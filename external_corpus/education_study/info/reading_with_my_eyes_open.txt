              Acknowledgements

I owe my thanks to many people who in various ways have contributed to the
making of this book. First of all I should like to thank the students who partici-
pated in this particular study and gave me kind permission to use their words.
In addition my thanks are due to the students who I have taught since, because
their engagement helps me to continue to learn and develop.

  I am also very grateful to many of my colleagues and friends for their
encouragement and insightful comments. In particular I would like to thank
Cathie Wallace, John O'Regan, Alison Phipps and Theo Hermans for reading
earlier versions of the study and providing in-depth and detailed feedback,
and Jane Fenoulhet, Cristina Ros i Solé and John Took for reading the manu-
script. Their sharp observations and critique greatly contributed to the final
version of this book.

  I am especially grateful to Kimbal Bumstead for granting me permission to
use one of his art pieces for the cover. His work based on personal relations,
intimacy, communication, responsibility, and tracing journeys chimes with the
themes in this book.

  Finally a very special thanks is due to my two sons Kim and Remi for con-
tinuing to inspire me with their own life journeys, and most of all to my hus-
band Chris for providing me with time, space and all kinds of practical and
moral support. Without their encouragement and love this book would not
have been written.
                 Introduction

This book is based on a classroom study exploring a particular intercultural
approach to language teaching at university aiming to develop students into
critical intercultural language users. I call my approach the `cultuurtekst' - text
as culture - approach, a term which I have borrowed from the Dutch literary
critic, Maaike Meijer (1986). I had conceived of this approach as a result of
reflections on my previous teaching, students' engagements and the newly
developing theoretical area of intercultural communication in language and
culture pedagogy.

  In this book I am mapping the territory of language teaching at university
and coining new concepts on the way. As the study took me over 10 years to
complete - with various interruptions along the way, it represents a profes-
sional journey as a lecturer of Dutch at one of Britain's traditional universities
at a time when ideas about language and culture pedagogy were developing
fast. This has not been an easy professional journey; the pedagogy which I was
developing at times met with resistance among the students and ran counter
to language teaching approaches employed by colleagues at the institution
where I worked. Moreover the data I collected, consisting of transcripts of my
classes in which we discussed a particular text and interviews with students,
were marred by ambiguities and if anything, seemed to point to a failure of
my approach.

  My initial conclusion therefore was that intercultural communication is
infinitely more complex than a `cultuurtekst' approach, or perhaps any other
particular method of language teaching, can effect. Secondly, that attempting
to develop students' critical awareness and language competence would need
an even clearer conceptualisation coupled with a more considered pedagogi-
cal approach.
2 Reading With My Eyes Open

  Some years later - and this is where conducting this study over a longer
period of time than initially anticipated has produced unexpected benefits - I
looked at the data again. This time I looked at the data from an ethnographic
perspective, and not with the idea in mind of how `successful' the approach
had been. Instead, I focused on what happened in the classroom, how the stu-
dents engaged with the text and one another and what the significant dialogic
moments in class had been. Something interesting emerged. In the earlier
interpretation I had seen students' interpretations of the text based on personal
experience as a weakness; students had failed to analyse the text using the lan-
guage of analysis based on concepts of culture and representation. Instead, it
emerged that it was precisely the moments where students brought their per-
sonal experience and interpretation to bear upon the text that the most dialogic
and intercultural moments occurred. These were the moments when students
applied their `self ' to the text, where they tried to respond to the text and explain
it to others - the moments when students were `struggling for meaning'. As a
result, I coined the phrase `being a text ethnographer' to account for the way
that students can engage critically and reflexively with a text from an `inside' as
well as an `outside' perspective.

  The study itself and the development of my approach was born out of dis-
satisfaction with existing instrumental approaches in language teaching which
were - and indeed still are - prevalent in existing language materials and in
many discourses surrounding language learning in general and in the field of
Dutch language teaching in particular. Yet, I worked in a context - that of a
Modern Language Degree at one of Britain's traditional universities, where to a
large extent traditional discourses about language learning were dominant. As
a result there was a general assumption at the institution where I worked, that
language teaching was synonymous with the grammar-translation approach,
and language classes were strictly separated from the `content' classes address-
ing `culture', which was generally conceptualised as `literature', or - occasionally
- as `film'. The generally accepted aim of language learning was, and in some
cases may still be, that of reaching `near-native speaker' competence.

  The tensions and conflicting pulls between these almost opposing forces
and discourses within language learning form the background to this study. In
chapter 1 I argue that neither paradigm in language education, i.e. the `tradi-
tional' liberal humanist on the one hand and the instrumentalist on the other,
can provide a satisfactory framework for language teaching in the context of a
Modern Languages degree; a context, in which students are prepared linguis-
tically, culturally and personally for the complex lives in an era of mobilities.
Whilst neither paradigm is sufficient in its own right, I argue that one of the
aspects of the liberal humanist paradigm, which is worth rearticulating for lan-
guage learning, is its focus on criticality and intellectual engagement. However,
the notion of criticality provided by that paradigm, the idea of taking criti-
cal distance to gain objectivity, provides a limited view of criticality. I point to
                                                                                                  Introduction3

Pennycook's (2001) notion of `mapping discourses' as an alternative view on
critique to be taken in the language classroom.

  In chapter 2 I further discuss the conflicting perspectives on the concepts of
culture and of language that are often assumed in language learning at univer-
sity. In discussing the relationship between these two I point to the dilemma
language teachers face when wishing to emphasise complexity and transna-
tional perspectives, whilst at the same time being charged with looking at the
particularities of the language and culture being studied. I conceived of the
latter as `national articulations' in globalised discourses.

  Chapter 3 focuses on the notion of intercultural communication and dis-
cusses three different approaches in language education: those of Kramsch,
Byram and Guilherme. In discussing these approaches in relation to the frame-
work of criticality and complexity set out earlier, I set out where and how I
build on particular aspects within each of these approaches, including Blom-
maert's argument for `boundary crossing' in intercultural communication. Fol-
lowing Phipps and Gonzalez's (2004) view on `being intercultural', I explain
how the notion of `cultuurtekst' provides a way of being intercultural and being
ethnographic when reading texts.

  Chapter 4 forms a bridge between the theoretical chapters and the discussion
of the data. Here I set out the context of my study, the conceptual framework of
my `cultuurtekst' approach based on a pedagogy of heteroglossia and multiple
discourses, the syllabus of the fourth year language class in which I adopted this
approach, and the methodology of my study.

  Chapter 5 looks at the data from two lessons out of the yearlong language
course. In these lessons we discussed a particular text from Men's Health, fol-
lowing the framework for analysis which I created based on the idea of `cul-
tuurtekst'. During the first lesson, we discussed the text at a `textual' or `prod-
uct' level, looking at content and argumentation structures following a liberal
humanist perspective of critique. During the second class we discussed the text
at a `cultuurtekst' level, creating a dialogic space in which the students started
to engage in `mapping discourses'. In looking at what different ways of reading
the two perspectives on text yielded, it emerged that these two levels of text
analysis are not easily separated. Even when looking at text at a product level,
students `went beyond' the text and engaged in critiquing the text for its ideo-
logical positioning. Equally, looking at the text as `cultuurtekst' at times became
confused with critiquing the text from the liberal humanist perspective, as not
constituting a `good argument'. The second lesson did, however, bring about
much richer dialogic moments where students took on occasion an intercul-
tural stance in engaging with the ideas in the text and with one another. The
significant findings in these data were particularly how students brought their
own experiences and previous knowledge to bear upon the text.

  In chapter 6, the concluding chapter, I discuss the general findings of my
study and I include interview data to see what approaches to text students had
4 Reading With My Eyes Open

taken and to what extent they had used critical perspectives. I focus on two
students in this chapter: Claire, who engaged readily with my `cultuurtekst'
approach and Sarah, who resisted it throughout the year. Whilst it might have
been tempting to classify Claire as the `successful' language learner, as she was
reading `with her eyes very open', as she said in one of her interviews, it was
in fact Sarah who made the biggest transformation as a learner, as she had to
adapt her view of communication and language as a whole. She also provided
me with insights into how prior views of communication that students hold
affect their learning in class. Moreover, the interviews also showed that the rich
moments and understanding of discursive mapping which had occurred dur-
ing the class, were not necessarily transferred in their reflections on the course
as a whole.

  In this final chapter I also examine the tensions brought about by working
with conflicting views of text, criticality and education embodied in a pedagogy
which aims to emphasise cultural complexity on the one hand and cultural
particularities, through the notion of `Dutch articulations', on the other. I con-
clude that these seeming incompatibilities are part of the every day realities of
students anyway and I argue for positively embracing these tensions. A greater
level of explicitness about the theoretical assumptions underlying language
and culture will provide students with the theoretical tools needed to reflect on
these tensions. I further point to the importance of engagement with personal
experience in the language class. I argue for pedagogies of engagement rather
than the purely rational and analytical. These are pedagogies where students
can explore their own relations and sense of belongings in our globalised, com-
plex and cosmopolitan societies.

  Whilst this study looks particularly at reading texts, it is set within the con-
text of a general language class and my proposals for future pedagogies assume
reading is embedded in the interrelated network of other activities that take
place in class.

  It is through the self-examination aspect of my study - looking critically at
my own practice - that new theoretical understandings emerged. However
uncomfortable these self-examinations are, this book is implicitly also an argu-
ment for a pedagogy which not only encourages the learner to engage in self-
reflexive activities, but conversely for the teacher to do the same.

 Tensions Between the Old and the New:
 the Influence of Educational Ideologies

           on Language Learning

                                  Introduction

At the start of this study, in the late 1990's, language teaching at university
seemed to be flourishing. Bailey stated in 1994 (p. 41) that language teach-
ing at our universities is thriving because of the mushrooming of language
courses at universities, mainly as an extra module available to students of dif-
ferent degree subjects at Language Centres and Institution Wide Language
Programmes, and because of the increasing number of modern foreign lan-
guage degrees where the curriculum displays a greater emphasis on language
learning at the expense of literature.

  Now, more than a decade later, the situation is very different. Instead, lan-
guage learning is said to be in crisis. There has been a decline in recent years
in the number of student applications for modern languages degree courses
except for school leavers from non-state schools. The concern over these fall-
ing figures, together with concerns over the funding provision for Modern
Languages prompted the Higher Education Funding Council for England
to commission a review of language in Higher Education in 2009 to investi-
gate the health of modern languages (Worton, 2009). Worton attributes the
decline of students studying modern foreign languages in part to the govern-
ment's decision to make languages optional for pupils after the age of fourteen
(Worton, 2009: 2). But, there are other reasons. Phipps explains the preference
for non-language degrees by the fact that students are exposed to a utilitarian
6 Reading With My Eyes Open

framework that makes a direct link between their decisions about education
and the shape of the labour market (2007: 4). Despite marketing attempts by
universities and other stakeholders to convince potential students of the prag-
matic value of studying modern languages, students are still `voting with their
feet', she says. In fact, it may be precisely the emphasis on gaining instrumental
skills, which is counter-productive when it comes to considerations of employ-
ability. Canning (2009: 1, 2) argues that if university language departments
keep on marketing themselves mainly in terms of providing the learner with
language skills, employers will offer jobs to native speakers whose skills in that
language are supreme, and in addition will have other skills than just linguistic
ones. Canning makes a distinction between promoting languages as `skill' and
languages as `discipline', the latter giving learners `humanities type skills'. He
further cites Brumfit's (2005) rationale for a modern languages degree as `giving
learners the linguistic tools to behave as critical beings in `other' cultures'. For
this intercultural understanding linguistic skills are not sufficient, but language
graduates `should possess in-depth cultural insights' (ibid. p.8). Phipps (2007:
35) also argues that the field of foreign languages has made a mistake in see-
ing languages in purely functionalist and employability terms rather than to
embrace the insights of anthropological approaches to culture.

  I add here my own voice of critique to the instrumental paradigm, and argue
that both the humanities with its philosophical underpinning and focus on
texts, as well as embracing anthropological insights to culture, can contribute
to a language learning pedagogy for engaging as critical beings with `other' cul-
tures. Whilst I am not aiming to analyse the `languages in crisis' situation, I do
suggest that one of the problems with language study at university is located
in the lack of status the subject has had and still has at university. I will turn to
this below.

             The Position of Language Teaching at University

When I started this study there was a large variety of pedagogies in language
teaching provision in British universities, ranging from the traditional literary-
based modern languages degree, modern languages degrees with an emphasis
on Area Studies and non-linguistic degrees with language as an extra mod-
ule, the latter usually provided through a Language Centre. Language teaching
as part of a modern languages degree, whether provided by the departments
themselves or by a Language Centre, took place as a separate educational activ-
ity with a different set of aims from the rest of the degree and carrying much
less prestige. This lack of prestige was borne out particularly by staffing levels,
terms of employment and hours allocated to language teaching within the cur-
riculum as a whole. In 1992 Scott et. al. pointed already to the fact that the
majority of language teachers were part-time and hourly-paid, and on tempo-
rary contracts. This situation does not seem to have changed. Teachers in Lan-
                                                                 Tensions Between the Old and the New 7

guage Centres are still frequently on vulnerable contracts (Worton, 2009: 31).
Whilst, in comparison with a decade ago, there is a tendency in departments to
employ specialised language teachers, they are not part of the `academic staff ',
and as Worton says (p.26), are seen to provide `service teaching'. Moreover, in
many departments the tradition still persists of (junior) lecturers with special-
isms other than language and no specific qualification or experience in lan-
guage teaching, teaching language classes in order to fulfil their share in the
teaching load of the department. This illustrates the view that is still common
at some institutions that language teaching can be carried out by any intel-
ligent native speaker with some sensitivity towards the language. When this is
seen against the situation for other subjects, the likelihood of appointing non-
specialist staff to teach for instance a literature class, would be an extremely
unlikely occurrence.

  Whereas the curriculum for modern language degrees as a whole is changing
- with the traditional literary degrees (although they still exist) giving way to
contemporary cultural studies, including contemporary literature, film studies
and Area Studies (Worton, 2009: 25), language teaching still remains separated
from the rest of the degree in status and content. This separation is even starker
now that instrumental approaches have been adopted.

               Classical Liberalism Versus Instrumentalism

Until the shake-up of the Higher Education system in Britain, which started in
the sixties with the expansion of Higher Education and which culminated in
the early 1990s in the transformation of the former polytechnics into universi-
ties, the educational aim at universities had been firmly rooted within a liberal
philosophy of education. The key pillars of this philosophy are the pursuit of
knowledge and rational autonomy; the development of the individual student
towards independence of mind applied within the confines of a body of knowl-
edge established as `truth' in order to advance the discipline. These classical
Enlightenment ideals were emancipatory - both for the individual in his striv-
ing for betterment, and for society, although this emancipation served particu-
larly the emerging middle classes in the 19th century where the discourse of
rational argument and cultural discourse were developed in the coffee-houses
in England as part of an oppositional stance to the absolutism of a hierarchical
society (Eagleton, 1984: 9-12).

  The traditional liberal paradigm, with its notion of `promoting the general
powers of the mind' (Robbins (1963), quoted by Dearing, 1997: 71), has come
under attack from several angles. One of these criticisms relates to the exclusiv-
ity of Higher Education towards certain groups in society. This is also an issue of
concern addressed by Dearing (1997) in his report. This concern may now seem
superfluous, since, the last 20 years or so, the university system has undergone a
huge increase in the number of school leavers going to university. Whether this
8 Reading With My Eyes Open

mass expansion was due to an instrumentalist neo-liberal response to the need
for flexible labour markets or out of a liberal concern with equality is of course
debatable. Nevertheless, the traditional Russell Group of universities still admit
a proportional higher number of students from middle class backgrounds in
comparison to the so called `teaching universities'. Criticisms have also been
directed at the philosophical underpinnings of the traditional liberal humanist
paradigm. Its notion of emphasising individuality, rather than seeing individu-
als as being rooted in society, and its notion of pursuit of `truth' is one which
does not fit in a post-modern era. Jonathan (1995: 75-91) points out that mod-
ern liberalism has become free from the social baggage and the emancipatory
idiom of its classical origins and argues for an examination of the ontological
and ethical questions which are central to the development of consciousness
and to the relation between the individual and the social. She points to the the-
oretical inadequacies of a paradigm which aims to develop maximal individual
autonomy of each, for the eventual social benefit of all. The causal connection
between these (individual autonomy and a socially better world) remain unex-
plained within liberalism, Jonathan says, and do not provide a theoretical posi-
tion to reconcile the `twin contemporary pulls of illegitimate value imposition
and incoherent relativism'. She argues for reconstructing the theory of liberal
education within a social theory; reconstructing the concept of autonomy as a
socially located value. The key issue which Jonathan points out regarding the
apparent conflict of the development of the individual within the social, is one
that is also relevant for language teachers. A concern with the individual finds
resonance in a new development within language teaching where pedagogies
are shifting attention from a fixed authoritative curriculum to a focus on learn-
ers' identities and subjectivities (cf. Phipps, 2007; Fenhoulhet and Ros i Solé,
2010 and 2013; Quist, 2013).

  As Apple (1990) points out, theories, policies and practices involved in edu-
cation are inherently political in nature. Changes within the educational system
thus rarely, if ever, come only from philosophical considerations, but are politi-
cally motivated. This was certainly the case in the 1980s when a huge para-
digm shift occurred in education. At many universities education came to be
seen in terms of a market philosophy: education as responding to economic
needs. Education in the 21st century is now not solely described in terms of the
development of the individual and rational autonomy. Instead, the need to fit
in with the demands of a fast changing world and the importance of the global
economy have started to define curricula. Dearing (1997) emphasised the need
to extend the - what he saw as still relevant - liberal aim of `training the power
of the mind' to include the needs of the world at large.

  The paradigm shift from a liberal towards an instrumental view of education
has been particularly pronounced within language teaching at universities. The
rationale for language teaching has therefore changed from a view of increasing
knowledge about a culture and developing one's critical and analytical ability, to
                                                                 Tensions Between the Old and the New 9

one which is couched in a discourse which emulates such values as the need to
regain a competitive edge, overcoming a shortage of skills, not losing business
to competitors abroad and so on.

  The impact of the instrumental philosophy on language teaching has been
phenomenal, but not always in a beneficial way. In the next section I discuss
the language teaching approaches at university within these two paradigms and
evaluate their contribution to the educational aim of developing critical lan-
guage users. I will look at their strengths and weaknesses and suggest that the
implementation of communicative approaches - in their extreme form - have
contributed to the lack of status of language teaching. I discuss the approaches
in their most `pure' form, although naturally one could expect that teachers
`borrow' from either paradigm.

                             The Liberal Tradition

Within the liberal tradition the aim of modern language teaching at university
level was - and still is - both cultural and intellectual. Bailey (1994: 41) formu-
lates it as instilling `an appreciation of foreign literature and language through
a scholarly analysis of their content and structure'. This is achieved through
the study of `esteemed' canonical literary texts of the past as well as a historical
approach to linguistics.

  Language teaching itself, within this tradition, has been modelled on the
teaching of the `dead languages', as the classics were seen as the highest expres-
sion of the liberal philosophy (Bailey, ibid.). The rationale for teaching language
was to contribute to its two important aims of developing the cultural and intel-
lectual capabilities and sensibilities of students. Whereas language learning has
never been seen as an important intellectual activity in its own right (outside
the subject of philology or linguistics), there was a recognised academic ele-
ment in the learning of grammar. The cognitive powers of the students were
challenged by exercises in sentence parsing and translation of de-contextu-
alised sentences - even if this resulted in artificial language use - in order to
apply the rules of logic and show a thorough understanding of the underly-
ing grammatical intricacies. The emphasis was strongly on grammar and the
development of written skills - an oral element to language teaching was either
non-existent or incidental. This is because communication had no role to play
in the traditional liberal humanistic language curriculum; its rationale for lan-
guage teaching is the teaching of logical thinking skills and an `objective' way of
describing reality. Interestingly, as Cope and Kalantzis (1993: 3) point out, this
traditional curriculum of prescriptive grammar has mistaken, even deceptive,
pretensions to the timelessness of the classics. In ancient Greece and Rome the
use of grammar was applied to the social context, forming an integral part of
the teaching of dialectic or rhetoric. The classical language curriculum thus
10 Reading With My Eyes Open

has a pragmatic communicative origin and a communicative function, which
was never followed up on and which diametrically opposes the methodologies
based on teaching a `dead language'.

  The second aim which informed the teaching of language was the access it
provided to cultural products by exposing the student to `good' language use
and developing an aesthetic appreciation of language, through the study of a
canonical body of literary work. This embodied the liberal humanist principle
of language as striving for human perfection and beauty based on the Enlight-
enment ideas about the interpretation of the concept of culture and a wider
epistemology. `Culture' within this tradition encompasses elements of aesthetic
and spiritual development (Williams, 1976, 1983: 90) which are enshrined in
the valued canonical body of artistic - mainly literary - products of that soci-
ety. This view pays homage to Matthew Arnold's (1869, 2006: 40) definition of
culture, and its emancipatory idea of striving for betterment: `culture is [.....]
a study of perfection. It moves by the force, not merely or primarily of the sci-
entific passion for pure knowledge, but also of the moral and social passion of
doing good'. In addition, this epistemology contains within it a belief in the
rational autonomous subject who can use language to control meaning. Lan-
guage offers endless opportunities to describe a reality which is located outside
language itself. There is a belief in the `true' and `real' self and the universality of
language. I will discuss this further in chapter 2.

  One will not find Arnold's view of culture and its moral good quoted in
departmental aims and objectives at universities. Nevertheless, the tradition of
literary degrees espouses the core of these values, which were up until recently
widely accepted at many universities and still inform departmental courses,
although this is more likely to be the case at pre-1992 Russell Group universi-
ties. At many of these institutions students studied a canonical body of works
to `sustain a moral criticism of the world' and to recognise the `little knots of
significance' in order to make sense of the world out there and to make `distinc-
tions of worth' (Inglis, 1992: 220). These liberal values are also reflected in the
approach taken in studying canonical works, approached from a strong belief
in the authority of the writer, rather than the poststructuralist emphasis on
reader interpretation.

  It follows that language teaching has a somewhat diminished role within this
paradigm as far as language production is concerned. The aim of language teach-
ing is to instill a sense of appreciation for the language and to recognise language
as it functions and gives meaning to the `individual' voice of the author. Lan-
guage teaching is not geared around developing a language proficiency or com-
municative ability. Everyday language is of no academic interest. Only literary
language and the voice of the author are worthy of study and so literature classes
are generally taught in English and the discourse of literary criticism will take
place in English rather than through the target language. Language learning
and teaching achieve intellectual worth, as mentioned before, only through the
study of grammar and translation, supplemented by précis and essay writing.
                                                               Tensions Between the Old and the New 11

  The traditional methodology has been heavily criticised and is seen as being
thoroughly outdated, precisely because of its lack of placing language in rela-
tion to its immediate context or related to wider social and cultural forces
which may influence language utterances. Students will have knowledge about
the language, but will not be able to speak it. Cook (1989: 127, 128) points
to the fact that the traditional approach to language learning does not take
account of how meaning is created through a unified stretch of text. In short,
grammar-translation approaches do not stand up to scrutiny within applied
linguistic theories as the sole method of teaching language proficiency. Whilst
this approach may be used at university language teaching at some of the tra-
ditional institutions, it will indeed not be used in language courses which teach
at ab-initio level. Ab initio courses, and indeed increasingly language courses at
all levels, generally are influenced by the instrumental paradigm.

                          The Instrumental Paradigm

                                    Aims and Practice

At the other end of the spectrum to the traditional liberal language degrees are
language courses which are informed by instrumental values. As with language
provision in general, there is a rich variety in the practices in business and
pragmatically oriented language classrooms, so any attempt to describe these is
by nature doomed to be a gross generalization. Yet, there are certain character-
istics which can be recognised as being fairly representative of language classes
influenced by instrumental considerations. Because the aim of language classes
of this kind is to provide students with the `real-world' skills which are valu-
able to employers, language classes are aimed at developing a communicative
competence. This would include an emphasis on speaking and interpersonal
skills over writing because employers do not necessarily expect graduates to
have written competence in the foreign language: "...they want people who
can have everyday conversations and state of the art conversations - in other
words they know the French for computer or keyboard" (quoted in Scott et.
al., 1992: 18). These instrumental approaches, which at the time of starting this
study may have been haphazard, have become systematically part of language
teaching at universities, since the Common European Framework (CEF, 2001)
has been published.

  The CEF is a guideline document and does not suggest particular teach-
ing methodologies, but instead provides an extremely detailed taxonomy of
the competences, skills and knowledge that learners should possess at certain
levels of study. The general aims and principles which are formulated empha-
sise both the functional aspect of language learning (learning to communicate
in order to encourage collaboration, mobility and trade) as well as the moral
aspect (respect and understanding for other cultures). However, certainly when
12 Reading With My Eyes Open

judged by course books in Dutch which are taking account of the CEF guide-
lines, the practice has developed on very instrumental lines, concentrating on
transactional tasks such as buying train tickets, filling in a form, writing letters
or covering conversational interests on an easy interpersonal level such as talk-
ing about leisure pursuits and interests or cultural customs.

  Clearly the purely instrumental view of language teaching does not fit in well
with the liberal ideal of critical thinking; language as an expression of individ-
ual thought and emotion. Inglis (1992: 221), for instance, takes a traditional lib-
eral view when he bemoans the loss of a critical and aesthetic and value-based
view towards language. He feels that `to withdraw from the question of value
making at the heart of language is [....] to hand language over to technicism
and the skills-mongers whose very function is to demoralise education in the
name of its orderly management.'

  Within this light it is understandable that with the advent of communicative
language teaching (CLT), the discipline came even more to be seen as a non-
intellectual subject at the traditional departments. One can legitimately ques-
tion whether the needs of employers should inform curricula in such a narrow
way. Employers are not pedagogues and cannot be expected to know what the
best educational route to a final aim of communicative competence is. As well
as a reductive skills and information based approach to language learning at
the expense of a critical approach to knowledge production, there is another
problem with the instrumental approach.

  It is absolutely the case that communication skills are of paramount impor-
tance to our graduates. They will need to be able to function communicatively
in a complex world with many different people, in many different situations,
the vast majority of which will be defined by unpredictability, fluidity and
changeability. Teaching standard rules and guidelines for these situations, as
instrumentalist language teaching does, encourages a labelling of communica-
tive partners into essentialised entities devoid or complex personal histories.
But there is also a political point to make. As Fairclough said, in many profes-
sional domains, power and manipulation are exercised through language in
increasingly subtle and implicit ways (Fairclough, 1992: 3). Teaching set rules
for communicative situations could, whether unwittingly or not, contribute
to developing skills in students, which perpetuate this exercise in manipula-
tion. I discuss this further in chapter 2, but it is worthwhile to note here that
when offering texts from a commercial professional domain to students, the
discourses of the legitimacy of self-enrichment and capitalism become natural-
ised to such an extent that students might employ these uncritically themselves.

  Furthermore, the uncritical submitting to employers' needs when draw-
ing up syllabi may train future graduates to fit in with the economic needs of
society, but it denies them the development of capabilities aimed at effecting
changes in society themselves. As Hoggart (1995: 22) points to the political
aspect of instrumentalism; it trains people like robots to serve the needs of
industry which is `one way of avoiding [...] `looking seriously at injustice which
                                                               Tensions Between the Old and the New 13

runs through the educational system' and `indicates mistrust [...] of mind and
imagination'. Moreover, the focus on market forces is a safe political position: it
`provides a piece of firm dry land for many of today's politicians, barren though
that land may be intellectually and imaginatively' (ibid.: 25).

                                   Underlying Theories

Because of the instrumental aims, the immediate concerns in language classes
within this paradigm are practical; developing skills and presenting learners
with ready-made phrases or expressions for use in particular situations. The
theoretical premises which underlie communicative language teaching (which
generally informs instrumental approaches) are therefore often subsumed by
practical concerns. Communicative approaches, with an emphasis on real com-
municative tasks, the use of authentic material in the syllabus and an emphasis
on `getting the message across', are based on pragmatic descriptions of language
use derived from Hymes' notion of communicative competence (1972) and
Speech Act theory (Austin, 1962).

  These approaches generally start from a sociolinguistic description of how
meaning is communicated in particular settings, situations and contexts and
take account of a variety of parameters such as the intention to mean, the rela-
tionship between participants in the communicative act, the topic, the mode of
communication and so forth. The view of language which is implicit in com-
municative syllabuses is thus a pragmatic one; language is seen in a functional
goal-oriented sense. This contrasts with the classical liberal view which sees
language on the one hand as a creative and aesthetic expression of individual
thought and on the other hand as a system of formal rules. Since I started to
develop my language course in the mid 1990s, communicative language teach-
ing (CLT) has increasingly been aiming for not only developing Communi-
cative Competence, but also for Intercultural Communicative Competence.
However, these original pragmatic concerns remain the bedrock of CLT.

  The two approaches I discussed here are thus almost diametrically opposed
in their educational aims. The liberal tradition aims to develop autonomous
critical thinking and an aesthetic appreciation whereas language learning in the
instrumental or communicative approach aims at developing the competence
to be able to communicate in work and social environments, including inter-
cultural situations.

  It follows then that the pedagogical theories underlying these views also dif-
fer, but in the case of the liberal tradition of language teaching, even though
based on clear educational values, there is no theory of language learning which
informs teaching methodology. As we have seen, the approach was based on
the way that the classical languages were taught. In the instrumental approach
to language learning, I want to suggest that the problem is reversed. There is
no concern with personal or educational development in many instrumentally
14 Reading With My Eyes Open

based language classes, as the main concern is to develop skills in the learner
which are useful on the job market. The language teaching itself within these
classes, on the other hand, is influenced by theories of language learning as an
automatic process, which I briefly set out below.

  Chomsky's research in mother tongue language acquisition in particular
has influenced early communicative approaches in foreign language teach-
ing: as language learning is an automatic process, the argument goes, the role
of the teacher is to provide language input of the right level and tasks and
situations through which the learners can practise and absorb the use of the
foreign language.

  Chomsky relates the idea of language acquisition specifically to the gram-
matical rules. However, in communicative language teaching it has become a
common sense notion that the social rules of a language (the appropriateness of
utterances in relation to the context in which they are expressed) are acquired
along similar lines as these grammatical structures. These social rules consti-
tute what Hymes calls `communicative competence' (1972).

  What is problematic about the view of an automatic acquisition of commu-
nicative competence, is that it might explain how certain functional phrases
or vocabulary items are acquired, but it allows no role for the wider social and
cultural influences which shape communication and discourses. It is possible
that these are acquired automatically as well. Children certainly seem to have
an uncanny ability to switch their `social voice', without explicitly having been
taught how one speaks within certain social or cultural groups. This ability to
`switch codes' is likely to have been `picked up' from the various discourses
they are exposed to in their environment, notably through television. The ques-
tion for language teachers, however, is not so much whether language, which
is saturated with social or cultural values, can be acquired automatically, but
whether it should be.

  If we want students to understand how language creates both explicit and
implicit cultural and social meanings, then they need not internalise linguistic
items automatically. On the contrary, they need to look at language consciously
both to understand texts as a social and cultural construct, but also to be ena-
bled to produce language utterances which are culturally and socially appropri-
ate. This is an intellectual skill, which is not automatically achieved in a foreign
language and would need to be addressed consciously.

  In summary, the instrumental approach to language teaching, which views
language particularly in terms of its pragmatic function is much more sophisti-
cated than the liberal tradition in terms of learning to communicate in various
settings and in terms of views on language learning. But it is lacking in other
ways. Firstly, the emphasis on context as shaping language utterances tends to
be interpreted only in terms of the immediate parameters that define a commu-
nicative situation and often this is interpreted in fairly reductive terms in the
choice of settings, dialogues and texts. This only takes account of the immedi-
ate social context, and not the wider cultural influences and the larger social
                                                               Tensions Between the Old and the New 15

constructs, which Halliday (1989), using Malinowski (1923), defined as being
of importance in language use. Secondly, while the emphasis is on intention to
mean, it assumes that language use is always explicit in its functions and aims,
it does not allow for the more implicit social and cultural values which are
embedded in texts. I will discuss this further in chapter 2.

         A Re-accentuation of Elements of the Liberal Approach

Whilst the instrumental approach to language teaching may be unsatisfactory
in terms of thinking more critically about language use, the failure of the tradi-
tional liberal approach to develop communicative competence is also evident.
Yet, even if the paradigm offers little towards a theory of learning, and towards
creating social meaning, I do not want to dismiss the liberal tradition outright.
The actual methodology of grammar and translation is not as reviled as it was
during the heyday of communicative language teaching. There is increasingly
a general recognition of the importance of explicit grammar teaching. Trans-
lation in particular, is also seen as a new area to increase textual and stylistic
awareness, particularly from a cultural point of view. It can open up areas of
cross-cultural study in examining how language mediates underlying cultural
values through, for instance, its use of vocabulary and metaphor (Byram, 1997;
Lantolf, 1997). Translation involves cultural negotiation. In addition, activities
such as précis writing coupled with the inclusion of `serious content' contribute
to the intellectual development of the student and echoes Cummins' (1979)
notion of the need to develop a cognitive academic language proficiency as well
as basic interpersonal communicative skills. However, grammar and transla-
tion, even though they have a place in the language curriculum, cannot be the
sole elements of language teaching.

  The notions in the liberal paradigm which are worth exploring in greater
depth for their possible potential in language teaching are located in three areas:
a) intellectual stimulus and criticality; b) the idea of a language user speaking
with an 'individual voice' to express her humanity (cf. Kramsch, 1993); and c)
the notion of morality.

  These elements combine easily and almost naturally in a language classroom
because the content of the classes can be fluid and contain any topic from prag-
matic transactions to intellectually challenging discussions on any cultural,
social, political or other issue which interest the students. It is precisely the
intellectual engagement which is one of the strengths of the liberal paradigm
in education, and which has been almost completely lacking in instrumen-
tal approaches. This brings us to the second notion of `expressing individual
meaning'. It is through content-based discussions that an exchange of complex
thought and cooperation can take place and that room can be given to students
to express their unique experiences and thoughts. This will contribute to stu-
dents' intellectual development as they may come to think about issues in a
16 Reading With My Eyes Open

different light or come to realisations and ruminations, to experience perhaps
the `life-changing conversations' (Attinasi and Friedrich quoted by Kramsch,
ibid. p. 29) taking place through the medium of the foreign language. However,
the notion of expressing individual meaning needs to be problematised, which
I will do in the next chapter.

  The third notion of morality in the classical liberal paradigm can be eas-
ily translated to a modern context for language teaching through its emphasis
on the emancipatory role of education and its view of a morally and socially
better world. At the time that I collected the data for this study, this notion
was embedded in the concept of language teaching for `European citizenship'
(Byram, Zarate, Neuner, 1997). This requires, as Byram said, more than mainly
pragmatic and functional language teaching, but is rooted in a more compre-
hensive concept of living together. In terms of language teaching this meant
emphasising attitudes of mutual tolerance and a readiness to exchange views.
This idea has been developed by, amongst others, Starkey whose pedagogy
of political education and human rights awareness through foreign language
teaching aims for `the development of democracy and active citizenship' (Star-
key, 1999: 156). Pedagogies taking such an explicit citizenship approach tend to
focus on content as knowledge in the language class. Recent developments in
this area tend to move away from the original national focus of citizenship edu-
cation and offer cosmopolitan perspectives (cf. Starkey, 2010), critical perspec-
tives (cf. Guilherme, 2002) and transnational perspectives (cf. Risager, 2007).
Whilst I believe the citizenship and knowledge agenda in language pedagogy
are very important, I focus in this book largely on a text analytical approach,
which, though less knowledge focused, incidentally also assumes a broader
cosmopolitan and transnational perspective, as I will set out in greater detail in
chapters 3 and 4. In my own pedagogy, the moral element is less fore-grounded
than in citizenship education, although it is present through critical discussions
about texts in class, and through the idea of taking responsibility for the reader.
The latter, to which I refer as `addressivity' (cf. Bakhtin, 1996 (1986)) comes
into play when students do writing tasks.

  Whilst all three elements of the liberal humanist paradigm which I felt
warranted re-articulation, are to some extent present in my own pedagogy, it
was particularly the intellectual engagement and the critical element which I
focused on in the pedagogy on which this book is based. This critical engage-
ment is emphatically not present in the instrumentalist approach. Neverthe-
less, it was clear to me that the liberal humanist paradigm itself was unable
to provide the theoretical framework for language teaching with a critical
emphasis. Its notions of objectivity and language as neutral are counter to
the idea of encouraging learners to see the complexity of language and cul-
ture. My interpretation of intellectual engagement was not so much the idea
of providing interesting or challenging articles in the classroom (although
that too was important), but my main objective was primarily for students
to engage with texts in a critical manner. My aim was for students to become
                                                               Tensions Between the Old and the New 17

critical intercultural language users. Whilst my starting point was the critical
perspective taken in the liberal humanist paradigm, I also wanted students
to engage with other critical perspectives. This, however, brings with it the
problem of incommensurability.

                  Problematising Intellectual Engagement

The concept of criticality needs some explanation. I do not refer here to `criti-
cising' in the sense of disagreeing with or objecting to something, although that
could of course be part of it. I am following Pennycook (2001: 5) in describing
three different approaches to criticality in relation to applied linguistics. The
first approach that Pennycook identifies is what he refers to as critical think-
ing, associated with the liberal educational paradigm. This is also often referred
to as `taking critical distance' - the term already suggests there is an assumed
objectivity in this perspective. This approach develops `questioning skills' in the
learner and involves bringing a `more rigorous analysis to problem solving or
textual understanding' (ibid:3). Critical thinking in this paradigm assumes cer-
tain universal `rules' of thought, which are based on rationality, logic, evidence,
precision and clarity. In my context of work, it was this perspective on criti-
cality which was dominant at the time in which this study is set. As I explain
further in chapter 4, it also used to be an element in my own teaching practice,
in analysing texts partly in relation to argumentation structures, and emphasis-
ing cohesion and coherence and generally the need for clarity in students' own
writing. It also formed a small part of the course I taught the year I collected the
data for this study, and as I describe in relation to the empirical data in chapters
5 and 6, the incommensurability of these approaches led to a certain confusion
amongst students.

  The second approach of criticality that Pennycook refers to, is what he calls
the modernist emancipatory position. This approach is associated with the
neo Marxist tradition and is based on Critical Theory. This approach sees an
engagement with political critiques and social relation as the most important
aspect of critical work. It aims to work towards social transformation and to
tackle social inequality and injustice. In language teaching this approach is
taken on by the Critical Language Awareness (CLA) movement (cf. Wallace,
2003; Fairclough, 1992; Fairclough and Wodak, 1996), where texts are analysed
for the way they construct ideological positions legitimising domination and
social and economic inequality. Whilst my own view was less about unmasking
dominant power positions and ideologies, but more about discursive construc-
tion in general, I felt the modernist position to be a useful one for its focus on
discursive constructions in texts. Also this critical paradigm offered available
frameworks for text analysis, notably that of Wallace (2003), from which I bor-
rowed for my own pedagogy.
18 Reading With My Eyes Open

  The third approach to criticality is generally associated with the `post' phi-
losophies, such as feminism, poststructuralism and postcolonialism and queer
theory. Pennycook refers to it as problematising practice, which consists of
`mapping discourses'. This position is also inherently political as it articulates a
scepticism about truth claims made in texts (Pennycook, 2001: 42). In mapping
discourses it asks questions about the social, cultural and historical locations of
the speaker. It seeks a broader understanding of `how multiple discourses may
be at play at the same time' (Pennycook, 2001: 44). It is this approach to critical-
ity which particularly underpins my own pedagogy, because of its concern with
discourses in general, although the other two approaches to criticality, `critical
thinking' and critique of ideological power positions are also present. My aim
was for students to be able to deconstruct the text positions and be able to
respond to the `truth claims' in a text rather than reading a text at face value as
if it contained an `existing truth'. This aspect of criticality also allows for culture
to be brought into discussions around language, communication and texts as I
conceive of discourses as the practice where language and culture are merging.
I develop this idea further through the idea of `cultuurtekst', which I describe
in chapter 3.

  I did initially conceive of these levels of criticality as pedagogical stepping
stones. The first stone of `critical thinking', I considered as a useful perspective
on text to sharpen students' critical ability, to query and question what a text is
about and whether its structure, presentation and argumentation will stand up
to scrutiny. This, I felt was the first step towards the more sophisticated levels of
critique which are embedded within the other two approaches: particularly the
third level of critique, which involves the problematising of meaning and texts
by acknowledging complexity.

  At the time of data collection, I was aware that I applied theoretically incom-
mensurable elements. The `critical thinking' paradigm assumes a view of objec-
tivity, which clashes with the `problematising practice' of critique which asks
questions, eschews simple straight forward answers and demands self reflec-
tion of the learner. Yet, I felt that this incommensurability reflects the complex-
ity of the linguistic, social and cultural world we are introducing the learners to;
this is after all fluid, messy and full of contradictions and inconsistencies that
students need to deal with in their everyday life.

                                   Conclusion

In this chapter I have traced the two paradigms which have influenced lan-
guage teaching at universities in Britain. I have argued that neither of these pro-
vides the framework for language teaching that takes account of our complex
society and complex needs of learners. Since this study took place, the instru-
mental paradigm has, as a response to the perceived crisis in language learn-
ing, grown still stronger and the liberal language classroom has become the
                                                               Tensions Between the Old and the New 19

`dinosaur' of language learning. Clearly, instrumental aims are important, but
even more important is, I feel, the developmental role of education. One of the
key elements of the liberal paradigm, which is worth re-articulating, I argued,
is that of the intellectual and critical aspect of language learning. However, I
have also argued that the notion of criticality adhered to in the liberal para-
digm itself with its assumption of objectivity, cannot solely provide the critical
skills students need to engage with the complex social and cultural world. This
engagement is more likely to be occasioned using a problematising approach
of criticality towards texts by `mapping' discourses; recognising the ways texts
construct in culturally routinised ways the world and `make sense of the reality
to which it belongs' (O'Regan, 2006: 118).

  Learning a foreign language is not just learning a useful skill; it has the poten-
tial to empower the students in enabling them to participate in a critical way in
a foreign culture and to understand more about the nature and motives which
lie behind communication. In order to address this question, I will look in the
next chapter in greater detail at the relationship between language, meaning
and culture and how these have impacted on language teaching

guage Teaching at University: A Clash of Cultures, Language and Education

                              CHAPTER 2

   Culture Pedagogy: Some Theoretical
                Considerations

                                   Introduction

In this chapter1 I will consider some of the underlying issues of language and
culture pedagogy. Whilst it is the basic tenet of this study that language and
culture need to be addressed in an integrated manner in language teaching, I
will nevertheless discuss language and culture separately as two interlinking
pedagogic areas.

  In the first part of this chapter I look at views of culture which underpin cul-
ture pedagogy as part of modern language degrees, and I describe some of the
practices. I argue that teaching culture as part of language classes may be bet-
ter served by a `cultural studies' approach, rather than courses which empha-
sise the `content' dimension and focus on imparting knowledge about the tar-
get language country as a coherent overview. The latter approach tends to be
located in a national view of language and culture, whereas a cultural studies
approach focuses on the processes and practices of culture and the construc-
tion of meaning and allows for a more complex idea of culture.

  In the second part of this chapter I focus on views of language in relation
to culture which have influenced language teaching approaches. In doing so
I argue that a traditional structural view of language as stable still underpins
some contemporary language courses, and that this view has taken on a com-
mon-sense understanding. I then describe social and cultural views of lan-
guage, including those derived from linguistic relativity, critical language study
and Hymes' notion of pragmatic language use.
22 Reading With My Eyes Open

  I conclude the chapter by discussing how the two areas are interlinked in
pedagogy.

                       Teaching Culture

                                Views of Culture

It is a `truism' that the word `culture' is problematic. Raymond Williams is pur-
ported to have said he wished he had never heard `the damned word'. There are
various common sense definitions of the word, and Williams's discussion on
this is still a good place to start. As he points out, there are various overlapping
categories of meaning: culture as a process, as a product and as a way of life of
a particular community, but the meaning of the word shifts continuously (Wil-
liams, 1983 (1976). Stuart Hall (1997: 34-36) calls the word `the new language
of our time'; it is a catchword, used widely and frequently `from politics to busi-
ness, from life-style to media' to refer to the way people think, feel and behave.
Frequently, the words `social' and `cultural' are used interchangeably, both in
everyday use and in the literature on the subject. There are no clearly agreed
definitions on what separates the social from the cultural, although the word
social is more often used when we talk about structures and systems of society
and relations between people or groups of people, whereas culture is often seen
as encompassing anything social plus the wider notions of value and ideologi-
cal systems.

  In Williams' seminal book Keywords he lists the intricate and complex
semantic transformations the term `culture' has undergone since its early use in
the 15th Century. In summary, modern usage of the term relates to three broad
categories (1983 (1976): 90):

  1) a general process of intellectual, spiritual and aesthetic development.
        This usage captures the idea of culture as a natural process of human
        development in a linear way, the ultimate of which resulted in the Euro-
        pean `civilization' and culture of the Enlightenment. Culture is then seen
        as a universal development of human history;

  2) a particular way of life, whether of a people, a period, a group or human-
        ity in general, in short, the anthropological view of culture. The use of
        the word `culture' as `a way of life' started in the 18th century with Herder
        (1782-1791) who attacked the Eurocentric view of culture encompassed
        in the first definition. This view contrasts with the first one, as it does
        not see culture as a universal process, but instead sees `cultures' in the
        plural: `the specific and variable cultures of different nations and periods
        but also of [...] social and economic groups within a nation' (Williams,
        1983 (1976): 89). Whilst Herder is sometimes cited as being the fore-
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 23

        runner of the one nation, one language view of culture, he was, accord-
        ing to Risager, not a National Romantic (Risager, 2006: 61). The view of
        culture, in terms of specific particularities associated with a particular
        group of people, often equated with nation or ethnicity is a dominant
        one in common parlance. Generally speaking, these particularities refer
        to behaviour, belief systems, history, language, customs, values, and so
        on. Within cultural anthropology itself, however, this static view of cul-
        ture is seen as outdated (cf. Wright, 1998; Street, 1993; Hannerz, 1999).
  3) the works and practices of intellectual and aesthetic activities, such as
        music, literature, painting and sculpture, often referred to as Culture
        with a capital C or `high' culture. In daily contemporary usage this
        view of culture now also includes products and practices from popular
        (`low') culture, such as film, tv and media. The use of the terms `high'
        and `low' indicate the value judgements attached to these. Hence, Eagle-
        ton represents the view of `high' and `low' culture as the `culture wars'
        (Eagleton, 2000).

The latter definition, culture in the sense of aesthetic activities and products, is
the view of culture which has been traditionally assumed in modern language
degree programmes, at least in Britain. In the liberal humanist educational par-
adigm, culture was (and in certain institutions still is), mostly seen through the
prism of the literary canon, the `high' view of culture, which combines the aes-
thetic view with the hierarchical view of culture as civilisation. This concords
with Matthew Arnold's (1889: 56) view of "the best knowledge and thought of
the time". However, as I discussed in chapter 1, as a result of the expansion of
university education in Britain and the political pressures towards instrumental
aims of language learning, literature courses have been increasingly replaced
by courses focusing on `contemporary cultural studies', as Worton referred to it
(2009), bringing about a change in how `culture' is interpreted. `Contemporary
cultural studies' in Worton's report refers to courses which combine the `high',
and `low' view of culture; literature as well as film studies. But in addition, cul-
ture is part of the curriculum in its anthropological form through `Area Studies'.
These courses tend to include the history, politics and social structures of the
target country.

  When it comes to the view of culture as anthropology, culture as a way of life,
there is, however, a range of practice in courses taken as part of a modern lan-
guage degree. At the humanities-based modern language degree programmes
at the university where this study takes place, for instance, there is, for instance,
no reference to the term Area Studies. Non-literature courses tend to be taught
in academic disciplinary areas, such as history, film studies, and occasionally as
linguistics or socio-linguistics. Increasingly courses are taught comparatively
(e.g. comparing literature from different countries) or as interdisciplinary, the-
matic courses.
24 Reading With My Eyes Open

  Language teaching remains strictly separate from the `content' courses. In
this book, my concern is not with separate content courses in the academic
disciplines of literature or history, but with the cultural dimension of language
teaching itself. For this reason I will not discuss Area Studies as an academic
discipline. What I will discuss is culture pedagogy as it is practised in the lan-
guage classroom.

  I start with the knowledge dimension of culture pedagogy, which is often
underpinned by the national dimension of culture.

           Knowledge in Culture Pedagogy: Examples of Dutch
                                    Textbooks

With the knowledge dimension, I am referring to courses which are, even
if implicitly, based on a view of culture pedagogy which used to be called
Landeskunde. This term is now gradually disappearing, as Risager says, (Ris-
ager, 2007: 5) but the idea of providing an overview of knowledge of society,
country and culture, an extension of the old, what Risager refers to as `land-
and-people tradition' (ibid: 27), still underpins many language courses in prac-
tice. The term kennis van land en volk (knowledge of land and people), is also in
some cases still adhered to in the context of Dutch as a Second and as a Foreign
Language. The term is gradually being replaced by Nederland-en Vlaanderen-
kunde (knowledge about the Netherlands and Flanders), a clear indication of
the national orientation of this approach to culture in language teaching. The
traditional `land-and-people' courses took a strong orientation towards typical
national characteristics (ibid: 28). This emphasis has changed over the years,
yet the discussion of the `national typical', even of the national psyche, was until
recently part of many language courses. I will discuss this below in relation to
some Dutch textbooks which specifically address the culture dimension, either
as an integrated language activity, in providing reading texts in Dutch, or as
articles written in English to be used by teachers to address `culture' in the cur-
riculum as they see fit.

  The knowledge element of culture pedagogy, particularly when it has a strong
national focus, tends to be based on a view of culture in terms of its particulari-
ties. These courses are based on the idea of a defined culture or `cultures' (Wil-
liams, 1983 (1976): 89) that can be clearly described as a cohesive unit, marked
off from the cultures of other groups of people (Risager, 2006: 33). The most
traditional of courses in this mode focus on the history and social structures
of the target country, providing factual information on, for instance, the party
political, judicial, educational and healthcare systems, economics, media and
historical events. In other words, a course that describes rather than analyses.
These courses tend to provide a simplified picture of society in order to create
a coherent overview. An example of a book which is used (or perhaps more
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 25

accurately now, used to be used, at universities abroad where Dutch is taught is
Nederland leren kennen (Snoek, 2000, (1996)). This consists of chapters focus-
ing on history, culture, recent social issues, economics and religion written in
Dutch and functioning as reading texts in the language classroom. Another,
well-respected, example is The Netherlands in Perspective: The Dutch way of
Organizing a Society and its Setting (Shetter, 2002 (1997), an English language
resource providing an in-depth historical, social and cultural `coherent over-
view of the Dutch society in all its aspects' [my translation] (Beheydt, 2003).
Themes running through the chapters emphasise supposed national character-
istics, such as the consensual nature of Dutch society, the pragmatic approach
of its citizens and institutions and, above all, the insatiable need to `organise'.

  The kind of Landeskunde pedagogy I referred to above, might seem a little
outdated, with its broad overview and its references to national characteristics.
However, the national paradigm is anything but outdated, at least in practice.
Courses which aim to provide a cultural dimension are more often than not
presented in a national framework, and directed towards `the target country'
and `the target language'. Some of these courses can indeed by very informative,
aiming for deeper understanding of the cultural and social complexities of the
country under study. Recently, in the Netherlands a book was published with
the intention to address `culture' in a more complex context, acknowledging
that Dutch national identity is fluid and apt to change as a result of globalisation
and multiculturalism (Besamusca and Verheul, 2010). Their book, Discovering
the Dutch is not primarily written for the educational market, but already it
has become a key text for Dutch language and culture courses at universities in
and outside the Netherlands. This book takes a more contemporary approach
to `Dutch culture' than some of its predecessors I mentioned above. Gone are
the references to national characteristics of the Dutch. And there where Dutch
characteristics such as pragmatism and tolerance are mentioned, this is always
within the context of representations made `through foreign eyes'. The approach
to Nederlandkunde in this textbook is not only aimed at giving factual informa-
tion, but many of the themes which are touched upon are based on research
and theoretical considerations. A chapter on the multicultural society, for
instance, offers a gentle critique of the `us and them' approach adopted by the
Dutch government, and sets the discussion in a complex historical context. The
occasional references to the `construction' of national identity, indicates that
the idea of national identity is not necessarily taken as a given. The book clearly
pushes the genre of Nederlandkunde, but it does not constitute a new para-
digm as it remains located in a national context. This is not surprising, since the
context of Dutch language and culture pedagogy, including the materials and
textbooks available, is influenced by the guidelines of the European Council,
which I will discuss later in the chapter. But, probably more significantly, Dutch
language and culture teaching is influenced by the current political context in
the Netherlands. As a response to the brand of government supporting multi-
culturalism, which the Netherlands pioneered in the late 1970s, the political
26 Reading With My Eyes Open

climate has veered towards a strong national outlook, which demands cultural
assimilation of immigrants. These political views also had an effect on the pub-
lic discourses about `Dutch culture' and history, and the media frequently dis-
cussed the need to reclaim the Dutch national identity. In 2006 a canon of the
history of the Netherlands was commissioned by the government in order to
address the fact that many native Dutch do not have a sense of their national
identity and history. The canon, widely used in primary and secondary educa-
tion, sets out the `significant events in Dutch history' that all Dutch citizens
should be aware of.

  The national model in language learning in the Netherlands is strong. Lan-
guage learning materials construct a nationality which constitute what Billig
(1995) refers to as `banal nationalism'; the representation of nationality through
seemingly harmless symbols, such as the orange dress of football supporters,
tulips on t-shirts, weather reports with national maps, and indeed language
when it is seen as a political and national, rather than a social construct. Banal
nationalism feels `natural', because it is part of everyday life and customs.

  The national outlook in culture pedagogy does then not only have its source
in earlier romantic notions of nationality, but is also influenced by contempo-
rary political contexts. Nor is it only a characteristic of Dutch foreign language
and culture pedagogy. As Stougaard-Nielssen argued, the same national out-
look takes place in course materials produced in Denmark (2010).

        Critique of the Nationally-Based Knowledge Dimension

The national outlook is gradually being replaced, at least in theoretical discus-
sions of language and culture pedagogy, by notions of transnationality (Ris-
ager, 2007,) super-diversity (Vertovec, 2009) and the idea of the Cosmopolitan
Speaker (Ros i Solé, 2013).

  The view of culture as complex, fluid, changing and indeterminate, is now
dominating the pedagogical literature, as the world is becoming increasingly
interconnected in an age of globalisation and mobility. Kramsch (2002: 276)
refers to the invention of the personal computer as the watershed of changing
views about culture. Before the 1970's culture meant national culture; `what
peoples had and held in common', whereas now she says referring to Geertz
(2000) `there is a scramble of differences in a field of connections.' As Brian
Street (1993) said in an often quoted paper: culture is not a noun, but a verb.
Culture is not a static object, but a dynamic process of meaning making. Hol-
liday (2004: 132) quotes Hall to refer to the meaning making aspect of culture.
`A national culture is a discourse', Hall says, `a way of constructing meanings
which influences both our actions and our conceptions of ourselves.' (Hall,
1996: 613). These discourses of nationalities as `imagined communities' (cf
Anderson, 1983) are powerful and perpetuate the myth of national unity and
national characteristics that many in a nation would share. Hannerz (1999:
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 27

393-407) argues that the seeming self-evidence of `cultures' as entities exist-
ing `side by side as neat packages, [as if] each of us identified with only one of
them', is a time-worn anthropological concept. Most of us, he states, have more
complex lives which entail various cross cultural allegiances.

  Most of us come into contact on a daily basis, whether face-to-face or vir-
tually, with people with different cultural or ethnic backgrounds, with people
with different ideas. As a result we have all become global citizens, who have
become part of `a larger global tribe' as Appiah calls it, where intercultural
encounters are no longer the exception but the norm for many. Appiah (2006)
uses the term `cosmopolitanism' to indicate the complexities and multifaceted
nature of these daily intercultural experiences. This challenges the traditional
notions of `identity'. It challenges the notion of `national identity' as consisting
of a clearly described and delineated set of fixed characteristics shared by all
within the borders of a nation-state. It also challenges the traditional notion of
individual identity - the idea of individuals having a core and stable self, which
remains unchanging over time.

  But the notion of `cosmopolitanism' does not assume that we all share a uni-
versal set of values. The interconnectivity of intercultural encounters that glo-
balisation brought, is only one aspect of `cosmopolitanism'. It does not preclude
the perception of the particularities of ethnic, cultural or national identities.

  Kumaravadivelu (2008) proposes that our complex cultural and subjective
experiences are formed by at least 4 different `realities' of which the global one
is only one aspect. The others are formed of national, social and individual
realities. It is important to note that none of these realities should be seen as
fixed itself. Instead, each of these shape and reshape one another in a dynamic
and constantly shifting relationship (p.157-158).

  However, as I showed above, in language learning materials, the national
outlook remains strong. Textbook writers and teachers of `culture' do face a dif-
ficult choice. On the one hand teachers want to emphasise the complex social
and cultural reality of `the target culture'. On the other hand, teachers or text-
book writers do not want to create a confusing message to students; after all,
it would be hard to deny that there are cultural specifities. Moreover, students
often want to know about what makes `the' culture of the country or coun-
tries whose language they study different from their own. Besamusca stated
that her students were disappointed when they found out that certain practices
in the Netherlands were similar to those in their own country. Students had
hoped the Netherlands to be more `exotic' (2006). Similarly, Ros i Solé found in
her study in learner identities that students often are attracted to the language
they study because of a romanticised idea of the culture (Ros i Solé, Fenoulhet,
2013). This pull between the pedagogic desire for clarity, and the intellectual
desire for acknowledging complexity, is part of what Risager (2007: 216) calls
the national dilemma.

  The content dimension of nationally oriented courses which focus on
imparting information tends to centre on sociological and historical themes.
28 Reading With My Eyes Open

But there are two other areas which are also considered to be part of the cul-
tural dimension of language teaching. Since Byram (1989) developed a model
for intercultural communicative competence for what he used to call `lan-
guage-and-culture' teaching, the communication element has also become
an integrated part of culture pedagogy. I will discuss this in greater detail in
the next chapter. The other very significant element in culture pedagogy, apart
from social, political and historical information, is the anthropological aspect
of culture as everyday experienced life. This aspect has been included in the
detailed taxonomy by the Common European Framework of References for Lan-
guages (2001).

                    The Common European Framework

The Common European Framework of References for Languages (CEFR for
short) was commissioned by the Council of Europe and published in 2001.
Even though it is to a large extent based on Byram's notion of intercultural
communicative competence (see chapter 3), it cannot be completely attributed
to him, as the CEFR is a consensus document between the various member
states of the EU. In fact, as Risager points out, many of Byram's recommenda-
tions, particular those on intercultural competence, were not included in the
final document (2007: 115). The CEFR provides guidelines for teaching, learn-
ing and assessment and does not suggest particular teaching methodologies.
Instead, it consists of a taxonomy of the skills that learners should possess at cer-
tain levels of study. The CEFR arose as a consequence of the mobility schemes
which were set up by the Council of Europe and which followed the removal of
trade restrictions in the European market. These mobility programmes encour-
aged exchanges between staff in areas of governmental and non-governmental
organizations in health, social care, education and other professional domains.
To facilitate this movement, the CEFR was set up to encourage language learn-
ing, to provide parity in language provision across the EU to prepare people
linguistically as well as mentally for the intercultural experiences that mobility
would bring. It is an extremely comprehensive document which describes in
detail what competences, skills and knowledges learners of a foreign language
ought to possess at a particular level and in a particular domain.

  The emphasis in the document is on language skills, although attention is
also given to sociolinguistic aspects which stems from an instrumental ration-
ale: one cannot be an effective `intercultural' or `cross-cultural communicator'
without having at least a basic understanding of the social patterns and values
in society as these are reflected in the way that people communicate. It relates
to culture as communication. For this reason sociolinguistic information is
provided to develop an awareness of prevailing communication strategies and
customs (shaking hands when greeting, degrees of directness in expressing
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 29

intent etc.). This is what Canale and Swain (1980: 30, 31) called `sociolinguistic',
`strategic' and `discourse' competence.

  In addition to linguistic and sociolinguistic competences, there is a cul-
tural dimension in the CEFR, which is referred to as `intercultural awareness',
although the emphasis is on language skills rather than on cultural aspects.
An important aspect of this awareness is `objective knowledge of the world' in
respect of the country in which the language is spoken. This includes informa-
tion about areas such as everyday living (e.g. food, hobbies, celebrations), liv-
ing conditions (e.g. welfare arrangements), interpersonal relations (e.g. family
structures, race relations, relations between genders), values, beliefs and atti-
tudes, body language, social conventions (regarding, for instance, punctual-
ity, gift giving, dress, and taboos), and finally ritual behaviour regarding, for
instance, religious celebrations, birth and death, festivals and so on (CEFR,
pp101-130).

  Whilst the CEFR acknowledges that intercultural awareness should be seen
in a wider sense than the context of the L1 and L2 cultures, it also emphasises
that learners should be aware of `how each community appears from the per-
spective of the other, often in the form of national stereotypes' (CEFR, p.103).

  Even though the CEFR document does not make reference to its particular
perspective on culture, the view which emerges from the CEFR seems to be
partly based on a similar view of culture as underpinning Landeskunde: culture
as knowledge. But its inclusion of attitudes and values with regards to a range
of areas in daily life, suggests that Geertz's (1973) symbolic and interpretive
view of culture as `historically transmitted patterns of meaning [...] by means
of which men communicate, perpetuate, and develop their knowledge about
and attitudes toward life" (Geertz 1973: 89) may also have informed the CEFR.

  The CEFR has undoubtedly advanced the notion of culture pedagogy as part
of language teaching by introducing a considered list of the wider aspects of
cultural knowledge that it considered students should possess. But in practice,
at least in contemporary Dutch language courses (cf. Contact, 2010), the cul-
tural dimension is limited to a few reading texts about topics such as the geo-
graphical situation of Flanders, or information about everyday habits such as
customs and conventions regarding food or celebrations. The rest of the course
is solidly based on a functional approach to language teaching; arguably a more
considered inclusion of the cultural dimension of the CEFR would have been
a step forward.

  The focus on everyday life in the CEFR gives the potential to include an
ethnographic element into language courses; a self-reflexive awareness of the
political, cultural and social influences to which learners are subjected them-
selves in their everyday experiences and realities. However, this possibility is
not emphasised and the CEFR's treatment of the cultural dimension of every
day life is superficial. It does not encourage reflection beyond a comparing of
everyday living practices with the learners' `own' culture. A national perspective
30 Reading With My Eyes Open

of culture is taken, which links the foreign language to an essentialised idea of
`the' target culture and does not allow for a critical understanding of the com-
plexities of cultural realities such as power inequalities, differences in role or
status and the `lived experience' occasioned by the complex and fluid cultural
identities and subjectivities of people. It tends to represent culture as homog-
enous and stable and reduces culture to facts and information. This can provide
students with pragmatic and useful information, but it also brings with it the
danger of reinforcing, or even creating, unchallenged stereotypical images.

  Despite the influence it has on language teaching in Europe, Risager only
mentions the CEFR in passing in her overview of language and culture peda-
gogy (2007: 143); `its conception of the relationship between language and cul-
ture, and that between language teaching and culture teaching [in the CEFR],
is unclear and without theoretical foundation', she states. Yet, the CEFR informs
many language courses in Britain and seems a force to stay.

  Whilst I think an element of knowledge about the target country needs to be
addressed in language pedagogy, it should not present culture in a bounded,
stable and one-dimensional way, as that will not provide the enabling of an
intellectual critical development in the students. This brings us again to the
issue of criticality.

             Criticality and Culture: My Own Considerations

When I initially started to develop the Dutch language course on which this
study is based in the mid 1990s, one of my prime motivations was to introduce
an intellectual and critical element to the course. I discussed the motivations
for this in the introduction. At the time, criticisms against a national approach
had not yet arisen in the pedagogical literature, except as a rejection of the ulti-
mate aim of language learning to emulate `the native speaker'. The cultural con-
tent element of language teaching courses was largely limited to the national.
My own discomfort with the national approach, honesty demands me to say,
was at the time not theoretically motivated, but was the result of practical con-
siderations. Wanting to introduce a critical element into language and culture
teaching based on the practice of asking students to discuss intellectually stim-
ulating topics, rather than only providing information, I found, unsurprisingly,
that most topics relating to culture and society had international relevance. In
discussing environmental issues, for instance, students would automatically
introduce perspectives, angles and examples which were related to their own
experiences, and to discourses with which they were familiarised through their
own varied contexts of living. But rather than taking a comparative perspective,
it soon appeared through these discussions that the discourses on which stu-
dents, or the articles I presented them with, drew, were not limited to national
situations or view points, but rather to global ones. The differences between
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 31

perspectives were not informed by nationality, but by ideological and general
worldviews which crossed borders.

  So from starting out to address critical skills at the level of `critical think-
ing', or questioning skills, which is located in a humanist educational perspec-
tive, I arrived through pragmatic considerations at, what Risager calls, the
transnational perspective. I conceptualised this as `global discourses', but since
national political situations impact on global debates, I also conceived of the
notion of `national articulations' within these discourses. I will develop this
idea further below.

  What I had conceptualised at the time, was that culture, language and com-
munication were infinitely more complex and fluid than most language and
culture courses allowed, and that the criticality for which I aimed needed to
go beyond the questioning skills of `critical thinking'. The criticality that was
needed to understand how meaning is created, which discourses come into
being, why and how, and generally to understand the processes of meaning
making, demanded a different ontological view of culture pedagogy.

  An information-based approach would not suffice. A better option for the lan-
guage and culture teacher would be to address culture in terms of its wider defi-
nition, and see cultural products and practices in relation to the meaning mak-
ing processes that inform them. I found this in the Cultural Studies approach.

                           Cultural Studies: Context

The term cultural studies needs explaining as it is used in different ways in dif-
ferent contexts. In modern language degrees the term is often used to refer to
academic subject courses with `cultural content', such as literature, film studies
or area studies. In language pedagogy literature the term has also been used. In
his 1989 book Byram called the language and culture pedagogy for which he
started to develop a theoretical basis `Cultural Studies'. However, his use of the
term is not the same as that of the Cultural Studies movement which I discuss
below. Byram has since dropped the term, as his overriding concept came to be
the `Intercultural Speaker', which I discuss in chapter 3.

  I use the term cultural studies here in line with Turner (1992: 9) to refer
to an interdisciplinary area of study - rather than one particular approach
- where various concerns and methods converge which have `enabled us to
understand phenomena and relationships that were not accessible through
existing disciplines'. Its interest encompasses a very broad field of contempo-
rary cultural practices, products and processes, although its main focus tends
to be on `popular' culture, as it rejects the notion of the `canon'. Whereas a
Landeskunde approach focuses on providing information and knowledge, a
cultural studies approach allows students to engage with texts, to `discover'
information about cultural practices, values or processes through reading and
interpreting texts.
32 Reading With My Eyes Open

  In chapters 3 and 4 I set out my particular take on how to include a cul-
tural studies approach in a language class, but below I provide a short overview
of some of the main ideas and concepts associated with cultural studies as an
approach to culture pedagogy.

       Overview of Ideas of Cultural Studies in Culture Pedagogy

Cultural Studies developed initially in Britain. The Centre for Contemporary
Cultural Study (CCCS), the first of its kind, was established in 1964 at the Uni-
versity of Birmingham. The birth of cultural studies marked a movement which
took a very different view of culture than the traditional one, which is based
on the literary canon, and regarded culture as a socially informed construct
rather than purely the expression of an individual great mind. The distinction
between high and low culture became irrelevant. Raymond Williams, generally
considered to be the godfather of this movement, has been seminal in seeing
culture as a process as well as `concrete lived experience', and in analysing cul-
tural products in relation to the institutions and social structures which pro-
duced them (Williams, 1961).

  British Cultural Studies changed the way that people think about, study
and teach culture, but as the approach developed beyond Britain, different
interpretations underpinned by different theories, emerged. Much of British
Cultural Studies was initially informed by a Marxist agenda, centring around
issues such as power relations, particularly those determined by social class.
Later academics, such as Stuart Hall extended the notion of inequality in soci-
ety to incorporate areas of ethnicity and gender. An important moment in cul-
tural studies was the adoption of Gramsci's (1971) notion of `hegemony', which
views the cultural domination of a particular group as being achieved through
persuasion or consent. Submission to the dominant ideas is then partly a con-
sensual undertaking. People submit to dominant views because these views
have developed a taken-for-granted perspective. Power is then exercised not
so much by a dominant group or ruling class imposing its will on other groups
or people, but instead power is the legitimisation of certain ideas in becoming
the norm. As Van Dijk (1993) states, we speak of hegemony when subtle forms
of `dominance' seem to be so persistent that it seems natural and it is accepted
that those that are dominated act in the interest of the powerful. Behind this
principle of hegemony, as Wallace points out (2003: 30), is the view that people
in general are not aware of the operation of power, especially as embedded in
language. The idea that language practices and conventions are invested with
power relations of which people are unaware, is also the focus of a strand of
language pedagogy, Critical Language Awareness, which I will discuss later on
in this chapter.

  The issues in cultural studies are wide and varied but a consensus concerns
the extent to which, and the processes through which, cultural meanings are
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 33

made and accepted, and are imposed upon or resisted by us. The central ques-
tions are therefore to do with ideology and power. The notion of ideology
which is used in cultural studies is a complex one. The concept of `ideology' is
often traced back to a Marxist view which pertains to ideas of economic and
cultural domination of the ruling class over the working class. As Wetherell
(2001: 286) says, `Marxist work on ideology was concerned with testing ideas
and statements for their truth value, or their accordance with reality'. However,
this early view of ideology has become superseded in cultural studies by other
views which are based on notions of reality which are more complex and subtle.

  Stuart Hall (1983) uses the term `ideology' to refer to a framework of ideas
and concepts to make sense of the world. This view of ideology as a belief sys-
tem is the one which is used most frequently in the `common sense' under-
standing of the term. The notion of `ideas' as encompassing a belief system is, I
think, given more subtlety through the concept of `discourses' as used by Fou-
cault, which explains how ways of thinking about a particular topic or slice of
the cultural or social world can become so dominant that it `infiltrates' people's
mind and takes on the aura of `truth'.

  What thus becomes relevant for study is not just what products or practices
are part of a particular way of life, but rather the meanings attributed to them.
Quite how we interpret cultural products and practices, whether we see them as
forms of self-expression or socially enforced meanings, as acts of resistance or
incorporation, depends on the theoretical paradigm and underlying epistemol-
ogy from which we approach the texts we study.

  Interpreting texts then, is not just a matter of seeing how meaning is encoded,
but it is a process of constructing the meaning of signs which must take account
of the wider context in which the texts are produced and in which they are
read and received, or how they are `articulated' (Stuart Hall, 1985). Meaning is
thus not fixed, as different meanings can be ascribed dependent on the position
from which we approach the sign. Different people, in different contexts, with
different ideological backgrounds and different individual histories, will inter-
pret texts in different ways. The importance of looking at signs not merely from
the viewpoint of text production but also of text reception is central to many
contemporary cultural studies practices. One of the key issues in this respect is
the notion of intertextuality. As Maaike Meijer (1996) argues, this goes beyond
traceable references to other texts and should be interpreted in its widest sense
as the whole of the social and cultural climate and conventions. The reader
constructs the meaning of the texts through his/her knowledge of and experi-
ence with other texts and a whole network of conventions and discourses. In
this way a text becomes what Meijer calls a `cultuurtekst', a network of accepted
ways of talking about a particular theme. Seeing a text as `cultuurtekst' neces-
sitates looking at the cultural and social environment in which the text is pro-
duced. The intertexts also provide a wider context through the other cultural
phenomena and practices to which the text refers and the discourses on which
34 Reading With My Eyes Open

it draws. Intertexts provide the cohesive structure through which text and con-
text can be studied in relation to one another.

  Culture in Cultural Studies is not an aesthetic view of culture, but an anthro-
pological one. This, as Risager (2006: 49) says, is an extension of Geertz' inter-
pretative view of culture as a system of meanings. Whereas for Geertz, she
explains, an already existing meaning needs to be `unearthed' from texts or
practices, in a Cultural Studies approach the emphasis is on the creation, rec-
reation and the attribution of meaning as part of a process of people in interac-
tion or `dialogue'. This, as well as the notion of `cultuurtekst' are key aspects in
my own pedagogy which I will discuss further in chapters 3 and 4.

             Language in Relation to Culture

                       Orientations Towards Language

In this section of this chapter I want to address some of the theoretical posi-
tions from which language is seen in relation to culture and how these theories
have been reflected in language teaching. Looking at this relationship assumes
that there is an intrinsic link between language and culture. This view of an
automatic link between language and culture needs to be problematised, and I
will do so at the end of this chapter. Indeed, this link is now almost commonly
accepted in the theoretical literature on language and culture pedagogy, even
if, in practice, certainly in the case of Dutch language teaching, the inclusion
of culture in course books is very haphazard, and the pedagogic activities fre-
quently display a view of language as stable and autonomous.

  I will first discuss this approach to language as being stable and autonomous.
I discuss this here as part of a traditional approach to language learning, before
looking at social and cultural views of language.

             Traditional and Linguistic-Oriented Approaches

I will start by briefly backtracking to the traditional approach to language teach-
ing in university language degrees. This pertained to an Arnoldian concept of
culture (part of which survives in traditional universities) and incorporated
two views of language concurrently. On the one hand, language had a central
role to play in the conceptualisation of `high' culture, so that language was val-
ued for its historical, literary and aesthetic dimensions. On the other hand,
language teaching was divorced from these ideals and instead emphasised the
structural properties of language, in accordance with methodologies derived
from teaching Latin (Cope and Kalantzis, 1993: 41-45).
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 35

  As a result, language, as it was conceptualised in language teaching, became
separate from its original anchoring in those traditional philological degrees.
This split between an aesthetic and a formal view of language was occasioned,
I believe, by the two conflicting trends of thought about language which were
current at the time and which Volosinov2 (1996 (1973): 53) describes as `indi-
vidualistic subjectivism', rooted in historical views and concerned with human
consciousness, and `abstract objectivism', which considers language as `com-
pletely independent of individual creative acts, intentions or motives'. The first
trend emphasises the individual and creative aspects of speech. Vossler, as
quoted by Volosinov (ibid. p. 51), formulates it like this: `linguistic thought is
essentially poetic thought; linguistic truth is artistic truth, is meaningful beauty'.
The link with an Arnoldian view of culture is easy to recognise. The second
trend, known especially for its Saussurean interpretations, looks at language as
a system, and, as Volosinov (ibid. pp. 67, 68) says, ignores the social function of
language and fails to do justice to its changeable and adaptable nature.

  These two opposing trends in linguistic thought remained separate within
foreign language degree courses and offered a two-tier view of language within
one and the same degree; on the one hand language as literature; on the other,
language as grammar. Neither `individual subjectivism', nor `abstract objectiv-
ism' is easily married with the idea of a relationship between language and cul-
ture, if culture is interpreted as a meaning making process as part of the wider
social environment and its value systems. Whilst a Saussurean view of language
allows both for an individual as well as a social side of language, Saussure sees
these two elements as separate. His view is complex, but I feel relevant to the
language teacher as many of these concepts have taken on the aura of `com-
mon-sense' assumptions (Kress, 1994: 170, 171), and have influenced views on
foreign language teaching. Saussure's notion of langue as a system of forms rep-
resents the social aspect of language in the sense that the linguistic rules have
been agreed upon by a speech community. Parole (the utterance) on the other
hand, as the execution of speech, represents the individual choices the language
user makes. In separating these two elements, Saussure (1973: 11) says we can
at the same time `separate 1) what is social from what is individual; and 2) what
is essential from what is accessory and more or less accidental.' What is essen-
tial to Saussure is langue, the system passively internalised by the individual
speaker. In this trend, as Volosinov (ibid. pp. 52-54) explains, `the individual
acquires the system of language completely ready-made'. There is no room for
individual creativity, because the linguistic system is fixed. A Saussurean view
has no time for social values as reflected in texts or utterances, and is not inter-
ested in language as constructing social reality. Structuralism sees language
in terms of its formal properties and not its use. This approach remained de
rigueur in language teaching until the 1960s when it was gradually replaced by
methodologies informed by contextual and communicative concerns.

  However, a Saussurean-based view of language has influenced language
teaching in more than its view of grammatical correctness as a major criterion
36 Reading With My Eyes Open

in teaching. Saussure's notion of language as a system of signs encoding mean-
ing also continued to inform language teaching approaches. For Saussure, the
sign consists of the signifier (the outward stimulus) and the signified (the mental
construct which the signifier conjures up). The problem with applying these
notions directly to language teaching lies in the two assumptions embedded in
this conceptualisation of the signifier and signified. One assumption is that the
relationship between signifier and signified is arbitrary, that there is no inher-
ent link between form and meaning, but that this relationship is established by
convention alone. The other assumption is that language as a system is stable,
fixed and bounded; meaning is tied to form and exists independently of context
(Kress, 1994: 171). In other words, language is seen as an autonomous system
without any relationship to culture.

  The point I would like to make - and to which Kress refers - is that if we do
not think there is a motivated relation between words and meaning, then lan-
guage users merely engage in recycling pre-existing meanings. Applying this
notion to language teaching would lead to the conclusion that it is sufficient to
teach these pre-existing meanings, whether as grammar, vocabulary or func-
tional phrases, as has indeed been the case in functional approaches. Language
teaching becomes then in effect a mere re-labelling, sticking a different label to
the same concept. How can we then express individual meaning? Or, looking
at it from the pedagogic perspective of reading, the consequence of this view is
that the text entails a definite meaning which the reader needs to extract.

  The implication of a Saussurean view for language teaching is that semantics
is restricted to surface meaning and does not extend to underlying meanings,
or using Halliday's term, its `potential to mean' (cf Halliday, 1978). Much of lan-
guage teaching reflects this stable view in the tendency to look at texts and use
them as exercises in testing comprehension of the explicit meaning presented.
Yet it is by looking at implied meanings and at what texts do not say, the signifi-
cant absences in texts, the reading between the lines, that students can access
the social and cultural as well as individual meanings, which are constructed
in a text.

  In short, the views of language, which were, and in some cases still are, in
operation in traditional language degrees, i.e. on the one hand language as
expression of individual and creative thought and on the other hand language
as a system of formal rules, would not form a good basis from which to derive
principles for language teaching. I will now turn to cultural and social views of
language and argue that these do not necessarily negate the potential to express
individual meaning.

         Social and Cultural Views of Language

              Hymes' Theory of Communicative Competence

Hymes' view of communicative competence (cf. 1967; 1972) brought an anthro-
pological understanding to language, as it provides a model for analysing a
communicative event in its socio-cultural context. His model indicates the var-
ious parameters that govern communication in terms of what to say, when, to
whom and how to say it, and with what intention. This set of parameters in its
pragmatic, goal-oriented and functional aspects has served as a guide for lan-
guage teaching since the 1980s. It formed the basis of the functional approach
to language teaching (cf Wilkinson, 1976), which was developed further in the
Threshold Levels (Van Ek, 1991) of the Council of Europe, the precursor to the
Common European Framework, which I discussed earlier in the chapter.

  This approach focused on language functions in a few specific domains of
language use such as shopping, travel, house and home, food and drink. Lan-
guage teaching for communicative competence reduced Hymes' notion of
communication to a limited and fixed set of situational topics, through which
the learner would encounter and practice communicative acts such as giving
a warning, inviting someone or asking for help, within set domains using set
phrases. Its focus became a goal-oriented view of language where limited fea-
tures of the situational context were the principal determinants of the linguistic
choices to be made.

  Reducing language teaching predominantly to the context of situation limits
the learners' understanding of the role that our social and cultural environ-
ment has to play in our language use. Considering the context according to set
parameters assumes that the rules for social communication used in one situa-
tion are the same in all situations of that kind. Like the Saussurean tradition, it
assumes stability of meaning. It ignores the unpredictability of communicative
events and the individual choices we might make in our utterances to respond
to the context. It could be argued that learners would at least need to learn
the conventions used in certain communicative settings, but even in situations
governed largely by conventions we have the freedom to act in accordance with
those conventions or not. As Kress (1994: 176) argues, even a decision to con-
form is an act of choice, and as such involves a `new production of the meaning
of conformity'.

  However, it is not only the limited interpretation of Hymes' (1967; 1972) for-
mulation of communicative competence view of language which is the prob-
lem. I believe that his model, whilst helping us to understand the very impor-
tant role of the immediate context, or the context of situation, does not fully
address the idea of the complexity of culture. Even though cultural conventions
are addressed through the parameters of `norm' (social rules) and `genre' (argu-
ably a social view of text), it does not question or consider the wider view of
38 Reading With My Eyes Open

`context of culture', which consists of wider societal influences and ideological
forces and discourses (Halliday, 1985). Hymes did consider ideology in his later
work, which I will refer to in the next chapter, but that work did not have an
impact on language teaching.

  The two notions of context come from the anthropologist Malinowski
(1884-1942). Kramsch glosses Malinowski's idea of `context of situation' as the
`immediate physical, spatial, temporal and social environment in which verbal
exchange takes place' (1998: 126). Indeed, this is similar to Hymes' parameters
governing communicative competence. But in order to understand meaning
more fully, one also had to take account of the context of culture, Malinow-
ski argued, which, as Kramsch quotes Malinowski, means taking account of
`tribal economics, social organisation, kinship patterns, fertility rites, seasonal
rhythms, concepts of time and space' (ibid. p. 26). Whilst this relates to a tradi-
tional anthropological and static view of culture, the idea of context of culture
can include a poststructuralist view of culture. The aim of achieving commu-
nicative competence in language learning has now been replaced by the notion
of Intercultural Communicative Competence (Byram, 1997). I discuss this in
chapter 3.

                                   Sapir-Whorf

A strong culture-bound view which stems from a cultural anthropological per-
spective of language, is the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, first formulated by Whorf
in 1940 (Whorf, 1956) which holds that language and culture are completely
interwoven. The Whorfian hypothesis posits that language determines the
way we think; the possibilities and limitations of our language structure our
thought, so people see the world differently because of their language. This view
borrows from the romantic idea of culture that there is a direct link between a
particular language and the particular culture where the language is spoken. In
the literature of Dutch language teaching, this close relationship is often stated.
In her monograph, aimed at teachers of Dutch as a second language, Van der
Toorn-Schutte (1997: 9) suggests that the reason that foreign language learn-
ers of Dutch struggle with learning the language is because, not having grown
up in the Netherlands, they perceive the world in a different way. Referring
to etymology, as well as to pragmatics, she gives examples or words, expres-
sions, linguistic as well as functional aspects of language, which are `culturally
determined'. Whilst van der Toorn-Schutte seems to hold on to a strong notion
of the Whorfian hypothesis, Van Baalen (2003) and Van Kalsbeek (2003) who
also both refer to Whorf, agree that language is culturally determined, although
they see this in a weaker form; of language reflecting rather than determining
culture. Nevertheless, they both hold on to the one language, one culture view.
Van Kalsbeek particularly focuses on miscommunication to which she refers
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 39

as `culture bumps', whereas Van Baalen uses Wierzbicka's cross-cultural seman-
tics to encourage students to look at the `culturally determined norms and val-
ues embedded in words' [my translation] (ibid. p. 107). Examples of these are
words such as vriend (friend), tolerant, and the supposedly untranslatable word
gezellig which refers to `cosiness' as well as to `having a good time in company'.

  The problem with using the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis to inform pedagogy
and the assumption of a direct relationship between one particular lan-
guage and one particular culture is that it does not acknowledge the com-
plex social, linguistic and cultural realities of people's lives. Roger Andersen
(1988: 83) suggests that an influence of language on thought is indisputable.
I agree that language has an influence on our perception of the world. How-
ever, I see this relationship not as being between `a' language and `a' culture,
but rather in the way we construct our world through discourses which are
part of culture and which we encounter in our daily lives. I come back to this
later in this chapter.

  Whilst Andersen (ibid. p. 88) also critiques linguistic relativity because it
ignores the fact that people have different experiences, both in social terms
and in their relation to the natural world, he adds a critical angle. These differ-
ent experiences of people are not necessarily haphazard, he says, but based on
inequality, because social and material knowledge are not distributed equally.
For this reason, he suggests, issues of power relations need to come into the
equation when looking at questions of language and thought. Interpreted this
way, the issue becomes an ideological one and bears on similar concerns to
the questions asked by cultural studies - to what degree are we free to create
our own meaning, and can we resist the dominant `taken-for-granted' inter-
pretations of text? These questions reflect a critical approach to language and
culture, in critiquing how power is reproduced through language. I will discuss
this view of language below.

                         Critical Language Awareness

Critical Language Awaress (CLA) is not a view of language as such, but a peda-
gogic approach. I include it nevertheless in my discussion of social views of
language, because its critical approach, derived from influences such as Criti-
cal Linguistics (cf. Kress and Hodge, 1979), Critical Pedagogy (Freire, 1970),
and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA) (cf. Fairclough, 1989; Fairclough and
Wodak, 1996) is part of a shift moving away from viewing language as autono-
mous, to a more ``ideological' model with connections to media studies and a
more grounded understanding of social processes' (Pennycook, 2001: 9). Its
aim is emancipatory: to encourage social transformation through denaturalis-
ing ideologies that have become naturalised (ibid. p. 81). CDA studies focuses
particularly on unequal relations as produced through conversations, e.g. doc-
40 Reading With My Eyes Open

tor and patient interviews, such as who gets to speak about what and for how
long (Fairclough, 1989: 43-47).

  CLA, as the pedagogic wing of CDA, aims to promote an awareness in learn-
ers of how power relations and inequalities are produced and reproduced
through language. There are various practices of CLA, although there is usually
a strong focus on the use of text and reading (cf. Wallace, 2003). CLA pedago-
gies encourage students to look at the way that power is reflected in the use of
particular conventions, what the conditions and motivations were of the pro-
ducers of a given text and how texts positions readers or listeners in terms of
their role or identity. It raises awareness of how through the use of language
people can maintain or change power relationships.

  This pedagogy was developed in Britain and is used in some English Lan-
guage Teaching contexts, but does not seem to have made much impact on for-
eign language teaching. One reason for this might be that a pedagogy of critical
language awareness does not fit in easily with the now dominant skills-based
traditional approaches to foreign language teaching.

  However, Critical Language Awareness approaches are also used to develop
productive language skills, particularly writing. Romy Clark (1992: 134-137)
argues that in the case of academic writing, for instance, students should be
aware of the prevailing conventions within the academic community and
should be able to apply them. But equally important is, as she states, a criti-
cal attitude towards these conventions; by challenging dominant practices,
students can learn to produce alternative discourses and inscribe their own
meaning.

  This last point has potential for further development as a pedagogy in the for-
eign language classroom. It hinges on the dual aims of empowering the learner
to recognise social meanings and to be able to employ these if needed, but
also to allow for human agency to create individual articulations within estab-
lished discourses. I describe elsewhere (Quist, 2013) how in an oral presenta-
tion, one of my students employed both formal conventions and consciously
departed from these. She did so by adopting generally an informal tone, in
order to ensure her `audience', who she had imagined to consist of a range of
different people representing hierarchical relations, felt all equally respected
and included.

  I borrow from CLA in my own pedagogy in the sense that I ask learners to
look at how people in texts are positioned and represented. However, my peda-
gogy deviates from CLA in the sense that its primary aim is not to `unmask
power', but instead to recognize the complexities of discourses in texts. In doing
so, I am more in line with O'Regan (2006) who critiques CDA (the theoretical
precursor to CLA) for its `unintended privileging of a final reading of the text'.
O'Regan locates this predilection of CDA in its attachment to humanist values
of reason and truth (2006: 21). His concern with criticality is to query the `truth
certainties' and the `truth claims' in texts (ibid: 17). Whilst his motivation is
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 41

political, in the sense that it is critiquing the naturalising of discourses of power
inequalities, it is also moral in its concern with tolerance, and social justice. His
take on criticality is not located in the ideology critique of `emancipatory mod-
ernism' (Pennycook, 2001), but in the poststructuralist critique which Penny-
cook refers to as `problematising practice', which finds its practical application
in `discursive mapping'. This brings us to a discursive view of language.

                              Discourse and Power

The term `discourse' is central to many social sciences studies and takes on a
range of meanings. Foucault offered a `three dimensional' definition, as Kumar-
avadivelu (2007: 218) states. The first of these definitions relates to all language
in use; i.e. all texts or utterances. The second one relates to `specific formations
of fields' such as the `discourse of racism', or the `discourse of feminism'. The
third definition, Kumaravadivelu says, extends beyond language to the `socio-
political structures that create the conditions governing particular utterances
or texts'. Discourse, then, relates to the entire conceptual world in which knowl-
edge is produced and reproduced. From this perspective language is only one
of the entities that construct discourse. Texts are generated by discursive forma-
tions or discursive fields of power and knowledge. These fields construct certain
ways of understanding the world (within particular domains) which then take
on the status of common sense assumptions. A discourse then provides a lim-
ited set of possibilities and structures of what can be said and how it can be said
within certain domains.

  The field of education may provide an example. Discourses prevalent when
talking about Higher Education, for instance, are those located in the discur-
sive field of liberal humanism or that of vocationalism. The former provides
a way of thinking about education as well as a general shared understanding
of society which prioritises the individual over the social, which focuses on
the individual's development of rational and rigorous thinking, and which is
seen as leading to a general improvement of a `moral' society. We could also
add that this constitutes an understanding of education from a largely west-
ern perspective. The discursive field of vocationalism on the other hand, con-
structs the value of education as helping students on the career ladder. To do
so students do not need critical thinking, but practical skills. The implicit val-
ues relate to prosperity, ambition, business, booming economies and financial
security rather than an individual's development of the `mind'. These discourses
are reflected in prospectuses of HE institutions.

  However, it is also clear that prospectuses would not be written using only
one of these discursive fields. As Kress points out (1985: 7, 8), discourses do
not exist in isolation, but in larger systems of sometimes opposing and contra-
dictory, or just different, discourses. As discourses tend to, what Kress calls,
`colonise' areas, i.e. to account for increasingly wider areas outside the initial
42 Reading With My Eyes Open

domain, texts attempt to reconcile these `contradictions, mismatches, disjunc-
tions and discontinuities' to seamlessly interweave these different strands
(ibid.:10). A university prospectus may therefore reflect both discourses of
liberal humanism and vocationalism in a seamless fabric, interwoven with
other strands such as those emphasising the discourse of `community of the
university', as well as those referring to comfort and pleasure. Indeed, I draw
on a range of discourses in the field of education myself in this thesis, and not
always explicitly so. It is difficult for an individual to think outside these dis-
cursive formations which determine to a large extent what we can think and say
in particular domains.

  Discourses then seem to be deterministic: to reduce the role of human agency
and to limit the autonomous free-willed subject's ability to step outside these
discourses. After all, according to Foucault, discourse produces knowledge
and meaning. As Stuart Hall explains: `physical things and actions exist, but
they only take on meaning and become objects of knowledge within discourse'
(Hall, in Wetherell et. al. 2001: 73). In other words, it would be difficult to see a
particular situation or action from a different perspective or attach a different
meaning to it, then the meaning which is, as it were, provided through dis-
course. Discourse then, guides how `reality' is interpreted. Knowledge, as Hall
(Hall, in Wetherell et. al. 2001: 75) explains, is `always inextricably enmeshed
in relations of power because it was always being applied to the regulation of
social conduct in practice.' In this sense `discourse' comes close to ideology, but
I prefer the notion of discourse, like Foucault, to make it clear I reject the Marx-
ist position which focuses mainly on class.

  Instead of `ideology', Foucault put forward the notion of `regimes of truth',
discursive formations which seem to become `true' because `knowledge, once
applied to the real world has real effects, and in that sense at least, `becomes
true' (Hall, in Wetherell et. al. 2001: 76). Hall gives the example of single parent-
ing. If everyone believes that single parenting inevitably leads to delinquency
and crime, and single parents are being punished accordingly, `this will have
real consequences for both parents and children, and will become `true' in
terms of its real effects [...].'

  However, I believe the individual is not trapped within discourses, because in
living complex and mobile lives, we are exposed to a multitude of discourses on
which we draw at any one time, and sometimes these are ambiguous, conflict-
ing or overlapping. Moreover, as an educational approach, we can step outside a
particular discourse, when engaging in what Pennycook (2001) calls `discursive
mapping' or `problematising practice'. Through discursive mapping, students
can become aware of how discourses operate in texts to produce this configura-
tion of power and knowledge. This discursive mapping can consist of relating
the text to one's own experiences, both in terms of other reading as well as in
terms of one's own lived experience. Using this approach allows students to see
culture not as a one to one relationship with language, but in relation to the
cultural complexity of our contemporary globalised society.

     Relationship Language and Culture: Generic and Differential

To conclude the discussion on the different views of how language relates to
culture, I have argued there is a close relationship between language and cul-
ture; not as a direct link between a national language and a national culture, but
rather through the ideas, values, knowledge and power structures of discursive
formations which are expressed through language. Risager has theorised this
distinction (2006: 2-5) as the generic and differential levels at which language
and culture relate. Language and culture in the generic sense are `phenomena
shared by all humanity'; phenomena which are part of social life. In this sense,
language and culture cannot be separated. At the differential level, on the other
hand, we talk about different `languages', whether national, e.g. Dutch, French,
German, or language varieties. At the generic level, language and culture are
inseparable, Risager argues; at the differential level, however, they can be seen
as separate, as `a' culture does not necessarily conform to `a' language.

  This duality helps to conceptualise the complexity of the language and culture
relationship. Pedagogically, I believe, the language class should address both
these levels. On the one hand, we should address the critical understanding
of discursive formations in culture and society as reflected in and constructed
through discourses - this is the generic level. On the other hand the main task
of the modern language class is still to teach students to speak, write and under-
stand `a' language - in other words to teach, in my case, Dutch at the differential
level. Whilst this would include teaching the standard variety of grammar, it
should also include different language varieties, genres and voices. Teaching at
the differential level does not necessarily mean teaching a stylised, standardised
and sterile form of the language. But the complexity lies at the generic level,
where I interpret the pedagogic activities to involve more awareness raising
exercises and critiquing rather than actually teaching `discourses', although, as
I will discuss in chapter 4, part of my pedagogy is to get students to write for
different purposes drawing on different discourses.

  Discourses transcend the differential and national levels. In the contempo-
rary world, many discourses are global, or at least extend across wide geograph-
ical areas. Examples are the discourses of `terrorism', or `environmentalism', or
`multiculturalism'. But, sometimes these discourses have a national accentua-
tion. With this I mean that due to social or cultural histories and experiences
of nations, as part of their nationhood, discourses may be `articulated' differ-
ently in different places and contexts. One of these contexts is a national one.
With this I do not suggest the existence of essentialised national discourse, but
instead I argue there may be, in my case, a Dutch, articulation in texts, as one
of the layers of meaning.
44 Reading With My Eyes Open

                               Dutch Articulation

Discourses reflect largely meaning making practices which cross borders
and are not limited to particular nations. This is the generic level where lan-
guage and culture relate. However, due to historical processes and structures
in society, which are formed along national lines, such as governments and
educational systems, globalised discourses may take on a national `articulation'.
This has nothing to do with how people behave and think as a group and what
characteristics they have, but it relates to accentuations of discourses which are
deemed to be more common or more acceptable in certain social and cultural
environments, including national ones. Similar articulations could just as eas-
ily exist in other countries or cultural groups, but if these accentuations are
validated through the media in one country and not, or less so, in another,
maybe we can talk about a `national' articulation. The idea of a `Dutch articula-
tion' then became part of my idea of `cultuurtekst'; as a nationally articulated
`flavour' or `taste' of a particular globalised discourse. I use this as one aspect of
my approach to analysing texts in the classroom (see chapter 4).

  An example of Dutch articulation, as I saw it, is found in the Men's Health
text, which I used for the data collection lessons; it drew on a discourse of gen-
der roles and domesticity which, in my view, would not have been acceptable in
Britain, nor indeed now, 10 years later, in the Netherlands itself. This discourse,
exaggerated as it was in places, was made acceptable through the way it was
interwoven with other discourses into a `seamless fabric' (cf. Kress, 1985).

  I know, I am treading on dangerous ground, as, keen as I am to emphasise
complexities of culture, the idea of a Dutch articulation could be perceived to
be an essentialist view. However, I do not see this notion as directly linked to
`a' national culture, but merely as shifting tendencies. This articulation is in
itself continuously changing, shifting and contested. In chapter 4 I describe my
interpretation of the Dutch articulation of the text which I used for my class-
room data.

                          Summary and Conclusion

Central to this chapter is the concept of `culture'. I argued that knowledge based
language courses with a national bias do not provide insight into the com-
plexity of culture, although when taught at an academic level, it can develop a
critical understanding of the target country in terms of querying information
given and understanding changing events in relation to the wider global and
cultural situation. A cultural studies approach to culture in language teach-
ing allows for acknowledging the cultural complexity and indeterminacies of
contemporary life.
                                                                                          Culture Pedagogy 45

  I discussed various views of language and argued that the view of language
as being stable and autonomous, as it is in the structuralist paradigm, leaves
no role for cultural or social context. This view, whilst widely considered to
be outdated in modern language teaching, still, unwittingly, underpins lan-
guage courses.

  Social views of language include the determinist Whorfian hypothesis, which
is frequently quoted in the field of Dutch language teaching, to theorise the
unrefuted relationship between language and culture. Whilst I believe there
is indeed a strong relationship between the two, this is not at the level of `a'
particular language in relation to `a' particular culture, which the Whorfian
hypothesis supposes. Instead, this relationship is occurring at the generic level.

  A more complex view of language and the social world underpins Critical
Language Awareness approaches, which provide a critical stance and deepen
learners' understanding of the processes of producing texts, and the ideologi-
cal forces that have a bearing on this. CLA particularly focuses on how power
is produced and reproduced through language. These approaches could be
applied to modern language teaching, but the critical understanding, which is
occasioned through CLA approaches, should be supplemented with an under-
standing of other cultural parameters, in addition to power.

  Hymes' view of communicative competence provides such a view in con-
sidering a range of parameters, including time, place and social conventions.
However, this view focuses primarily on the context of situation and does not
allow enough space for the wider cultural ideas provided through the context of
culture. Finally I argued that looking at language as discourse, and its meaning
making potential, can help students to develop a deeper understanding of the
complexities of the cultural world in which the language under study is spoken.

  Risager's concepts of a generic and a differential level of language and cul-
ture help in considering how the notion of discourses can be conceptualised in
relation to language teaching. I argued that both levels, the generic and the dif-
ferential are part of language teaching, and the generic level avoids the narrow
one-to-one relationship of the one language, one culture view.

  Looking at language as discourse, Pennycook points us to pedagogies of
`mapping discourses' (2001), which helps to understand the multiplicity of dis-
courses, how discourses cross borders, and develops students' critical aware-
ness of how texts construct truth claims. Despite my focus on the global aspect
of discourses, I also argued, that we cannot deny particular national `accentua-
tions', even if these articulations themselves need to be understood in the con-
text of the complexity of culture in an age of mobility.

  Finally, through discursive mapping students are invited to think about the
relations and interrelations which are part of the process of communicating in
different cultural situations and realities, and ultimately practise them.

  It is this aspect of intercultural communication, which has been implicit in
this chapter, which I will discuss explicitly in chapter 3.

    Being Intercultural Through Texts:
    The Student as Text Ethnographer

                                  Introduction

In the previous chapter I looked at views of the nature of language and the
nature of culture, particularly as applied to the context of language education.
In this chapter I focus on the intercultural aspect of language pedagogy and
develop the idea of being intercultural through text. I argued in chapter 2 that
the relationship between language and culture is very close on a generic level,
but not at a differential level, i.e. there is not a direct and straightforward link
between a particular language and a particular culture. At the generic level,
language and culture come together through discourses. I use discourses in
the way that Foucault uses these; discourses as discursive formations giving
rise to certain routinised ways of talking and thinking about specific topics
or areas of social life. I argued for an approach to language teaching which
is akin to cultural studies, taking account of the notion that language is to a
large extent a social construct which is influenced by its context of use. The
complexity of the interrelationship between language and its context of use
is reflected in discourses, voices and genres; language as `styles for certain
spheres of human communication' (Bakhtin, 1986: 64).

  For that reason, I want to extend the notion of context as used in language
teaching beyond that of merely situational and immediate concerns, to include
a `context of culture' (Kramsch, 1993), as the area where meaning is con-
structed. Context is then not just formed by the situation in which the com-
municative event takes place, but also by what the broader views, ideas, and
taken-for-granted assumptions and meanings are in particular contexts of use.
48 Reading With My Eyes Open

  Cultural studies as a discipline itself can be approached from at least two
different angles, Turner (1992) says: a text-based or a context-based approach.
With the former he refers to the study of texts from literature, film or popular
media. With the latter he refers to Area Studies: courses which cover historical,
social and political aspects. Arguably, the same applies to language teaching. I
will refer to Kramsch's 1993 book, Context and Culture in Language Teaching
and to Byram's notion of Intercultural Communicative Competence as the two
dominant examples of respectively a text-based and a context-based approach,
at the time when I started this study. Both Byram and Kramsch have slightly
rearticulated their positions, but many of their basic tenets are still relevant,
and indeed often referred to in the pedagogic literature.

  Both approaches have taken language teaching out of the mere functional
concerns of communicative language teaching and have advanced language
and culture pedagogy. Both challenge the myth of `the native speaker', and
both use the model of the Intercultural Speaker. I build on both Kramsch's and
Byram's approaches for my own pedagogy. However, I believe we need to fur-
ther problematise the nature of intercultural communication, and acknowledge
its complexity, particularly in multicultural and global societies, without deny-
ing the existence of cultural patterns.

  To do so I will look at Blommaert who, although not a language pedagogue,
puts forward a view of intercultural communication which can be usefully
applied to the debates about language and culture pedagogy. I make use of
Blommaert's insights and relate these to various emerging views in the last few
years of a new conceptualisation of intercultural communication in language
teaching. But, whilst intercultural communication and the inclusion of culture
in the language curriculum is a much-debated issue at a theoretical level (cf
Risager, 2007; Phipps and Guilherme, 2004; Starkey, 1999; Sercu, 2005; Fenoul-
het and Ros i Solé, 2010, to name but a few) in practice, this is still haphazard
in many course books, certainly in Dutch, and is even ignored in influential
language exams.

  My challenge then is to find a model of language teaching as part of a general
language course that contributes to the development of the learner as a critical
intercultural language user. In this chapter I build on the concepts discussed in
the previous chapters which underpin such a pedagogy, and in chapters 5 and
6 I look at how students engaged with this pedagogy.

 Intercultural Communication in Language Teaching

                               Ideas and Practices

The notion of a pedagogy of intercultural communication as part of language
and culture teaching was not formally theorised until the 1990s. Michael Byram
in Britain (c.f. Teaching and Assessing Intercultural Communicative Competence,
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 49

1997) and Claire Kramsch in the US (Context and Culture in Language Teach-
ing, 1993) have been the main reference points in this area. In the last few years
particularly, the idea of intercultural communication as the area where lan-
guage and culture meet in the classroom, has gained momentum and different
strands and views are being developed. My intention here is not to give an
overview of these developments; Risager (2007) offers a comprehensive over-
view and discussion of this field. Here I will set out to what extent Kramsch
and Byram, as well as others, have influenced my perspective on language and
culture teaching and to what extent I deviate from them.

  As I said earlier, I suggest that a cultural studies-oriented language and cul-
ture pedagogy can be approached from two different practical starting points:
a text-based or a context-based approach. Kramsch uses the former, Byram
the latter.

  Both approaches rely on text as well as context in their pedagogy, but the
differences lie in the main focus of the pedagogical tool; a text-based approach
aims to develop an understanding of culture and language through analyzing
texts, whereas a context-based approach focuses on the cultural situations in
which language is used, as well as on a body of knowledge that is taught, dis-
cussed or `discovered'. In a text-based approach the role of cultural knowledge
is less fore grounded; knowledge is conceived of as the contextual knowledge
needed in order to interpret the text. But knowledge is then also conceived
of as meta-knowledge; knowledge of the interpretation process itself and the
concepts needed to talk about the texts. Kramsch uses texts as the starting
point of her pedagogy. Byram on the other hand, represents a socially oriented,
especially an ethnographic, approach through making cultural knowledge an
important part of his pedagogy, following on from the idea of Area Studies
which I discussed in the previous chapter.

                    A Text-based Bakhtinian Approach: Kramsch

It may seem paradoxical to locate Kramsch in a text-based rather than a context-
based pedagogy when her great contribution to language and culture pedagogy
is her conceptualisation of context as a complex structure. But here I refer to
the pedagogical tools which Kramsch uses, which involve looking at texts, in
her case, specifically literary texts. This is not to say that she does not use other
classroom activities: on the contrary, her follow up activities after reading a text
could, for instance, include a role play trying to emulate the `voices' in a text.

  Kramsch's pedagogy has roots in the European liberal humanist philosophy
of education, with a text-based analytical approach and concerns for develop-
ing the intellectual and critical ability of students. In contrast, Byram aligns
himself more with instrumental and pragmatic goals of language and culture
learning, as we will see later, although he takes a much less reductive approach
than the strong instrumentalist paradigm which I criticised in chapter one.
50 Reading With My Eyes Open

  Working in the American context, Kramsch criticises the instrumentally-
oriented action pedagogy, rather than a reflection-oriented one. Its sole con-
cern to get students to talk and write as well and as fluently as possible has, she
argues, trivialised language teaching. In such a syllabus the teaching of culture
has become a controversial issue, as the argument is that depth and breadth of
thought belong to other subjects (1993: 4).

  This instrumental approach is also very dominant in teaching Dutch as a
foreign language, as evidenced by course books and the examination which is
taken worldwide by adult learners of Dutch as a foreign language, Certificaat
Nederlands als Vreemde Taal (CNaVT). As I set out in chapter 1, the instrumen-
tal approach is also becoming more dominant in language teaching at universi-
ties in Britain, particularly since language teaching in the context of language
degrees is increasingly taught through special provision in places such as Lan-
guage Centres. This means language classes are separated from the so-called
`content' classes which are perceived to be intellectually superior.

  I align myself with Kramsch's educational aims. As I argued in chapter 1,
although the main aim of the general language class is to be able to use the
foreign language, there is a developmental and intellectual aspect to language
learning, over and above learning a skill.

  Kramsch's pedagogy of language learning provides the critical and intellec-
tual demands in terms of students needing to reflect on the interrelationship
between text and context. Her pedagogy focuses on the interaction between
linguistics and social structures: teachers should not teach either form or mean-
ing but the interaction between the two, she emphasises. Her approach to lan-
guage and culture pedagogy was new in 1993, and still holds valuable insights.
Kramsch's contribution, I feel, is that she provides a more fully conceptualised
notion of context than that previously offered in the Threshold levels which saw
context only in relation to set phrases tied to certain set situations which occur
in typical everyday pragmatic exchanges of shopping, getting a coffee and so
forth. But also, crucially, she considers a range of theoretical models from lin-
guistics, ethnography of communication, and language philosophy to provide
a view of context, not as a natural given, but as a social construct.

  Context, she suggests, consists of linguistic, situational, cultural, interac-
tional and intertextual dimensions. In describing context as being `shaped
by people in dialogue with one another in a variety of roles and statuses' (p.
67), she marries Hymes's model of communicative competence, Halliday's
notions of context (1989), and Bakhtin's notion of dialogue. Context is then
created by situations, including the classroom situation itself, previous `cul-
tural' knowledge, as well as the ongoing dialogue or interaction between peo-
ple and their socio-cultural environment. Crucially, she adds the dimension
of intertextual context; the relation a text has to other texts, assumptions,
and expectations. The notion of intertext comprises not just the other texts,
assumptions and expectations a `text' may refer to, but also the assumptions,
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 51

expectations and previous experiences of texts that readers themselves are
imbued with.

  Kramsch suggests that in an intercultural communicative event, the engage-
ment between the language user's own cultural context and that of the cul-
tural context of the interlocutor (or the text) creates a new or `third culture'
where the perceptions and knowledges of the interlocutors about their own
and the `other's' culture intermingle. This also happens, she suggests, in a class-
room context, particularly in a multicultural one, where complex relation-
ships take place between the students, the teacher, the foreign language, the
`target' culture and the culture of the learners themselves (ibid. p. 13). In this
`third culture' or `third place' students can express their own meanings and
discover their own identities in a foreign language without being bound by
either their own, or the target speech community's identity (ibid. p. 256). It is
a place where hybridity and plurality flourish. For my initial pedagogy, I inter-
preted the metaphor of `third place' as a space for learning and dialoguing in
the classroom, where a `dialogue' can take place between students themselves,
between students and the teacher and between students and the text under dis-
cussion. Reading the text becomes a `dialogue' with the text, as the text will be
rewritten, reinterpreted and re-accentuated several times during the classroom
discussions. However, the notion of hybridity, which is encompassed in the
idea of `the third place', is one which is also problematic. Whilst the notion of
the third space allows the classroom to be perceived as a place where cultures
intermingle, meet and clash, and where students can become `border crossers',
it also assumes students identify strongly with their `native culture', and that
their intercultural encounters will be with people who identify strongly with
`the target culture'. Kramsch has now distanced herself from the idea of the
`third place', as being too static and not capturing the relations and operations
between multilingual learners (2009: 200). For my own pedagogy, I interpreted
the dialogic space in the classroom as `being intercultural', which means, as
Phipps and Gonzalez say, it is `beyond the captivities of culture' (2004: 168),
where students engage with language and culture in a process which Phipps
and Gonzalez call `languaging'.

  For the purpose of this chapter I will remain with Kramsch's 1993 book,
even though it does not encompass the idea of `being intercultural' as the
messy, indeterminate and fluid struggles with which her later work is con-
cerned. Her pedagogy described in Context and Culture in Language Teach-
ing, influenced my own approach, particularly since it is largely based on the
use of texts. Her approach, partly rooted in the liberal paradigm, is geared to
giving access to a range of speech communities, which then opens up areas
for reflection and discussion and introduces the idea of multivoicedness in
texts (1993: 27).

  Kramsch's contribution to language and culture pedagogy, as I said earlier,
has been inspiring because of the conceptualisation of context as a complex
52 Reading With My Eyes Open

social construct. Moreover, she distances herself from a strong national para-
digm in language teaching. She criticises the link made in many language text-
books by which any speaker of the language is automatically representative of
any national (e.g. German) speech community. It is rarely acknowledged in
language teaching, she says, that even if learners share a common native lan-
guage, `they partake of a multiplicity of `cultures' (1993: 93).

  Risager criticises Kramsch for not systematically analysing the relationship
between linguistic practice (as cultural practice) and cultural context. Risager's
criticism focuses particularly on Kramsch's radical social-constructivist posi-
tion and the fact that Kramsch does not sufficiently distinguish between the
relationship of language and culture at a generic or at a differential level (2007:
108). Risager and I (see my argument in chapter 2) agree with Kramsch that
language and culture relate at a generic level; the cultural meanings and conno-
tations of language utterances which are reflected and refracted by participants
in contexts of use. But, Risager suggests, Kramsch is close to suggesting that
language as text, and cultural context are identical. Risager suggests instead
to make a distinction between the `aspects of the context that are directly cre-
ated via the linguistic interaction, e.g. the immediate social relations, and the
aspects of the context that exist in advance as objective facts and that constitute
the historically specific setting' (2007: 109). This reflects Risager's particular
point of view regarding the relationship between language and culture as well
as the inclusion of cultural knowledge in the curriculum.

  My own criticism with regard to Kramsch's 1993 book is slightly different
from Risager's. For Kramsch, cultural knowledge (which Risager refers to as
`objective facts that constitute the historically specific setting') relates to both
the shared cultural knowledge in the context of production as well as in the
context of reception. Kramsch does not see it as necessary that students need
a coherent body of knowledge of the cultural context, i.e. the national context.
Instead students will need to have the cultural knowledge needed to interpret
the text at hand and to be able to relate the text to both the context of produc-
tion as well as the context of reception in the target speech communities. I
agree with Kramsch on this. I also like the fact she uses text in her pedagogy,
as her concern, like my own, is with meaning making. However, the texts that
Kramsch uses in the classroom tend to be from the literary genre only, whereas
I provide another angle by including mass media texts which are rich in discur-
sive constructions. The latter is not one of Kramsch's concerns. Her aim is not to
critique power and knowledge constructions in text, and her focus tends to be
at the differential level, with particular languages and particularities of culture,
rather than with `discursive formations'. Whilst I feel that the Bakhtinian text-
based approach of Kramsch goes a long way in helping students to understand
the complexity of communication and the complexity of context, it does not
address the discourses and power as they are used in everyday language events.
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 53

                A Social and Context-based Approach: Intercultural
                              Communicative Competence

It is precisely the text-based approach that has attracted criticisms from other
scholars in the field of language and culture teaching. Byram particularly takes
issue with the text-based approach and its focus on literary texts. He posi-
tions himself against the literary tradition in language teaching, because it
does not deal with the real every day world in the target language countries.
This view of culture, as I discussed in chapter 2, is the anthropological one (cf.
Byram, 1989). In this context-based approach the `real world' is the starting
point for the pedagogy, whether in terms of factual knowledge, or commu-
nicative events. Whilst Kramsch and Byram agree on the need for reflection
on the `other'; as well as the learner's `own' culture, for Kramsch this reflection
takes place through thinking and talking about texts, particularly in relation
to how learners interpret the contexts of production and reception. For Byram
this reflection takes place through focusing on and comparing information
about `the' culture, especially relating to everyday life. For Byram then, cultural
knowledge is a very important part of the syllabus, whereas cultural knowl-
edge for Kramsch is incidental; it is part and parcel of discussing the context of
production. As mentioned above, for Kramsch it is not desirable that students
learn a body of coherent cultural knowledge related to `the' foreign or `target'
culture, whilst Byram feels there is a certain body of knowledge that students
learning a foreign language need to possess.

  Byram's work in theorising language and culture pedagogy became enor-
mously influential in Europe as a whole. In fact, culture pedagogy, as Risager
(2007: 92) points out, did not get under way until Byram's work in the 1980s.
He formulated the notion of Intercultural Communicative Competence (ICC for
short) as a model for language teaching and assessment of language learners
which focuses on acquiring linguistic as well as socio-cultural knowledge and
discourse competence (1997: 73). Byram builds on Van Ek's notion of communi-
cative competence which is focused on language rather than culture. To under-
stand people of other national groups, Byram notes, we cannot only depend
on `communicative competence'; learners also `need to acquire the ability to
comprehend cultural differences and cultural relativity' (1992: 165). Byram sees
language and culture learning as clearly consisting of a language and a culture
element, but these generally remain, unlike with Kramsch, separate.

  One of the important new aspects of Intercultural Communicative Compe-
tence is that learners not only need to learn about the foreign culture, but that
they also need to relate this to their own cultural experiences. Byram based
the idea of Intercultural Communicative Competence on the concept of the
Intercultural Speaker which he developed with Zarate as part of the work they
undertook for the Council of Europe with the project Language Learning for
European Citizenship (1997). The aim of language teaching is not for language
54 Reading With My Eyes Open

learners to try and emulate `the' native speaker, but to become `intercultural
speakers'. The notion of the Intercultural Speaker has become a widely accepted
goal of language teaching and has replaced the previously used target aim of
`near-native competence' at most (except for the most traditional) Higher Edu-
cation Institutions. The intercultural speaker is `someone who has an ability to
interact with `others', to accept other perspectives and perceptions of the world,
to mediate between different perspectives, to be conscious of their evaluations
of difference.' (Byram et. al. 2001: 5).

  Intercultural communicative competence (ICC) is to a large extent formu-
lated as a set of competences. These are a range of skills and knowledges
that can be taught as well as assessed, which Byram called the 5 savoirs. The
savoirs present a complex picture of the skills needed to be a competent inter-
cultural speaker, including (socio-)linguistic skills, cultural knowledge and
a focus on intercultural attitudes, and being prepared to relativise one's own
values, beliefs and behaviour.

  Promisingly, the savoirs also include what Byram calls, `critical cultural
awareness' (savoir s'engager). With this Byram means that learners can turn
their attention to their own beliefs and belongings, and in doing so become
aware of their own (often unconscious) cultural assumptions. He also intro-
duces a political and critical element to language teaching. The learners, Byram
(1997: 20) says `can also be encouraged to identify the ways in which particular
cultural practices and beliefs maintain the social positions and power of par-
ticular groups. The analysis can become critical.'

  I agree with Byram's emphasis on the context of everyday culture and reflect-
ing upon one's own preconceptions in cultural exchanges. This has developed
into the inclusion of self-reflection activities and ethnography in language
teaching (cf. Byram and Fleming, 1998) and preparing students for residencies
abroad, such as the `The Intercultural Project' at Lancaster University (http://
www.lancs.ac.uk/users/interculture/subproj4.htm) and the Ealing Ethnogra-
phy Research Project developed at Thames Valley University (Roberts et.al.
2001). It is particularly the development of critical awareness and ethnography,
which I feel is very beneficial for language learners, because the methodology
of ethnography helps learners to become intercultural.

  Byram's notion of Intercultural Communicative Competence then is very
helpful in addressing learners' engagement with the complexities of everyday
cultural contexts. The model provides a clear method for developing a range
of competences. However, this approach is not sufficient on its own to fully
address areas of criticality and super-complexity. Its emphasis is on encounters
between cultures by reflecting on comparisons between `the target culture' and
the learners' own, and which, despite Byram's emphasis on differences within
cultures, can easily lead to assuming relatively fixed notions of these `cultures'.
And whilst the Intercultural Speaker has an open attitude towards the cultural
other, she, as Ros i Solé (2013) points out, does not move in and out of, and in
between different cultures. Nevertheless, it is particularly Byram's fifth savoir,
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 55

`critical cultural awareness', which provides most insights for culture pedagogy
based on views of culture as complex. Guilherme developed the idea of critical
cultural awareness to focus on just that.

       Guilherme's Citizenship Agenda: The Critical Intercultural Speaker

Guilherme developed a pedagogical and philosophical framework as a possible
formulation of a critical approach to intercultural language learning which is a
more complex and theoretical extension of Byram's notion of critical cultural
awareness. She locates this pedagogy, like Starkey (cf. 1999, 2010) within the
area of citizenship education. Being critical in this approach means `question-
ing dominant cultural patterns and seeking the reasons which lead to these pat-
terns being blindly accepted and unquestioned' (2002: 19). Guilherme borrows
from Giroux's (1992) notion of `border pedagogy' in which critical reflection
is an important element. Referring to Barnett (1997), who saw reflection as
`meta-critique', she explains that in order to question dominant patterns one
has to take a critical perspective towards one's own knowledge and social con-
text, as well as being critical in trying to inhabit someone else's cognitive per-
spective. Critical reflection is then a vital element in developing cultural aware-
ness as, when reflecting on cultural differences, it will help to make explicit
how one justifies one's own beliefs and actions, as well as how these beliefs
and actions might be perceived by the other, Guilherme states (2002: 40). She
continues: `From this perspective, reflection-in-action allows for the coming
into consciousness of factors that interact in a cross-cultural event such as the
unconscious concepts and rules or routine responses that are taken for granted
by each side as well as the emotional impetus that drives the intercultural
encounter (ibid).' In her critical approach to intercultural language learning,
Guilherme attempts to respond to the contemporary complex realities of bor-
der crossings, of multiculturalism and hybridity. Her `border pedagogy' rejects
a Eurocentric approach towards any culture and favours the inclusion of non-
European cultures in curriculum content. It perceives the cultural subject as
multifaceted, ever-changing, and in relation to a complex, also evolving soci-
ety (Guilherme, 2002: 43). Border pedagogy then does not only involve the
acknowledgement of facts, that is, the input of geographical, historical, social
or political information. `It should focus on the complexity of hidden mean-
ings, of underlying values, and how these articulate with the micro- and macro-
contexts they integrate (ibid:45).' Guilherme takes a transnational perspective
in formulating the notion of the `critical intercultural speaker' (her emphasis).
The critical intercultural speaker, she states (ibid: 126, 127) has to problema-
tise the concepts of nationality and ethnicity, both in terms of their origin and
their present developments. She must be aware that the development of iden-
tities involves a `constant negotiation between remembering and forgetting,
idiosyncracies and common interests'. Guilherme looks towards Giroux again
56 Reading With My Eyes Open

who states that the pedagogical goal is not to have students exercise rigorous
analytical skills in order to arrive at the right answer but to have a better under-
standing of what the codes are that organise different meanings and interests in
particular configurations of knowledge and power (Guilherme quoting Giroux,
2002: 46). By reflecting on these configurations, students studying a foreign
culture should be able to translate them into their own contexts. `The meanings
and interests of the Other will echo their own thoughts and feelings and, by
becoming critically aware of them, students will identify and clarify their own
struggles, points of view, predisposition which are likely to help them make
more enlightened choices' (ibid).

  Guilherme's framework offers a multi-perspective approach as she borrows
from modernist theories, such as Critical Theory and Critical Pedagogy, and
from postmodernist approaches. In this, there are similarities with my own
pedagogy that I describe in chapter 4, as being located in different paradigms
of modernist and postmodernist critique, although as I have mentioned before,
there was an incommensurable element to my own multi-perspective approach.
Risager (2007: 151) critiques Guilherme precisely for this. On the one hand
she seems to refer to a language-nation derived concept of culture, and on
the other hand, she formulates a language independent conception based on
`border-crossing', `hybridity' and `diversity. My own feeling is that Guilherme's
thoroughly theorised model has much to offer for considering practical peda-
gogies for the critical intercultural language user. Her focus is on citizenship,
rather than on actual language and texts, and thus functions more as a theoreti-
cal consideration than a practical example. However, Guilherme's theoretical
considerations in relation to problematising the national view and the idea of
stable identities resonates with my own pedagogy.

  I now want to make a slight detour from the discussion about how language
and culture pedagogy can do justice to the complexity of this relationship
and develop learners as critical intercultural speakers, and look at how inter-
cultural communication has been conceptualised in the discipline of inter-
cultural communication itself. I shall then draw on this for an application to
language pedagogy.

       Three Views of the Study of Intercultural Communication

The study of intercultural communication (ICC) as a disciplinary study in its
own right does not seem to have had a strong influence on language teaching.
As I have set out in chapter 2, other theories have been brought to bear upon
language teaching. However, I believe that it is worthwhile to take a brief look at
different views in use in the discipline of `intercultural communication', because
this disciplinary area is focused on actual communication - `what happens
when people engage in an exchange of meaningful semiotic symbols' (Blom-
maert, 1998: 1). There are various historical overviews of this area of study,
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 57

but I will use a talk given by Blommaert (1998) which charts three views of
intercultural communication with different ideological underpinnings. Whilst
Blommaert charts these views, by his own admission, in a sketchy manner, it
is relevant for my purpose, precisely because he takes an approach which con-
centrates on how `culture' affects, or is seen to affect, speech styles. And, whilst
my research is not about speech styles as such, it is about language and culture
connecting in everyday speech in everyday communicative events.

                                 Culture and Difference

The first model which Blommaert highlights is a strongly essentialist one. He
points to a large body of work which shares the theoretical premise that mod-
ern nations have dominant national character traits which can be revealed by
measurable data. Cultures in this model are described as essential values and
practices and are therefore seen in terms of their difference from one another.
This model is particularly dominant in the area of ICC studies (intercultural
communication) for business purposes (cf. Pinto, 1990; Hofstede, 1994). Cul-
ture in this model is seen only in terms of behaviour or as a set of fixed values
and beliefs. Culture is then viewed as a problem that can lead to misunder-
standings: culture as a problem to be overcome. As Hofstede said on his web-
site in 2010, `cultural differences are a nuisance at best and often a disaster',
although this statement has now disappeared from the website in question.

  It is undoubtedly the case that in order to make sense of the multitude of
ideas, impressions, and information that we experience in our everyday life,
humans need to order these impressions into categories. To be fair to the body
of work produced in the business related field, this work is not produced in the
context of education with its developmental and intellectual aims that I argued
for in chapter 1, but in the context of training with its instrumental aims. The
aim is not to understand the complexities of the world, or to be critical but
to understand behaviour which would otherwise be `puzzling or unacceptable'
(Verluyten, 2000: 340 ) or lead to `misunderstanding, miscommunication and
mismanagement, of which damage to business and personal interest can be
the result' (Pinto quoted by Blommaert, (1998: 2)). And with the increasing
emphasis on instrumentalism in language teaching in Higher Education, it is
prudent to be alert to these argumentations which are borne out of commer-
cial self-interest. The problem with the difference view of ICC is precisely the
simplification of a complex social and cultural world to a coherent, manageable
set of fixed ideas. As I argued in my previous chapter, language teaching should
help students to recognise the complexity of the world and not focus on ideas
that lead to stereotyping.

  Blommaert strongly criticises the essentialised `difference' model, not only
because this model posits a simplified notion of culture, but more problemati-
cally still, because this model draws a direct and simplified link between `culture'
58 Reading With My Eyes Open

and communication. Kumaravadivelu (2007: 213) quotes Hall, who developed
the first courses in `intercultural communication' for American diplomats, as
having declared unequivocally that `culture is communication and communi-
cation is culture' (Hall, 1959: 186). The model assumes that the way that people
communicate is related to `their' culture, frequently interpreted as a national
culture, rather than to a range of other social, political or individual factors. As
referred to in chapter 2, seeing a national culture in terms of shared values and
norms begs the question: are these values shared by everyone all the time? It
also assumes that nationality and identity are natural givens, rather than con-
structions which are perpetuated through everyday conceptualizations of the
nation, such as in weather reports, what Billig (1995) called `banal nationalism'.
Nationality does not dictate a particular communicative style. At the very most,
people's nationality or ethnic identity may suggest tendencies; the `possibility of
ethnic or cultural marking in communicative behaviour [...], but it in no way
imposes ethnic or cultural characteristics onto the communicative behaviour
a priori.' (my emphasis). Moreover, presenting intercultural communication as
dealing with the `other' who has his/her own set of different values and behav-
ioral styles that follow on from that, leads to a `massive overestimation of the
degree of and the nature of difference in speech styles' (Blommaert, 1998: 5).

  Whilst he criticises the essentialised model of difference as represented by
intercultural consultants such as Pinto and Hofstede and numerous others,
Blommaert also criticizes the cultural relativist idea of what he calls horizontal
stratification. Differences in terms of differentials such as age, nationality, eth-
nicity, gender, class, are seen as just existing on an equal par with one another.
We might like to think, Blommaert says, that all languages, cultures, all groups,
in fact all people are equal, but in reality they are not. And it makes no sense to
talk about cultural differences as if they are all equivalent. Vertical models of
differences which look at power differentials, he argues, are more in line with
reality. An approach to ICC which has the potential to take account of the rel-
evance of power differences in roles and status is that of ethnography.

                    Ethnographic Approaches to Communication

To illustrate this particular model of intercultural communication, Blommaert
refers to work by Gumperz and Hymes. The importance of this model, he says,
is 1) that it recognizes the complexity of the relationship between culture and
communication, and that 2) differences in communication in this model are
not marked by national culture, but, critically, by differences in the context in
which communications take place. Nationality is only one of the factors in that
context of situation. Gumperz' contribution to the study of intercultural com-
munication, Blommaert says, is on the one hand that he highlights that it is
not so much `culture' in the sense of values and norms which has an effect on
communication, but instead `communicative repertoires', such as conventions,
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 59

speech styles and narrative patterns. These repertoires are formed by `traditions'
such as those of class and ethnicity which have become part of the language;
`we don't just use `a' national language, like Dutch or German, but instead we
always use a variety of `a' language; `a genre, a speech style, a type of interaction'.
People identify themselves on the basis of such speech styles, which often relate
to social traditions of class, gender, ethnicity etc. An important aspect of this is
that these traditions and identities cannot be separated from issues of power.
It makes a huge difference, Blommaert indicates, who the dominant party is in
a particular interaction, whether, for instance, the interlocutor is the immigra-
tion officer or the asylum seeker for instance.

  The all important role of a wider context means we cannot predict what
will happen in an intercultural exchange purely based on someone's `culture',
whether national or otherwise, as the horizontal difference view holds. There
are too many factors in different contexts at play. Moreover, we cannot predict
what will happen in such an exchange; people might mutually adapt to one
another's speech styles, both or either participant may sacrifice or exaggerate
cultural conventions. In fact, more often than not, Blommaert says, `ethnically'
or `culturally' marked aspects of communication are influenced by emotional
factors such as feelings of frustration, anger or powerlessness. In other words,
there is no fixed link between certain speech conventions and certain cultural
groups; the reality of communication is too complex.

  Paradoxically, the model of ethnography of communication was the main
inspiration for communicative language teaching, but it was interpreted in a
reductive manner, as I discussed in previous chapters, so that the principles of
this model, which Blommaert describes as allowing for nuanced analyses of
communicative events, were almost completely lost.

  Incidentally, even though Gumperz carried out important work in this con-
text by showing that a range of social factors influence communicative styles,
including the power difference between interlocutors, when Gumperz applied
his work pedagogically in a training context in `Crosstalk' (1979), he largely
ignored the notion of power. In Crosstalk Gumperz does exactly what Blom-
maert criticizes; he makes the trainees aware of the direct link between par-
ticular cultures and particular speech conventions. This highlights the issue of
the training context, where pedagogy is more neatly organised and focuses on
a limited, clearly defined area, where there generally is no room for reflection
and complexity.

  Whilst Gumperz, as Blommaert said, noted the role of power between partic-
ipants in a communicative exchange, Hymes (1996) showed another aspect of
power in intercultural relations; language varieties themselves are not neutrally
valued, as some of these varieties are seen to be `better' than others. Particular
language varieties or even languages tend to be associated with certain attrib-
utes, particularly status, which immediately imposes a power structure on the
interaction. But, apart from different hierarchical relations, what is important
in relation to intercultural communication, is that power legitimises certain
60 Reading With My Eyes Open

views over others, it legitimises certain languages and certain language varieties
over others. And as language or language variety tend to be associated with a
particular social group, the question becomes as Blommaert states, `whose cul-
ture is being used in intercultural communication?', which we could paraphrase
as `whose version of reality counts'? The differences which occur between par-
ticipants from different cultural backgrounds are not neutral. The many inter-
cultural communication courses in a business context convey a very specific
global form of intercultural communication where the language of interaction
is almost always English and the participants are generally highly educated.
But where intercultural communication involves a meeting of people who are
members of different social groups such as in immigration contexts, these
meetings take place in contexts where one interlocutor has more status and
power than the other. Another factor then is the larger context of interethnic
relations in that area or at that historical point of time and, I would suggest, the
discourses which are in operation around otherness which would inform the
assumptions and stereotypes which are held. When these discourses become
dominant, such as `the Clash of Civilisations' (Huntington, 1998), they become
powerful as supposed `truths'.

  What is relevant to the foreign language teacher in this work is the notion that
in intercultural communication we do not just deal with a national language,
but that if we want to prepare our students for real intercultural exchanges we
must make our students aware of language varieties, discourses, register, genre
which, as Bakhtin showed, reference socially charged contexts. Or to use Ris-
ager's terms (2007), we should not just think about language and culture at the
differential, but also at the generic level. And as Blommaert shows, it is not just
being aware of the existence of these varieties, but also the value or status which
they are afforded in certain contexts and in relation to other language varie-
ties or genres. But intercultural communication is still more complex than that
and, as Blommaert points out, `difference is not always there, can appear in one
context one time and not another time, and is also `caught in patterns of social
evaluation' (1998: 11).

                         Crossing Ethno-linguistic Boundaries

The third view that Blommaert identifies in the study of intercultural commu-
nication allows for difference and complexity in a much greater sense. Inter-
cultural communication cannot be seen without taking account of the social
dynamics amongst people within communicative events. Blommaert uses
Rampton's (1995) study as the prime example of this view and argues that this
could be a way forward to studying examples of intercultural communication.
Rampton showed how young adolescents in urban areas in Britain did not stick
to clear ethnic boundaries when using language associated with a particular
ethnic descent. Instead they performed regular `language crossing', switching
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 61

in and out of ethnically marked varieties of English when communicating with
friends from different ethnic groups or in different social settings. Ethnic iden-
tities were being manipulated and negotiated; the study showed `how identities
can be picked up, dropped, altered, combined and so on, in ways that defeat
any form of simplism or singularity'. Rampton also concluded that the differ-
ent speech varieties were not associated with one specific context of use, but
were sometimes used for even conflicting purposes, whether as a sign of resist-
ance, an expression of solidarity, or showing a recognition of prestige. Culture
for these adolescents then, Blommaert says, serves as a set of resources which
partly operates automatically, but can also be strategically activated in different
circumstances and for different purposes.

  This view of intercultural communication which Blommaert suggests here as
a step forward in thinking about interculturality, is a marked change from the
`difference' view; not only does it not primarily focus on a national culture, it
also emphasises that people move in and out of various forms of cultural sym-
bolic behaviour, in terms of using different language varieties or genres, and
indeed by feeling different allegiances. Moreover, it also shows that the same
behaviour or language can be utilised for completely different purposes. The
idea of context is made much more complex precisely because it allows for the
use of conflicting discourses and indeterminacies.

  There is a parallel in the boundary crossing model with thinking about iden-
tity and cultural complexity. Our sense of `belongings' is formed by the affili-
ations to the various roles, relationships and memberships of `communities of
practice' people feel they are part of, as Kumaravadivelu (2008) says. None of
these communities are fixed and stable entities in themselves. Instead they are
complex mixtures of `pleasure and pain', of `trust and suspicion', of `friendship
and hatred' as Kumaravadivelu says, quoting Wenger. How these complexities
of the different realities can overlap, was illustrated by Baumann in an ethno-
graphic study of Southall, a very diverse and multicultural area in London. `The
vast majority of all adult Southallians saw themselves as members of several
communities', each shifting and potentially conflicting with one another. `The
same person could speak and act as a member of the Muslim community in
one context, in another take sides against other Muslims as a member of a Paki-
stani community, and in a third count himself part of the Punjabi community
that excluded other Muslims, but included Hindus, Sikhs and even Christians'
(Baumann, 1996).

             Significance of the Boundary Crossing Model for
                               Language Teaching

The strength of Blommaert's model, or view on intercultural communication, is
that it acknowledges that context is complex and there is not a straightforward
link between one particular context, especially not a national one, and par-
62 Reading With My Eyes Open

ticular speech styles. The model is a useful way of thinking about intercultural
communication in the context of language teaching. Even though I will not use
the concept of code switching in a linguistic sense for this study, the idea of
culture as a set of resources (linguistic and otherwise) that people can pick and
choose from to utilise, resist and create new meanings, I think is very relevant
for critical intercultural communication in language teaching. Blommaert's
model does not give us the answers we need in terms of pedagogy and whether
we should opt for a context or text-based approach, or what to include in a
language teaching syllabus. Moreover, Blommaert seems to refer specifically
to speech. We cannot, in short, apply his views directly to language teaching,
but his models provide a way of thinking about intercultural communication
which is important for us as teachers. His view of culture as `resources' to draw
upon bears similarities with Holliday's view (2004: 12).

  The fact that choosing from these resources operates, not just on an uncon-
scious, but also on a strategic level, is an important point. If people use these
resources partly strategically on an everyday basis, they become more easily
available for conscious reflection, which can be used in the language class.

  The notion of switching and mixing language styles and varieties depending
on a range of complex factors with regard to the social context, as well as factors
outside the social arena such as emotions, can be made central to language and
culture pedagogy. Such a pedagogy would focus on difference in terms of styles
and discourses and look at the embedded ideologies and values, see context as
influenced by a complex set of factors, focus on making learners take account
of who they address and direct their communications specifically to their audi-
ence. This addressivity - `the quality of turning to someone', as Bakhtin (1996
(1986): 99) so aptly calls it, comes into play particularly in writing, as students
have more time for reflection on their language output. But an awareness of
varieties of styles and discourses, and indeed how the reader is addressed, also
helps students to delve deeper into text and go beyond the content of the text.

  Cultural meanings are then created through discourses; structures of mean-
ing which also hold in Bakhtin's words a `stylistic aura' which reflect the ideol-
ogy pertaining to that discourse. But these cultural meanings are often global.
Areas of human activity are after all not limited to a particular national culture.
For the language teacher who frequently is expected to teach the national para-
digm, this provides a dilemma.

            Dilemmas of Intercultural Communication in the
                              Language Classroom

One of the dilemmas of intercultural communication for the language teacher
is that on the one hand we want to emphasise the complexity and diversity of
cultural environments that we are looking at in the classroom, and at the same
time we cannot deny that certain tendencies and cultural patterns exist. Con-
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 63

ceptualising culture within a pluriform society, with different sets of values,
lifestyles, genders, political views and so on, can also easily fall prey to a simi-
lar essentialising of, what Holliday calls, `small cultures' (2004: 63); describing
such subcultures as consisting of people sharing a set of collective character-
istics. This could still lead to learners thinking of culture or subculture as a
fixed and bounded entity. It would be futile to think there are no differences
between the way people live or make sense of their world, whether between
different countries or groups within a country. But the most important thing is
to recognise these patterns as tendencies which may be hard to pin down; with
vague and fluid boundaries. As Blommaert said: the world is indeed full of dif-
ferences, but these differences are not always there, or are not always the same,
and they are partly determined by unequal power relations (1998: 11).

  As I set out in the previous chapter, foreign language teaching has had a
take on culture (and on language) using somewhat stereotypical and stable
notions of a national culture. This is understandable to a degree, because,
despite the fact we have all become part of a `larger global tribe' (Appiah,
2006), national, and indeed sub-national realities, even as `imagined com-
munities' (Anderson, 1983), remain important in how people describe their
complex cultural identities and subjectivities, as Holliday (2011) showed. In
his study on this topic, he noted that nation is an `undeniable powerful source
of identity, security and belonging, but it is an external one which may be in
conflict with more personal cultural realities'. We can also see this in books
which take a comical look at a national culture and focus on stable notions of
a culture, e.g `The Undutchables' (White and Boucke, 2006). These books are
so popular and seductive precisely because the information they contain is
so easily recognisable; we tend to recognise what we already know as it slots
so easily into our existing mental schema. Coleman (1996) pointed out that
students of German who spent time in Germany as part of their Residence
Abroad scheme came back with all their ideas and stereotypes of Germany
and the Germans confirmed.

  In a recent survey of Dutch language teachers at Institutions for Higher Edu-
cation worldwide, it was found that many teachers recognised the dilemma of
not wanting to stereotype, yet felt that cultural information as part of language
teaching is frequently about behaviour as part of a national culture. Teachers
opted for giving cultural information accompanied with the warning: this is a
generalisation, but nevertheless there is a core of truth in it (Rossum and Vis-
mans, 2006).

  I would like to suggest that the `kernal of truth' view can be just as limiting as
the stereotypical view, as it pretends to recognise complexity, but still focuses
on essential meanings. We need knowledge about another culture, but that
knowledge must be looked at critically and must be placed in context. The ker-
nal of truth view is dangerous because it perpetuates the idea of fixed cultures.

  I will now turn to the implications for the classroom.
64 Reading With My Eyes Open

       Towards a New Conceptualisation of Interculturality in the
                              Language Classroom

A more useful way of conceiving of interculturality in the classroom, which
allows for complexity, a level of fluidity, individual agency is the notion of being
intercultural, put forward by Phipps and Gonzalez (2004), where `being' is
emphasised over `knowledge'. They argue that the central activity of modern
languages degrees should be `languaging', `being intercultural', and `living with
supercomplexity' (p 8). The key element in the process of being intercultural
is that of `languaging'. In `languaging' the emphasis is on `real' communication
and dialogue in the classroom rather than on artificial language tasks; it is `liv-
ing in and through the language' (p.111). `Being intercultural' means under-
standing another world, which takes place through the process of dialoguing
with others and being part of another cultural group. Crucially, this process can
only take place from a position where students challenge their world and `let it
be enriched by others' (p. 27). The notion of `intercultural being', as conceptual-
ised by Phipps and Gonzalez, focuses on engaging with the other, on processes
and on critical reflection. Being intercultural is more than an attitude of how
you feel towards other countries as Byram's notion of ICC holds. `It is more
profoundly about how one lives with and responds to difference and diversity.
[....] It is about living out the network of diverse human relationships - not just
abroad, but down the road as well' (p.115).

  `Being intercultural' is not about getting information about the other culture,
but it is about engaging with it, both from `within' to get a sense of what the
other thinks, feels and does, and from a position of real critical understanding.
Phipps and Gonzalez argue for not just the insertion of critical reflection as part
of the language curriculum (p. 92), but the active engagement which they call
`critical being'. Learning is about `testing and exploring ideas in and against
reality, and then reflecting upon the process' (p. 124). This combination of the
experiential and intellectual is found in the practice of ethnography as a way
of understanding the cultural and social practices of a (cultural) group. But,
Phipps and Gonzalez argue, ethnography is more than a tool to enable learn-
ers to develop into intercultural beings. It is about `people meeting in human
encounters and in ways which may change the way they see the world' (p.125).

  I interpret the notion of `being intercultural' as taking the learner conceptu-
ally out of the classroom, and into the real world. It is an intellectual engage-
ment with the real world. It may consist of `real' dialogues with fellow students,
or even other speakers of the language, but the notion can also be extended to
engaging with written texts as if in `dialogue'; relating what is read explicitly
to one's own experiences and understandings and to keep on querying these.
Indeed in chapter 5 I explore how students, when testing their ideas against
their experienced `realities', made them realise the positioning of the text we
discussed.
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 65

             Ethnography as a Method of Being Intercultural

Ethnography for language learners, even though it hasn't yet made its way into
many syllabi at university language departments, has nevertheless attracted
increasing interest in the last few years as an exciting way to combine the intel-
lectual and experiential aspects of engaging with the other culture. The aim
of ethnography is twofold: on the one hand it encourages the learner to rec-
ognise the cultural in his/her everyday life and ideas by `making the familiar
strange'. On the other hand the learner is encouraged to try and understand the
`strange' from within its own perspective. The learner will then start to recog-
nise that what previously seemed natural, was actually culturally constructed.
Of course, it is impossible ever to see things from the perspective of the other.
We will always see the world through the filter of our own experiences. An
important aspect of ethnography is to realise that what you see and observe,
is coloured through your own experiences, your own cultural and social back-
ground, and ideas and assumptions, your own ethnocentricity. But, even with
that knowledge, we can never truly know what phenomena, ideas, objects, cus-
toms, behaviour, everyday life events actually `mean' for the `other'. We cannot
observe neutrally. Every observation will always have what Hermans (2007:
147) calls a `blind spot', because every observation can be interpreted only from
the context of those that do the observation.

  The main technique of ethnography is creating `thick descriptions': by giving
extremely detailed accounts of what can be observed, students discover things
which might otherwise have escaped their attention or would have been taken
for granted. But thick descriptions involve reflection on one's own observation
and response to what is observed at the same time. Doing ethnography then is
to question the sources of evidence presented and thereby challenge assump-
tions and stereotypes (Barro et.al., 1998: 76-97).

  Probably the first ethnographic project of its kind for language learners was
the Ealing Project, in which students first made the familiar strange through
writing `home ethnographies' before applying this to a closely observed eth-
nographic project during their year abroad (Roberts, et.al., 2001). This project,
though undertaken by language learners in the context of their modern lan-
guages degree and as preparation for their residency abroad, is not an actual
language class, but more a cultural studies class.

  Because its focus is on `lived experience' and `culture as practice' ethnogra-
phy is very suitable for study abroad. Indeed, I adopted and adapted the Ealing
Project in a similar way and incorporated it in a cultural studies course, which
prepares student for doing their ethnographic year abroad project. But, ethno-
graphic projects have also been used in the language classroom itself. Morgan
and Cain (2000), for example, undertook a collaborative project between two
schools; a French class at a school in England and an English class at a school in
France. The aim of the project was to let pupils think about their own culture as
66 Reading With My Eyes Open

well as that of the other group, seen from the `other's' perspective. To this aim
pupils were asked to represent aspects of their `own culture' around the theme
of `Law and Order'. Students from each class worked in small groups to create
cultural material for the partner class. In doing so they had to be aware of what
was specifically English or French about the topic, but more importantly, they
had to think about the communicative needs of the partner class, both in con-
tent and language use. By looking at the material the partner class produced,
pupils could discuss and compare the similarities and differences. Whilst it may
be said that this approach still did not encourage a non-essentialist attitude to
the other culture, and was still located within a national paradigm, pupils were
encouraged to think about the perspective of the other; to imagine how others
might feel and how they might engage with information given to them.

  Phipps and Gonzalez take integrating ethnography in the classroom prob-
ably furthest. One of the projects that Phipps worked on with her students was
a project about `rubbish' (Phipps and Gonzalez, 2004: 126). Students collected
data and interviewed Germans living in Glasgow about environmentalism. This
integrated project work outside, in the `real world', with language work inside
the classroom. This is an exciting initiative which includes project work as part
of classroom work and makes a direct, experiential link between everyday
experienced culture. Moreover, by interviewing Germans living in Scotland, a
narrow national focus is avoided. I feel that projects such as these point the way
forward to more ethnographic real world experiences, and should be explored
further in language teaching. However, in my own pedagogy I adopted not a
project approach, but I aimed to include ethnography as part of the general
pedagogic activities in the classroom. This became a text-based approach using
principles of ethnography. I will set this out below.

                                Text Ethnography

Ethnography is well suited to an intercultural approach to language teaching
because of the opportunities it affords for being reflexive about one's own cul-
tural environments and the focus on querying the `taken for granted', as well
as `stepping into the shoes of others', although care needs to be taken not to
see these cultural environments as fixed. But ethnography can be integrated
further in the language classroom, I believe, than by just being the focus of
separate projects, as in the Morgan and Cain study. Ethnography could also be
usefully applied to looking at texts, thereby integrating text and context. Texts
are after all a natural focus for the language and culture classroom. Moreover
language always happens as text (Kress, 1985), and texts reflect and reconstruct
specific instances of culture.

  An ethnographic approach to text helps students to recognise how culture
underpins texts, to query the taken-for-granted and to see how language and
culture interrelate. This is a process of discursive mapping. However, an eth-
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 67

nographic approach also looks at the role students have to play in their inter-
pretation. Looking in an ethnographic way at texts then, allows us to make the
`familiar strange', and the strange familiar. Being intercultural through text then
can be a pedagogy of an integrated look at language and culture which takes
account of the complexity of context, interculturality and criticality. But, before
we can discuss what it means to be intercultural through texts, we first need to
look at what we mean by `text', which I will do below. These views of text are
similar, but not the same, as the views of language which I discussed in the
previous chapter: views of the liberal humanist perspective; of a structuralist
perspective; and text as a semiotic encounter where text and reader `meet' to
create meaning.

                              Texts

                 Ways That Text Has Been Conceptualised

For the purposes of this study, I am looking at texts as `written' texts. Whereas
my pedagogy sees text in a wider range as `transmitters of meaning' which
could also be visual and/or aural texts, I focus particularly on written text in
the empirical part of this study. During the lessons which form the empirical
part of this study (see chapter 5), I tried to alert the class, when discussing a
particular text, to the extra layer of meaning added by the illustrations and page
layout. However, this discussion did not generate illuminating data, and I do
not include the multimodality of text in my discussion below.

  Historically, the concept of text has been conceived in different ways within
language teaching. I will briefly set out traditional views of text, before focus-
ing on the conceptualisation of text which is the core of my pedagogy, i.e. that
of `cultuurtekst'.

  In the liberal humanist educational tradition, which I discussed in chapter 1,
text itself was not an issue for theorizing. Text is a written product, and not a
process of communication. A product, moreover, which was the result of intel-
lectual thought and ideas. The most important attribute of a text is the content
which, in `a good text' is generated through solid thinking and expressed in
good writing. The quality of these thoughts is reflected in the actual quality of
the language, the structure of the text and the strength of the argumentation.
As the 19th century educationalist Blair, cited by Emig, said, the aim was for
writers to produce products of moral superiority and rationality: `embarrassed,
obscure and feeble sentences are generally, if not always, the result of embar-
rassed, obscure and feeble thought' (Emig, 1983: 7).

  Texts in this traditional view are wholly the responsibility of the individual
writer, regardless of whether anyone else, such as an editor could have had a
role to play in the writing. The writer is thus unproblematised. The reader on
the other hand has no role to play in the interpretation of the text, except, per-
68 Reading With My Eyes Open

haps, to appreciate (and imitate in the case of learning to write) the quality of
the text. The assumption then is that quality is not subjective, but objective,
there is an agreed notion of `the good text'. Moreover, it is a product which
contains a stable meaning.

  This view of text is now generally no longer held in the academic world, but
it survives as a `common sense' assumption amongst many people, as evidenced
by newspaper discussions bemoaning the declining quality of writing of school
pupils in the subject of English. As a result the notion of a `good text' has an
enduring appeal with (some) students, as I found out when analysing my data
(see chapter 6).

  The second view of text which I discuss here, is the structuralist view of
text. This view, whilst less concerned with the idea of `the good text', does also
emphasise the autonomy of the text. But in contrast with a liberal humanist
educational view, the emphasis shifts towards a more prominent role for the
reader in `extracting' meaning from texts (Wallace, 2003: 15). This view corre-
lates with the view of communication put forward by de Saussure, the `speech-
circuit', which as Daniel Chandler says (2002: 176) can be seen as an early form
of the transmission model of communication; the Shannon-Weaver model
(1949). The latter sees communication as sending a message from person A
(the sender) to person B (the addressee) as if it were a package. I would suggest
that, again, this is the common sense idea of communication that most people,
including our students would hold. This idea of communication as `sending a
message' is subsumed in much of (Dutch) language teaching practice, both in
reading and writing tasks. Reading in foreign language classes then frequently
consists mainly of comprehension tasks and activities, which typically include
multiple choice tasks, or comprehension questions regarding writer intention
or the meaning contained in the text as if these were unproblematic constructs.

  Later versions of the structuralist model allow for a more complex idea of
communication and crucially include the notion of context. This model also
allows for a view of text beyond the written product alone. The text can thus be
anything that `sends a message', whether a conversation, a visual image or even
a form of behaviour of dress. As such this model allows not only for a much
broader view of text, but also the emphasis in communication has shifted from
the producer of text to the text itself.

  A more interactional version of the structuralist encoding and decoding view
of communication, is that espoused by Widdowson (and others) in relation to
language teaching, which grants a greater role to the reader and to the role of
context than the traditional views based on the Shannon-Weaver model. For
Widdowson reading is not just a matter of transferring information from the
author to the reader, but is instead a process of communication; the reader is
active in the decoding process, engaging his or her prior knowledge, experi-
ences and ideas. Encoding, or writing, is not just a formulation of messages,
says Widdowson (1979: 175), but also giving pointers to the reader to help him
or her along in the process of decoding. The responsibility of the text still lies
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 69

with the writer in the sense that he needs to take account of the reader in writ-
ing a text. A writer must therefore see writing as a cooperative activity. The
writer provides directions to the reader and anticipates the questions an imagi-
nary and critical reader might ask; questions such as: Oh yes? How do you
know? In that sense Widdowson's view of text may also seem to be reminiscent
of the liberal view of `the good text', because the text needs to adhere to certain
criteria. But these criteria are not necessarily located in the clarity of thought of
the writer, but in the way the writer directs him/herself to the audience.

  This is the same addressivity that Kramsch emphasises in her approach,
where she borrows the term from Bakhtin. However, Kramsch (and Bakhtin)
see this reader-oriented writing as a social aspect; the writer imagines the
reader and what his/her previous knowledge, interests, objections to the text
and so on, can be. Widdowson's structuralist position towards writing, on the
other hand, is not dissimilar, I would suggest, from the maxims that guide the
conversational Cooperative Principle put forward by Grice - communication is
understood as being guided by the `rules' of `being truthful', `being clear`, `being
informative', (i.e. not being too wordy for the purpose) and `being relevant'.

  Widdowson's view allows for a stronger role for the reader than either liberal
or structural views generally take on board, as the writer relies on the active
participation of the reader in order to comprehend the text by understanding
the pointers the writer gives, but it also sees communication more as something
taking place between individuals, rather than as a social process.

  The third view of texts which takes the interactional element much further
still is that explicated by Halliday, who sees texts as both product and process.
The text is a product in the sense that it is an artefact, it is there in the physical
sense and we can read it. But at the same time, text is also an interactive process,
`a semiotic encounter' where participants (the writer and reader) meet to create
meaning in a particular situational context. Wallace uses Halliday's concep-
tual framework of text as a starting point in her critical pedagogy of reading
where she sees reading and writing as closely interrelated (2003: 12). Wallace
locates her work in CLA (Critical Language Awareness), which as I discussed
in chapter 2, as a pedagogy encourages learners to deconstruct texts to critique
the ideology embedded in them; analyzing linguistic features in the text raises
students' awareness of how the discourses privilege those with power. Wallace
takes a view of reading where text interpretation is partly guided through ana-
lyzing the social interaction between the participants, the social situation and
the language used. This is not a completely fluid and open interpretation of
the text where it is up to the individual reader to recreate his or her mean-
ing. Following Eco she says that texts do carry meaning in and for themselves
`apart from writer intention (and indeed apart from reader interpretation) at a
number of levels signaled, in complex ways, by the nature and combining of the
formal features selected' (ibid. p.13).

  My own view is to some degree in line with Wallace, in the sense that in
text interpretation, at least in the context of language education, we can look
70 Reading With My Eyes Open

for `preferred readings' (ibid. p. 16) which students can access by considering
specific linguistic features and contexts. These apparent intended meanings of
a text, refer to, as O'Regan (2006: 113) says, how, `from the perspective of a
reader, the text seems to want to be read'. Preferred readings then are the appar-
ent arguments, perspectives and orientations, as they appear to the reader,
and, O'Regan states, `it is the text itself [that] seems to indicate this prefer-
ence' (ibid.). But, in my own pedagogy, and indeed the framework for analyses
of texts, which I used with my students, I also deviate from Wallace, in the
sense that, when looking at texts, my concern is not so much with ideology, but
rather with discourses as meaning making practices and how these produce
knowledge and make claims to truth. Looking at discursive formations in texts
also gives the student reader a window on the context in which these texts are
produced. And even though I assume that text interpretation does not allow
unlimited readings, as I argued earlier, I also take into account that students re-
write the text; they imbue it with their own meaning, derived from their expe-
riences and discourses to which they have been exposed, and the intertextual
knowledge they gained through these.

  I have argued earlier that in my own pedagogy I encourage students to employ
various critical strategies to interpret texts by referring to the linguistic choices
made. I am partly borrowing from Wallace (2003) in this. But, as my concern
in the foreign language classroom is not only with critique of how power is
sustained and constructed in texts, but also with culture, I am using a different
view of text which allows for both elements. For this reason, I am focusing on
models of text which are more suited to `being intercultural' through text.

  Bakhtin offers a good starting point.

     Being Intercultural Through Texts: Dialogism and Addressivity

Text, or utterance, according to Bakhtin, is about a dialogue with an other. Text
then, does not exist in its own context, but is always directed to someone else,
and as such his model of text can function also as a model of communication.
Text can therefore be seen not just as a product in its own right, but it is always
produced for someone else: a reader, interpreter, listener, which makes it rel-
evant for intercultural learning, both in reading and writing.

  This `addressivity' goes further than just helping the reader or listener along
through using structural markers in the text or writing in a reader-friendly
manner, such as writing with the use of discourse questions in mind, as I dis-
cussed above in relation to Widdowson's view of texts. Instead, Bakhtin's notion
of addressivity or `dialogism' means taking account of the reader or listener in
a more substantial way and considering what the possible reader or listener's
previous knowledge and expectations and possible responses to the text might
be. A reader's responses to a text are based on his/her cultural and social experi-
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 71

ence and history, particularly in relation to previous reading experiences, but
also in relation to the addressee's conceptual world, which is made up partly of
conventions of communication in certain areas of life (e.g. genres such as aca-
demic articles, law reports etc.), as well as his or her own ideological positions,
or at least the discursive fields the addressee is familiar with.

  But text and communication are not just addressed towards a (future) reader
who has a past and cultural baggage; texts (utterances) are also addressed to
past language or communication. Language, Bakhtin says, is always a response
to a greater or lesser extent to other utterances (1996 (1986): 91, 92). This applies
to communication in real time, e.g. a response to a previous utterance in a con-
versation, or a text which has been written in response to another text or any
other intertextual references.

  If we apply this notion of engaging with the other to `being intercultural', the
intercultural learner is not just responding or engaging with the other culture,
but also with another past. Words, like texts, are not neutral. There may be neu-
tral dictionary meanings of words which ensure that speakers of a given lan-
guage understand one another, Bakhtin says, but in live speech communication
words are always contextual (1996 (1986): 88). Language in use is not neutral
because the context of the whole utterance gives the word 'colour' or `sense'.
Furthermore, as speakers we are not the first people to use words. What we say
is not just addressed to the object, the topic we speak about, but to what others
have said about it. A text is a `link in the chain of speech communication' (ibid.
p. 94) and it cannot be seen separate from this chain. A text, or an utterance,
carries echoes with the past, or as the playwright Dennis Potter says it more
succinctly: the problem with words is that you don't know whose mouths they
have been in (quoted by Maybin, 2001: 68).

  This is of particular relevance to the foreign language learner, who has not
been socialised in the foreign language discourse communities and indeed
might not be able to relate any discourses to particular people, events or cul-
tural and ideological views, at least not in the foreign language context. To
understand a text, you can never only take the thematic content into account,
because the text also responds to what others have said about the same topic.
A text is then not just about its content, but it is a representation of something
in relation to the other texts to whom it (perhaps unwittingly) refers: texts are
filled with `dialogic overtones' (Bakhtin, ibid., p. 92).

  But texts do not just exist as `echoes of the past', texts themselves are not just
written within one voice or discourse. As Kress showed, frequently there are
various, even conflicting, discourses in a text, and it is these clashing discourses
which give rise to the text itself (1985: 82). This heteroglossia consists of the
seemingly endless voices and discourses in which social and ideological posi-
tions are embedded.

  It is the notion of dialogism - being in dialogue with past, present, future
and the other, which, I believe, constitutes the inter in intercultural. The inter
72 Reading With My Eyes Open

in this interpretation is not a direct relationship between two cultures. As I
argued earlier, intercultural relations are a complex set of cross cutting alle-
giances in which speakers act their complex multifaceted identities, or differ-
ent `belongings'. In the next section I explain what the cultural in intercultural
is when we adopt a Bakhtinian version of texts, as a way of communicating
with the other.

               Cultuurtekst as Discourse and Representation

In the previous chapter I already pointed to the notion of `cultuurtekst', text as
culture, coined by Maaike Meijer, a Dutch feminist literary theorist. She devel-
oped this notion of text into a theory of text interpretation or reading, mainly
for literary analysis purposes. She focuses particularly (following Kristeva,
1966) on the notion of intertextuality contained in Bakhtin's view of language
being `echoes of the past', but, in literary analysis, she maintains, recognising
intertextuality is a limitless task. Often it cannot even be determined exactly
how or where a text is borrowing from other texts. In order to create a frame-
work for literary interpretations outside the notion of literary intertextuality, it
makes more sense, she suggests, to recognise the discourses (in a Foucauldian
sense) in a text. Texts are not created as fresh and new meanings, but are a
reworking of old notions and ideas and conventionalised historically accepted
ways of talking about certain things. This `culturally routinised way of talking',
Meijer calls `cultuurtekst'.

  Culture then, in `cultuurtekst' is the `conglomerate of accepted and recur-
rent motifs and ways of representation around a theme, which is organising
itself again and again in new texts, whether literary, journalistic scientific or
otherwise' (my translation) (Meijer, 1996: 33). It is meaning-making in rela-
tion to the whole cultural space; `the scenarios' which are provided by the sur-
rounding culture. Each individual text is a retake of those scenarios, she says.
`Cultuurtekst' encourages us to look at how a text rewrites and reproduces the
available scenario. Or, in other words, how a text re-articulates the commonly
accepted meanings, values and attitudes.

  Meijer's view of `cultuurtekst' is not a completely open-ended framework.
It is not about a text having a single meaning, but about not having infinite
meanings either. Groups of readers who have been socialised in similar ways,
will `smell', as Meijer calls it, similar discourses. They recognise the underpin-
ning ideologies and values without being able to quite `put their finger on it', as
students have explained this sense of vague recognition to me.

  Meijer's notion of `cultuurtekst' is close to Foucault's notion of discourse, but
it differs from it in that her notion encompasses both that of the individual
concrete text itself, as well as that of the `invisible' or implicit discursive fields
which are operating within those texts. (1996: 33-35). This notion is useful for
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 73

language teaching, as we are not just dealing with discourses, but also with text
itself at a `textual level'.

                              Mapping Discourses

Using the notion of `cultuurtekst' also gives us the advantage of seeing culture
in more pluriform terms: not a formulation of features specific to a national
culture, but as a mapping and critiquing of discourses. I derived at the term
`discursive mapping' from Pennycook (2001), and see it, as he does, as a `prob-
lematisation' of texts. I conceptualised discursive mapping as part of discussing
with students how meanings in the text are created through discourses. This
allows us, as Pennycook says, to map out different formations of meaning and
to see how these are constructed through intertextual relations: a search for
how social reality itself is produced and reproduced in language (ibid: 111).
In this, the discursive mapping approach is a critical undertaking. O'Regan
(2006) developed a model for reading texts in the classroom, in which he uses
the idea of discursive mapping, an approach which he calls TACO, the `text as
critical object'. His model incorporates a number of stages from looking at the
`preferred readings' of texts, `how the text seems to want to be read' (ibid: 24),
through to a `representative', a `social', and a `deconstructive' interpretation. I
did not use O'Regan's model for my own `cultuurtekst' approach to reading
texts in the classroom, since his study was not available then, but I will come
back to the TACO approach again in the next chapter when I discuss my own
framework for text analysis.

  Seeing text as `cultuurtekst' then also brings to the fore the multiple dis-
courses, to which Kress refers (1985: 7) and which are current in any context.
Bakhtin calls this `polyphony' (multivoicedness). Any context, except the most
stable one, contains a range of `voices'. I take `voice' here to be similar to dis-
course. Bakhtin refers to different ideologies and discursive forces being inher-
ent in all words and forms: `Each word tastes of the context and contexts in
which it has lived its socially charged life: all words and forms are populated by
intentions.' (1981: 293).

  The idea of `cultuurtekst' then gives us access to the idea of culture as a com-
plex, fluid and dialogic construct, which whilst containing patterns of meaning
and behaviour, also recognises that these patterns change and merge and sub-
merge in (sometimes unpredictable) ways.

  An added advantage of applying the model of `cultuurtekst' to language
teaching, is that it gives language classes more intellectual content, even if dis-
cussing trivial texts, i.e. texts with a popular appeal, or everyday topics. It helps
learners to think about language at a more theoretical level, as well as touching
on the notion of addressivity, and the processes of meaning making, which is
an inherently critical task.
74 Reading With My Eyes Open

  Finally, the idea of `cultuurtekst' works not only as a mode for interpreting
texts, but, when combined with the notion of `addressivity' is also very useful as
an awareness tool for writing texts. I have incorporated this into the syllabus of
my general language class (see chapter 4 for an overview). My emphasis in the
fourth year language class under study was particularly, but not exclusively, on
reading and writing, as an intellectual dialogue.

                           Implications for Teaching

The need to conceptualise text in social ways in terms of the context of pro-
duction and reception is fairly widely accepted these days. However, as indi-
cated before, in the practice of language teaching an uncomplicated view of
text is still prevalent. Texts are frequently used as vehicles for grammar and
vocabulary work, for translation, or for comprehension exercises on the con-
tent level only. Questions of text generally are aimed to `check' whether the
learner has passively understood the surface messages contained in the text. In
language teaching, text is still frequently seen as a written product; a carefully
constructed framework with a clearly demarcated beginning and end which
constitutes an intelligible, cohesive piece of writing, and any language work
relating to texts frequently separates the activities of reading and writing. Stu-
dents also frequently hold similar assumptions about text. As I show in chap-
ters 5 and 6 students can struggle to recognise the complexity of texts as a result
of these assumptions.

  Yet on the other hand, students also engage with texts as social and cultural
beings themselves; their responses to texts are based on their own experiences,
ideas and assumptions. This is what I turn to next.

                          Personal Lived Experience

Traditional psychological schema theory (cf. Bartlett, 1932) holds that readers
relate the incoming data they receive from the text to existing mental represen-
tations of situations or events. These are, as Widdowson (1983: 34) points out,
primarily cognitive constructs which aid the organisation of information.

  However, information is always located within a social context (Wallace,
2003: 22). This is the context of reception, the context in which the informa-
tion is received, which is located within the wider context of culture, i.e. the
views, ideas, knowledges and discourses which the reader is surrounded with
or has encountered.

  The previous knowledges and experiences which readers use to interpret the
text relate to areas of academic as well as social experience; what they have
read, learnt or heard about the topic, whether in formal education or through
the media or everyday life. Moreover, readers also relate the text they read to
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 75

their `lived experience' of their relationships and encounters with other peo-
ple which include power relationships. In short, we interpret texts by relating
them, frequently unconsciously, to the discourses we have been exposed to our-
selves. These unconscious understandings take on a taken-for-granted assump-
tion of the world.

  The resonances people hear are relevant and indeed give meaning to the text,
but interpretations are never complete. They are dependent on the frameworks
people use, the situation they are in, their experiences and interests, their life-
world knowledge (cf. Habermas, 1984). In short we see texts from our own
ethnocentricity. We also have, as said before, our own `blindspots'. In order to
deal with these and to try and take a position `outside' the text, readers need to
be reflexive about their own position.

  Asking students to `map' the discourses in a text, as I do in my `cultuurtekst'
pedagogy, brings to the fore two things: firstly, you need to take a position out-
side its discourses in order to critique a text, otherwise the discourses will seem
`natural'. Discourses are, after all, resistant to internal criticism, as Gee has said
(2009 (1990): 161). Conversely, students may not be familiar with the discur-
sive fields that gave rise to the text, as they would not share the knowledge
inherent to which the text implicitly refers, in which case it may also be hard
for them to `problematise' the text or they may be half conscious of the discur-
sive fields, but cannot quite `put their finger on it'. To access the cultural mean-
ings through discourses on which the texts draws then, we can, I suggest take
the position of an ethnographer; an ethnographer of text, which includes the
notion of reflexivity. I will turn to this next.

          Being Intercultural Through Text: Reading as a Text
                                  Ethnographer

An ethnographer looks at cultural difference from both an inside and an outside
perspective. Taking an inside (emic) perspective is trying to see the world as the
`other' experiences it, i.e. `trying to stand in the shoes of the other' through
being as much part of the experience as possible, by talking to people and being
a participant observer. Of course an ethnographer can never completely under-
stand the inside perspective; it can only ever be an interpretation. At the same
time ethnographers try and take an outside (etic) perspective by trying to be
aware of their own assumptions which influence their interpretation of what
they see. This is the outside perspective, `making the familiar strange' through
creating `thick descriptions'.

  I consider the text ethnographer to go through similar processes in reading a
text. An inside perspective of text cannot be the same raw everyday experience
of the ethnographic observation or interview. The text is itself already a medi-
ated artefact of the social and cultural world. However, by reading a text from
an inside perspective, the text ethnographer is not so much trying to under-
76 Reading With My Eyes Open

stand the writer of the text, but the environment the writer is describing in real
life. This means the reader tries to understand the content of the text in relation
to the wider cultural environment to which the writer wittingly or unwittingly
refers. But, importantly, the reader can only understand the content and con-
text in relation to her own experiences. So trying to understand the text from
an inside perspective, i.e. trying to understand what the text might mean for
the audience for whom it is intended, the reader will have to make use of her
own experiences. These experiences could be those of empathy with the ideas
or participants in the text, or these experiences could be brought to bear in
relating and exploring the ideas and descriptions in the text against the reader's
own reality. This is an `engaging with'. It is not quite the same as the `languag-
ing' concept from Phipps and Gonzalez, because it does not involve `real' face-
to-face engagement in the language, but taking an emic perspective as a text
ethnographer, can, I believe, be an engagement with otherness and relating it
to oneself. Even if it is not a `raw' ethnography in its experiential form, it is an
intellectual engagement through relating the text to one's own experience and
ideas and making it `real'. In the classes which I used for data collection, there
were some almost `raw' experiences as students emotions became part of the
very personal responses to that text, as I will show in chapter 5 in relation to a
particular instance.

  But the inside perspective needs to be accompanied by an outside perspec-
tive, i.e. reflecting on the taken-for-granted interpretations the reader makes
herself. By being reflexive about his or her own interpretation, the reader
engages in a process which queries the taken for granted realities and interpre-
tations which reflect his or her own assumptions which are part and parcel of
his/her ethnocentricity.

  Again, the outside perspective I am describing is not quite the same as an etic
perspective, as it does not involve making `thick descriptions', but it can be a
way of `making the familiar strange'.

                          Summary and Conclusion

This chapter set out more specifically the underpinning ideas of my pedagogy.
I drew on Byram and on Kramsch's early work, and on Guilherme's critical
pedagogy. I aligned myself with the latter's critical emphasis, with Byram's focus
on `the everyday' aspects of culture, and with Kramsch's notion of context as
complex and multilayered, her focus on text and on the notion of dialogue in
class. I interpret this dialogue as taking place between students themselves as
well as in relation to the teacher and the text under discussion, including the
multiple discourses which occupy the cultural spaces which exist and open up
in such dialogues.

  Whereas language and culture in language teaching has been frequently seen
as relating to information about the target country, and what to say in what
                                                                       Being Intercultural Through Texts 77

situation, intercultural communication as a discipline, developed initially for
diplomacy and applied to business contexts, focuses exclusively on interper-
sonal relations, seeing a direct link between `a' communicative style and `a'
culture. I argued, drawing on Blommaert, that language and culture teaching
should not focus on this perceived link, because even though there are patterns
of communication in specific, including national, groups, language teaching
should take account of linguistic and cultural complexity.

  One way of conceptualizing a new way of thinking about intercultural com-
munication is that put forward by Phipps and Gonzalez of `being intercultural';
an actual engagement with `the other' in and through language. Ethnography
is an excellent tool to encourage interculturality, as it encourages students to
observe, participate in, engage with, and reflect about the `other' in relation
to themselves and their own complex cultural environment. Even though eth-
nography is about engaging with `real' situations, I argue that the idea can be
applied to looking at text as well.

  I set out different views of text which have prevailed in education, but the
view of text which allows for a critical, an ethnographic, and a dialogic read-
ing is that of `cultuurtekst', as this view of text combines the idea of text as
a product, and text in relation to the context of culture as shifting, complex
and reflecting multiple discourses. The idea of `cultuurtekst' then underpins my
pedagogy. The advantage of this model, I argued, is that it lends itself to `discur-
sive mapping', which I see as both a critical practice and as an engagement with
the cultural contexts of the texts.

  In the next chapter, I set out the context in which this study took place, dis-
cuss the text I used for this study and I will introduce the framework for analy-
sis which I used with the students.
                              CHAPTER 4

     Context of Teaching and Research

                                   Introduction
In this chapter I set out both the methodological concerns of this study, as well
as its context; a space where the tensions between expectations, mine and stu-
dents', and the normative processes of traditional liberal humanist educational
perspectives and instrumental ones were constantly felt.

  The aim of this classroom study was to find out how students engaged with
my pedagogy of intercultural language education which I had been developing
over the previous years: a cultuurtekst approach. The process of this study was
not a neat and linear one. As I let the data `rest' for a few years after I initially
collected these, the underpinning ideas to this pedagogy kept evolving. This
was as a result of reflection on the analysis on my data, the everyday experience
of teaching this particular language course and a range of other courses, and
through further theoretical reflection. The first three theoretical chapters of this
book, then, do not just set out the theory underpinning the data chapters, con-
versely the data chapters also underpin the theoretical chapters, as my notion
of the cultuurtekst approach, and its accompanying idea of becoming a `text
ethnographer', and how this contributes to learners' cultural and intercultural
awareness became more refined.

                           Background to the Study
When I started this study in the late 1990s, the theoretical field of intercul-
tural communication as part of language teaching had only just started to
develop. The idea that the notion of the Intercultural Speaker should replace
80 Reading With My Eyes Open

that of the `native speaker' as the aim of language learning was only posed in
1997 by Byram and Zarate. At the university where I worked, language teach-
ing was at many language departments still largely grammar and translation
based with an assumption that students should achieve the level of `near-native
speaker' competence upon graduation. The underlying educational principles
in language departments were rooted in the liberal Arts and Humanities with
their emphasis on critical and rigorous thinking, objectivity and the notion of
`high' culture. The texts which were used for reading and translation in lan-
guage teaching were challenging in their intellectual content, but the actual
pedagogy did not emphasise communication in the foreign language in real
life situations.

  As I set out in chapter 1, outside the institutions adhering to liberal educa-
tion, the grammar-translation approach was, justifiably in my opinion, recog-
nised as outdated. A contrasting approach, that of Communicative Language
Teaching (CLT), was favoured at universities with less traditional language
departments or at Language Centres attached to universities. The content of
these latter courses was originally developed with exchanges in typical tourist
situations in mind, but this was soon incorporated into the new educational
paradigm of instrumentalism which was gaining significance in HE.

  Contemporary published language teaching materials for Dutch, such as
Code Nederlands (1992, 1996) strictly followed the principles of the functional-
notional syllabus with its bite-size approach to memorising phrases to perform
language functions such as asking for directions, or ordering in a restaurant.
Unlike the grammar translation approach, the pedagogy of CLT was informed
by general theories of language acquisition and learning. The strength of this
approach was clearly that students learned to communicate in every day situ-
ations and were familiar with appropriate phrases in a range of contexts. Stu-
dents would be more likely to use `authentic' language expressions within these
set contexts. However, as a language teacher, I felt equally dissatisfied with this
approach because of its lack of structure and linguistic underpinning on the
one hand, and the reductive content focusing on pragmatic language exchanges
only, on the other.

  It would seem an obvious solution to integrate the positive aspects of each of
these approaches into one syllabus, i.e. integrating the learning of grammatical
structures in relation to communicative language functions, and, in addition,
adding more interesting `cultural' content. Indeed before embarking on the
study for this book, in the mid to late 1990s, I had developed the second and
fourth year language courses at the department where I taught. My brief had
been to `improve the language skills' of students. The principles that influenced
my courses at that time were informed by, amongst others, Wilkins' notion of
the semantico-grammatical category1 (1976), Hawkin's (1984) notion of lan-
guage awareness as a meta-linguistic construct, and views of language as `dis-
course' in the sense of the units of language which contribute to coherent texts,
i.e. the `traditional' applied linguistics view of discourse. I wanted students to
                                                                      Context of Teaching and Research 81

develop their language competence and skills both at the level of social inter-
personal communication as well as at the level of academic and cognitive lan-
guage use; the areas that Cummins (1979) refers to as BICS (basic interpersonal
communicative skills) and CALP (cognitive academic language proficiency).

  In practice this meant that in my courses I focused on the integration of
form, function, text structure, text coherence and cohesion. But in addition,
I also introduced an element of critical thinking in the courses, particularly
in the fourth year language course. At that time I had not conceptualised crit-
icality either as ideology critique, or as `discursive mapping' (see chapter 3),
but instead conceptualised critical thinking to mean scrutinising argumenta-
tion for its logical interplay of ideas in texts and being able to write logical and
cogent arguments. In the initial syllabus for the fourth year language course
then, I included a range of language activities focusing on `heavyweight' topics
such as the political and ethical principles of the various Dutch media or the
political ideals and historical influences which were embedded in the current
arts policy of the Dutch government.

  The initial results of this course (developed in the mid-1990s) suggested that
students' language and writing skills improved in the sense that they showed a
greater competence in writing cohesive and coherent texts than was previously
the case. They also showed an awareness of the reader (albeit a universal one) in
writing reader-friendly prose2. Yet, I was still not satisfied with the course and its
learning outcomes; the students' writing lacked authenticity and engagement.
I realised that this was due to the fact that they were not able to understand,
and certainly not produce, the subtle and connotative cultural meanings in lan-
guage use. Students were quite capable of comprehending the surface mean-
ing of texts and recognising stylistic points such as the degree of formality or
informality of a text, but they tended not to respond to more subtle or specific
cultural meanings. Nor were they able to produce language themselves incor-
porating these subtle or cultural meanings. Moreover, the texts that I exposed
students to covered - due to the nature of the topics, mainly one register: that of
the `quality newspaper' or popular academic article. I realised that in my desire
to provide a high standard university course encompassing critical thinking, I
had unwittingly interpreted the notion of content and culture as couched in the
liberal humanist ideology: culture as the `better' products of intellectual think-
ing. And in having done so, students received a one-sided and value-based view
of language and text as needing to adhere to certain standards.

                               Research Challenge

The challenge for me became to develop principles for language teaching and
learning for a general language course in the context of a language degree,
which would conceptualise communication as not only taking place in a con-
text of situation, but also in a context of culture. I followed Kramsch in using
these two parameters. The course would need to develop students' general
82 Reading With My Eyes Open

communicative and critical language skills and relate these to the immediate
context (which I had focused on in my original course), as well as relate it to the
wider cultural context of `ideas and values'. As I came to understand later, the
notion of `cultural values' carries with it the assumption of stability and clearly
delineated `cultures' which are distinct from others. As I started to conceptu-
alise the idea of cultuurtekst, I soon came to use the notion of `discourses' and
`discursive formations' (see chapter 2) in my own conceptualisation, although I
used these terms only occasionally to students themselves, since they showed a
resistance to these concepts. As a result of this study my own conceptualisation
of criticality also changed. My intention was initially to develop students' criti-
cal language skills in both the `critical thinking' paradigm I set out above and in
addition in terms of CLA, which I saw as a way of alerting students to the fact
that texts invite us to take up certain reading positions, particularly in relation
to dominance of particular ideologies. Later in the study, I came to think of
this as `discursive mapping' as that afforded texts to be looked at in relation to
complexities, contradictions and tensions in real life as well as the `text produc-
ing environment'.

  My intention was to develop these principles through re-designing my
fourth year language course, and to reflect on my pedagogy and the students'
responses to see how the course `worked' in practice. This course is taken by
students when they return from their Residency Abroad - a period of a year or
half a year, spent at a university in the Netherlands or Flanders.

  My initial intention with this study was to develop principles for good prac-
tice in language and culture teaching. As my study progressed along dialogic
lines, i.e. a continuous reflection on practice in relation to theory, new concepts
started to emerge. The research focus changed as part of this reflective process.
Early on in the study, I articulated the initial aim further as `developing princi-
ples for a pedagogy that would enable students to see text as cultuurtekst within
a general language course'. Later on my research focus shifted from developing
principles of good pedagogy, to understanding what happens in the classroom,
and how students engaged with the concept of cultuurtekst, which had become
the focus of my pedagogy.

  It was the juggling and problematising of the initial and emerging concepts
which posed the challenge of this study. In the process I followed various angles
and themes, later abandoned them, resurrected some, picked up new ones, only
to abandon some again. I will describe below which concepts in the end informed
the thesis and how they changed over time. However, first I will set out the
nature of the enquiry and the particular methodological features of this study.

                         Methodology and Messiness

The data for this study consist of two recorded and fully transcribed lessons
out of the fourth year language course and two sets of fully transcribed student
interviews. In collecting and analysing these data I engaged in a few different
                                                                      Context of Teaching and Research 83

research orientations. As my study was aimed in part at improving my own ped-
agogy, it can be said to be a form of action research. However, this study aims
to be more than a `procedure designed to deal with a concrete problem' (Cohen
and Manion, 1985: 223), as it seeks to understand how students responded to
my approach and to see what would emerge from my classes in terms of student
learning and engagement. In that sense my methodology is ethnographic in
nature in trying to understand the `richness, complexity, connectedness, con-
junctions and disjunctions' (Cohen et. al., 2007: 167) of the classroom environ-
ment. I used the `traditional' ethnographic methods of participant observation,
although there was a tension between my dual roles of teacher and researcher.
I also carried out in-depth ethnographic style interviews. My study reflected
to some extent the tension which exists in ethnography between traditional
naturalistic perspectives which sees the ethnographic product of field notes as
a closed, completed and final text, and a postmodern orientation influenced
by the linguistic, or interpretative turn. The latter orientation looks upon the
discipline as characterised by difference and diversity and a series of tensions
ethnographers and the people they study both engage in.

  As I indicated earlier, my data seemed messy and contradictory. The reali-
ties of the classroom and the students' experiences seemed at times ambigious,
elusive and slippery. However, it is in reflection that I can conclude that this
indistinctiveness is an inherent part of research which seeks not to reduce or
simplify the complexity of social reality. As Blommaert (2010: 11) states, social
activities are `not linear and coherent, but multiple, layered, checquered and
unstable.' By refusing to impose ordered methods to complicated and kalei-
doscopic realities, ethnography becomes critique, Blommaert suggests (ibid).

  It can be said that in my own study I used the standard social science
approaches of observations and interviewing. Similarly, in the initial stages
of the data analysis I followed the `mechanical' approach which is inherent in
that standard methodology. Nevertheless, my intellectual engagement with the
data, as well as with the `project' as a whole, has embraced ways of thinking
about method which sees messiness not as an unavoidable disadvantage, but as
a `way of working' and a `way of being' (Law, 2004: 10).

  In my reflection on the data, this study also borrows from grounded theory
(cf. Glaser and Strauss, 1967). Rather than having a clear hypothesis at the start
of the study to explain certain phenomena, research using a grounded theory
approach aims to understand these phenomena through the data. Concepts
and categories of explanation are `discovered' through careful analysis of the
data, as well as through reference to and reflection on theoretical literature.
The tentative categories and concepts which emerge can be tested over and
over again, against new data in a continuous cycle. In relating the data to con-
cepts and to make links with existing theories and categories, I developed and
rearticulated the concepts which I discussed in the previous chapters. This pro-
cess of developing categories and concepts took place through `coding': reading
84 Reading With My Eyes Open

and re-reading the data and going through these to see what categories emerge,
whilst acknowledging the multiple voices and what Denzin and Lincoln call the
`breaks, ruptures, crises of legitimation and representation [and] self-critique'
(quoted in Atkinson et. l. 2007 (2001): 3).

                  The Concepts which Informed the Study

In developing my approach to language and culture teaching, I conceived of
context of situation and context of culture as consisting at two levels: context
of situation as the basic level that students would need to understand, and the
context of culture as the level which would allow students to become inter-
cultural - to understand where the text or the speakers were `coming from' at
an ideological level. Both levels are necessary to discuss and understand text,
and indeed to become a competent language user and intercultural speaker.
The second level, the context of culture, addressed the relationship between
language and culture at the generic level; how values and ways of thinking are
articulated and refracted in language through discourses. Following a range
of other concepts, such as a Foucauldian notion of discourse, Bakthin's notion
of multivoicedness and dialogue, Kress's notion of conflicting discourses and
Maaike Meijer's idea of cultuurtekst, I applied these ideas to my language
teaching courses, in what I came to call the cultuurtekst principle of language
teaching. As I set out in previous chapters, this principle holds that seeing text
as cultuurtekst helps students to become aware of the discourses and values
which underpin our everyday communications and which are often taken for
granted. I wanted to make students aware of this through reading texts, and
also to apply, or at least be aware of it in their own communications.

  The notion of cultuurtekst also helped me to address the tension that exists
in the relationship between language and culture at the differential level, i.e.
`a' language related to `a' specific culture. As I set out in chapter 3, we cannot
hold to a view of a direct relationship between a language and `the' culture
with which it is associated. Yet, at the same time we cannot ignore that there
are cultural patterns which relate to or, at least, are experienced by people as
a national or localised entity (cf. Holliday, 2011). Many of the discourses that
learners come across, however, are global and cross many different national
borders, e.g. the discourses of `terrorism' or `environmentalism', but these
`global' discourses can be articulated differently in different contexts, includ-
ing national ones. I have called this in relation to the text we discussed in class
a `Dutch articulation'.

  In the process of conducting my study and analysing data, making tentative
inferences and recognising categories, new concepts emerged. Whereas earlier
on in the study I had worked with the notions of context of situation, context of
culture, and different views of criticality, which then led me to the idea of cultuur
                                                                      Context of Teaching and Research 85

tekst, the analysis of the data brought new categories to the fore. One of these
new categories was particularly the importance of students' previous personal
experiences, their emotions, their lifeworld knowledge as ways of making sense
of the world in interpreting texts. Also, I realised that the view that students had
of `text' became an important part of their response to the text. The `partial' or
`half ' understandings (as I saw them), I recognised later to be an important part
of the `struggle to mean' and to gain a deeper understanding of these complex
issues. As I realised, the `rich' learning moments in the lessons had been where
students engaged with and related the text to their own experiences.

  Students did not just approach the text in an intellectual way, but also in an
experiential way. That is to say, they read text in relation to their own experi-
ences. I came to think of this way of intellectually and experientially engaging
with text as `seeing text as a text ethnographer', which I describe in chapter 3.

  It was only retrospectively, after the process of analysing, further reflection
and further theorising on the course that I came to see how reading text as
an ethnographer is a way of engaging with the other, and being intercultural
through texts, so it was not part of my pedagogy at the time of data collection.

  This study analyses two lessons in the fourth year language course. In order
for the reader to understand where these lessons fitted in, I will give a short
overview of the course, its aims and the distinctiveness of my approach.

                         Distinctiveness of the Course

The course which I am using as the basis for this study, is a fourth year Dutch
language class. The reason for focusing on this year group was partly prag-
matic, in that this was the only language year group I was teaching at that
point. However, more importantly, I felt that for researching the understand-
ing of the cultural locatedness of texts, the fourth year class would be the best
starting point as the students had just returned from the Netherlands or Flan-
ders on their Year Abroad, and would therefore have already experienced vari-
ous cultural practices; in other words they have already participated and have
been socialised in the `shared cultural knowledge' that the Dutch readership
for the texts we are using would have. The fourth year students would there-
fore be more likely to recognise the discourses in the texts in relation to the
context of production, and be able to discuss texts at a critical level because
their language competence would be that much greater than in the first or
second years.

  Whilst the course takes a cultuurtekst approach, which borrows concepts
from cultural studies, it is important to emphasise that this study took place
as part of a general language class and not a cultural studies class per se. This
means that students were not just engaged in reading, discussion and interpre-
tation, but also in other practical language tasks which included all the four
traditional language skills. However, as the students on this course have just
86 Reading With My Eyes Open

spent a substantial time in a Dutch-speaking environment, they are confident
communicators at the interpersonal social skills level (cf. Cummins), and are
confident intercultural speakers. For that reason, the course focuses more on
cognitive language skills. It is largely centred around texts (including oral and
visual ones, although the latter were only touched upon), discussed in class and
with a range of follow up writing activities.

  At the time of data collection I had articulated the overall aim of the course
at a practical level as enabling students to function and communicate at a pro-
fessional, social and academic level in a Dutch-speaking environment within
a wide range of social and cultural contexts. Apart from advancing students'
actual language skills, this functioning particularly requires the students to
develop an awareness of how language, communication and culture relate to
one another. As I mentioned earlier the students need to be able to engage with
communicative instances at the level of context of situation as well as context
of culture. Both levels would demand a particular level of criticality. Look-
ing at texts in relation to the context of situation requires students to engage
with texts as products and encourages them to think critically about the text in
terms of its interplay of ideas, its coherence and clarity. Looking at the context
of culture requires students to engage with text as a process and encourage
criticality in terms of `discursive mapping': looking at texts for the way they
draw on discourses and produce `truth claims' and maintain assumptions about
the world and power differentials. Students need to be `critical intercultural lan-
guage users', not only in their ability to read and talk about texts, but also in
being able to write and address readers themselves, taking into account the
communicative demands set by both levels of contexts.

  As set out in previous chapters, the course differed from other Dutch lan-
guage courses in its focus on awareness raising of `culture in language'. In my
previous chapters I criticised the instrumental approaches to language learning
which are informed by the guidelines of the Council of Europe. Particularly in
the Netherlands there is a strong instrumental focus in language teaching. My
criticism of instrumentalism is directed at its limited and reductive approach
to the social and cultural world. Frequently in instrumentally oriented text-
books, examples of `language in use' are presented as if the language users all
share the same context and speak with the same voice; as if there is a universal
(native) speaker.

  That does not mean that I believe preparing students for the world of work
is irrelevant, but I believe that the `world of work' is part of the complex wider
cultural context. We cannot predict what particular linguistic and cultural con-
texts our graduates will encounter. What we can predict, however, is that these
situations will be complex and differ each time, will be challenging, consist of
many indeterminacies and will be intercultural.

  As well as linguistic skills, students should develop intellectual skills which
go over and beyond the cognitive academic language proficiency of writing
cogent arguments in order to understand and become aware of language and its
                                                                      Context of Teaching and Research 87

uses in the cultural world. These are not just skills for functional and pragmatic
purposes, but also for ideological purposes: recognising on the one hand how
ideas and values are reflected and constructed in texts, how power relations are
reproduced and how the reader is positioned in certain texts.

  With these factors in mind, I designed the course so that students were
gradually made aware of the wider cultural context of the text and how this is
reflected and constructed in the language used. I had `packaged' this approach
to students in the more pragmatically formulated notion of `style'. After all stu-
dents' expectations and their own objectives for this course would have been
primarily to improve their language skills, not to learn how to analyse texts.
The importance of looking at cultural values in texts, I explained, was partly to
recognise as a reader where a text is 'coming from', but also, it would help them
in their practical writing skills by being able to write stylistically appropriately
for different aims and purposes.

                            Overview of the syllabus

The course of 20 weeks is split into two parts. In practice the material that I
wanted to cover in the first part took approximately 12 weeks, with 8 weeks left
for the remaining part of the course. The table below shows a schematic over-
view of the course. However, the course did not progress as neatly as the over-
view suggests. As well as discussing texts and doing writing activities, we also
did grammatical exercises where appropriate. In addition a number of lessons
were spent on translating texts as this offers a way to discuss cultural aspects
of a text.

  The first 12 weeks of the course consisted of two blocks. The first block, intro-
duces the notion of `style' in relation to the aim and audience of a text before
looking at how language in its stylistic choice of structures and lexis can reflect
particular ideological positions in texts. In order to help students to query the
seemingly natural positions in texts, I introduced most texts in `pairings' so that
students could see how else the topic could be talked about. I also structured
the ideas in a gradual way, moving from ideas of situational context to context
of culture. Paired texts covered the same topic, but were either written for dif-
ferent purposes, for different audiences, or consisted of different genres or draw
on different discourses.

  The second block of this first part of the course applied these conceptual
ideas to a more `traditional' area of advanced language teaching; that of argu-
mentation and text structure. In looking at structure and argumentation we
initially focused on the `textual' and `product' level of the text, I introduced
students first to the academic, rhetorical and linguistic aspects of these areas,
e.g. how arguments and texts are constructed, and cohesion and coherence in
texts. Then we looked at these texts in their situational and cultural contexts.
It is in this block that I introduce the notion of cultuurtekst using the Men's
88 Reading With My Eyes Open

Health text which is the focus of this study. I will discuss these lessons in more
detail below.

  The second part of the course aimed to put the framework and the new
understandings of cultuurtekst into practice in more practically and profes-
sionally oriented situations and contexts, such as report and letter writing and
giving oral presentations. I ask students to look at addressivity and at position-
ing of the texts, as well as to write for different contexts, and drawing on dif-
ferent discourses. My main aim in this second part of the course with moving
from cultuurtekst to instrumental and goal oriented areas of language teach-
ing was to encourage students to apply their critical awareness of discourses to
communicative events which may seem even more natural than those of popu-
lar media texts, but are equally filled with different voices, discourses and ide-
ologies. In their writing I want students to be responsible towards their readers
and audience - to take account of `addressivity'.

                                             In the last couple of lessons we focus on
                                             the importance of context in writing a
                                             summary. Depending on why you want

                                             formulate it differently.

                                   The Lessons

The two lessons I focus on in this study represent the point in the course where
I introduce the notion of cultuurtekst explicitly to the students. Even though we
have looked at discourses in texts at earlier points in the course, I had masked
that as looking at `style'.
                                                                      Context of Teaching and Research 93

  These two particular lessons fitted into a series of lessons within the block
on argumentation, which had as its starting point gender roles and representa-
tions. Prior to discussing the Men's Health text, the class discussed a feminist
polemical article, `De man als dinosaurus', (`The male as dinosaur'), by a female
journalist, and a critical response to that. The students looked at this text par-
ticularly to see how the linguistic representation through grammar and style
enhances the impression of the strong successful female and the weak disem-
powered male. I then introduced the text which forms the focus of this study,
the text from Men's Health (see appendix).

  The reason for discussing the Men's Health text was that it provided a range of
different and contrasting discourses with the previous texts. Whereas the first
two texts, respectively the feminist text and a critical response to it, came from
a `quality' newspaper (de Volkskrant), the Men's Health text is a different genre
text from a popular lifestyle `glossy' for men.

  The rationale for using a text from the popular media is that discourses tend
to be more exaggerated and easily recognisable. Moreover, as Wallace citing
Luke et. al. (2001: 113) states, these texts may seem innocuous, neutral and
requiring just a simple response, `cumulatively they document and shape social
and cultural life' (Wallace, (2003: 1). This particular Men's Health text, I felt,
would easily yield a discussion around discourses and values in texts. The topic
crossed national boundaries and the article drew on various conflicting dis-
courses familiar in the western world. Moreover, I thought there was a Dutch
articulation in the text, as I will explain below.

            Framework and How it Relates to the Two Classes

The framework I have developed (see below) borrows to some degree from Wal-
lace (2003: 39), in the sense that her concern with critical language awareness
(CLA) is both with critiquing the logic, arguments and sentiments expressed in
texts, as well as the ideological assumptions underpinning these (ibid: 42). As
the basis of my framework I adapted Wallace's orienting questions which she
based on Kress (1989): 1) why has the text been written?; 2) To whom is the text
addressed?; 3) What is the topic?; 4) How is the topic being written about?; 5)
What other ways of writing about the topic are there? However, I am not fol-
lowing Wallace's Hallidayan methodology, based on Halliday's Systemic Func-
tional Linguistics (1994), partly because of its high level of abstraction which
would demand much more specialist in-depth analysis and the use of meta-
language. My theoretical concerns are less with in-depth analysis according to
clearly delineated linguistic categories. Instead, I saw my framework partly as
a tool for looking at texts, at both levels of `text as product', and `text as cultu-
urtekst', each encompassing a particular perspective on criticality. As I set out
before, one of my concerns with reading texts in class is also with the cultural. I
saw cultuurtekst not only as a tool for analysis, but also as a guideline to facili-
94 Reading With My Eyes Open

tate the dialogue in class, to provide the `fuel' in the process of collaborating
in making sense of the text. Moreover, cultuurtekst also embodies the cultural
aspect of language learning, as by looking at discourses in texts, students can
access social, historical and political meanings.

  I intended for the discussion around texts to move from a focus on text at a
textual level, to text at a cultuurtekst level, which I saw in relation to respectively
the context of situation and the context of culture. I based the level of context of
situation on Hymes' model of communication, even though strictly speaking
this model also encompasses cultural and social contexts as part of some of the
speech categories such as norm and genre, but, these, I would say, are distinct
from the context of culture, as they do not explicitly consider values embed-
ded in language use. For my framework then I conceptualised the context of
situation in a slightly more `pared' down manner than Hymes' model, focusing
particularly on the where, to whom, when, why and how. Or as I have phrased
it in my framework, the text audience, the text function, the text structure.

                      English translation of framework

 Framework for analysing and understanding texts

 1 - Content: what (or who) is the text about?

 -- what is the main point?
 -- maybe also: what are the subsidiary points?
 -- what is exactly said about those points?
 -- Relating to your own expectations and knowledge
 -- to what extent do you recognise the theme of the text?
 -- in what kind of situations have you come across this before (having read or

      heard about it?
 -- and in what way?

 2 - Immediate context:

 -- aim/function
 -- what does the text `do'? (what does the text want to achieve?) examples of func-

      tions are: to inform, to analyse a problem, to suggest a solution for a problem, to
      amuse, to give an opinion, to convince the reader of a particular argument, to explain
      something, to try and convince the reader to change his/her behaviour, etc.
 -- Describe the function in relation to the content of the text. For example: this text
      provides an overview of the different saving accounts available at this bank. Or:
      this text tries to convince the readers that the product of this company is the best on
      the market.
 -- Which (strategic) means are used to achieve that aim?
      For example: Engage the reader by appealing to making the theme recognisable, or
      engage the reader through grammatical structures, e.g. use of imperfect tense. Or:
      Convince the reader by referring to sources of authority, or by making comparisons,
      or by referring to a generally accepted `rule' or convention, etc.

 -- target audience: who is the text aimed at?
                                                                    Context of Teaching and Research 95

-- is the text written for a certain situation or a certain publication?
-- and what do you know about that situation?
-- if you don't know that situation or publication, are there clues in the text which

    could help you to find out what kind of audience the text is aimed at? (for
    example: is the reader expected to have certain prior knowledge, the way the reader
    is addressed (or not), the kind of arguments which are used, kind of sources which
    are used, complexity, liveliness, formality, and use of grammar: use of passives,
    complex sentence structures, use of verbs, nouns, adjectives etc.)

3 - genre

-- What kind of text is it? (for example: a business letter, a personal letter, an
    invitation for a party, a news report, an opinion article in a newspaper, an essay,
    a report, an academic article, a conversation, a joke, an informative article in a
    women's glossy, dietary advice etc.)

4 - text as text

-- structure
-- How is the text structured?
-- What is the effect?
-- cohesion
-- How are the sentences and sentence parts connected? (for example: formal

    markers, use of ellipsis, repetitions, through word order, synonyms, bridging sen-
    tences which indicate links explicitly etc.)
-- What is the effect?

5 - text as cultuurtekst

-- How does the text talk about the topic and the `participants'? Show this by refer-
    ring to specific words and expressions. (For example: written from perspective of
    the `participants'; distant; critical; ambiguous; knowledgeable; angry; sympatheti-
    cally; with empathy; with disdain; from a power position; as truth; cautiously etc.)

-- How is the reader addressed? (as equal, patronisingly; as a `student', from the
    assumption reader shares the same ideas and values; with (dis)respect; etc.)

-- Which values do you recognise in the text? (for example: feministic; new age;
    religious; social-democratic; humanistic; conservative; capitalistic; individualistic;
    collaboratively; environmentally aware; nationalistic; etc.)

-- Which different `discourses' and `intertexts' do you recognise in the text?
    (see above, and discourses reminiscent of law, text books, advertising, financial
    world etc.)

-- Are these values conflicting in anyway?

6 - evaluation

-- Why is this text written?
-- If you would write it for a different target group what and how would you adapt it?
-- What other ways could you write about this topic (think about aim, audience,

    values and intertexts?
-- Is it an acceptable text if you look at it from a liberal view of text structure (in

    terms of argument, structure, clarity and `honesty')?
-- How do you respond yourself to the text now? Compare with your own expecta-

    tions you had written down at point 1.
96 Reading With My Eyes Open

  I introduced this framework at the point of the lessons where we looked at
the Men's Health text. The questions in the framework were not specifically
geared to this particular text. So, even though one aspect of the second lesson
related to Dutch articulation, the framework itself does not cover this aspect.
The notion of Dutch articulation was not a general point to be discussed for
each text we read, but seemed pertinent to this Men's Health text. There are six
points in the framework, which relate to various stages in the interpretation
process, as I had conceptualised this. These stages move gradually from content
and description gradually to interpretating and problematising the text. The
earlier points in the framework relate to looking at the text from an `outside'
perspective, whereas looking at the complexity of the text as cultuurtekst intro-
duces discursive mapping which involves students looking at texts also from an
`inside' perspective.

  In designing my framework I did not take account of the framework which
O'Regan (2006) designed for his approach which he calls the TACO approach:
Text as a Critical Object, as his study was not available then. My framework
does indeed differ from O'Regan's in that his framework is designed to be
interpretive, as well as analytical. My approach as I explained before was less
explicitly analytical and partly formed the basis for discussion of text and con-
tent. Although O'Regan's TACO approach is more complex and more fully
underpinned by philosophical perspectives, there are some similarities with
my approach as a staged process of analysis and an aim to engage in `discursive
mapping' (Pennycook, 2006), so I will refer to his work in the discussion of my
framework below.

  The first point in the framework serves to invoke students' previous experi-
ence and expectations of the text in order to make them aware of the possible
preconceptions they may have. This is not a pre-reading activity per se, because
normally the students would already have read the text as homework in prepa-
ration for the class. However, the first reading of text as homework is primarily
meant for students to read at a content level, in order to look up any vocabulary
they do not understand. Point 1 in the framework then, is to ensure there were
no misunderstandings which arose from unfamiliarity with the vocabulary or
with certain (cultural) references to the text. Under the heading of what the text
was about, I also included the recognising of main and subsidiary points in the
text. This was because the aim of my lessons was partly to develop cognitive
language skills.

  The second point was designed to make students think more carefully about
the immediate context of the text; the context of situation. This involved moving
from the surface content of the text (which is discussed under point 1) to recog-
nising what the text `does'; what its aim or function is, and the way of bringing
that about, such as the use of various argumentation schemas. Another aspect
of this part of the framework refers to the target group: who is the text aimed at
and how can you tell? Whereas the first point of the framework is intended to
be purely at a description level, this second point in the framework moves the
attention of learners on to the level of interpretation. This point in the frame-
                                                                      Context of Teaching and Research 97

work constitutes the `preferred reading', which O'Regan (2006: 113) describes
as `the apparent argument, perspective, or purview of the text as it appears to
the reader and is therefore preferred in the sense that the text itself seems to
indicate this preference.'

  Point 3 of the framework, the notion of genre, bridges the notion of context
of situation, i.e. social setting, and context of culture. I have given this a sepa-
rate heading as it needs some special consideration, both in terms of reading as
well as writing of text. In developing writing skills, it is crucial for the students
to consider conventions of certain social contexts (Bakhtin, 1986; Fairclough,
1992). As far as reading a text is concerned, the issue of genre helps students to
recognise the conventions associated with specific types of text and to consider
why a text may deviate from these conventions and expectations.

  The fourth point of this framework, text as text (i.e. text as a product), is
designed to alert students to the textual aspect of text, which I see here as a
more traditional, structuralist approach to text in language teaching. In this
framework I am contrasting the notion of text with the notion of cultuurtekst.
Under this heading students look at text in terms of cohesion and argumenta-
tion. The rationale for this was not only to develop cognitive language skills,
but also to guide students towards the interpretation of text as cultuurtekst. I
felt that, together with point 3 of genre, looking at the effect of the overall struc-
ture and cohesion of a text, would alert the reader to style as social language
use, which would pave the way for seeing text as cultuurtekst. This point in
the framework, as well as the previous two points, require critical work by the
students which are on a par with the `critical thinking' level defined by Pen-
nycook (2001) as being an aspect of the liberal humanist paradigm. It is a level
of critique which requires students to take up an `outside' position towards the
text they are reading.

  The most important point for my purposes is point 5, that of cultuurtekst.
In this section I want students to look at that aspect of cultuurtekst which rec-
ognises and maps the discourses and the voices in the text, and to see if the
discourses are consistent with one another, or conflicting. The conflicting dis-
courses are the most significant ones. For this aspect I borrowed from Wallace's
framework (Wallace, 2003: 39) which focuses on how the topic and partici-
pants in the text are represented. I am encouraging students to recognise dis-
courses by engaging their knowledge of previous texts, of intertexts, by asking:
where have you come across this kind of `talk' before? This discursive mapping,
`problematising practice' (Pennycook, 2001), applies to all texts, and not just to
ones which show clear ideological positions, in terms of power domination. As
O'Regan states (2006: 118) `all texts are inserted into a matrix of social, political
and economic meaning relations.'

  The final point in the framework is an overall `evaluation'. I use evaluation
here, partly in line with Halliday (cf 1985) in attributing meaning to the text.
However, it also has a more pedagogical rationale in the sense that it functions
to summarise the points mentioned under 5, cultuurtekst, which can then be
98 Reading With My Eyes Open

compared with the questions and answers which were given in the earlier parts
of the framework. I followed Wallace's aforementioned Hallidayan framework
with questions such as `Why has this text been written?' which serves to make
students aware that as well as text function, as part of immediate context dis-
cussed under point 2, there are ideological underpinnings to a text. Finally, I
ask the students to look at the text from the liberal humanist perspective of
text: Is it a clear, well argued piece of text?, before asking them to give their own
response to the text. By comparing their answers under point 6 with earlier
answers, I hope to alert students to the value or importance of analysing a text
from different perspectives.

  Important to mention is that my framework was not purely meant to help
students interpret texts, but also intended to function as an `awareness raiser'
for students in producing text themselves.

                           The Text and my Analysis

The English translation of the text is in the appendix. I will offer a summary
here.

  The title of the text is: `Huwbare mannen gevraagd' (`Marriageable men
wanted') with the subtitle: `Pas op. Er wordt op je gejaagd. (`Look out. They
are after you'.) The text comes from a monthly publication called Men's Health.
The publication is an international one, and the Dutch version carries the same
English name. As far as I can tell, the texts are not translated from English, but
written by Dutch authors for a Dutch audience. The particular issue (1999)
which carried the text I was using for these classes, used the following edito-
rial categories within the table of contents: `Fitness and sport'; `Relationships'
(the category in which the article under discussion appeared); `Psychology' (an
article about stress); `Nutrition'; `Sex' (`How to keep going for longer'); `Health';
`Career'; `Adventure'; and `Fashion'. In addition there are a number of columns
which all reflect the topics in the sections just mentioned. The categories and
topics would suggest that the target group of Men's Health are ambitious, health
and body conscious, fairly youngish men. The notion of `success' is emphasised
in many of the articles and columns.

                                   Content and context

As described in the introductory paragraph of the text, the article is about sin-
gle career women between 35 and 54 whose `biological clock is ticking'. As the
title states: `Marriageable men wanted'. The women are represented on the one
hand as aggressive young women who go out in the evenings to engage in `man-
nen vernielen' (`male-bashing'), and on the other hand as women who have a
problem and need help, as they are incapable of maintaining a healthy relation-
ship with a man, and are thus risking missing out on having a baby.
                                                                      Context of Teaching and Research 99

  The `preferred reading' of the text could be construed as advice or as a warn-
ing to men. In the last line of the introductory paragraph this is made explicit
as the (male) reader is directly addressed in this warning:

    Kijk uit, er wordt op je gejaagd.

    Look out, they're after you. (literally: Look out, you're being hunted).

Equally, there is a whole paragraph with the heading: `The career woman:
instructions for use', in which advice is given. It starts with the following
sentence:

    Wat doe je wanneer je verstrikt raakt in een relatie met een vrouw die
    gehard is in de top van het bedrijfsleven?

    What do you do when you get trapped in a relationship with a career
    woman who has been hardened in a top position in the business world?

There are some linguistic, as well as visual features of the text which suggest a
half-serious as well as a half amusing undertone in discussing the particular
`social phenomenon' of the single career woman. Particularly the descriptions
in the first few paragraphs, which describe some of the women in their `male-
bashing' exploits seem geared to getting some laughs:

    Allen zijn ze op hun eigen manier even succesvol én .... even single. Nou
    ja, de meiden komen wel aan hun trekken hoor, dat is het niet. Dorien
    - 34, topbaan bij een bank - heeft al een paar jaar een relatie met een
    getrouwde vent. José - 36, manager bij een hotel in Utrecht - heeft een
    onmogelijke verhouding met een vage schilder met een alcoholprobleem.

    All are in their own way equally successful and ...... equally single. Well,
    the girls don't go without, you know. Dorien - 34, top job at a bank - has
    had a relationship with a married bloke for a few years. José - 36, hotel
    manager in Utrecht - has an impossible relationship with some vague
    artist with an alcohol problem.

Similarly, the inset box with a quiz about `how to recognise a desperada' clearly
is not meant to be taken seriously, e.g.:

    -- Ze heeft geen kinderen maar soms al wel de kinderopvang geregeld
         - 25 pt.

    -- Ze citeert moeiteloos enkele strofen uit `Het dagboek van Bridget
         Jones, 59 kilo' -10 pt.

    -- Zeven van de tien zinnen die ze uitspreekt, begint met één van de drie
         volgende woorden: onafhankelijkheid, ruimte of respect - 20 pt.
100 Reading With My Eyes Open

    -- She doesn't have any children, but has sometimes already arranged
         child care 25 points.

    -- She quotes with ease whole paragraphs from `The diary of Bridget
         Jones, 59 kilos' - 10 points.

    -- Seven out of her 10 sentences start with one of the three following
         words: independence, space or respect - 20 points.)

On the other hand the thrust of the rest of the article seems fairly serious
and informative. There certainly is a semblance of seriousness in its references
to other sources. The dominant information source is that of the female psy-
chologist, Labrijn, who has carried out `exhaustive research' (uitputtend onder-
zoek) into this phenomenon. She has written a book on the subject and gives
therapy to women with `this problem'. Furthermore a documentary film by a
Dutch female film maker set in New York is cited as proof that this problem
is universal.

                            Representations and discourses

When deconstructing the text, the first paragraph sets the scene and gives the
impression that `the issue' of single career women is wide spread. They are char-
acterised as a homogeneous group:

    Ze verdienen geld als water en hebben alles wat hun hart begeert, behalve
    een man. Steeds meer hoogopgeleide carrière-vrouwen tussen de 35 en
    54 raken in paniek omdat zich maar geen potentiële vader voor hun kind
    aandient. Ze zijn soms cynisch, vaak hard en altijd veeleisend...

    They earn money like water and have everything to their heart's desire,
    except a man. More and more well-educated women between 35 and
    54 are starting to panic because a potential father for their child has
    not yet turned up. They are sometimes cynical, often hard nosed, and
    always demanding...

The group characteristics are defined as:

    Leuke, goed geklede, vlot gebekte meiden zijn het en ze hebben het hele-
    maal voor elkaar.

    Great, well-dressed girls they are, with the gift of the gab and they've
    really made it.

What it means to have `really made it' is further defined in terms of possessions
and appearances:
                                                                    Context of Teaching and Research 101

    Designkleren, dakterras of balkon, vlot karretje onder de cellulitis-vrij
    getrainde billen, make-up van Clarins en Roc, koelkast met zalm en
    champagne en natuurlijk die job met uitdagende perspectieven.

    Designer clothes, roof garden, nice trendy car under their cellulite-free
    trained buttocks, make-up from Clarins en Roc, fridge with salmon and
    champagne and of course that job with challenging prospects.

Moreover this group of women is represented as sexually aggressive:

    Als de meiden uitgaan is zij [Suzanne] het die roept `Kom vanavond gaan
    we mannen vernielen!', een kreet die een gevleugeld begrip is geworden in
    het groepje. Sarren, flirten, beetje zoenen, en net als hij denkt dat-ie jou
    heeft, toch weer afwijzen - aan veel meer komen ze niet toe.

    When the girls go out, [Suzanne] is the one who shouts `Come on,
    tonight we're going to destroy men!', which has become a battle cry in
    their little group. Provoking, flirting, bit of snogging and just when he
    thinks he has got it in the bag, drop him. Much more than that they
    don't get around to.

Initiating sexual advances seems to be the male prerogative.

    Welke man heeft er geen avonden gespendeerd aan vrouwen waarin je een
    vermogen aan aandacht, humor en dineetjes investeert met nul komma
    nul aan (seksueel) rendement?

    What man has not spent evenings with women, investing a fortune
    in attentiveness, humour and dinners with zero point zero (sexual)
    gain [profit]?.

The expected conventions of behaviour, it is clear, is for the man to take the
woman out to dinner and bestow his attention and charm on her, with a clear
expectation that this favour will be returned in sexual kind. The discourses on
which the text draws are very similar to the ones which the Men's Health pub-
lication displays; discourses of success and status defined through possessions,
job, a toned body and money. The latter is important; the quote above is located
within a capitalist discourse, e.g. `investing', `fortune' and `profit'.

  These discourses of success take on a natural common sense assumption
when applied to men. However, when applied to women, these discourses take
on a negative connotation; it seems subversive and abnormal for women to
have `a top position in the business world'. Indeed the rest of the article makes
clear that success is not a natural state of affairs, but it is a `problem' for women.
The first example of this is in the form of a woman in a documentary film,
Laura Slutsky (!), who as a single career woman has `developed strategies for
being successful', which have led her to be `confrontational and critical' in her
102 Reading With My Eyes Open

relationships. Laura was told by her psychiatrist that `her game was power'. She
might win the battle with this, but she would lose the war.' Again, power and
success are highlighted as problems. By describing Laura in relation to her psy-
chiatrist, her desire to be powerful and successful is constructed in terms of an
`illness' or `madness' (cf. Foucault, 1965). Moreover, the unnatural and aggres-
sive aspect of this is emphasised by locating power in yet a different strand of
meaning: that of fighting and war.

  Another shift in tone then takes place. A discourse of psychological analysis
is constructed as the female psychologist, Labrijn, is quoted, explaining that
women's desire for success is occasioned through their `jeugdervaringen' (child-
hood experiences). Frequently, the father is absent, and because of this fatherly
neglect women overcompensate by building `a strong male ego' for themselves
in terms of `wanting to achieve a successful position in society'. But building up
this strong outer protective layer

    snijdt haar ook af van haar zachte kant. Haar creativiteit, haar vermogen
    evenwichtige relaties met mannen aan te gaan.

    has cut her off from her soft side, her creativity, her ability to have stable
    relationships with men.

Labrijn continues:

    Afhankelijk kunnen zijn is het taboe van de succesvolle vrouw.

    Being able to be dependent is the taboo of the successful career woman.

Softness, creativity, being dependent are then constructed as `natural' charac-
teristics of women.

  Another shift of personal self-development takes place as the psychologist
describes therapy sessions in which women are trained in `alternative behav-
iour'. Together with her clients she explores the behaviour that women them-
selves want to change. Moreover, Labrijn gives some practical tips to men
who are in a relationship with a career woman. These reflect the discourse
of self-development; on the one hand the shared responsibility is empha-
sised, and on the other, the importance of the man to protect himself and his
own individuality:

    Zoek en vecht samen uit wat wel en niet goed voelt in de relatie, ook als je
    voor jezelf geen pasklare antwoorden hebt. En blijf bij jezelf.

    Work out together what does and doesn't feel good in the relationship, even
    if you have no ready made answers. And stick to your own convictions.

The final paragraph represents yet a different strand of discourse, which seems
to be almost diametrically opposite to the discourses of the independent suc-
                                                                    Context of Teaching and Research 103

cessful career woman. Instead, an intensely traditional image is presented; evi-
dence of the successful results of the therapy sessions is given in the form of
the marriage and birth announcements Labrijn receives from her ex-clients.
Moreover, she herself points to how happy she is now since she has been in a
`really good relationship' for the past 5 years. Moreover, she also had her first
child, she says `beaming'. The last few sentences set the article within a wider
context. Labrijn explains women of her age have been part of the generation
which was conscious of feminism, and even though, she said, this was a phase
that was necessary, it had led to a particular attitude towards men:

    In die tweede feministische golf werden mannen individueel verant-
    woordelijk gemaakt voor allerlei maatschappelijke misstanden, voor de
    ongelijkheid. Dat heeft de attitude van je afzetten tegen mannen bevor-
    derd en onze generatie heeft daar last van. Ik denk dat er nu wel ruimte is
    voor een andere houding.

    During the second feminist wave men were held individually responsi-
    ble for all kinds of social injustice, for inequalities. That encouraged the
    attitude of contempt for men, and our generation suffers from that. I
    think now the time is right for a different attitude.

Feminism is represented here for its contempt against men. It would seem then,
that the final discourse which emerges is that of anti-feminism. This final dis-
course, allows us, I would suggest, to read the whole article in the light of an
anti-feminist perspective, or at least a perspective of fear of successful women,
as success seems to be a male attribute.

  The women in the text are represented in many different and conflicting
ways. Through the range of representations and different discourses a picture is
created where the discourses of power, success and sexual aggression are `natu-
ral' for men, but unnatural for women, to the point that they are seen as `ill'
or at least as `unhappy' when they display these male characteristics. What is
natural for women is to be soft, creative and dependent, and to find happiness
in a stable relationship and motherhood.

  A discourse of self-development, both in terms of changing one's be­haviour
and gaining insight into oneself is also reflected in the text. Part of this dis-
course is the discourse of shared responsibility, (`work out together what does
and doesn't work') and a discourse of individuality, at least when it applies to
the male: `stick with your own convictions'.

                               Dutch Articulation

Looking at the text as cultuurtekst as I did in the previous paragraph, means
looking at culture and language at a `generic' level. But I also felt that this text
displays culture at a `differential' level (cf. Risager, 2007), which I referred to
104 Reading With My Eyes Open

in chapter 2 as `Dutch articulation'. The topic of the text is clearly a global,
or at least a western one; indeed students made intertextual connections,
as chapter 5 will show, with American and English soaps and films. Yet my
own interpretation of this text is that particularly the gender based discourse
of women only finding fulfilment in motherhood was more likely to have
occurred in the Netherlands. Whilst I realise I am treading on dangerous
ground here, keen as I am to underline the pluriformity and multicultural
aspects of society and avoid an essentialist interpretation, there are neverthe-
less cultural and social specificities in society as a result of, at least in part,
historical development. Certainly, in her history on Dutch women's writings
between 1919 and 1970, Fenoulhet (2007: 1) highlights the `extreme empha-
sis on the nuclear family'.

  Another Dutch discourse, as I saw it, was that of the semi-therapeutic one,
which was quite prevalent in lifestyle publications in the Netherlands at the
time (1999). On the other hand we could surmise that `therapy talk', and the
discourse of `personal development' is part of many lifestyle magazines in the
west. It has become so ingrained that we cannot even step outside it easily; it
has become taken for granted to such an extent, that, even in a men's maga-
zine, it does not seem out of place (at least not to me). However, I felt that a
discourse which sometimes is referred to as `touchy-feely', - the word already
indicates a critical attitude - would be out of place in an English men's maga-
zine. I also interpreted this particular discourse as an indication that strongly
negative stereotyping of women and brazen sexism, as expressed in the first
part of the article, was not acceptable, even in a glossy male magazine (which
quite likely is also read by women), and needed to be toned down and wrapped
up in a semi-serious therapeutic tone. Of course, the underlying sexism is still
there, even, or maybe especially in the `therapy-part' of the article. But the ther-
apy discourse seems to make the sexism in the article more acceptable because
of the tone of concern and caring it adopts, even using a literal female voice.

                   Using the Framework in the Classroom

In the first lesson students had not received the framework for analysis which
I discussed above. I felt that it might make the class too formal and I wanted
them to `engage' with the text. For most of the other texts we had discussed
in the course up to that point, I had given them questions specifically geared
towards that particular text. In quite a few instances I found that following the
questions one by one formed a hindrance to the flow of the discussion in class.
In this particular lesson, then, the framework was intended to be more a guide
for myself.

  However, as I will show in chapter 5, in reality, it was very difficult to fol-
low the framework. Whilst it had been designed to take student through the
text progressively, the students themselves did not make that strict separation.
                                                                    Context of Teaching and Research 105

Frequently, in answering one of my questions, they would bring in issues that
related to one of the other points in the framework. Initially, I did say on a
couple of occasions; `this will come later in the lesson', but as that frequently
had the effect of stopping the flow of communication, I tried to steer students
back to the point under discussion - and not always with success. Cooke and
Wallace call this students `not staying on task' (2004: 109). This happened even
more frequently in the second lesson, as the students rather than pre-empting
the next questions, used the text for their own purposes to `talk around the text'
(ibid), as I will show in the next chapter. As a result the framework was followed
only in a very loose sense during both classes.

  To prepare students for the second lesson, the cultuurtekst part of the frame-
work, I gave students a copy of the framework and asked them to answer the
questions related to point 5 as a homework task.

                                   The Students

There are six students on this course, two male, four female. Five of the stu-
dents have followed the whole programme in the department which included
a language course in the first and second year and a year or a half year (varying
between 3 to 8 months) spent in the Netherlands as part of the Year Abroad.
The sixth student was a mature student, Chris, who was in his sixties and who
followed an MA course at the department. All students have had experience of
foreign language learning at an advanced level (i.e. at A-level or comparable)
before they started this degree course. All students except one (Emma) started
the degree course without any prior knowledge of Dutch. Students followed
a variety of degree options which were either BA Dutch or a combination of
Dutch with another modern foreign language.

  All students are white, three are mature students (Chris, Emma and Eve), the
other three either started their degree straight from school or after a gap year.
All students were British, but students had a variety of background experiences.
In addition there were two exchange students from the Netherlands, Marijke
and Yasmin, who I had invited to take part in one of the classes which I use for
data collection. I will describe the individual students below.

                                           Emma

Emma was a mature student in her late twenties. She had lived and worked
for a number of years in the Netherlands before she came to study at our
department. She was the only student in the group who when she started
her degree already had a high competence in Dutch. She was taking the BA
Dutch programme.
106 Reading With My Eyes Open

                                           Claire

Claire had studied in France for a couple of years doing a Baccalaureate, but
had lived in Britain prior to that. She did not speak any Dutch when she started
her study. She was taking the BA Dutch and French programme.

                                            Andy

Andy had taken A-levels at a British school. He did not speak any Dutch
before starting his study. Like Claire, he was taking the BA Dutch and French
programme.

                                           Sarah

Sarah had taken A-levels at a British school. She also started Dutch completely
from scratch. She was studying BA Dutch and German.

                                             Eve

Eve was in her mid-twenties which classified her as a mature student. She had
lived for a brief period in Amsterdam working in a bar. She had a smattering of
Dutch when she started her BA Dutch programme.

                                           Chris

Chris was a mature student in his sixties. He had worked his whole life. He was
taking an MA course at the Dutch department. He had learned Dutch many
years ago and wanted to catch up on his language skills. His Dutch competence
was particularly grammar-based and his writing style tended to be very formal.

                                          Marijke

Marijke was an exchange student from the Netherlands. She was studying lit-
erature at the University of Groningen. She also undertook some work practice
while she was at the department. In this capacity she did vocabulary work with
students in a literature class.

                                          Yasmin

Yasmin was an exchange student from the Netherlands. She was studying at the
University of Amsterdam and was of Turkish descent.

  In chapter 5, I use classroom data mainly, but not exclusively, relating to
Claire, Emma, Sarah and Marijke, because their responses tended to provide
                                                                    Context of Teaching and Research 107

the richest segments of data. In chapter 6 in providing a general overview of
my findings, I also discuss some interview data relating to Claire and Sarah. I
decided to focus on these two students because of their contrasting approaches
to the cultuurtekst pedagogy. One of the students, Claire, could be said to
be a `model student', as she engaged well with this pedagogy. Claire has also,
together with Emma and Marijke, contributed more than the other students
to the classroom discussions. I selected Sarah for this study, because the data
relating to her are significant: she resisted my pedagogy throughout the course
and she was very open and frank about this.

                                   Conclusion

This chapter described the context in which my study took place and I set out
the conceptual framework which I developed to look at texts as part of what I
call the cultuurtekst approach. I draw attention to the tensions, `ruptures' and
frustrations which were part of this study in terms of a number of areas, which
included 1) the conflicting pulls of language teaching discourses in the context
of my work; 2) the organic nature of the study, with paradoxical and `messy'
data and a constant interplay between data, theory and reflection; 3) and in
the classroom itself, when students did not always `play ball' or even resisted
my pedagogy.

  In the next chapter I look at the classroom data of this study in which these
tensions emerge clearly.

                                       Notes

  1 The semantico-grammatical category is one of the four principles under-
    pinning the functional-notional syllabus. The category holds that particular
    meanings are embedded in grammar.

  2 Student feedback was generally positive about the improvement of their
    language competence. The most pleasing comment (for me) on one student
    questionnaire was that the course had been `very thought provoking'. On
    the other hand it needs to be said that my impression was that only the
    more academically motivated students engaged enthusiastically with the
    texts, whereas others treated the texts and activities as just another lan-
    guage exercise.
                             CHAPTER 5

         Tensions in the Classroom

                                  Introduction

In this chapter I look at what happened in the classroom data during the two
lessons in which we discussed the Men's Health text, using the framework for
analysis which I described in chapter 4. During the first lesson we discussed
the text as `text' and looked at it from the perspective of the immediate context,
or the context of situation, which, as I described in chapter 4, I had conceived
of as a pared down version of Hymes' model of communicative competence.

  During the second lesson we looked at the text as a cultuurtekst, i.e. we
looked at it at the level of the context of culture. For the second lesson I had
invited two exchange students from the Netherlands to enhance the intercul-
tural aspect of looking at text as cultuurtekst. I have explained in chapter 4
how these two lessons fitted in with the syllabus as a whole.

  I had conceptualised both lessons to be distinct from one another, with les-
son 1 focusing on the situational context, pedagogically speaking supporting
the second, cultural and intercultural, layer of reading. Both levels of reading
would require students to approach the text from a critical perspective, but I
had envisaged students taking a critical approach to the text from an outside,
seemingly objective stance in lesson 1 and a critical approach of critiquing the
ideological stance in lesson 2.

  To be able to answer the overall question of this study `How do students
engage with the cultuurtekst-pedagogy?' I focus in this chapter on what dif-
ferent ways of reading my focus in these two lessons yielded.

  More particularly, I look at whether the cultuurtekst layer of reading
would enable students to `be intercultural', whether they recognise the range
of (conflicting) discourses in the text, and whether reading the text at a tex-
110 Reading With My Eyes Open

tual level in the first lesson would pedagogically speaking support the read-
ing of text as cultuurtekst in the second lesson. Finally I look at whether the
notion of Dutch articulation is a fruitful one to pursue as part of a cultuurtekst
approach reading.

  A number of tensions emerged from these data, tensions which were located
both in the fact that students' conceptualisation of the text and of the peda-
gogical activity itself were not always straightforward. It is particularly how
students engaged with the text through `dialoguing' and `languaging' which led
me to understand the importance of students' own experience in interpreting
the text, and particularly how these experiences can be utilised and given a
greater role in the classroom.

                   Lesson 1: Text as `Text'

                           The Progress of Lesson 1

This first lesson took place with all six students in the group, 2 male, 4 female.
The students had read the text as homework and I had asked them to underline
and look up the words and expressions they did not know. At the start of the
lesson we quickly went through any queries students still had at a semantic
level. I had not given students a copy of my framework for analysis, so the dis-
cussion was to a large extent teacher-led.

  Whilst lesson 1 was geared towards looking particularly at the level of `text'
as a product and in relation to the immediate context of the aim, audience,
function and structure of the text, students did start to deconstruct the text and
issues of representation and voice also surfaced. I followed the structure of my
framework for analysis loosely. The first 20 minutes or so of the lesson were
taken up by me explaining the task, i.e. that we would look at the text twice over
the course of two different lessons, that in each session we would look at it in
slightly different ways, and that Dutch students would be joining us for the sec-
ond session. I also explained briefly what these two different ways of looking at
text were and that in the second session we would focus on text as `cul­tuurtekst',
i.e. looking at discourses and possible intertextual references. Students had
heard of the terms `discourse' and `intertext', as they had been mentioned in
other classes, but it seems fair to say that the understanding of these concepts
was still somewhat vague. I only explained these in a cursory manner. This
was partly because in previous years when I piloted my course, students had
shown resistance to explicit analysis in class. They felt the language class was
for learning language skills, not for doing text analysis. Equally in previous les-
sons in the course with the cohort of students on whom I am basing this study,
students had responded very negatively when I mentioned the word `discourse'.
One student, Chris, said: `It's always `discourse this and discourse that. It's just
jargon', referring to another (literature) course. Other students were nodding in
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 111

agreement. I felt at that time that we could talk about the issues by referring to
terms such as `ideas', `values', and `network of ideas', as these terms seemed less
`loaded' to students. After all, my aim was not necessarily for students to carry
out a full discourse analysis of texts, but rather to raise awareness of underlying
assumptions in texts. I did not purposely avoid the term `discourse', but I felt we
could talk about all the issues which a critical look at texts would throw up in
language with which students felt comfortable. As it turned out some students
occasionally used the term `discourse' themselves, and whilst students some-
times searched for terms and phrases, they were able to express complex ideas
fluently and at times in an academic voice.

  The level of participation of individual students in this lesson was more or
less on a par with that of other lessons during the year. Noteworthy is that the
male students did not contribute very much to the lessons, though this was
partly reflected in all lessons, as the female students tended to be very articulate
and eager to engage in classroom discussions. Both male students signalled
signs of resistance towards this particular text. Chris particularly disliked the
text and said several times it was a very `bad' (slechte) text. He commented
once that the writer was probably drunk when he wrote it. Andy participated
more than Chris, but tended mainly to contribute only when being addressed
directly. Andy commented that he had not much to say about the text, because
it did not relate to him. Both Andy and Chris rejected the triviality of the text.
Andy commented later in his interview that he felt the topic would have been
better discussed using a `better' text. With this I assumed he meant an academic
text, or one from a `quality' newspaper. The female students in the class on the
other hand clearly were invoking personal experiences and intertextual refer-
ences, even in this first lesson. In my discussion of the data of this first lesson I
am guided by the topics of the framework: content, function and text structure.
A more specific selection of data was guided in the different ways of reading
the text. I will now turn to the discussion of the first point in the framework;
that of `content'.

                            Discussing Text Content

                       Aligning with or Going Beyond the Text

In line with my framework, the first point I wanted students to engage with
was the surface content of the text. My aim with this question was to elicit an
awareness of the surface content, or `preferred reading' of the text, what the
text seemed to be about, at a first reading. Even though in my framework I had
formulated other questions relating to content, particularly whether students
recognised the theme of the topic and in what situations they might have heard
or read about it, it turned out to be difficult to follow this format as the discus-
sion tended to stray from the point at times.
112 Reading With My Eyes Open

  My own interpretation of the surface content of the article was guided by the
introductory paragraph in the text, as well as by recognising a particular rhe-
torical structure, often referred to in the Dutch mother tongue writing peda-
gogy as the `problem-solution' structure (cf. Steehouder, 2006 (1979)). (We had
discussed these rhetorical structures in texts a few weeks earlier.) Applying this
structure to text, the 'problem' would then relate to a `certain type' of women
(single successful career women between 35 and 54) whose `problem' is that
they are not capable of loving and lasting relationships and were thus lacking a
partner to have a baby with.

  The question of what the text is about is of course very open and ambiguous.
In effect I am asking students to give a concise summary in one sentence. And
as we had not at this stage looked at the text in terms of its textual structure, the
students responded from first impressions. Moreover, as I explained in chap-
ter 3, readers bring their own experiences to bear upon interpreting text, so a
wide range of interpretations is to be expected. This highlights the issue that
summarising out of context - a standard pedagogical task in much of language
teaching - is not a disinterested activity. We can only summarise a text if we
know what the reason for the summary is and from which perspective we need
to summarise.

  The students gave indeed a range of different answers:

    Eve

    Eve: ...dat dat soort vrouwen nu bestaan en een beetje gevaarlijk zijn voor
    mannen [...] vrouwen die op jacht willen en jonge mannen willen pakken.
    [...] ja niet gevaarlijk, maar hoe zeg je dat nou? opletten

    G: Ja een waarschuwing voor mannen.

    Eve: ...that these kind of women now exist and are a bit dangerous for
    men [...] women who want to hunt and catch/ grab young men [...]
    well, not dangerous, but how do you say that: `take care'?

    G: Yes, a warning to men.

    Andy

    Andy: Het gaat over dat sommige vrouwen nu een mannelijke identiteit
    hebben.

    G: Wat is het mannelijke daaraan? Wat is het mannelijke aan hun
    identiteit?

    Andy: Dat ze hard zijn geworden..

    Andy: It's about the fact that some women now have a male identity.

    G: What is male about it? What is male about their identity?
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 113

    Andy: That they have become hard...

    Sarah

    Sarah: eh... ik vond het een beetje grappig. Het gaat over hoe mannen ook
    gebruikt kunnen worden.

    G: Als hoofdpunt of als bijpunt?

    Sarah: .... er zitten een heleboel tips in over hoe je deze situatie kunt ver-
    mijden.

    Sarah: I found it a bit amusing. It's about how men also can be used

    G: As main point or as subsidiary point?

    Sarah: ... there are lots of tips in the article about how to avoid this situation.

    Claire

    Claire: Kijk voor mij is dit de ideale vrouw die de ideale man wilt.

    Claire: For me it's about the ideal woman who wants the ideal man.

    Emma

    Emma: Ik denk dat het echt gaat om vrouwen die echt denken dat ze niet
    zonder een man kan; dat ze echt een man nodig hebben.

    Emma: I think it really is about women who really think they can't live
    without a man, that they really need a man.

The question of what the text was about was made even more difficult because
of the range of conflicting discourses and the various textual elements in the
text (e.g. the visual page lay-out of the text which included different headings,
photographs and various text boxes). The students' interpretation of the text
content showed that rather than trying to weigh up the different text elements
together and to decide what the main thrust or point would be, they focused
on only one aspect of the text. In doing so, students' answers depended on what
they had selected as a significant aspect of the article.

  Even though my question was intended to be one of surface content, students
did go beyond that already, and tried to analyse the content in relation to an
aim or an underlying meaning; they gave an `evaluation' of the text, as Halliday
(cf. 1985) calls it. Wallace (2003: 43), referring to Wells (1991), points out that
it is inherent in readers, even very young ones, to discuss the implications of
the text.

  All students presented their answer with a confident voice and took the ques-
tion to be a standard pedagogical one needing a definite answer. They did not
query the ambiguity of the question, nor the ambiguity of the article.
114 Reading With My Eyes Open

            Text Alignment: Discourse of Hard and Aggressive Women

The aim of this first stage of reading the text had indeed been to `stay close to'
the surface content of the text, and not to query any of the underlying ideologi-
cal assumptions or the truth claims made in the text. However, even if students
stayed close to the text, there were still significant differences in their responses.

  Eve applied a common reading strategy to determine what the text was
about. She looked at the first paragraph, where frequently the main point is
introduced. In this introductory paragraph the text explicitly addresses the pre-
sumed male audience and says: `take care: you're being hunted'. In her interpre-
tation Eve is aligning herself with the text's presentation of what the main issue
is; namely to say that `these' women exist and men should be warned against
them. She is interpreting what the text is about from a text functional perspec-
tive; the text aims to achieve something, and that aim is to warn men against
these women. In seeing the content of the text as related to its function, she is
in line with Hymes' paradigm where text function or aim is one of the features
guiding communication.

  However, in describing the women in the text as `scary', Eve also evaluated
the text. She presumably referred to the paragraph in which the women were
described as enjoying `male-bashing' when going out with friends in the even-
ing. In focusing on this particular representation, rather than on any of the
other various representations of women in the text, Eve saw the main point of
the text as embodied in that particular discourse. Eve is confident in her inter-
pretation of the text; she does not add qualifiers or modal particles.

  Andy, similarly to Eve, feels the text is about a certain `type' of women, but
he pinpoints a different representation as the main point. By saying that they
have a male identity, Andy may be referring to the part of the article which is
written in a therapeutic discourse, where the male characteristics that women
have taken on are explained as a response to their perceived lack of paternal
contact. Andy does not elaborate on this, nor does he say the article represents
the women as having a male identity. Instead he states that the text is about the
fact that some women have a male identity. And as such he is staying with the
thrust of the article. He says this in a seemingly objective voice by presenting
his view as factual statement and by not adding a qualifier such as: `according to
me'. The meta-communication that Andy uses is in line with traditional educa-
tional discourse where the teacher asks a questions and the student responds. A
qualifier in such cases is not necessarily a convention that needs to be followed.

  Sarah's answer is interesting, because on the one hand she seems to align
herself with the text position, yet on the other hand she is looking outside the
text to interpret the main issue of the article. Sarah, like Eve and Andy, also
uses a confident voice and uses no qualifiers such as `I think', so she seems to be
confident about her interpretation. However, she is also explicit about her own
response to the article: she thought it was a bit amusing. Sarah is also evaluat-
ing the text; she is assigning meaning to it. Like Eve, she also sees the article in
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 115

terms of its discourse of women who are `dangerous' for men, but Sarah trans-
forms that discourse into one of `exploitation'; the text is about the fact that men
can also be `used'. So, Sarah sees the main focus of the article not so much in
terms of `the fact' that `these kind of women' exist, but instead, she focuses on
the effect these women have on men. Whereas Eve and Andy saw the article in
the light of women, Sarah is seeing the text in relation to men.

  However, Sarah also evokes her knowledge of society to attribute meaning to
the text. By using the modifier `ook' (also) Sarah transposes the issue of women
being used (by men) to men being put in the same role. Being used is not just
happening to women, Sarah seems to be saying. Moreover, Sarah, like Eve also
assigns a functional meaning to the text. By stating that `there are lots of tips in
the article about how to avoid this situation' (of being used by women), Sarah
sees the aim of the text also as informative for men, which could have a real
impact on the readers' lives (avoiding a particular situation).

  Even though the three students above, Eve, Sarah and Andy all hinted at the
particular discourse of `aggressive women', their answers still showed consid-
erable differences, showing the complexity and ambiguity of the question of
what the text is about. Eve stayed closest to the text by focusing specifically on
the introductory paragraph, whereas Andy and Sarah were already `evaluating'
the text. In mentioning the amusing aspect of the article, Sarah pointed to the
`preferred reading' of the text. All three students had interpreted the task as a
traditional language classroom task, and followed the academic discourse for
that. They gave their answers in a seemingly objective voice. They also stayed
on task in seeing text in relation to the immediate context.

                     Going Beyond the Text: Different Discourses

Two other students, Emma and Claire, did not just stay close to the text posi-
tion of the discourse of `hard' women, as Eve, Andy and Sarah had done. They
both allowed a greater role for cultural context in their interpretations. But each
of them drew on a different discourse in the article. Claire took on a position of
critique from the start. By saying that the text was about the ideal woman want-
ing the ideal man in the set of data above, Claire is not only evaluating the text,
in relation to its immediate context, she is relating it already to a context of cul-
ture. It is not clear how she has come to this interpretation, or indeed what she
means by `ideal', although in making this statement, Claire is, like Sarah, clearly
referring to the text-producing environment and indeed discursive formations.
She comes back to this interpretation later on in the lesson when she seems to
refer to the pressure women are under to conform to certain lifestyle character-
istics (e.g. have a great body, wear great clothes, have a great car etc.). In mak-
ing this connection, she is also evoking her life experience and knowledge of
media discourses by seeing the text in the light of these previously encountered
discourses. She comes back to this text fragment several times in the lesson.
116 Reading With My Eyes Open

In contrast to the other students, Claire makes clear that she is not just stating
what the content of the article is, but what she thinks the text is about; Kijk voor
mij is dit... [Look for me this is about...]

  Emma has yet another response to the question of what the text is about. Like
Claire, she is not aligning herself with the position of the hard and aggressive
women, and she brings her own evaluation and interpretation to bear on the
text. She, like Claire, is explicit in stating she is giving her own interpretation (ik
denk dat het echt gaat om..., I think that it is really about...). Her interpretation
centres on one of the aspects of the article which focuses on women who are
unsuccessful in their relationships, as represented through the therapeutic dis-
course of women who go into therapy to help them to have `stable and mature'
relationships. That she feels strongly about her interpretation is shown by the
fact that she used and repeated the word `echt' (really) several times. She did
not explain her interpretation nor why she specifically focused on only this
particular discourse. Both Claire and Emma were already engaged in `discourse
mapping', even if they did not do this explicitly.

  In summary, in the individual answers as to what the text is about, students
focused on the various content aspects of the text, which represented a range
of discourses; aggressive women (who are `bad' for men), women who have a
male identity, pressures on women to be perfect, and women who feel they are
incomplete without a man.

  In doing so, they discuss the text at a range of levels: functional, cultural
(identity and representations) and intertextual (implicit references to other
media representations). So even if the question of content was intended to
focus students' awareness on the superficial text level, students interpreted the
task as an invitation to go beyond the text, to evaluate the text and critique the
ideas and truth claims implicit in it. Even in the answers which stayed closest
to the text, and indeed the intended task, students inscribed their own mean-
ing onto the text and evaluated it in relation to what could lie behind this text.

  However, the contrast in these representations, the aggressive woman versus
the image of fulfilled motherhood, was not seized upon by any of the students
at this stage, and in fact never became a point of focus in either of the two
lessons, despite my efforts to draw students' attention to it. Each student saw
the text only in the light of one discourse, i.e. single-voiced discourse, whether
about `aggressive women' or about `women as mothers'.

                           Discussing Text Function

                             Different Positions of Critique

From the initial statements about the content of the texts, students gradually
started to collaborate to make sense of the text around the questions which
focused more specifically on the pragmatic aspect of the text (audience/aim) as
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 117

well as structure and argument. My intention had been to focus specifically on
this immediate context of text production, but students continued to relate the
text further to its wider cultural context.

  In my own answer to the question of what the text was aiming to achieve,
I indicated that there were two sections in the article where the reader was
addressed directly; in the first paragraph this consisted of a warning (as Eve had
indeed noticed earlier), and further on in the article, as Sarah had noted above,
the reader was presented with advice on `what to do when trapped in a relation-
ship with a career woman'. However, apart from these paragraphs which indi-
cated a warning and advice, at the surface level the article as a whole seemed to
present itself as an informative text, albeit in a humorous tone, setting out the
phenomenon of `single career women' and its `associated problems'.

  Claire focused on the latter notion in saying that the function of the text
was (in part) a commentary. However, as the data below show, Claire's position
shifted immediately from taking part in the classroom exercise of looking at
what the text was aiming to achieve, to critiquing the text itself for its position-
ing. She used both levels of criticality I referred to in chapter 4; on the one
hand she criticised the text for not achieving its aim, and on the other hand she
critiqued the text (albeit implicitly) for its ideological view:

    Claire: Ik denk dat er zijn een paar serieuze commentaren want je denkt,
    ja... er zijn vrouwen die hebben problemen, maar ja sorry hoor, dit is niet
    normaal. er zijn veel vrouwen die ik ken, maar ik ken geen stereotiep...
    Dit is een heel streng stereotiep.

    G: Welk stereotiep?

    Claire: De eerste, op het begin.... `leuke goed gebekte meiden, zalm in de
    koelkast'... ja....

    Emma: Ik weet niet wat hij hiermee wil zeggen. Hij noemt een aantal
    vrouwen op die een bepaalde leeftijd zijn en een bepaalde levensstijl, maar
    wat wil hij daarmee zeggen? Is dat een probleem van alle vrouwen? Of van
    de vrouwen die hij toevallig is tegengekomen?

    G: Ja, maar Claire zegt hij heeft het over een bepaald verschijnsel en jullie
    zeggen ook... je herkent dit verschijnsel, zo van de succ...

    Claire and Emma: de succesvolle carrièrevrouw

    Emma: Maar gaat dit altijd hand in hand met dit [gedrag]?

    Claire: Ja, precies, precies.

    Translation

    Claire: I think there are a few serious comments because you think,
    yes...there are women who have problems, but sorry, this is ridiculous.
118 Reading With My Eyes Open

    I know many women, but I don't know a stereotype[ical one]... this is a
    very strong stereotype.

    G: Which stereotype?

    Claire: The first... at the beginning... `good looking girls with the gift of
    the gab, salmon in the fridge'... yes...

    Emma: I don't know what he intends to say with that. He talks about a
    few women of a certain age and leading a certain lifestyle, but what does
    he want to say with that? Is that a problem of all women? Or just the
    women he has happened to have met?

    G: Yes, but Claire said... you recognise the phenomenon, that of the
    succ...

    Claire and Emma: of the successful career woman

    Emma: Yes, but is that always accompanied by this [behaviour]?

    Claire: Yes, exactly, exactly.

Rather than staying with the task of identifying the aim of the text, which Claire
brushes off with the comment that it could be seen to be a commentary about
problems that women have, she immediately turns to the implication of the text
by relating it to her own experiences and evaluating it in accordance with those.

  Claire makes use of her personal experiences at two levels. In stating that the
text aims to be a serious commentary she legitimises the topic, it seems, and
confirms that `women who have problems' do exist. So she does not dismiss the
text as ludicrous or not worthy of discussion outright (although which `prob-
lems' Claire is referring to is again not clear: women who are `hunting', women
not having successful relationships, women harassing men, women feeling the
biological clock?).

  But Claire also makes use of her lifeworld knowledge as she starts to decon-
struct the text. She looks not just at the text, but she uses - implicitly - the
context of her own experiences as a reality check against which to gauge her
own response to the text; there isn't anyone she knows who is like this. Claire is
moving on from `text' to critique its representation.

  By asking students to look at the text at a textual level in relation to immedi-
ate context, I had assumed students would take on an `outside' position (i.e.
looking at the text for its textual intricacies and specificity at a seemingly objec-
tive level). This outside perspective is surrounded by its own conventions of
`educational talk', where in class students usually employ an `analytical voice'.
However, as Claire is taking on a position of critique and using her experience
of the world to look at text at a cultural level, she, in contrast with the conven-
tion of this approach, switches to using a `personal' voice: `well, I'm sorry, but
this [stereotype] is ridiculous'.
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 119

  Emma then contributes to Claire's analysis and critique by trying to link
the excerpt quoted by Claire with the motivation or intention of the author.
Emma is also critical of the text in different ways. On the one hand she criti-
cises the author's lack of clear purpose and his lack of intellectual rigour in
using stereotypes. But, at the same time she also takes a more critical cultural
perspective on board; she starts to consider that the excerpt is a generalisation
which suggests all women display the same lifestyle characteristics. Both Claire
and Emma are starting to relate the text to social and cultural perspectives and
knowledge, Claire critiquing the text for not according with reality, Emma for
its generalisation.

           Text Alignment in Order to Understand the Male Perspective

Sarah on the other hand, provided a very different take on the idea of what
the text aimed to achieve. Since the students had brought the discussion on
to a cultural level, I wanted to build on this by focussing their attention on
what these particular stereotypes might signify. The stereotypes to which Claire
above had referred, were a set of lifestyle characteristics that successful career
women displayed, such as having a house with a balcony, luxury food, snazzy
car and so on. But when I ask, in response to Claire's statement in the set of
data above, why the author might have chosen those particular clichés, Sarah
interpreted my question not as an invitation to refer to the social world or other
views she may have had. Instead she brought the discussion back to the textual
level referring to the aim of the text, which was indeed the aim of this peda-
gogical activity in the first place. In doing so, Sarah introduced the notion of
the intended reader:

    Sarah: Ik denk dat hij zo begint om ze zo aan te trekken, ze zijn daarin
    geïnteresseerd... als je aan een leuke goed geklede mooie vrouw denkt, dan
    als je als man dat artikel leest dan denk je van `he mmmm' interessant en
    dan wat is het, hoe gaat het verder, dus het is eigenlijk... het trekt precies
    de mannen aan... dus het werkt alsof het zo'n vrouw is, `t zegt: hier is een
    groepje mooie vrouwen en we gaan hun houding bespreken en dat... dus
    het brengt de man die de tekst leest, in, zeg maar, om eh om het verder te
    gaan lezen en aan het eind is het zo andersom dat eigenlijk eh dan wil-
    len ze niet meer... dan zijn ze niet meer in deze vrouwen genteresseerd
    want ze zijn eigenlijk een beetje kinderachtig.

    [...]

    Sarah: Ja maar volgens het artikel... dus aan het eind dan is dan wordt de
    mannen vrijgelaten, zeg maar, van de vrouwen in de tekst.

    G: Hoe wordt hij daardoor vrijgelaten...?
120 Reading With My Eyes Open

    Sarah: Omdat gewoon hoe het aan het eind is dan zou hij niet meer
    genteresseerd zijn in de vrouw want het lijkt alsof ze een beetje stom is en
    nergens naartoe gaat.

    G: Waar zie je dit precies? aan het eind hè, ja `t eind is interessant hè,
    Claire noemde het eind ook al...

    Sarah: Ja ik denk niet dat het oppervlakkig is want `t gaat over de relatie
    met hun vader. Als je kijkt daarnaar dan zie je dat het is een sociologische
    en psychologische analyse over wat er in hun hoofden zitten. Dus eigenlijk
    denk je: ze zijn een beetje gek, het is eigenlijk... ze weten niet wat ze wil-
    len. Ze willen gewoon alles wat ze denken te kunnen krijgen. Dus eh `t
    gaat eigenlijk over de manier waarop mannen oppervlakkig in deze vrou-
    wen genteresseerd zijn, maar de doel van de tekst is eigenlijk te zeggen:
    nou deze vrouwen zijn niet goed voor je want ze kunnen niet goed met je
    praten, want ze kunnen alleen maar over hun praten en...

    G: Ja ze zijn niet goed voor je en ze zijn alleen maar met zichzelf bezig.

    Sarah: Ja.

    Translation

    Sarah: I think that he starts like that to attract them. [To draw the male
    readers into the article] They are interested in that... if you think about
    a nice well-dressed beautiful woman, then when you read the article as
    a man then you think: mmmm interesting and then:...what is it? How
    does it continue? So really. It attracts exactly the men... so it works as
    if it is one of those women, it says: here is a group of beautiful women
    and we are going to talk about their attitude and that... so it brings the
    man who is reading the text in, as it were, to eh to read further and at
    the end it is the other way round that actually eh then they don't want
    them anymore... then they are not interested in these women anymore,
    because really they are a bit childish.

    [...]

    Sarah: Yes, but according to the article... so at the end the men are
    released as it were from the women in the text

    G: How is he released by that?

    Sarah: Because, well just how at the end he is not interested anymore in
    the woman because it seems as if she is stupid and going nowhere.

    G: Where do you see that exactly? The end is interesting isn't it, Claire
    also mentioned the end...
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 121

    Sarah: Yes, I don't think that it is superficial because it is about the rela-
    tionship with their father. If you look at that then you see that it is a
    sociological and psychological analysis about what is in their heads. So
    actually you think... they are a bit mad, it is really... they don't know
    what they want. They really want everything that they think they can
    get. So eh it is really about the way these men are superficially interested
    in these women, but the aim of the text is really to say: these women are
    no good for you because they can't really talk with you, because they can
    only talk about themselves and...

    G: Yes, they are not good for you as they are only concerned with
    themselves.

    Sarah: Yes.

Sarah is constructing a different context in which to interpret the aim of the text
by referring to the intended reader. In explaining why these stereotypes were
mentioned in the text, Sarah focuses on the rhetorical structure of the text. She
sees a parallel between the way that the text is structured as if it were a meta-
phor for the women themselves; the quote which Claire called stereotypical,
(the description of women in terms of lifestyle characteristics) Sarah regards as
a rhetorical effect: the male reader would be attracted to these women because
they are good looking, and so would be inclined to read further. But, further
on in the article, Sarah says, the male reader would realise these women are
`stupid' (stom). With her interpretation Sarah brings the discussion back again
to the textual level; both in term of how the text is constructed which leads her
to conclude that the aim of the text is to say to the reader: `these women are not
good for you'. The text function is then, as Eve had suggested in the first set of
data, a warning to men.

  Assigning a function to a text takes account of a social context; the immediate
context in which the text functions as a communicative act. Sarah did indeed
consider a social context: that of the male reader who needs to be warned
against `these' women. By describing this text function from the perspective of
how a male reader might approach this text, it might seem that Sarah is trying
to read the text interculturally: she is trying to understand the `other'; the `other'
being the male author as well as the male reader for whom the text is intended.
It would seem that Sarah is trying to relate the text to the context of reception,
but as she is not referring to previous knowledge, or experiences of the context
of the intended readers of the text, she is taking her cue from the text itself. So
by explaining how a male reader might read the text, she is actually `imagining'
this context.

  Like Emma and Claire, Sarah focuses just on one of the discourses in the
article; but unlike Claire and Emma, she does not see the article to be about
women who are out to hunt or hurt men, but women who are `stupid' and `a
122 Reading With My Eyes Open

little bit mad'. She seems to refer to the part of the text which describes women
in therapy in order to deal with their inability to have long-term relationships.
She does not see the text as representing women as such, but as a description
of how women `are'.

  Sarah, like Emma and to a lesser extent Claire, also feels sure about her inter-
pretation is the `correct' one. In one of her interviews she later states that she
really doesn't see how you can interpret the article in any other way.

                           Discussing Text Structure

                                 Conflicting Discourses

My intention with focusing on textual structure was to encourage students to
recognise the different ways in which the women in the text were portrayed.
This would then prepare the way for seeing the text as cultuurtekst and the
multiple and contrasting discourses embedded in it. In the course of the dis-
cussions so far, students had located their comments regarding the text always
within one particular representation of the women, one particular discourse.
Students were not necessarily aware that they saw the text in terms of a repre-
sentation. In this lesson, I did not use the meta-language of the cultural studies
oriented analysis, which makes up the cultuurtekst part of the framework we
would discuss in the next lesson. Students seemed to regard their interpreta-
tion as `obvious'. As I had said before, students felt confident about their inter-
pretation, and at no point did they seize on the conflicting answers that each
student seemed to give in terms of what they thought the main point or aim of
the text was. Students then read the text as, what Kramsch (1993: 27) calls after
Bakhtin, a `single-voiced discourse'.

  Only Claire had voiced her concern with the conflicting discourses. When
I asked earlier in the lesson whether there was an argument in the article,
she said:

    Claire: Maar ik denk dat het begint met een idee en dat het eindigt niet
    met hetzelfde idee, of in het midden is er een... there's wires crossed.

    Claire: But I think that it starts with an idea and it does not end with the
    same idea, or in the middle there is eh... wires crossed.

In the data below, I am trying to focus students' attention to the contrast of
the discourses in the beginning and end of the article; what Claire described
as `having its wires crossed'. The set of data below starts with me asking how
women are represented at the end of the article (i.e. in terms of fulfilled moth-
erhood) in comparison to the beginning, where women were first described in
terms of `ladette' behaviour out to `destroy men', and in the paragraph following

that, where they are represented in terms of their consumerist lifestyle. Claire
and Emma disagree in their interpretation:

    G: ... je zei eerder het is een vreemd eind van de tekst heel anders... de
    vrouw wordt aan het eind totaal anders beschreven dan aan het begin.
    Hoe wordt ze anders beschreven?

    Emma: een beetje zielig.

    G: Wordt ze als zielig beschreven? Vanuit wie gezien? Vind jij dat ze zielig
    is of vindt de schrijver dat?

    Sarah: wWt betekent zielig?

    G: Pitiful, iemand waar je medelijden mee zou hebben.

    Claire: Maar de vrouw op het eind zegt... eeh ja, `mijn relatie gaat nu
    al vijf jaar hartstikke goed: dat is echt heerlijk'. Maar het is... wennen...
    `zeker voor vrouwen van mijn generatie'. Dus voor haar, zij is een andere
    vrouw, ze heeft geleerd en nu ...alles gaat goed, nu heeft zij een man en een
    kind en zij heeft... ja...

    [Claire and Emma talk at the same time, but I think Emma says]:

    Emma: Dus hij heeft toch eigenlijk wel bereikt wat het doel was waar al
    die vrouwen naar streven.

    G: ja maar dat is de psychologe dus...

    Emma: ja, maar dat is dus het man-en kindverhaal.

    G: ... You said before that the text has a strange end... very different...
    at the end the woman is described very differently from the beginning.
    How is she portrayed differently?

    Emma: a bit `zielig' [pitiful].

    G: is she described as pitiful? From whose perspective? Do you think
    she is pitiful or does the author think that?

    Sarah: What does `zielig' mean?

    G: pitiful, someone whom you would pity.

    wonderful', but it is... getting used to... `for women of my generation'. So

    [Claire and Emma talk at the same time, but I think Emma says]:

    Emma: so he has achieved what the aim was of all those women.

    G: Yes, but she is a psychologist so...

    Emma: Yes, but that is the husband and child narrative.

Emma does not take my question as an invitation to describe what that particu-
lar representation was, but she momentarily steps outside the classroom dis-
course of text analysis, and uses a personal voice by making a value statement:
the women (as described at the end of the text) are to be pitied. Claire disagrees
with that particular value judgement; after all, she says, the woman in the text
describes herself as happy. She has learnt [from her therapy] and now every-
thing goes well. Claire further quotes from the text itself, saying that women of
her (i.e. the female psychologist's) generation have `had to learn', but now `eve-
rything is going well'. Claire is trying to find evidence in the article to describe
this particular discourse, but Emma responds to Claire by switching the focus
from the text and the portrayal of women in that last section, to the author: `he
has achieved what the aim was for all those women', and she concludes by say-
ing: `that is the `husband and child narrative'', which she explained earlier as the
way that women are seen as reaching fulfilment only through motherhood. So
Emma seems to suggest that since the article finished with this particular repre-
sentation, this shows that the representation of women as fulfilled by their rela-
tionship and `happy motherhood' is the `solution' or most important discourse
of the article: he [the author] achieved what all those women want. Emma looks
at the text from a critical ideological perspective; she critiques the intensely tra-
ditional view of women finding happiness only in marriage and motherhood,
but in this critique she is not considering any of the other discourses and rep-
resentations. The discourse or representation of women as taking on the `male'
characteristics of achievement and success, she did not mention.

  Claire is much more prepared to see the text in its complexities of conflicting
discourses, and is still struggling to make sense of the text. Emma is not. She is
sure of her interpretation.

                              Conclusion Lesson 1

The focus of this first lesson was to look at text on a textual level and in relation
to the immediate context. What emerged was that, even at this level of look-
ing at text, many different interpretations are possible. The range of answers
students gave to the first question about the content of the text showed how
complex and ambiguous such a question is. Indeed, I take a view that text
interpretation is a process in which readers use their experiences and lifeworld
knowledge to give meaning to the text, not to extract pre-existing meaning (see
chapter 3). However, that does not mean we should allow for a limitless number
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 125

of interpretations in pedagogical activities. I believe, along with Wallace (2003:
16) that we can talk about a range of `preferred readings' of text. The answers to
the question about content showed that students do not look at text in a disin-
terested way. Even if students try and stay close to the text in their answers, they
still inscribe meaning, they `evaluate' the text, and see it in relation to its context
in relation to its effect on the world; e.g. the text is about women who have a
male identity, the pressure to be `perfect', or about how women `use' men, or,
in total contrast, that women only gain happiness through having a stable rela-
tionship and a child: what one student called the `husband and child narrative'.

  This may show that seeing text as stable, which is in effect the assumption
underlying questions such as what the text is about, is an artificial and ambigu-
ous task.

  Another significant aspect to emerge from the data of this first lesson, is that
in ascribing meaning to the text, students tend to focus on only one of the
discourses within the text, rather than seeing the text in its entirety and with
a complexity of multiple discourses. Critical thinking merged with critique of
ideology in some instances.

                    Lesson 2: Cultuurtekst

Of the group of 6 regular students Sarah and Andy were not present in this
lesson, but two exchange students from the Netherlands, Yasmin and Marijke
joined this class. I had invited them to create a dialogic space in the classroom
as well as an intercultural element in which students could discuss various
interpretations and relate to other texts which drew on similar or significantly
different discourses. Because I wanted to introduce the idea of `Dutch articula-
tion', i.e. what I perceived to be the intensely traditional discourse on women,
I also thought the presence of the Dutch students might add an extra layer of
interculturality. To ensure the Dutch students were prepared for this class I had
given them a few articles we had discussed during this block on gender, and the
framework for analysis that guided our discussions. I had also briefly discussed
with the Dutch students the issue of `cultuurtekst' and I had given them a pho-
tocopied handout of a few pages from a book by Maaike Meijer, in which she
discusses the notion of cultuurtekst. This meant that the Dutch students were
more explicitly prepared for this class on a theoretical level than the regular
students of the class, as these had not received the text by Maaike Meijer. As I
explained in chapter 4, I had not been explicit throughout the course about its
underpinning theories, as I had assumed, partly based on previous experiences
in other classes, that students would not appreciate theoretical discussion or
information as part of a language class.

  To prepare the regular English students for this particular class I had asked
them to complete a homework task. This task was to write down their answers
to the cultuurtekst section under point 5 of the analysis for framework we used
126 Reading With My Eyes Open

(see appendix). These questions were designed to get students to recognise
which discourses underpinned the text, and asked how the topic and subjects
in the text were talked about; how the reader seems to be addressed; which
discourses or intertexts they recognised, and whether these were in any way
conflicting with one another. All of these questions asked for specific references
to linguistic points of vocabulary or grammar to explain their answer. Sarah
was the only student who had not carried out this piece of homework. Emma
had given her own interpretation to the task and rather than treating it as an
academic and analytical exercise she wrote a spoof on the original text as if it
was an article in a glossy women's magazine.

                           The Progress of Lesson 2

The aim of the second lesson was to discuss the text as `cultuurtekst': text as a
cultural construct through discursive mapping. I had wanted to draw students'
attention to the prominence of particular discourses in the text, and how these
took on an aura of `truth'. The issues of representation had surfaced in the first
lesson, but I wanted students to recognise the cultural locatedness of the text,
i.e. the different discourses and values, and to see whether the range of different
discourses added an extra layer of meaning to the text.

  The lesson moved from eliciting some initial responses from the Dutch stu-
dents to discussing issues of representation: how maleness and femaleness was
constructed and what particular values, intertexts and discourses were recog-
nisable. Finally we moved to the question whether this issue is talked about
differently in England and Holland; in other words was there a Dutch articula-
tion? By the exercise of discursive mapping, as well as looking at `Dutch articu-
lation', I asked students in effect to look at both a `generic' and a `differential'
level of language and culture (see chapter 3).

  After the short discussion around the initial responses of the Dutch students,
I had asked students to do an exercise in pairs to look specifically at how men
and women were represented in the text and to make a list of words and expres-
sions which showed that. The aim of the exercise was to encourage students to
see these different discursive formations through looking at the language used.
By doing the exercise I hoped to make the (conflicting) discourses visible. After
this exercise we looked at the text in sections by which I hoped that the students
would recognise the different voices with which women were represented. So
far in the first lesson only Claire had picked up the issue of the different repre-
sentations. In the second lesson which I discuss below, students were `dialogu-
ing' more with one another and responding to one another's comments than in
the previous lesson.

  On the whole the Dutch students took a fairly equal part and the English
students were not particularly more interested in what the Dutch students had
to say in comparison to themselves. The Dutch students were perhaps a little
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 127

reticent and less likely to respond as this was a new group and also a new way of
looking at texts. The English students felt very comfortable in their comments
about how things were `done' in the Netherlands; as they had lived there during
the year abroad, they felt their observations were valid.

  My role during this lesson was less fore-grounded than in the first lesson.
Whereas I asked questions to initiate discussions, responded to students'
answers, and asked students to elaborate on certain points, on the whole I took
a background role. Students were dialoguing and engaged in the discussions,
frequently without any prompting from me.

  I did not use the questions on the framework explicitly, as it had become clear
during the first lesson, that working our way through the framework rigidly
stopped the flow of the discussion. Nevertheless, there was a progress in the
lesson as I had the framework questions in my mind, and through the discus-
sions the notion of discourses and values in the text were gradually made more
explicit by the students. However, this process did not take place neatly in a
linear way and also led to misunderstandings amongst students as they some-
times were more interested in discussing the issues which were thrown up as
a result of having highlighted the discourses, rather than seeing the text as the
micro cosmos in which these discourses were reflected and recreated. It turned
out that the presence of the Dutch students helped to make the discussion more
focussed. I will start with the latter point below, and then move on to discuss
how students engaged with the text and its underpinning values in an increas-
ingly intercultural and ethnographic manner.

     Role of the Dutch Students: Towards an Understanding of the
                             Socio-cultural Context

My expectations of the role of the Dutch students had been that the English stu-
dents would be more to the point in their answers, because they had experience
of discussing texts in previous classes, albeit not using an explicit framework.
As it turned out, it worked the other way round. The inclusion of the Dutch stu-
dents in the lesson immediately raised the level of discussion, as their responses
prompted more dialogic responses from the other students.

  In giving their first responses to the text, both Dutch students straight away
took an evaluative stance to the text and considered, without being prompted,
what might lie behind the stereotypical representation of women in the text:

    G: Wat is jullie eerste reactie op de tekst... puur persoonlijk en waar ging
    de tekst over naar jouw gevoel?

    Yasmin: Heel herkenbaar, ja. Als je naar programma's kijkt als `Sex in the
    city' en `Ally McBeal' dan gaat het echt daarover. En dit artikel, ja dat was
    niet iets nieuws... ik herkende alles.

    G: Je herkende, wat precies?
128 Reading With My Eyes Open

    Yasmin: Nou zeg maar die hoger opgeleide vrouwen die een man wil om
    haar leven, zeg maar, compleet te maken en dat lees je ook in tijdschriften
    als Cosmopolitan en normale kranten ook en dergelijke, voorgekauwd spul
    was dit... ja dat heb ik heel vaak gelezen.

    Translation

    G: What is your first reaction to the text... purely personal reaction and
    what was the text about, you feel?

    Yasmin: Very recognisable, yes, when you look at programmes like `Sex
    in the city' and `Ally McBeal' then it is really about that. And this article,
    yes it was nothing new... I recognised everything.

    G: You recognised what exactly?

    Yasmin: Well, those well-educated women who want a man to make
    their life, well, complete. You read that also in magazines like `Cosmo-
    politan' and also normal newspapers, hackneyed stuff this was, yes I
    have read this often.

The dialogue continues:

    Marijke: Dat was mijn reactie ook wel. Om nou te zeggen... ja, ik herken
    het natuurlijk ook wel, ik heb ook artikelen gelezen dat je ook over al die
    series op tv over vrouwen...

    Claire: Ja, dat stereotiepe ook.

    Marijke: Ja en als ik dan denk van... ja, ik herken het omdat ik er vaker
    over heb gelezen, ik herken het niet als verschijnsel in de maatschappij... ik
    heb dit soort vrouwen nog nooit gezien. Ja, eigenlijk vind ik het een beetje
    belachelijk dat mannen vernielen, ik vind dat heeeel kinderachtig. Zijn er
    echt vrouwen... is er een hele beweging van vrouwen die dat soort dingen
    serieus doen?

    Yasmin: Ja, je leest er wel verhalen over, maar gebeurt het ook op grote
    schaal? Ik ken persoonlijk niemand die zo is.

    Translation

    Marijke: That was my reaction as well. Well... yes, I recognise it of course,
    I have also read articles like that and all those series on tv about women...

    Claire: Yes, the stereotypes...

    Marijke: Yes and when I think... yes, I recognise it because I have read
    about it more often, but I don't recognise it as a phenomenon in soci-
    ety... I have never seen these women. Yes, actually I think it is a bit
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 129

    ridiculous... that `destroying men' thing, I find it veeeery childish. Are
    there really women... is there really a whole movement of women who
    are really doing that kind of thing?

    Yasmin: Yes, you read about it, but does it really happen on a large scale?
    I personally don't know anyone who is like that.

Yasmin first responds by saying she recognised the issue of highly educated
women who want a man to make their life complete. But she immediately
made explicit that she recognised the ideas by having read about them in glossy
magazines as well as in `normal' newspapers. So Yasmin located the article in
an intertextual relationship with global media discourses. The Dutch students
were not just criticising the article for using stereotypes (although they did
that too), but they were at the same time relating the article to the wider issue
that these stereotypes indeed existed and were not only recognisable, but were
hackneyed (Yasmin). This was a collaboration: Yasmin initially felt that the arti-
cle portrayed something very recognisable, but Marijke takes her point further;
she recognises the stereotypes because she has read about them so often, but
she considers that these stereotypes do not relate to reality. Marijke, then, sepa-
rated the `cultuurtekst' (the underlying ideas in the text) from actual reality.

  During the next exchange Emma considered what could be behind the
creation of such stereotypes in the media, and how these ideas could become
dominant, considering they do not relate to reality. And again in the ensuing
dialogue, a collaboration takes place between Emma and one of the Dutch stu-
dents, Marijke, who helped to make a more explicit link with the cultural con-
text of the article:

    Emma: Misschien dat soort benoemingen dan, van mannen - of vrou-
    wen vernielers, misschien is dat ooit een keer gezegd als grapje, en is dat
    gewoon opgenomen in de maatschappij en is dat opgenomen door man-
    nen, of ja, door wie, en misschien van daar is het een verschijnsel in de
    geschreven... eh pers geworden, want ja, ik denk, ja, er zijn vaak genoeg
    vrouwen inderdaad die toch gewoon gelukkig zijn om alleen te zijn en die
    inderdaad op een beetje fun uit zijn, die wel eens een man versieren. `t Is
    niet zozeer dat ze een man willen vernielen, maar net als mannen, die
    willen verder niks... (onverstaanbaar)... ja, en daar houdt het dan mee op.

    Marijke: Ja, `t kan ook best wel dat je... want het is natuurlijk een heel
    interessant onderwerp, iets zoals dit, dus als je er ook maar een klein beetje
    aan ruikt of iets opvangt wat een beetje in die trant zit van vrouwen die
    een man gaan vernielen, dat klinkt heel interessant en dan kun je daar
    ook een prachtig artikel over schrijven wat al die mannen ook als een gek
    gaan zitten te lezen... ik bedoel, `t blijft gewoon een ontzettend interessant
    onderwerp, man versus vrouwen.
130 Reading With My Eyes Open

    Emma: Ja precies, kijk wat een man doet, als een man uitgaat en een
    vrouw versiert, nou dat is gewoon normaal, niemand kijkt daar van op,
    maar als een vrouw dat doet, dat wordt nog steeds gewoon beoordeeld.

    Marijke: Misschien is dat dan wel de waarde of het beeld dat je eruit kunt
    halen, hè, dat `t van vrouwen niet... dat `t niet bij ons beeld van vrouwen
    past om uit te gaan en mannen te versieren.

    Translation

    Emma: Maybe that those kind of labels: `destroying men/male bashing'
    or women, maybe that has been said once as a joke and that label has
    just been taken over in society and taken over by men or yes, and maybe
    from there it became a phenomenon in the press, because yes, I think
    there are often enough women who are indeed just happy to be on their
    own and who indeed are out to have some fun, who would like to get it
    off with a man, not that they want to destroy a man, but who just like
    men... and who do not want anything more than that (inaudible) and...
    well that's all there is to it.

    Marijke: Yes, it is also possible that you... because it is of course a really
    interesting topic, something like this, so if you sniff at it only a little or
    if you catch something in the sense of women who are going to destroy
    a man, that sounds very interesting and then you can write a wonderful
    article about it which all those men are going to read like mad... I mean,
    it remains such an interesting topic: men versus women.

    Emma: Yes, exactly, look what a man does... when a man goes out and
    gets it off with a woman, that is just normal, it is expected. But when a
    woman is doing that it is still being criticised.

    Marijke: Maybe that is the value or the image you can recognise, that it
    doesn't fit in the image we have of women to go out and pick up a man.

Emma's initial suggestion that the description of women as `mannenverniel-
ers' (`destroyers of men'/'male-bashers') had come into use purely by accident,
through a joke that then became part of an accepted notion in society, does
not consider in any way its social or cultural origins, ideologies or power rela-
tions. Emma's suggestion does not really refer to any previous knowledge or
experience either, it seems. It is an attempt at explaining an existing and rec-
ognisable discourse as not located within a particular socio-cultural context,
but as a chance happening. Marijke then takes Emma's suggestion on board,
but instead of accepting Emma's version, she locates the emergence of `labels'
within the commercial text-producing environment; the magazine needs to
attract readers, and gender relations, after all, constitute a very interesting
topic, Marijke says.
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 131

  Emma builds further on this and this time she does make a link with the
socio-cultural context. She relates the representation of women as being sexu-
ally aggressive to cultural conventions: what is `normal' behaviour for a man
is not deemed acceptable in a woman. It is Marijke who makes this even more
explicit and brings this back to what the text then might signify as a whole;
that `chasing men' is not part of the acceptable image of women in our soci-
ety. Marij­ke is already referring to discourse here: the implicit conventions and
assumptions of how women should behave.

  So Emma, even though she thought she was agreeing with Marijke,
approaches the text initially from a perspective outside society. Marijke tries
to formulate it from a socio-cultural perspective and tries to engage with the
values underpinning the text straight away, which Emma then responds to.
The students then are starting to engage with the notion of how gender is con-
structed in the article; they have started to `map' the discourses through their
dialogic interaction. In the set of data I discuss below, Claire takes the mapping
of discourses further still.

               Reading from Inside or Outside Perspectives

The fairly heated exchange below shows the very different approaches between
Emma and Claire in terms of conceptualising text and context. Claire was dis-
cussing the particular fragment in the text1 (which Emma and Claire had also
disagreed over in lesson 1), which she said was being stereotypical. Claire had
just mentioned that she thought these stereotypes consisted of women being
represented as having masculine traits:

    G: En jij vindt dat mannelijk. Wat is er mannelijk aan?

    Claire: Ik vind dat mannelijk want de vraag die ik citeer over seksueel ren-
    dement... voor mij is dat heel mannelijk, want ik vind dat dat is hetzelfde
    als de vrouwen in het eerste voorbeeld en dus voor mij is dat eh hij doet een
    eh `t franse woord `rapprochement' eh ja...

    Claire: Wat is dat in het Nederlands of Engels? `t Brengt dat eh...

    Marijke: Toenadering.

    Claire: Ja...

    G: Hij brengt die twee dingen bij elkaar.

    Claire: Ja.

    G: Maar hoe...wat is er nou precies... hoe komt het dat dat op elkaar lijkt...

    clothes, cellulitisvrij... getrainde billen...

    Claire: Nee, maar...
    Emma: Maar dat zeg je dan.
    Claire: Nee, ik vind dat als je dat vind belangrijk, ja ik vind dat een beetje
    mannelijk.
    Emma: Dus jij wil gewoon onderdanig blijven aan een man en met geld...
    G: Emma, Claire zegt volgens mij niet dat dat mannelijk is, maar dat de
    schrijver het presenteert als mannelijk, dat de maatschappij dat zo vindt.

    Claire: Maar wanneer je een lijst maakt met alle dingen... ik...
    Emma: Hij beschouwt het als mannelijk.

    chien niet die billen

    G: Nou, die billen zijn wel belangrijk natuurlijk. Waarom zijn die...
    Claire: Seksueel.
    G: Omdat hij toch de vrouw daardoor als seksueel aantrekkelijk neerzet.

    was er toch niet zo...

    Claire: Sexual.
    G: Because he is portraying the women still as being sexually attractive.
    [...]
    Claire: Listen... roof terrace or balcony... yes, trendy little car, well, not
    the cellulite, how do you say that for men...?
    Marijke and Yasmin: Six-pack.
    Claire: Six-pack, yes, not the make-up, but the fridge with salmon and
    champagne and the job with prospects... yes, for me that can be male.
    Eve: A typical bachelor...
    [...]
    G: So, the women are described in those successful economically suc-
    cessful terms and focused on achievement... eh... he also says some-
    where... eh... he defines being male as eh... achieving... on page... I
    don't know...
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 135

    Marijke: Yes on page 49 at the end: `that's how they build a... by achiev-
    ing things'.

    G: Yes, indeed. Achieving... is part of the male identity, yes, so in other
    words I repeat what was said is a male characteristic.

    Emma: Yes, then I agree with you that indeed that is how it is presented,
    but...

    Claire: Yes, yes.

    Emma: But...

    G: Yes, you don't agree with him.

    Emma: No.

Claire and Emma had discussed the same text fragment (the one about designer
clothes etc.) in the first lesson, and they had both agreed that it represented a
negative view of women, but they had each interpreted it differently. Emma had
seen this fragment as representing women as superficial, being only interested
in clothes and make-up, whereas Claire had seen it in terms of the representa-
tion of an `ideal' that women would need to live up to. Those interpretations
were forgotten now, and both Emma and Claire seem to agree that in this frag-
ment women are described as being successful, having achieved a certain status
due to these materialist possessions.

  Claire notes that this particular representation of describing women in terms
of success is gendered: success is represented as a male characteristic. But Emma
does not seem to recognise that Claire is making a statement about a represen-
tation in the text and she assumes that it is Claire's own opinion that success
constitutes a male characteristic. Emma steps outside the meta-communicative
style of the classroom discussion and seems to forget we are engaging in the
pedagogic activity of analysing a text. She feels so strongly about this that she
almost launches a personal attack on Claire: `Dus jij wilt gewoon onderdanig
blijven aan een man en met geld...?' (So you want to stay submissive to a man
and with money...?).

  When I am trying to build on Claire's point that the way that the women are
presented is almost in male terms, and when I try and articulate that in terms
of economic success and a focus on achievement (which the author later in the
article explicitly defines as being a male characteristic), only Marijke latches on
by pointing out where in the text this is said. Only then does Emma agree that,
yes, this is an issue of representation, but states yet again that she doesn't agree
with the view that success could be seen as a male characteristic.

  Emma then seems to firmly remain outside the article, not trying to under-
stand the text as discursive formations, but responding to the statement almost
as an item for debate. Claire, on the other hand is trying to understand the
text fragment in the context of the article itself and link it to its socio-cultural
136 Reading With My Eyes Open

environment. By doing so, Claire is moving away from looking at the text as a
product, and is starting to see the text as cultuurtekst, i.e. the discourses which
underpin the text. Claire made use of her socio-cultural knowledge to come
to this analysis and took on a position of critique. But, paradoxically, Emma's
strong criticism of the text using her personal experiences or views, formed a
hindrance to a position of critique as she saw the text in relation to a discussion
about content, not a discussion about discourses. Claire saw this fragment in
terms of culturally located ways of presenting male and femaleness, Emma saw
this as a statement of truth, and she drew the discussion on to personal terms.
This might suggest that a strong emphasis on personal experience, which is not
being reflected upon, can be detrimental to being critical and even be stereo-
type confirming.

  However, as a result of the interplay between theory, data and my own reflec-
tion, I realised in the later stages of this study that Emma's response to the
text cannot be solely explained by her taking a position outside the text. It
was precisely her emotional response to Claire's pinpointing of the particu-
lar discursive forces in society which represent success and independence as
the prerogative of men, which alerted me to the fact that Emma was engaging
with the text, and more so with Claire's responses to the text, in a critical way,
critiquing the ideologically motivated content, and how a truth-certainty is
maintained about gender. Her emotional response was directed at these par-
ticular discursive understandings, even if she mistakenly believed that Claire
personally held that particular view. Through asking Claire directly whether
she would like to remain dependent on a man and his money, Emma brought
both the personal and political domain into the classroom. Since I felt uncom-
fortable with the emotional and passionate tone of the discussion, I intervened,
without giving this personal political element a chance to develop. However,
the next set of data shows a moment in the class where that did happen. It
shows that students' engagement with their personal experiences can indeed
be a step towards a critical engagement with the discursive forces of the text-
producing environment.

           Lifeworld Knowledge: Being an Intercultural Reader

The fragment below shows that instead of being a hindrance to engaging with
text meaning, referring to one's own experience of the world could indeed aid
the process of being critical in problematising the text, and being intercultural.
The personal and cultural can combine to aid students to become intercultural
readers. When the exchange below took place in the lesson, I felt at the time
that the discussion had moved away from the text and that students used the
text merely as a vehicle for a discussion about the topic. My aim throughout
the lesson had been to get students to focus on the text and to point to the lan-
guage in the fragment to prove their points, so I was initially disappointed that
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 137

discussions like the one below developed, even though I recognised the value
of having debates like this. Looking at the exchange now, I think it shows that
students did have a meaningful and intercultural dialogue by collaborating in
their interpretative discussion and making use of their personal experience.
In doing so they were critical from an inside as well as outside perspective.
Students were both intercultural in the sense of understanding the complex-
ity of culture (cf. Blommaert, 1998; Holliday et.al, 2004) and they were `being
intercultural' (Phipps and Gonzalez, 2004) in trying to understand the `other',
in this case `the male', in relation to their own experiences. Students tried to
understand the text and its underpinning discourses; they also critiqued, as a
group, these discourses, which in turn led them to look at their own situation
in a different light again.

    Claire: Maar we zeggen één ding en we denken een ander ding. Ik denk
    dat ik heb hetzelfde probleem, ik zeg altijd ik kan doen wat ik wil, ik kan
    carrière hebben of niet, wat ik wil, maar ook in mijn gezin [mijn eigen
    familie, GQ], ze zegt altijd, wanneer is het huwelijk, wanneer komt de
    kinderen en dat is een heel, ja, ik vind het heel moeilijk en ik denk dat dat
    is een normaal probleem van vrouwen in deze tijd, ja de... hoe zeg je dat?

    G: Ja de rol, de veranderende rol.

    Claire: Ja, de rol, je kan alles zijn of niks zijn, maar het is moeilijk om een
    balans te vinden.

    Marijke: Ja, blijkbaar vinden mannen dat ook heel moeilijk dat ze niet
    goed weten wat ze nou van een vrouw moeten verwachten en dat daarom
    zo'n artikel ook gepubliceerd wordt omdat dat daarop ingaat van wat voor
    wat willen vrouwen nou eigenlijk en hoe zitten ze in elkaar...

    G: En wat willen ze zelf?

    Emma: En wat willen mannen?

    G: Ja, precies dat bedoel ik.

    Emma: Willen ze een hoer hebben of een moeder?

    G: Een hoer en een madonna.

    Claire: Ja, een hoer in de slaapkamer en een moeder in...

    Marijke: [lacht] Ja, in de huiskamer of zo...

    [door elkaar praten. lemand zegt]:

    In de keuken

    G: Ja, inderdaad. Zit er ook iets in van jaloezie? Dat de vrouw...

    Claire: Alles kan hebben.
138 Reading With My Eyes Open

    G: ...een bedreiging vormt? de man is nu zijn positie kwijt als degene die
    presteert, mannelijke identiteit is het leveren van bepaalde prestaties.

    Claire: Dat is het feministenidee dat ik heb de laatste tijd ook met mijn
    Franse professor zo gepraat. Zij zegt dat sinds het begin van de tijd, man-
    nen hebben een probleem, want vrouwen kunnen de kinderen hebben en
    mannen niet en dus mannen hebben vrouwen eh `repressed'?

    Marijke: Onderdrukt.

    Claire: Onderdrukt... enne nu vrouwen kunnen een carrière hebben en
    een huis en een baan en ze kunnen alleen wonen als we wilt, ja we kunnen
    alles doen en dat is een grote probleem voor mannen en ze weten niet wat
    ze willen en ze moeten denken...

    Marijke: Maar dan zou je kunnen zeggen dat dit artikel... juist die
    nadruk op de carrièrevrouw die, zeg maar, helemaal de plank misslaat,
    een be­scherming is van hé , het is altijd van ons geweest om een carrière te
    hebben en om te presteren en nu doen die vrouwen het ook, maar kijk eens
    naar ze, ze kunnen er niks van, `t gaat helemaal mis met ze, dus om dat
    ook een beetje te beschermen van `ja, maar het is toch ook een beetje van
    ons', want, ja, al kunnen ze het wel... toch niet zo goed als wij.

    G: ja, dus wat spreekt daar dan..., als we dat dan bijvoorbeeld vergelijken
    met Liesbeth Wietzes artikel van de man als dinosaurus, de mannen heb-
    ben hun positie verloren, ze zijn meelijwekkende wezens geworden, eh het
    was een heel extreme visie van haar, ze bracht het heel extreem, omdat het
    polemisch bedoeld was, maar herken je daar misschien iets in, zeg je, ja
    er is een bepaald maatschappelijk verschijnsel niet zozeer het maatschap-
    pelijk verschijnsel zoals hij het beschrijft over die agressieve jonge vrouwen,
    maar is er een maatschappelijk verschijnsel dat mannen, of vrouwen ook,
    in de war zijn, niet meer precies zoeken zoeken naar...een andere vorm...

    Emma: Ja, ik weet het niet, het is heel moeilijk, maar ik ben niet in de
    war, als vrouw zijnde heb ik geen probleem dat ik ook een carrière wil en
    desnoods kinderen en getrouwd zijn.

    Marijke: Maar denk je dat dat gaat lukken ook als je dat allemaal wil?

    Emma: Dat weet ik niet en als het niet lukt, ok, daar heb ik ook geen
    probleem mee.

    Claire: Maar ik denk ook dat de vrouw niet kan accepteren dat het ok is
    om geen man te hebben. Er is een...

    Emma: Vrouwen kunnen dat niet accepteren?

    Claire: Nee, de maatschappelijke mensen, ja, vrouwen, ik denk dat het
    misschien is het... het is dom, want ik weet dat zonder man kan ik gewoon
    functioneren op een normale wijze.
                                                                         Tensions in the Classroom 139

Marijke: Ja...

Claire: Ja, er is misschien een soort idee en...

Marijke: Maar er is toch ook een soort restant van dat hele traditionele dat
je toch ook een, dat je toch het idee hebt dat je een man nodig hebt en als
je dan ook kijkt naar `Ally McBeal' en al die series, je zit er toch ook op te
wachten dat ze eigenlijk een vriendje krijgt?

Emma: Maar is het ook niet zo tegenwoordig dat er voor mannen een
beetje een nieuw concept is dat zij gewoon een vrouw nodig hebben voor
eh eh `companionship'?

lemand zegt Gezelschap.

Emma: Gezelschap, want mensen als wezens, ik denk zijn niet bedoeld om
alleen te zijn, man of vrouw, `t maakt niet uit. Misschien is het dan voor
mannen, misschien moeten ze een hoofd er...

Claire: Get their head around it.

Emma: Ja, het idee dat die mogen ook kwetsbaar zijn, die mogen ook
zeggen, ja eigenlijk wil ik best wel een vrouw.

G: Ja en denk je dat dat hier ook enigszins naar voren komt?

Emma: Nee.

[er wordt gelachen]

Claire: But we say one thing and we think another thing. I think I have
the same problem, I always say I can do what I want, I can have a career
if I want and what I want. But also in my family, they always say, when
is the wedding, when will you have children, and that is, yes, I think that
is very difficult, and I think that that is a problem of women these days,
yes, the... how do you say that?

G: Yes, the role, the changing role

Claire: Yes, the role, you can be anything or nothing, but it is difficult to
find a balance.

Marijke: Yes, apparently men also find it difficult that they don't know
what to expect from a woman, and that is why an article like this is pub-
lished because it discusses what kind... what women actually want and
what makes them tick.

G: And what they want themselves?

Emma: And what do men want?
140 Reading With My Eyes Open

    G: Yes, exactly that is what I mean.

    Emma: Do they want a whore or a mother?

    G: A whore and a madonna.

    Claire: Yes, a whore for in the bedroom and a mother in

    Marijke: [laughs] Yes, in the living room

    [Talking and laughing. Someone says]:

    In the kitchen

    G: Yes, indeed. Do you think there's an element of jealousy? That the
    woman

    Claire: Can have everything.

    G: ...forms a threat? The man has lost his position as the one who
    achieves success; male identity is [seen as] achieving success.

    Claire: That is the feminist idea. I also talked about that with my French
    lecturer. She says that since the beginning of time men have a problem
    because women can have children and men can't. That's why they have
    `repressed?

    Marijke: Oppressed.

    Claire: Oppressed... and eh... women now can have a career and a
    house and a job and they can live on their own if they want. Yes, we can
    do anything we want and that is a big problem for men and they don't
    know what they want and they have to think...

    Marijke: But you could say that of this article... especially the emphasis
    on the career woman who has got it all wrong [in her private life] is a
    protection of... eh... this has always been our [domain] to have a career,
    to achieve, and now women do it as well, but look at them, they go to
    pieces, so to protect that a bit as well, yes, this is also ours... because
    even though they can do it, they can't do it as well as we can.

    G: Yes, so what can we if we compare that for instance with Lie­sbeth
    Wietze's article `the man as dinosaur', men have lost their position in
    society, they have become sad creatures... it was an extreme view...
    she presented it in a very extreme way because it was intended to
    be polemical, but do you perhaps recognise something that there
    is a phenomenon in society, or no not a phenomenon the way he
    describes it about aggressive women, but a phenomenon that men,
    and women as well, are confused, don't know exactly... are looking
    for new ways...
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 141

    Emma: Well, I don't know, it is very difficult, but I am not confused, as a
    woman, I have no problem with the fact that I want a career and possibly
    children, and be married

    Marijke: But do you think that you will manage it, if you want all of that?

    Emma: I don't know, and if I won't manage it, then that would be
    fine too.

    Claire: But I also think that the woman can't accept the fact that it is ok
    not to have a man.

    Emma: Women can't accept that?

    Claire: No, society... people, yes, women, I think that... maybe it is...
    it is silly, because I know that I can function normally without a man...

    Marijke: Yes...

    Clair: Yes, maybe there is a kind of idea and

    Marijke: But there is still a remnant of that very traditional... that you
    still have the idea that you need a man and also when you look at `Ally
    McBeal' and those TV series... you are waiting for them to finally get a
    boyfriend?

    Emma: But, is it also not the case that there is a new concept for men
    that they need a woman for eh eh [she says in English] `companionship'?

    lemand zegt: Gezelschap.

    Emma: Companionship, because people as beings, I don't think they are
    meant to be on their own, man or woman, it doesn't matter. Maybe it is
    then for men, they need to get their head...

    Claire: Get their head around it.

    Emma: Yes, the idea that they can be vulnerable as well, that they can also
    say: Actually, I would quite like to have a woman [female partner, GQ].

    G: Yes, and do you think that this comes across in any way in the text?

    Emma: No.

    [Laughter]

The classroom exchange above occurred at the point in the lesson straight
after I had guided students through the different representations of women in
the article. I had wanted them to consider how these different and conflict-
ing representations, i.e. women as `aggressive hunters of men', as `excessive life-
142 Reading With My Eyes Open

style consumers', and as `mothers,' created a different layer to the text. Claire
answered by relating these different representations to her own life and sug-
gesting that women may think or say they have the freedom to be what and
who they like to be, but that in reality they are under pressure to conform. So
she implied that whilst women might think they have all they want, they are
nevertheless strongly influenced by expectations of society, that is to say the
discourses which are enacted by their friends and family. It is difficult to gain a
balance between those discourses, she seemed to say. Claire was thus reflexive
in her answer.

  Marijke then made an explicit link with the article suggesting that men clearly
find it difficult to balance these various changing expectations women them-
selves and society have. Emma then turns the discussion towards men: they
don't know what they want: a whore or a mother. She elegantly (and perhaps
unwittingly) brings two discourses in the article together; that of the sexual
representation of women in one of the early representations in the article and
the end of the article, which could indeed be termed the madonna-discourse:
the traditional mother.

  The discussion amongst the students then becomes political: (suppression
of women throughout history), and psychological (envy of women's reproduc-
tion abilities) before it turns personal again about whether students them-
selves think they can combine the different roles of being a career woman with
that of being a mother. Finally, Emma talks about relationships between men
and women.

  At this stage in the lesson, students were not any longer trying to make sense
of the text. They had made the text their own and were collaboratively creating
meaning, in trying to relate the text to their own reality and their own experi-
ences. As I said, my initial feeling during this exchange in the lesson itself was
that they were almost `hijacking' the text. Cooke and Wallace refer to this as
`talking around a text' when a text carries `too much meaning in a personal expe-
riential way' for the students to maintain the required distance to stay `on task'.
Students wish to `make meaning in different ways' than the questions asked by
the teacher (2004: 109). But looking at the data, students are doing more than
merely talking around the text. They are discussing the issues which arose from
the text as a critique of society and highlighting the power differentials that
women still face. The style of meta communication had indeed changed from
analytical talk of standing outside the text to a dialogue and collaborative style
of talking, referring to personal experiences, as well as discourses in society.
In fact, students are even quite explicitly referring to the issue of discourses.
Claire calls it een soort idee (a kind of idea), which Marijke specifies as een
soort restant van dat hele traditionele... (a remnant of the very traditional...).
In this discussion, then, students are using the insights gained through the text
analysis, taking these further in a discussion using both the ideas that were
gained through the classroom activity of the text analysis, relating these to their
own experiences, before applying these ideas which had been gained through
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 143

a more personalised discussion, back to the text. This way they were seeing
the text as cultuurtekst, in terms of its conflicting and multiple discourses: the
expectations of being successful and independent versus the expectations to
be married and have children, which Claire highlighted as being part of every-
day reality for women. They also saw the conflicting discourses of `the whore
and the madonna', as Emma phrased the expectations of men towards women,
which indeed highlighted the way the article had represented women.

  By using the dialogic space students collaborated to engage in both discur-
sive mapping, and in discussing how they themselves were affected by these
expectations and discourses in society. Students were engaging through `lan-
guaging' (cf. Phipps and Gonzalez, 2004), or `dialoguing', as I call it, using the
article as a starting point, but then conversely relating their discussion again to
the article. They referred to a range of personal experiences to engage with the
text, from giving examples of their own experience, to relating the discussion to
other academic discussions (e.g. Claire referring to a literature class in French),
and students talking about their expectations for their own future.

  The personal here helped to engage students and make them see the cultural
and social significance of the article. Marijke particularly brings the discussion
back to the article. She also queries Emma in her confident statement that she
will have no problems integrating being a woman with having a career. She
makes it personal and at the same time queries underlying assumptions, both
in the text, but also in the attitude of the students themselves.

  By standing both inside and outside the text and through dialoguing, stu-
dents were able to use the personal to be intercultural. They were intercultural
at a generic level: recognising the cultural values embedded in the text and the
complexity of society of which this text is a product. However, the lesson also
addressed being intercultural at a more specific level and local level. I conceived
of this as Dutch discourses, and I turn to this next.

                              Dutch Articulations

Even though the topic discussed was transcultural, and certainly not spe-
cifically Dutch, as mentioned, I felt this particular texts showed what I called
Dutch articulations in the text. Students had indeed recognised the global, or at
least western, relevance of the text and made intertextual references to Ameri-
can and English soaps and films. I asked students whether they felt that this
issue would have been written about in a similar way in an English magazine
aimed at men. As I describe in more detail in chapter 4, my own interpretation
had been that the extreme traditional positioning of women as needing to find
fulfilment through motherhood, would not have been acceptable in an English
publication, not even in a men's one. This discourse was made more acceptable
by another discourse which also carried a Dutch flavour: that of therapy and
144 Reading With My Eyes Open

self development, which, I thought, would equally have been out of place in an
English magazine aimed at men.

  In the fragment below I am trying to bring this discussion into the fore-
ground. The exchange student, Marijke, responded as I had expected, say-
ing that this kind of discourse certainly does not surprise her, but the regular
students of the class did not seem to want to pursue this line of analysis. As
in the previous set of data, they `talked around the text' and focused on the
difference in conventions in how people talk about relationships: what can
you say and what not? The students are relating it to previous knowledge and
experience gained when living in the Netherlands. Marijke took on the role of
`learner' about English culture. The discussion which I had hoped to kick-start
on whether there was Dutch articulation to some of the discourses employed,
became a content-oriented one, based on personal experience, or at least what
they had inferred and observed about differences in relationships in England
and the Netherlands:

    Claire: Ja, maar ik moet zeggen ik heb in MH in Engeland gekijkt wanneer
    ik was in Waterstone's en MH in Engeland is niks te doen, of er is een klein
    artikel over seks maar al andere artikelen zijn over sport en health hoe je
    kan een betere sixpack hebben.

    G: Ja, wasbord dus.

    Marijke: [lacht]

    Claire: Ja, en een betere... 'deze schoenen voor voetbal'.

    G: Niets over relaties.

    Claire: Nee, niets over relaties.

    [...]

    Marijke: Maar denk... dan wat je ook zei dat over MH dat het alleen
    maar over sport gaat, dat praten over relaties, dat dat niet helemaal kan,
    dat dat te open is?

    Claire: In Engeland het kan niet ja, ik denk dat in Engeland je kan het niet
    publiceren in een Engelse mannelijke publicatie.

    G: En dan met name het vrij serieuze over relaties en het therapeutische
    gedeelte...?

    Claire: Nee, nee want ik denk dat in Engeland we praten niet over deze
    soort dingen, want ik denk mannen, maar ook vrouwen praten niet in
    dezelfde manier over seks.

    Emma: Nee.
                                                                         Tensions in the Classroom 145

Claire: In Nederland is het heel... je hebt 6 mannen en 6 vrouwen die
woont bij elkaar en misschien ik weet het niet, praat je over seks en dat
soort dingen.

Marijke: [lacht]

Claire: Maar je praat over relaties.

Marijke: Ja, dat gaat.

Claire: Maar ik denk in Engeland ik praat niet met mijn vrienden over
mijn relatie behalve dan in een meer generale manier.

Translation

Claire: Yes, but I have to say, when I was in Waterstone's I had a look,
and in MH in England there is nothing, or just a small article about sex,
and all other articles are about sport and health... how you can have a
better `sixpack'...

G: Yes, `wasbord'.

Marijke: [laughs]

Claire: Yes, and a better these shoes for football.

G: Nothing about relationships.

Claire: No, nothing about relationships.

[...]

Marijke: But do you think, that what you said, that MH is only about
sport, that talking about relationships that it is not possible/acceptable,
that it is too open?

Claire: In England you can't do it, yes, I think that in England you can't
publish it in an English publication for men.

G: And then particularly the fairly serious tone about relationships, that
therapeutic part?

Claire: No, because I think in England we don't talk about these kind
of things, because I think men, but also women, don't talk in the same
way about sex.

Emma: No.

Claire: In the Netherlands it is very... you have 6 men and 6 women
who live together and maybe, I don't know, you talk about sex and that
kind of thing...

Marijke: [laughs]
146 Reading With My Eyes Open

    Claire: But you talk about relationships.

    Marijke: Yes, that is...

    Claire: But I think in England I don't talk with my friends about my
    relationship except in a more general way.

Claire had taken an intercultural stance by looking at an English version of
Men's Health for comparison. Her analysis, that it did not contain anything
about relationships, was taken further by Marijke. She was interested to what
degree you could infer whether there is more of a taboo on talking about rela-
tionships in England than in the Netherlands. The exchange is perhaps a little
essentialist in its focus and conducted at a very general level, but I had encour-
aged that by my initial questioning about `Dutchness'. Whilst the dialogue
was not leading to discourses in Dutch society regarding women, that I had
scaffolded the discussion towards, the dialogue was nevertheless intercultural.
An interesting side effect was that the intercultural dialogue was taking place
in both directions: the statements about English society made by Claire, led
Ma­rijke to ask further questions. Interesting is that the English students were
more confident in their observations about cultural difference. Marijke did not
focus on cultural differences, and in her interview she said she had no idea what
`Dutch values' were, as she, as a native speaker, had never thought about it in
those terms.

  The students may have taken on an intercultural stance in the sense that they
were thinking about the issue of the wider cultural context in the Netherlands
and Britain, but they were not extending this to continuing the position of
critique of discourses. Nevertheless, the students were reflecting; Claire used
both the evidence of what she had inferred from the article, and something
which Marijke had said earlier on in the discussion and then related it to her
own experience. On the other hand, the discussion did not rise above the level
of stereotypes, and students were not aware of the fact that they were colluding
in stereotypes.

  I then aim to bring the discussion back from the `talk around the text' to the
pedagogical task at hand, i.e. looking at the underpinning values in the text and
whether these could be said to constitute a Dutch articulation. I want to find
out from Marijke whether she feels the underpinning values in the text are in
any way `recognisable' to her:

    erland te lezen is, nee.

    Claire: And you are not in the same [league?]

    Marijke: It is not personal?

    Claire: Yes exactly, it is a kind of ideal.

Marijke indeed feels the values reflected in the article are similar to those in
other publications in the Netherlands, which might suggest there may be a
Dutch articulation to some aspects of the text. My question was aimed at dis-
courses in the media, and Marijke's answer does indeed focus on this. However,
the students did not follow up on the representations in the media, but instead
continued the theme of attitudes of `openness' in attitudes and communica-
tion, which the discussion around the text had thrown up for them. In compar-
ing these attitudes between the Netherlands and England, students followed
essentialist notions of national cultures. Eve's general observation that Dutch
people have a direct style of communication is applied by Emma to different
communicative behaviours between English and Dutch men when it comes to
talking about feelings. She seems to make use of her own personal experiences
by emphasising: `that much I can tell you'.

  From that point the discussion starts to focus on sex, but Claire relates this
to her cultural knowledge of the Netherlands. She suggests that because there
is sex education at schools, it is easier for people to talk about sex. However,
rather than just making an observation, using her cognitive schemata, she
touches on a more complex point; she says that talking about sex is `a kind of
idea' (een soort idee). Claire seems to suggest that because sex is talked about
from a younger age at school, it becomes part of culture, almost like a dis-
course. The other students do not pursue the more complex point Claire is
making, but they confirm the fact that talking about sex is just more common
in the Netherlands.

  When Eve focuses on the comparative element (`the English find it so dif-
ficult to talk about sex') both Emma and Claire confirm this, but I feel that
the students are colluding in a stereotype. I want them to query this fur-
ther and I counter their comments by stating that there is a lot of talk about
sex in English magazines as well. This leads students to consider the way
Dutch magazines write about sex compared to English publications, such
as Cosmopolitan. It is Claire again who considers these differences and she
suggests that Dutch magazines will write about sex in the context of rela-
tionships and that they would also focus on the fact that sex is not always
perfect. English magazines (i.e. Cosmopolitan), on the other hand, write in a
`closed way' about sex, as if sex should be perfect all the time; it is not about
personal experiences, but an `ideal' to live up to (Eve: `multiple orgasms').
Again Claire comes close to suggesting that there are different discourses
surrounding sex, i.e. conventions in talking about sex and the assumptions
and expectations which surround it. Also interestingly, Claire focused again
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 151

on the pressure that glossy magazines exert to conform to the image of an
`idealised' lifestyle, which Claire mentioned a few times in relation to the
article in Men's Health.

  Whilst I had wanted to focus on Dutch articulation and discourses in the
Men's Health text, students changed that focus to a comparative one, looking
at the differences in the Netherlands and England in communicative styles in
the way people talk about feelings and about sex. Whilst partly I felt students
were colluding in stereotypes, they also, Claire in particular, attempted to relate
both their personal experience and their cognitive and lifeworld knowledge to
reflect on these differences.

  I felt slightly uncomfortable about discussing issues comparatively, as this so
easily leads to an unproblematic confirming of national stereotypes. Of course,
I had encouraged the comparative stance in trying to make students consider
the idea of a Dutch articulation, but articulation focuses on discourses, rather
than on the `facts' of people's behaviour, which is how the discussion was devel-
oping. On the other hand, students were reflecting on their own experiences
when they had been in the Netherlands during their residency abroad. Whilst
I think students were in danger of over-essentialising their experiences, Claire
points towards a way in which topics like these could be debated in a more con-
structive and intercultural way, with students reflecting critically on their own
experiences. She hints at the fact that there are discourses, which she referred to
as `kinds of ideas', surrounding sex, which may differ from country to country
(or indeed from social group to social group), because of historically developed
attitudes, or indeed, as Claire suggests, because of the educational curriculum,
which is a powerful conductor of values and discourses. Focusing on discourses
rather than the `facts' of people's behaviour, allows for a more comprehensive
and problematised view of the notion of a possible national articulation.

  In comparing the two different sets of data, i.e. the one where students
were engaged critically in mapping discourses and were discussing these on a
transcultural basis, the data set above relating to Dutch articulation in contrast
reverted the topic onto a national level. These different data show the tension
between these perspectives, transcultural and national, which I think are part
and parcel of language teaching which takes into account the complexities of
language and culture. Both sets of data showed students engaged in `dialogu-
ing' about issues which related to culture, language and clearly to students' own
lives. The data also show the importance of collaboration in the meaning mak-
ing process. The fact that one set of data showed students taking a more com-
plex stance to the topic in hand, and a more essentialist approach in the second
one, also shows that the context of discussion is important. This context was
partly created by me by asking students to focus on Dutch articulation. But stu-
dents themselves also created the context together. If one student introduced a
different perspective, i.e. Eve in the last set of data introducing the notion of dif-
ferences in communication styles between the English and Dutch, then others
152 Reading With My Eyes Open

were prepared to follow that line of conversation. In doing so, students showed
responsibility and engagement towards one another in their discussions, as well
as an intellectual curiosity towards new and other perspectives.

                                   Conclusion

What emerges from the classroom data is that the personal experience and
reflections of students, the collaborating and dialoguing together in class is as
important as the analytical activity of looking at the text from the various per-
spectives encompassed in my framework. In the first lesson students took a
greater distance towards the text, took on an outside position, and seemingly
approached the task of discussion as a traditional pedagogic activity, where a
`correct' answer is expected. Generally speaking it was not until the second les-
son, when we looked at the cultuurtekst perspective, when students started to
take a more dialogic approach to the text, relating the text to their personal
experiences, which in turn influenced their interpretation of the text.

  Over the two lessons, the discussion in class became more `dialogic' as the les-
sons progressed, both in relation to the text - students engaged with the text at
various levels, but also in terms of class discussion - students initially answered
my questions directly to me, but soon started to respond to one another and col-
laborated (or clashed with one another on a couple of occasions) in interpreting
the text. On the whole, it could be said that students' understanding of the text
gradually moved from the level of text as product, to text as cultuurtekst, rec-
ognising underlying values. However, this was not a neat and linear progress.
There were significant learning moments, but students' understanding of the
discourses in the text remained frequently at an implicit level. At times, it also
felt that students had negated their earlier understanding of the text. Students
used a variety of approaches to interpret the text and these approaches also dif-
fered from student to student.

  There were occasions where the students were intercultural in their attempts
to understand the text from the inside, i.e. engaging with the cultural mean-
ing of the text in relation to their own lived experiences. They also tried to
understand and critique the values contained in the text. In that sense stu-
dents were ethnographic and engaging. However, students did not reflect
on their own interpretation of the text, so as such they did not make their
own reality `strange'. This was not surprising, as I had not invited students
to be reflexive. I only conceptualised the notion of text ethnography and its
reflexive aspect as a result of this data analysis. Students did, however, take a
position of critique as they reflected on the ideological underpinnings of the
text and its representation of normalising the discourse of women being soft,
gentle, caring and dependent.

  Interestingly, the deeper insights by students occurred when they moved
away from the exercise of text analysis and made the discussion their own.
                                                                              Tensions in the Classroom 153

The `talking around the text' became the most dialogic, insightful and even
academic discussions of the two lessons, where students recognised the power
structures that regulate women's personal life choices in terms of career and
motherhood.

  Whilst in the first lesson, students conceived of the discussions at the `text
level' as a more traditional learning task, responding to questions and tasks,
in the second lessons students created their own dialogic space in which they
collaborated to talk around the text, which at times also took on elements of
discursive mapping. Students moved from particular interpretations and read-
ings to other ones, even if these seemed to be conflicting. In doing so they cre-
ated their own changing, what I call, `context of discussion', a shared experience
of learners engaging in the task of making sense of a text, mapping discourses
and relating it to their own experiences. Students' readiness to engage in differ-
ent interpretations or articulations showed their responsibility to one another
in the classroom discussions. The dialogic space in the classroom gives rise to
a fluidity of the `context of discussion', opening up opportunities for sharing
experiences, for expressing thought in a continuing shifting exchange of ideas,
emotions and experiences.

  The notion of Dutch articulation did not lead to any insights or, even con-
sidered discussions. The Dutch student, Marijke, did acknowledge that the dis-
courses in the text were recognisable in terms of what was published in the
Netherlands, but this point was not taken up further by anyone. I think in ret-
rospect, the notion of articulation would need to be developed further as it is
at a very subtle level that this takes place. The evidence from the classroom
discussion suggests that the idea of a national articulation leads to uncritical
comparisons and feeds into confirming stereotypes. However, one student did
introduce an interesting notion, by implying that ways of talking about a topic,
such as sex, can be nationally articulated to a degree, depending on to what
degree it is included and how it is talked about in education.

  Nevertheless, I believe the tendency to confirm stereotypes shows how care-
ful we need to be in focusing on national patterns. Even if there may be a Dutch
articulation in texts, or indeed discourses, this is only a particular tendency at
a particular time and in a particular environment. Such an articulation is only
one of various other articulations and of other discourses. Since students had
difficulty making sense of the multiple discourses, or voices in the text, and had
a tendency to interpret the text only in the light of one of these, focusing on a
`national' articulation carries with it the risks of confirming or creating new
stereotypes which should probably not be tackled until students have a fuller
and more balanced understanding of the complexities of national identity.

     Conclusion: Embracing Tensions

                                   Introduction

This book explored an approach to language and culture teaching as part of a
general language class, which I called the cultuurtekst approach - a way of read-
ing texts as culture. The underpinning rationale for my cultuurtekst approach
is that language and culture are complex, and that teaching language as if both
language and culture are stable notions creates a distorted representation of the
cultural and social reality of people's lives.

  The study on which this book is based consisted of a deeply reflexive pro-
cess, which originated in my disquiet with contemporary language teaching
practices at the time I started my study. This reflexivity consisted of a constant
interplay between ideas and practice. On the one hand, I reflected on theories
of language, culture and of pedagogy in order to develop the approach. Con-
versely, in looking at how students responded to my approach I reconsidered
the theoretical premises on which language teaching practice is based, includ-
ing my own practice. I developed notions such as `being a text ethnographer'
and `Dutch articulation', and utilized the notion `discourse mapping', as an
important rationale of the cultuurtekst approach as a way of being a critical
intercultural language user. The reflexive process of looking at my own practice
was a profoundly uncomfortable one. In listening word for word to my tape
recorded lessons, and looking at transcripts of these over and over again, I was
confronted with everyday failings, such as not picking up on points students
made, cutting off students, misinterpreting comments, leading discussions too
much or not leading them sufficiently and many other of these awkward defi-
156 Reading With My Eyes Open

ciencies, which most of us are probably liable to as teachers. More significantly,
however, because of what at times seemed to be only embryonic understand-
ings and, perhaps more worryingly, because of the resistance shown by one
student, Sarah, in particular, I started to doubt whether my approach was a
worthwhile addition to teaching methodology. Was my contribution to the
development of a new paradigm in fact worth exploring further?

  However, in this micro observation of my own teaching I became aware of
two things. First of all, after the discomfort of potential failings, either in actual
teaching or the methodology, was dispensed with, I realized that neither learn-
ing nor teaching are linear and straightforward processes. During the lessons
it was exactly the hesitations, the ruptures, the discomfort in students which
indicated valuable learning moments, much more so than the occasions where
confident answers were given. Equally, it was when students responded in
personal ways, rather than in distant, seemingly objective intellectual ways,
that real engagement took place. Moreover, it was the resistance of Sarah in
particular, which pointed not to the failing of this approach, but to the fact
that I had, in her words, not gone `far enough' with it. An important conclu-
sion then is that whilst students had taken a step towards discourse mapping,
interculturality and understanding the complexities of culture and being a text
ethnographer, what was lacking was precisely the consideration and reflection
on students' own subjectivities. And by extension, it was through my reflec-
tions on my own subjectivities, my own teaching and the discomfort I had
felt, that I was able to progress in my own lessons to open up more space for
personal engagement.

  Before I come back to this later in this chapter, I summarise and conclude
the findings of this study here, relating these to the theoretical concepts I devel-
oped, before discussing how this contributes towards thinking about a new
paradigm of language teaching which fits in with the current demands of pre-
paring students for their future complex mobile lives, linguistically, culturally
and personally. In discussing the findings I will also refer to significant data
from student interviews, which indicate these learning moments and processes.

                            The Student Interviews

For the purposes of this book I have looked in detail at the classroom data I
collected during my study, and which I analysed in chapter 5. I am not afford-
ing the same amount of time and space to the interview data in this chapter
as I did to the classroom data in the previous one, because the interview data
were intended particularly to triangulate the classroom data. In this final chap-
ter, where relevant, I refer to some of the interviews to illuminate some of my
research findings in greater detail. In doing so, I focus on only two students,
Claire and Sarah, particularly because of their contrasting views.
                                                                                                Conclusion157

  Out of all the students, Claire had engaged most with the conflicting dis-
courses in the Men's Health text and with the cultuurtekst pedagogy. In the
interviews, however, Claire showed that she was still struggling with the con-
cept of cultuurtekst to some extent. Yet her conceptualisation of cultuurtekst
in relation to her own lived experience added substantially to my own inter-
pretation and theorisation of cultuurtekst for language pedagogy, as I will
show below.

  Similarly, Sarah's responses added significantly to my understanding of how
students can engage with the idea of cultuurtekst, and how their assumptions
of what communication is have a bearing on how they conceive their language
learning. Moreover, it also helped me to locate the further conceptualisation of
cultuurtekst pedagogy in a philosophical context. Even though Sarah had not
been present during the second lesson, which was part of the analysis of the
previous chapter, I have still opted to refer to data of Sarah's interviews here,
because her resistance to my approach offered valuable insights into her learn-
ing experiences in relation to my pedagogy, and indeed has consequences for
my reflection on how to take this pedagogy forward.

  To understand the depth of Sarah's resistance, I need to point out that a few
weeks into the course Sarah had approached me to ask whether she could be
excused from attending the classes and just take the course on a self-study
basis. She did not like the course because of its focus on `style' in relation to
the audience and purpose of the text. As the data show, Sarah had not even
started to engage with the notion of discourses. It has to be remembered here
that, as I mentioned in chapter 4, I had at the start of the course used the term
`style' in order to refer to `routinised ways of talking' about certain topics, as
that seemed a more acceptable notion to students because of its more obvious
link with the idea of improving one's language skills in the class, rather than
the term `discourses`. But the idea of people adapting their language use in
different situations had had a profound effect on Sarah. She suddenly felt that
she could not communicate effectively anymore with people because she was
worrying and wondering about what to say and how to say it, whereas before
that would have come automatically. The idea that people use different kinds of
languages in different situations, that people `switch codes' was very unsettling
in a psychological way. In fact, she mentioned at the time, `it had rocked her
to the core'; it made her feel that on the one hand she could not trust people
anymore to say exactly what they meant, and that on the other hand, it made
her very self conscious about her own use of language in English, both in writ-
ing and speech.

  We managed to resolve the conflict between us by agreeing that Sarah would
attend classes and do her homework, but that she did not have to participate
in class discussions if she did not want to. After a few lessons, Sarah started to
participate fully in class, but it always remained clear that she continued to be
resistant to this approach.
158 Reading With My Eyes Open

                   The Research Findings

                                   Introduction

The overall question I attempt to answer in my study is `How do students
engage with the cultuurtekst pedagogy?' The sub questions in relation to the
two lessons in which the Men's Health text was discussed were: `What different
levels of reading do the two perspectives of text and cultuurtekst yield?', and
whether students make the journey from `text' to `cultuurtekst'. In answering
both these questions I was particularly interested in whether students would
recognize the complexity of the discourses at the cultuurtekst level of reading,
whether these different levels of reading would also relate to different levels of
criticality, including that of engaging with the text as a text ethnographer, and
finally, whether students recognized any Dutch articulation in the text.

  Below I discuss the ambiguities between text and cultuurtekst which emerged
both from the classroom data and the interviews, and how this linked to criti-
cality as well as, in the case of Sarah, views of communication.

      From Text to Cultuurtekst: Different Ways of Being Critical

As I showed in chapter 5, over the course of the two lessons students gradually
moved from seeing the text as `text' to seeing text as `cultuurtekst'. However,
this progress was not neat and linear, and there were considerable differences
between students. Understanding of the text at a cultuurtekst level seemed to
be incidental - occasional nuggets of insights, which students would not neces-
sarily build on later. It became clear that it is not easy to separate the different
ways of reading as students move in and out of different positions towards the
text. It also became clear that we cannot separate reading a text for its content,
structure and immediate context as a stable entity separate from cultuurtekst,
because students invested the text with cultural and social meaning, even when
reading the text at the textual level, as was the case in the first lesson. However,
despite attributing meaning to the text, at the textual level of reading, students
did so in the light of only one of the discourses reflected in the text. During
these discussions, some students stayed close to the text and aligned themselves
with the text or the author, but others went beyond the text, and were indeed
aware the text was showing representations, rather than facts. Moreover, in the
first lesson, students talked in a very confident manner about their analyses, as
they seemed to interpret the task to be one of a traditional language classroom:
that of assuming a `correct answer' was required.

  Discussing the text at cultuurtekst level in the second lesson, on the other
hand, did seem to give students more insights; students became less confident
in their voice as they interpreted the task as needing more careful consideration.
                                                                                                Conclusion159

It is the hesitancy with which students try out ideas as part of dialogic group
discussions, which I considered to be important learning moments. Questions
which assume a correct answer do not allow any space for dialogue, engaging
with other ideas, or for reflection. In the lesson focusing on the text as cultuur­
tekst, there was more `discussion around the text', and students used these dis-
cussions to re-interpret the text in the light of what had been said. Again there
were considerable differences between students. There were occasions where
students showed an intercultural stance in their attempts to understand the
text from the inside, i.e. engaging with the cultural meaning of the text in rela-
tion to the context of text production as well as engaging with their own lived
experiences. Interestingly, the deeper insights by students occurred when they
moved away from the exercise of text analysis and made the discussion their
own. The `talking around the text' became the most dialogic, insightful and,
even academic, discussions of the two lessons, where students critiqued the
power structures embedded in the text, i.e. those that regulate women's per-
sonal life choices in terms of career and motherhood. Moreover by relating
their experiences again to the texts, students were also becoming aware that the
text was making `claims to truth'.

                                           Claire

Whilst tentative conclusions after the second lesson pointed to a deeper
engagement with the discourses in the text, the interviews with the students
showed that some of the learning of the cultuurtekst lesson had not necessarily
been transferred. Claire, for instance, had shown most understanding of and
engagement with the discourses in the text during the lessons, including the
conflicting ones, and had recognized these to be culturally significant. During
one of her interviews, however, she took a different view; that these conflicting
discourses showed a lack of clarity and poor argumentation. She showed her
unease with the notion of cultuurtekst as she describes the process she followed
in reading the text.

  First she reads the text as a language learner making sure she has understood
all of the vocabulary, then she reads it for content, critiquing both the stereo-
typical representations in the text as well as empathising with the women in the
text who are dumped by their lover for a younger woman, before addressing the
text at cultuurtekst level:

    Claire: When I did the, well, what I tried to do was read it for the vocabu-
    lary so that I understood it fully because it was annoying to leave (...) and
    then read it again on the train without writing anything and without hav-
    ing read your [framework], and then it was that I started to see the kind
    of... I find it very patronizing, em, there are lots of sentences that I don't
    like, the whole cliché, cliché thing, you know, oh her true lover left her for
160 Reading With My Eyes Open

    a younger woman. Well, you know, that's quite a horrible thing to have to
    deal with, you know, you don't have to be patronizing about it.

    But then, when I read it with, what I did was when I needed to write out
    the text that you wanted for the cultuurtekst question, I wrote down all the
    questions that were asked and then I read it each time so I went through
    it thinking, how are women portrayed here or how are the people in this
    story portrayed, and then kind of underlining a word and using some of
    the things that I saw, and the more I read it, the more I realised that it's not
    a very, well, that the argument isn't very good because it sort of skips from
    one thing to the other, and it never actually says anything, it kind of moves
    around and around this point but it never makes any statement about,
    you know, or conclusion.

Claire's representation of her process of reading is significant for various rea-
sons. Her reading at the content level is not just a `preferred reading', looking
at the position from which the text asks to be read (see chapter 3), but her
response to the text in this phase of reading was one of both critical and per-
sonal engagement. One the one hand she critiques the stereotypical, patronis-
ing and mocking approach of the text. But at the same time she responds from
a personal perspective: she talks with a voice of empathy with the women who
are being dumped by their lover for a younger woman. In my own framework
of reading I had not taken account of this personal engagement which was also
a significant point to emerge from my classroom data. But whilst she is critical
of the text in terms of its ideological stereotypical representations of women,
her critique here occurs at the content and textual level of reading. She sees the
final cultuurtekst level of reading as an academic exercise, answering the ques-
tions about representations. Rather than this resulting in a firming up of the
critique of discourses, it led her to a more traditional perspective of reading:
being critical of its poor argumentation.

  It seems then that her view of cultuurtekst carries within it a traditional view
of text as containing stable meaning and text as a product. This dual view of
text could be the result of giving students a framework which carries within it
these two views. Critiquing representations is for Claire achieved through an
engagement with the content from the perspective of people being represented
in the text. She tries to inhabit the place of the `characters', as it were, and to see
the world momentarily through their eyes.

  However, later on in the interview, she comes back to the distinction between
text and cultuurtekst more specifically and this time she relates the notion of
personal experience and interest with the idea of cultuurtekst.

    Claire: [...] because we talked about it as a cultuurtekst not just necessar-
    ily as an article, because as an article you can take it apart.

    G: Right
                                                                                                Conclusion161

    Claire: You know, but as a cultuurtekst it's very interesting, because it,
    you know, it talks about a cultural phenomenon, which you know, and I
    found the way it used, you know, because if you think, you know, I don't
    read many things by men, so I think that's quite interesting and, you know,
    yeah. No, I found it a very, I thought yesterday was really good fun, I
    really enjoyed it, because it was, you know, especially as you're talking
    about something which is actually quite interesting for someone my age,
    you know, talking about politics or economics is something that is not so
    relevant to me now, em, but social values, sex, things like that, is quite a
    sort of, that is something I would realistically discuss with a friend, you
    know, you're not kind of making a you know, fake situation.

    G: Well, it's very much part of life and society.

    Claire: Exactly

Claire sees text, or `article' as she refers to it here, as a product you can analyse,
`you can take it apart'. She juxtaposes this with reading or discussing the text
as cultuurtekst, which she interprets now as `talking about a cultural phenom-
enon' you can relate to and engage with as you would in your everyday life: `it's
something I would realistically discuss with a friend'.

  Whilst in the first fragment she indicates that the academic cultuurtekst exer-
cise of looking at the way women were represented, made her realise the text
was not a `good text' in the traditional sense, Claire's conception of reading as
cultuurtekst is quite different. Here she relates cultuurtekst not as an academic
exercise looking at representations, but as reading as a `communicative experi-
ence', relating the text to one's own (or other people's) experiences. For Claire
this happened particularly when discussing the text in class. It was this com-
municative experience as dialogue which personalized the cultuurtekst phase
of reading. Whilst Claire does not mention it in this fragment above, this expe-
rience becomes intercultural if the text is produced in an environment, and is
about a social group, the reader is not familiar with. By relating the text to eve-
ryday lived experience and reflecting on that, Claire is reading, at least to some
extent, as a text ethnographer. With Claire engaging with the text as a reader
for her own interests, a topic she can relate to and would realistically discuss
with friends, her description of the process of cultuurtekst seems to parallel the
dialogic spaces which opened up in class when students engaged with the text
by `talking around it'. Reading `as an experience', and classroom discussion as
a real life activity, not a `fake situation', as Claire called it, might then provide
students with an opportunity to see things from different perspectives.

  In summary, in her retrospective engagement with the text in the two sets
of data above, Claire employed various positions of criticality. She had cri-
tiqued the text from a liberal humanist conception of critical thinking. From
this perspective the text did not stand up to scrutiny as a `good text'. She also
employed ideology critique. From this perspective the text consisted of ste-
162 Reading With My Eyes Open

reotypical representations. And furthermore, Claire employed also a personal
level of critique; she critiqued the text, as it were for its misrepresentations and
mocking approach, as if the women in the text were characters of flesh and
blood with whom she could empathise. Through inhabiting the represented
characters, she saw the world temporarily from their perspective. An approach
in reading which is not unlike the idea of sympathetic imagination with is
afforded in literature.

  Sarah on the other hand, read the text in a very different way, one which is
more distant and from a liberal humanist perspective. However, as we will see
below, personal engagement also played a role for her, but in quite a different
way from the way that Claire engaged with the text.

                                           Sarah

Sarah rejected the notion of cultuurtekst quite strongly and she had not engaged
with the idea of discourses. It must be remembered, however, she had not taken
part in the second class where we discussed the text at a cultuurtekst level. In
one of her interviews, when I ask Sarah what the notion `cultuurtekst' means
for her she says she feels it is to do with lifestyle. She distances herself from
this particular genre, or `cultuurteksts' as she perceives them, because they are
`manipulated' and written for specific audiences.

    Sarah: So I don't, so for me it's em it's quite clear when I read an article in
    a newspaper or a or a em whatever piece in a lifestyle magazine, that it's
    that it's just em that it's quite, well, manipulated for a particular audience
    to try and appeal to a certain type of em frame of mind.

    G: Mm.

    Sarah: And I don't, I don't like the idea of em of em being so manipulated,
    so I'd rather not read them.

Sarah thoroughly dislikes the idea of being manipulated through language. As
she had said to me at the start of the course, she had previously always thought
that people were `honest' in their communicative behaviours and stayed true to
themselves by speaking the same way regardless of who one spoke to or what
one wanted to achieve.

  With relating cultuurtekst particularly to the genre of lifestyle texts, Sarah
may think of cultuurtekst as linked to `low' culture; the popular mass media,
which may contradict Sarah's own sense of culture and identity. Later in the
interview when asked what kinds of texts she does read, she says that she pre-
fers to read books, `founts of knowledge', and would much rather learn about
topics in class that are personally interesting to her, such as, for instance, Eras-
mus, rather than `these cultuurteksts'.
                                                                                                Conclusion163

  What is interesting is that Sarah considers lifestyle publication as the same
genre as newspapers. Her dislike of texts being manipulated is less geared to
critiquing ideology, it would seem, then to an `ideal' view of communication,
as she makes clear below.

  But the process of having discussed texts in class according to the questions
in my framework for analysis, had led her to reflect deeply on the nature of
communication. Her resistance to the course was not only caused by the fact
that the texts seemed to be manipulated, or by her sense of identity as a reader
who wants to read texts of a certain academic, or perhaps literary, standing, she
also worried about how as readers you can interpret texts `correctly'. For her the
issues of `trust' and `honesty' emerge. As a reader you not only need to be able
to trust a writer not to manipulate you, conversely when you write you need to
trust your readers to interpret your text the way you intended:

    Sarah: So you can, so you can, not only does the writer make choices and
    so structure a text that it says what he wants to say, but also a reader by
    interpreting it in different ways understands it differently, so that's why
    the whole idea of, that's why I think you get lost, anything you read or you
    listen to or anything, any kind of communication, there's such a lot of room
    for error, just because em if you are going to interpret it one way or another
    and you mean it one way or another.

    G: Yeah yeah.

    Sarah: There's so much potential to em confusion.

    G: Yeah.

    Sarah: Despite it being what you might call a better communication, it
    doesn't mean, I don't know a good communication has got to do with lis-
    teners as well as speakers or readers as well as writers.

    G: Yes, yeah.

    Sarah: And you can't, and so to, so you have to rely on your audience and
    so that's why if you're going to, if you think you can manipulate them, well
    if they can't rely on you, em I suppose (...) so I think the whole trust thing
    is that you read a, it would be nice to be able to read a text and em for
    them not to be playing with you and it depends on genre so if you, I don't
    know, if you're like criticizing things and don't mind reading crap then
    you can quite happily read different things that I wouldn't be able to read
    because I, I don't know, I don't like that so...

    G: Right, okay.

    Sarah: Does that make any sense?
164 Reading With My Eyes Open

Sarah is clearly trying to make sense of very complex ideas about communica-
tion which the course has made her think about. Firstly, she is very much aware
of the complexity of the process of a communicative event and the important
role the reader has in interpreting a text. Secondly, she contrasts what she knows
is happening in communicative events with what she feels ought to happen.

  To start with the first point, Sarah realizes that in communicating, not only
does the writer need to make linguistic choices, the reader also has to be able
to decode those. Whereas in earlier comments, Sarah seemed to hold on to a
view of text as stable and universal, here she is introducing the importance of
the reader's interpretation. However, Sarah sees the reader's role as a potential
problem, since there is such a large potential for error and misunderstanding.
Sarah assumes that the writer has a particular meaning which the reader must
interpret `correctly'. This fits with Sarah's interpretation of the Men's Health
text in class, where she tried to align herself with the author (as I described in
chapter 5). Sarah's view of communication accords with that of the structuralist
model - a view of communication which many students hold subconsciously,
that in sending a message in a communicative event the message has to arrive
exactly as the sender had intended it.

  Sarah sees the relationship between audience and writer or speaker as one of
trust. As the reader you need to be able to trust the writer that he is not going to
manipulate you. Sarah seems to hold to a view of `ideal communication' which
is similar to one of the maxims of Grice's cooperative principles: that of being
truthful. Sarah's view of reading is one of text as `text' and not as `cultuurtekst'.
Her criticality is rooted in the liberal humanist view of `critical thinking', rather
than seeing text in relation to contexts.

  Whereas we saw that for Claire discourse critique was achieved through
relating the text at a personal level and looking through the perspective of the
women who were represented, seeing them as real characters as it were, for
Sarah it worked the other way. She resisted the course, precisely because of
affect. She felt uncomfortably because discussing texts brought to the fore the
different personalities and backgrounds of students in the class:

    Sarah: But I realise that, well, it's a course with a clear aim and a clear
    method to follow up, but at first I found it difficult because I don't like, I
    don't like it.

    G: Right, well tell me a bit more about...

    Sarah: So if you read the specific, anything, any kind of specific text we
    looked at, em, say, I don't know, it maybe depends on generation or em
    background or anything, like, so different people will read the same text in
    a different way. It could be a way of finding out about the person I suppose
    by their interpretation of it, I suppose you can't really get away from that
    can you?

    G: Yeah, no.
                                                                                                Conclusion165

    Sarah: So em unless it's a subject that really doesn't affect you personally,
    then you can't really leave your own background or ideas behind. And so
    although you, although you're just discussing one text, if you read it with
    different people like we did, you'll see that it meant different things to dif-
    ferent people, say em that text about [London] or something, em, we did
    quite near the end [...]

    G: Oh right, yes.

    Sarah: Yes, so that said something different to, I suppose we looked at it
    all in different ways, Andy, Emma, and I suppose our class was quite good
    because, for this course, because you couldn't get probably six more differ-
    ent people, all next to each other in the same class.

    G: Did you find that useful? Did you feel that em there was a dialogue
    going on between you as a class, and was that beneficial?

    Sarah: Well, I did think that em it's quite interesting, because if you just
    forget the texts but look at the class, I think that em for whatever rea-
    sons, in the end people identified with each other differently than at the
    beginning.

    G: Was that with one another or with the texts?

    Sarah: Yeah, with one another, and I actually think it might have to do
    with probably to do with the course because it was so much based on dis-
    cussion and interpretation [...]

Sarah's experience in class of discussing texts with the other students showed
her that the texts meant different things to different people. We saw earlier that
Sarah has a strong notion of correct interpretation. But what Sarah finds sig-
nificant here is not whether people's different interpretations are valid, but that
people's interpretations say something about who they are. The way you inter-
pret the text says something about your identity. Sarah turns it around: not only
does your experience, your lifeworld knowledge inform your interpretations, it
also reveals who you are.

  As Sarah makes this point in the context of citing an example of what she did
not like about the course, we can surmise that Sarah feels uncomfortable about
the idea of revealing something about herself. Reading a text the way we did
in class, has a challenging aspect because it forces students to engage and show
something of their personality and experience with other people. Sarah may be
worried about giving too much of herself away by interpreting a text.

  An interesting notion emerges from this. Whereas the previous set of data
pointed towards the fact Sarah holds a stable view of communication, in the
data above, by making a link between interpreting a text and what it reveals
about someone's personality, Sarah comes closer to a social view of language and
166 Reading With My Eyes Open

communication. She acknowledges that there are multiple interpretations of a
text, depending one's experiences and even personality. Even if Sarah deploys
the notion of personality and identity as unchanging, by seeing a strong corre-
lation between interpretation and who you are, in this set of data she is holding
an almost dialogic view of text.

  Even though the lessons stopped short of making a more explicit link
between students' interpretations and their experiences and lifeworld knowl-
edge, including discourses they have been familiarized with, Sarah already
made this link. Although for Sarah this link was less in terms of social knowl-
edge, but rather related to a stable individual identity.

  In the next set of data Sarah makes the link between personal experiences
and communication more explicit. Whereas in earlier data she may have felt
uncomfortable about unintentionally revealing things about herself, below
she states quite explicitly the connection between individual personalities
and communication:

    Sarah: But we're talking about communication, communication is (...) so
    you could say it's endless, so yes, it's endless because em em there's super-
    ficial communication and there's all different types going on at the same
    time and so if you're talking about communication, to really talk about
    communication, you do have to ask all those big questions so and we
    haven't done that, so that's why well...

    G: Ah okay, so you feel that's what you would've liked to address more.

    Sarah: I suppose, okay I suppose, it didn't occur to me before but now we're
    talking, I suppose, there are other aspects of communication, em, that we
    haven't talked about at all, so...

    [...]

    G: And what sort of questions are they? What sort of questions would you
    have liked to have addressed?

    Sarah: Well. I suppose em if you're talking about communication, then yes,
    ways, genres are quite safe em types of text where you look at em a text and
    say where's it from and what is it called and all the, that's kind of safe, and
    when you go down into and then you can, then the problem is that that's
    when it gets personal and so if that hasn't occurred to other people then
    fine, so then if you really wanted to know about what somebody is writing
    and why, and then you'd have to go sort of it would also become em em, it
    would have to do with individual personality and em yeah, I don't know.

Sarah feels the course should have gone deeper and further in addressing the
`big questions'. The course had stayed at a safe level, talking about `superficial
communication' and genres and ways of writing. These big questions, Sarah
suggests, relate to the individual; they are about finding out what somebody is
                                                                                                Conclusion167

writing and why. Whereas I had designed the course to address those questions
about what is communicated, how and why at a social, political and cultural
level, Sarah felt these questions should be explored at a psychological level:
what influences an individual to communicate in a particular way and to what
degree this is related to personality. Rooted in a view of language as stable and
communication as expressing individual thought, Sarah's view contrasts with
my aim to look at language at a social level. Nevertheless, my intention as I set
out in the first chapter had been to rearticulate aspects of the liberal humanist
paradigm, particularly the idea of expressing thought. Even though in Sarah's
experience these views clashed, it is precisely in the dialogic space in the class-
room, where students were expressing thought both as a collaborative social
activity and conceptually in relating language to its cultural discursive contexts.
Whilst Sarah was worried about revealing too much of herself, it would pre-
cisely by trusting the communicative other which would make dialogic rela-
tions possible.

  So for Sarah, the personal was an extra analytical layer to lead to insights into
why we as individuals communicate the way we do. For Claire the personal
helped her to be critical of the text partly as a responsibility to the women rep-
resented in the text: she spoke with a voice of empathy. For Claire the personal
also had an ethical perspective: during class she had also shown a concern with
the injustice of the stereotyping and gender inequality.

  Sarah also showed an ethical stance, but for her that was located in the use
of language: not obfuscating arguments and making sure that readers could
interpret correctly what you as a writer wanted to convey.

     Being a Text Ethnographer and Intercultural Communication

The process of critical engagement with the ideas in a text, as I have found
through analysis of my data, is partly occasioned by students reflecting on their
own experiences. I have called this process `being a text ethnographer'.

  Being a text ethnographer, I contended in chapter 3, is looking at text both
from an inside and an outside perspective. However, I do not conceive the
inside perspective as trying to understand the text from the perspective of the
author or even of the intended audience. Helping students to engage with oth-
erness in a text is more likely to come about in engaging with ideas within the
text. Ideas, moreover, which do not have to be understood and agreed with,
but can also be critiqued from their discursive and ideological perspectives -
their claims to truth. However, the research findings showed that the richest
moments of engaging with texts and the ideas embedded within were those
moments where students abandoned the text temporarily and related the ideas
to their own life, their experiences and their knowledge about society. It is this
aspect of `engaging with' which comes close to being a critical intercultural lan-
168 Reading With My Eyes Open

guage user. The most intercultural moments were then largely instigated by the
students themselves.

  However, despite this engagement, students stopped short of reflecting on
their own interpretation of the text and their own culturally located position as
a reader. So as such they did not make their own reality `strange'. This was not
surprising, as I had not invited students to engage with that level of reflexiv-
ity during the classes. In fact, I had only conceptualised text ethnography as a
result of this data analysis. This notion of reflexivity as part of reading a text as
a text ethnographer is an area for further theoretical development.

                Dutch Articulation: The National Dilemma

Mapping discourses is not only a critical activity. It is also a way of conceiving of
the relationship between language and culture at a generic level, rather than the
one language, one culture relationship which has influenced much of national
focused language teaching. Cultuurtekst forms this bridge between language
and culture; it is the space where different meanings can be created and rec-
reated. It reflects as well as constructs culture, the latter through discourses.
These discourses reflect transnational concerns and ideas, and so do not limit
looking at cultural environment as a national process. Yet, due to historical
processes and structures in society, which are formed along national lines,
these discourses, I contended in chapter 2, may take on a national articulation.
As I explained, I do not mean that a national articulation relates to essential-
ist practices, behaviours or ways of conceptualizing our world around us, but
rather that certain accentuations may be more prominent, or more accepta-
ble in public discourse in certain social and cultural environments, including
national ones. These articulations are not stable in themselves, but can also be
rearticulated in different contexts and over time. This Dutch articulation is not
a feature of all texts, but it seemed prominent in the text I used for this study,
in its very traditional gendered perspective on women and the implication that
their natural roles are to be mothers and wives.

  As chapter 5 showed, students did not recognize the Dutch articulation that
I had identified in the article, as they felt this text could have been written in
the same way in an English publication. They saw the text not in a national,
but in a global perspective. Students recognized instead the global intertextual
references of British and American soaps and films. Marijke, one of the Dutch
exchange students, was the only student who had been prepared to consider
the notion of a Dutch articulation, although she phrased this very carefully. The
text, she said, was not incongruous with other things published in the Neth-
erlands in certain social environments. However, none of the other students
pursued this notion of a Dutch articulation.

  In class the notion of Dutch articulation did not lead to any significant
insights, except confirming stereotypes. The notion `backfired' as it were. In
                                                                                                Conclusion169

the interviews students were more prepared to consider the notion, although
Claire and Sarah saw this in different ways. Claire tried to understand texts
from the context in which they are produced, whereas Sarah saw Dutch articu-
lation as related to the content of the text: a text about Dutch culture.

    Claire: And that is always going to be problematic and I suppose in a way
    I'm much more aware of Dutch texts and the cultuurtekst behind them
    because I actually have to research and I have to read it with my eyes
    very very open and see all the different things and I think to myself, well,
    I don't understand that, is that because that's a cultural thing, is that a
    cultural difference or is it just because I don't get the grammar or whatever,
    whereas in French and English I don't tend to think about that.

Claire is aware of her position as a culturally located reader. Being an intercul-
tural reader, i.e. not being the intended audience, actually helps in understand-
ing the cultural articulations of a text, Claire suggests, as it forces her `to read
with her eyes very very open'. As a bilingual speaker of English and French
she does not have to think in the same way when reading a text in those lan-
guages as when she is reading a Dutch text. Being a foreign language reader
then makes you stop and think and be more reflective about the text. It helps
you to stand `outside' the text and consider the particular cultural meanings.

    Claire: But I do think that it's a, it's an interesting way of looking at a piece,
    especially if for instance, I mean it's always interesting to look at other
    cultures, but to look at your own culture, to look at an English text written
    by an English person for an English audience, and to look at the analysis,
    you know, look at the way it's written, em, I do, I tend to do that a lot more
    than I look at the actual culture and the discourses behind it and the, it's
    affected by other things, em, I don't tend to look at the culture because it
    just seems natural to me.

    G: Yes.

    Claire: And I suppose one of the things that I've learnt in the last year is
    that, to look at it from someone else's point of view, in a way, and so when
    I write I try and think about other people, but also when I read I try and
    think about well gosh, how are people going to interpret that or how are
    they going to understand it.

Claire explains that when reading English texts she does not look at `the culture'
or discourses because they seem natural to her, whereas, she seems to suggest,
she does do that with Dutch texts: `it is interesting to look at other cultures'. She
then explains that what she learnt from the course is writing from a reader's
perspective. By linking these statements, Claire seems to be saying that her
awareness of discourses and culture is helpful in addressing people from differ-
170 Reading With My Eyes Open

ent cultural groups. So Claire sees her responsibility towards her own readers
then also in intercultural terms in the sense that when she writes, or even when
she reads, she almost tries to `step into the shoes of the other', by imagining
how they will interpret the text. Claire is seeing being intercultural in an ethno-
graphic way: a sympathetic imagination of the possible reader.

  Sarah on the other hand interpreted Dutch articulation as the content of text
about a culture, which was only significant and valuable when treated in a com-
parative way:

    Sarah: Well, I think em because we sort of mentioned that before, haven't
    we, and that what I said em em was that you can only talk about em a sort
    of certain way of doing things in one place or another if you compare two,
    so where you've got a text say for example the nostalgia text or the text
    [about London], for example, that's where you've got a Dutch person in
    an English context, so when you're comparing two, then it might be more
    obvious, where as if you are just looking at the text, so if it's like a Dutch
    text about, just in a Dutch, in Dutch society, say like the what was it, the
    text, the Men's Health or other lifestyle magazine or whatever, it's not com-
    paring Holland particularly with any other country.

    G: No.

    Sarah: So I don't really, I think it depends on the content of the thing, not
    in terms of what it's saying but em whether it's Holland as opposed to
    something else, if there's, if it's like comparing or there's two contexts, but it
    did say, didn't it in the [London text] it was saying that this is different in
    Holland or something.

Sarah interpreted my question about recognizing a particular Dutch articula-
tion in the text as asking whether we can learn anything about Dutch culture,
i.e. `Dutch ways' of doing things. She feels that any specific Dutch aspect will
come through only if the text is about a Dutch person in an English context or
vice versa. So Sarah assumes that any understanding or insight into Dutch soci-
ety from a text relates to the content of the text, rather than the way the content
is written, reflecting underpinning cultural values, ideologies and discourses.

  It is in retrospect not that surprising that students did not engage with the
idea of a Dutch articulation in the way I had intended, i.e. as a discursive articu-
lation in a particular historical national context. The concept of `discourses' is
complex enough for students to consider in its own right, and Sarah had not
engaged with this notion. The idea of a `flavour' or articulation of a discourse
is indeed very subtle, and for students to recognize this would require them to
be enculturalised in a range of discourses in various areas of social and cultural
life current in both, and possibly other, countries.

  Intertwining a cultuurtekst approach focusing on discursive mapping in
global perspectives, with an approach that highlights cultural particularities in
                                                                                                Conclusion171

the form of looking at Dutch articulations, is one of the tensions that underpin
this study. This study showed that dealing with this `national dilemma', as Ris-
ager phrases it, is not easy in the classroom.

  Finally, in terms of comparing the two students whose interview data I dis-
cussed in this chapter, it may be tempting to conclude that Claire was more suc-
cessful as a student engaging with this pedagogy than Sarah, as Claire's engage-
ment was more in line with my intention. However, Sarah's discomfort had led
her to go through the greatest transformation as a learner. In turn it led me
to realise that discomfort is perhaps a necessary process in education. Being
intercultural, and trying to engage with other ideas, will mean stepping outside
the familiar. It is about exploring the possibilities of who we can be, and how
we can relate to one another. It is not only about being intercultural, it is also
about being human.

        Conclusion: Tensions, Ambiguities and Incompatibilities

The study on which this book is based has been born out of and marked by
tensions and ambiguities. These tensions were present from the very start of
the study and were part of the context in which it took place - a traditional
university which was characterized by a strong adherence to the liberal human-
ist paradigm in language education, but operating in a wider context which
emphasises instrumental aims.

  Tensions were also located in the actual pedagogy itself. Looking at texts
as products, employing an approach to criticality which is rooted in the lib-
eral humanist paradigm, i.e. that of taking critical distance, conflicts with the
cultuur­tekst level of looking at texts. The latter employs a poststructuralist
critique, looking at multiple discourses in texts, which I referred to, follow-
ing Pennycook (2001), as `discursive mapping'. This means looking at texts as
a meaning making process, whereby the cultural contexts of both the text pro-
ducing environment, but also that of the reader, have a bearing on the inter-
pretation. The tensions between these two perspectives led to some confusion
where students critiqued the text on the one hand for its ideological positioning
and on the other for its poor argumentation and structure.

  I already referred earlier to the conflict embedded in my pedagogy of the
centrality of discourses in the cultuurtekst approach and the concept of `Dutch
articulation'. This particular tension led to students referring in discussions to
wider global contexts and intertexts and their personal experience on the one
hand, yet reverted to national stereotyping on the other.

  These tensions, conflicts, resistances and seeming incompatibilities not only
formed the backdrop of the study, but also inform my conclusion and point
to the way forward. I am arguing that the different perspectives on text, edu-
cational philosophies and criticality are not necessarily incompatible as such.
After all, ambiguities are part and parcel of students' everyday realities. They
172 Reading With My Eyes Open

live with diversity, with supercomplexity, with cultural, linguistic and philo-
sophical tensions. One of the important conclusions of this study then is that
language teaching needs to embrace these tensions if it is to develop pedagogies
which acknowledge cultural complexities on the one hand and the existence of
cultural patterns on the other.

  In chapter 1, whilst rejecting the tenets underpinning the liberal humanist
paradigm, i.e. the assumptions of objectivity and truth, and its denial of humans
as being, at least in part, shaped by cultural forces, I argued for a re-articulation
of some of its concerns. These were located, I contended, in 1) the idea of criti-
cality and intellectual engagement in language classes, 2) the notions of moral-
ity, which I interpret here as a concern for others, and 3) the importance of Self.

  I have discussed the different perspectives on criticality in detail throughout
this book as one of the tensions which I am embracing. The concern for oth-
ers is an element which I did not purposefully include in my pedagogy, but it
emerged naturally as students engaged with the text and its fictional characters
in discussions. This concern for others also emerged in students' writing as
they showed an awareness of the other they were addressing. In a similar vein,
the emphasis on Self and individual agency emerged, as students themselves
engaged with the text and with one another explicitly referring to their own
personal experiences.

  In this way, the three elements which I highlighted contributed to and fed
into one another. This criticality embedded in the cultuurtekst approach was
then partly achieved through the intellectual engagement with the text and
through a consideration of the analytical questions I had asked in class and the
framework I used. However, it was equally the personal engagement as a group,
the more intimate dialoguing with one another and relating the discussions to
themselves that led to this criticality. The dialogic space in the classroom which
students created themselves, opened up an imaginative, personal and intimate
human perspective through which collaboration and exploration of ideas took
place. In doing so, students showed empathy and placed themselves into the
shoes of others and into their future imagined selves. It was through sympa-
thetic imagination that critical interculturality started to take place.

                           Pedagogical Implications

Because of the time which has lapsed between the data collection and the com-
pletion of this study, my pedagogy has since had time to evolve as I reflected on
the implications of my findings. After the initial data collection, but before the
analysis of the data, I responded particularity to the resistance shown by Sarah.
I also felt that the overt critical analytical stance of my pedagogy could irritate
students as their main aim for this course is to improve their language skills,
i.e. they do not feel they need to learn how to analyse a text. As a result my
initial response was to tone down my cultuurtekst approach, so that discussing
                                                                                                Conclusion173

texts in class is not seen as explicit `text analysis', but instead as `talking about
the text', which is part and parcel of conversations building up linguistic skills.
My cultuurtekst pedagogy initially became even more implicit than the one I
described in this book.

  However, since I have analysed the data and completed the study, I have
come to the conclusion that rather than making my approach less explicit, I
should make it more so. In order to deal with the tensions thrown up by using
conflicting perspectives in class, I should embrace rather than avoid them.
Indeed, when looking at texts and carrying out tasks, I now explain explicitly
from which view of text and criticality we are operating; whether we are look-
ing at text structures, whether arguments are convincing and whether we focus
on writing solidly argued texts ourselves, or whether, in contrast, we are engag-
ing in discursive mapping. I do not tiptoe around the notion of discourses any
more, but address these explicitly in class, if relevant. My pedagogy is still one
of explicit heteroglossia; we read texts from a large variety of genres - each text
including multiple voices and discourses - which we analyse whilst discuss-
ing the issues thrown up by these. This way, students adapt their writing more
consciously to a variety of readers, drawing on discourses more consciously
and explicitly.

  The personal in language learning also needs to be embraced more explicitly.
I now ask students on occasion to relate their own experiences to the texts we
read and the tasks we do in class. I also ask students to reflect on their own
interpretations of texts and how these relate, not only to their particular set of
experiences, but especially to their understanding of these experiences in rela-
tion to discursive forces. Moreover, I ask students to be reflexive about their
own writing in relation to their own and the other (culture's) context: why they
have written a particular text in a particular way. Bringing the Self into stu-
dents' language tasks like this, resonates with the point that Sarah referred to
in her interview: that the course should look at what makes individuals com-
municate the way they do. So far, I have only included this reflexivity as part
of class discussions, but in future I will embed this more thoroughly in the syl-
labus by asking students to write down these reflections in diaries.

  Being explicit to students about the conceptual framework I use is not an
insignificant point. It goes against the expectations students have about what
a language class should be. Moreover the concepts which are touched upon
are possibly also in conflict with students' views of what language, culture and
communication are, and how they interrelate. Provided students feel they are
at the same time gaining practical language skills, being open to students about
the concepts and conflicting perspectives can avoid resistance such as shown
by Sarah. In the end it was not so much the fact that my course addressed
notions with which she disagreed, it was the fact that I did not address these
issues more explicitly and in further depth. If you touch on issues of com-
munication, `real communication', she asserted, you can't leave issues hanging
mid-air.
174 Reading With My Eyes Open

  Even though my cultuurtekst pedagogy took a global perspective from the
start, the notion of a Dutch articulation brought the national back into focus.
This particular notion, I showed, proved not to be that useful, and to be fully
exploited also needs to be used explicitly for it to make sense to students with-
out it leading to stereotyping. However, I have since only referred to the notion
on very rare occasions. Indeed it has become almost an incidental part of my
pedagogy. Students themselves tend to take cosmopolitan perspectives in class,
as one of my examples of such a task below shows.

  By linking students' experiences with practical language tasks we can cre-
ate opportunities in class for communicative encounters where students can
engage their own beliefs and belongings to imagine themselves to have real
impact on the world - creatively and responsibly with an interest in and con-
cern for their communicative partners.

                                          Example

My study consisted of only two lessons out of a whole year long course where
I focus on reading and awareness raising. All the same, I have observed that
that awareness of how language and culture interrelate also benefits students'
language skills, as they will learn to think about and consequently adapt their
own language use as part of showing responsibility in communicative events.

  Claire had said in one of her interviews that when reading in the foreign
language, she was `reading with her eyes very very open, - with an alertness
to cultural connotations. I am arguing that in using the cultuurtekst approach,
students apply this awareness to the way they communicate in general - with
an alertness to cultural connotations and to how relations are constructed dis-
cursively. I discuss here two examples of tasks which I am using now in my
pedagogy where students write or speak `with their eyes very open'.

  Whilst I reject instrumentalism in its focus on skills at the expense of per-
sonal development, ethics and engaging with criticality, that does not mean
that language classes cannot include work related tasks. My examples below use
work related contexts and I illustrate how my approach differs from functional-
ist skills-based teaching. In instrumentalist-oriented language classes and text
books, the task of giving an oral presentation, for instance, tends to be accom-
panied by advice on structuring, how to introduce and finish a presentation,
and by providing some useful phrases. In a cultuurtekst-oriented approach
preparing students for an oral presentation could indeed include some of
these aspects (after all, students need to know the conventions before they can
choose whether they want to deviate from these or not), but emphasises par-
ticularly the relational aspects of positioning themselves towards the audience.
This means a reflection on how they are creating and conducting relationships.
It is through evoking the personal that students can start looking at communi-
cative situations critically.
                                                                                                Conclusion175

  In my advanced language class I start preparing students for an oral presen-
tation by asking them to reflect on their own previous experiences, either in a
personal social sphere or a work environment where they have had to present
information. This led to considerations of how their previous holiday jobs, for
instance, such as working in the visitor centre of London Zoo or being a tour
guide for Dutch tourists in Notre Dame in Paris, had been instances where they
had to consider and make decisions on their positioning of others, as well as
their positioning of themselves towards their imagined `clients'. In this process
students recollected situations in which they had to make on the spot decisions
on how to present information in ways that could be understood, and showed
concern for their communicative partners.

  The next stage of this particular task is to look at other presentations found
on the internet and students try and imagine themselves in the role of the
intended audience. How do they feel they are being positioned as an audi-
ence? Do they feel they are treated with respect? How does the context inform
the presenter's style? Has he/she taken note of their possible viewpoints and
previous knowledge? Are there particular assumptions which are underlying
some of these presentations? When students prepare their own presentations
in a work context of their own choosing, they try and get under the skin of
the imagined role they have set for themselves and also that of their imagined
audience, so they can decide what to present and how to do so. Elsewhere
I describe how students engage creatively with this task from a position of
justice, equality and respect for one another - how they utilize their cosmo-
politan empathy. They do not address an imagined monologic other, but a
complex one which necessitates them using multiple voices (Quist, 2013).
Their presentations feel authentic and do not employ the bland ready-made
style which tends to be found in course books using vocationally-oriented
language tasks.

  Another example in my current course is the task of writing emails or let-
ters in a work-oriented situation. Students start with reflecting on uncomfort-
able writing situations they have experienced where they were unsure how to
address their addressee or what tone to adopt. The writing task I give them
has a clearly described context of relations, e.g. they have to imagine them-
selves to be the Head of a school who writes to parents to explain particular
changes in the structure of the school. Students consider what tone to use, how
to position themselves as the Head, and how to position the parents. Students
then read out their finished work in class and receive feedback from the other
students, who imagine themselves in the position of the receivers of the text.
Students often comment on whether the text is too authoritarian to their liking
or conversely too hesitant in its tone, and differences in opinion about this are
discussed. Frequently this leads to hilarity as students, unsolicited by me, start
to relate these different styles and indeed discursive constructions, in this case
to do with education, to the individuals who wrote the texts. They often joke
about whether this tone fits with the perceived personality of the text writer.
176 Reading With My Eyes Open

In engaging in tasks such as these which combine the personal and the criti-
cal in very practical language tasks, students create dialogic spaces where they
can discuss in intensely personal and intimate ways why they have chosen the
communicative styles they have been using. This comes close to what Sarah had
said she had wanted to gain from the classes.

  My pedagogy is still evolving, but by reflecting on discourses, multiple voic-
edness, and on interpersonal and intercultural relations, we do not only offer
chances for students to being intercultural, but also to being human - to use
their sense of responsibility towards, and engagement with, others. This can be
applied to all manner of genres and tasks using all manner of language varieties
and purposes, from academic to journalistic to creative writing - all of which
invite students to reflect on conscious linguistic choices and encourage experi-
encing the communication process. These reflections also bring to the fore the
fluid process that communication is; it brings a realisation of the changeability
of communicative situations, the `ruptures', the fragility of our own positions,
and of text as culture. It also engages students' cosmopolitan attitudes using
their sympathetic imaginations (Quist, 2013).

     Towards a Theory of the Personal and the Critical: Embracing
                                Incompatibilities

The practical examples of the language tasks above, which combine an ethi-
cal, individual as well as a critical perspective with vocational concerns is not
meant to be a simple marrying of liberalist and instrumentalist approaches. The
accentuation of cosmopolitan and ethical concerns which may have found its
origin in the liberal humanistic paradigm transcends that particular philosoph-
ical perspective, and can just as easily be taken on board by the poststructuralist
critical perspective of discursive mapping.

  The seeming incompatibility and tensions which underpin this study in the
perceived philosophical conflicts in many of the concepts I have been advo-
cating, is perhaps not as much of a problem as is sometimes assumed. In this
I am reminded of the term Romantic Conceptualism, an art scholarly term,
described in 2006 by the Dutch critic Jan Verwoert to refer to conceptual art.
The two terms are not as incompatible as they seem. Conceptual art, whether
installation, video or performance, is often associated with a cold intellectual
approach to art and rigorous attention to simplicity of form. However, many
conceptual art pieces do in fact frequently draw attention to the actual pro-
cesses of producing meaning, relying on memories and expression of emotion.
The conceptual is thus being romanticized. In a similar way an intellectual
engagement with text, language and writing can draw on the actual processes of
meaning making and include personal reflections, creativity, a concern for oth-
ers, and relating one's own every day communicative experiences to the wider
cultural forces.
                                                                                                Conclusion177

  We are at the turning point of another shift in language teaching. One which
affords a greater role for personal stories and self exploration. The call for
romanticism as a new paradigm has been mooted by Ros i Solé and Fenoulhet
(2013) who propose a `Romantic turn' in language learning, emphasising an
engagement with learners' subjectivities, emotions and an acknowledgement of
the discomfort of interculturality.

  In the seeming incompatibility of the personal and the critical, I am reminded
of the traditional Sufi image which Elif Shafak (2011) conjures up of the upside
down tree, extending its roots in the air. Its life force, its cultural environment,
is provided by the arc of the vast blue sky full of the promise of possibilities. In
a similar way our students feed from this vastness to create their own stories
as they go about their journey: critical, accepting, adopting, adapting, making
choices and creating their own stories of belongings.

    They earn money like water and have everything to their heart's desire,
    except a man. More and more well-educated women between 35 and
    54 are starting to panic because a potential father for their child has
    not yet turned up. They are sometimes cynical, often hard and always
    demanding.

Destroying men, they call it. Going out, dancing, drinking, flirting with
only one aim: to humiliate the male ego. `They' are Karin (37) and her three
friends. Great, well dressed girls they are, with the gift of the gab and they
have really made it. Designer clothes, roof garden, snazzy set of wheels under
their cellulite-free trained buttocks, make-up from Clarins en Roc, fridge full
with salmon and champagne and of course that job with challenging pros-
pects ....they are all in their own way equally successful and ...... equally sin-
gle. Well, the girls aren't missing out, you know. Dorien, 34 - top job at a bank,
has had a relationship with a married bloke for some years. Jose, 36 manager
of a hotel in Utrecht, has an impossible relationship with some vague painter
with an alcohol problem. Suzanne, 42, art director with an expensive flat on
one of the canals, seeks her pleasure in adventures with young men (`nothing
older than 25, after that they are past their sell-by date'). She doesn't want to
consider men of her own age. Since her great love (cliche, cliche) swopped
her two years ago for a young thing, she seems to want to take revenge on
every man of 35 plus. When the girls go out, she is the one who shouts `Come,
tonight we're going to destroy men!', which has become a battle cry in their
little group. Provoking, flirting, bit of snogging and just when he thinks he
has got it in the bag; drop him. Much more than that they don't get around to.
A real relationship? No, these women don't believe in that anymore. Al least,
that is what they say.
190 Reading With My Eyes Open

  Cold shivers were running down my spine when Karin, a friend of me, told
me a while ago about these escapades with her group of friends. Was this the
start of a new kind of woman? Or was this just the bawdy behaviour of a few
friends who in this way settle the account of a series of frustrated relation-
ships? I recognised this `cockteasing', and who doesn't? What man has not spent
evenings with women investing a small fortune in attentiveness, humour and
dinners and with zero point zero (sexual) gain? Nice game for a 19 year-old
girl trying to discover the rules of sexual conduct, but do you still do that when
you are 35 plus? Destroying men.... it sounded so hopelessly frustrated, so des-
perate, so calculated as well. During the research for this article I discovered
that Karin and her friends were not the only women who were keeping them-
selves occupied with this `sport'. In Nijmegen I spoke with Sybille Labrijn, a
35-year old psychologist who has carried out exhaustive research into relation-
ship problems of the successful woman. In the past four years she conducted
hundreds of therapeutic conversations with well educated women who have
problems finding a partner. She published her insights in Love is the only thing
I need now - a newly published book which unveils an honest portait of this
generation of women.

  Even though she never heard of the term `destroying men', Sybille Labrijn
does recognise the behaviour which the terms describes. `Some women, espe-
cially when they have been on their own for a while or have had several failed
relationships, want to armour themselves against new disappointments and
being hurt again. They rather hurt others than that they have to suffer more
pain in love themselves. Some hide behind an attitude of superiority and treat
men with a certain air of contempt: `We have more social skills, have a higher
E.Q. (Emotional Quotient) and are in fact more dazzling than men'. During
therapy I challenge them with questions such as `What makes you think that?
Does it help you to think like that?' Do you realise that by this kind of attitude
you form a barrier to the possibility of having an equal relationship and is that
what you want? And where does that idea come from?''

  Yes, indeed. Where does that idea come from? To answer those questions we
need to go back to the summer of 1986. In the States that year a statistical report
was published (the Bennett-Bloom-Craig study) stating that well educated
women of 35 years and older find it harder and harder to find a suitable partner.
`A woman over 40 has a higher statistical chance of dying through a terrorist
attack than to marry an parner of equal standing,' Newsweek summarised the
findings of the study in an oft quoted sentence which caused an uncomfortable
feeling. In the Netherlands filmmaker Marijke Jongbloed (43, well-educated,
living with a partner) was intrigued by this phenomenon. Armoured with her
camera she went to New York, the city where it is said that for every man there
are 5 single women. In her documentary Fatal Reaction New York, which came
out in 1996, the desperately seeking successful woman became personified
in the form of Laura Slutsky. With aching precision the 45 year old casting
director was followed closely on her odyssey along bookshelves full of self-help
                                                                                                  Appendix191

books with titles such as `If I'm so wonderful, why am I still single?', courses in
how to get a man, auctions where the highest bidder can win an evening out
with a man and countless visits to psychiatrist and fitness-clubs. `This situation
is God's cruel joke,' Slutsky says at a certain moment. `When I was twenty I had
enough egg-cells, but then I didn't know myself enough to find the right man
with whom to have children. And now that I am over forty and have worked
hard on my mental and physical aerobics and know who I am, my biological
clock has almost finished ticking - I have got only 6 egg-cells left! But the men
I meet now are damaged, B-choice. That is the price I've paid. I am angry! I
would warn my daughter.'

  And when she unexpectedly gets a boyfriend, she confronts him in conversa-
tions with such an aggressive tone that he recoils. She then uses the shoulder
of a psychiatrist to cry on. He confronts her with herself: `Laura, you are suc-
cessful. You have developed certain strategies to become successful. Confronta-
tional behaviour and responding critically are part of that; you don't let go eas-
ily. This way a pattern of attack and defends has developed in your relationship.
You attack, he defends and the other way round. You become ensnared in a
constant battle. That doesn't work in friendly relationships. Your game is power.
You might win the battle, but you l'll lose the war.'

  Apart from the toe curling pleasure the film affords, Marijke Jongbloed's most
important achievement is that she showed us that the single career woman is
a universal phenomenon. The woman from Amsterdam also filmed well-off
single women in Bombay and Singapore and a programme on Moscow is being
planned. Jongbloed would have liked to direct her camera with the same sur-
gical precision on to the arena of Dutch single women, but she didn't find a
suitable woman. Even though you would imagine there is no shortage of candi-
dates: according to the CBS our country has 60,000 women between 35 and 54
without a partner (see inset page 48).

                   The career-woman: instructions for use

What do you do when you get trapped in a relationship with a career woman
seasoned in the top of the business world? Let's look at the way in which psy-
chologist Sybille Labrijn analyses these women. The first thing she looks at is
family history. Labrijn: `Of course your childhood experiences do not deter-
mine everything, but through your upbringing you get a blueprint for the way
you handle relationships in years to come. During the 60ies and 70ies, the
era in which this generation of women has grown up, the role of the father
was still quite traditional. That means: dad was often not home or had little
time. Being neglected by dad invites rebellion; she ends up mistrusting and
rejecting her father. And to compensate for his absence you frequently see that
women will identify themselves with masculinity. Dad did not give them what
was needed? Well, they'll take care of it themselves. That way they build up a
192 Reading With My Eyes Open

strong, male ego-identity by focusing on achievements. But the male identity
is nothing more than a thin protective layer, an armour against the pain caused
by the rejection of their father which resulted in their feelings of self-worth
being undermined'.

  This `armed Amazon', a term that Labrijn borrowed from psychologist Linda
Leonard, possesses the toughness to succeed but her protective layer cuts her
off from her soft side, her creativity, her ability to take on relationships on equal
terms, Labrijn says in her book.

  When Labrijn focuses on the way these women conduct social relationships,
it appears they have an inability to show their dependent side. `Being able to be
dependent is the current taboo of the successful single woman,' Labrijn states.
`These women have told themselves not to be as dependent as their mothers.
But what should they do? If they received little recognition from their fathers,
they can react like: `I don't need any recognition, I can do everything myself, I
won't ask anyone for advice. I rather learn from my own mistakes then that I do
something which someone else told me to do.' Look, in a good relationship you
can be flexible in your attitude; sometimes you are the weaker one, sometimes
the stronger one. But these what I call `counter-dependent' women, are stuck in
their attitude of `I need to be in control, and I don't want to lean on any one'. To
be contra-dependent is to be dependent on being independent. And they can-
not give up that attitude of independence, not even temporarily.'

  In her therapy sessions, well-educated clients are trained in alternative
behaviour. Labrijn: I check with my clients what kind of behaviour they like
to change. Frequently these are forms of behaviour they don't feel comfortable
with. As far as the area of counter-dependency is concerned this can mean: not
debating exclusively the last political developments with men; not always being
quick of the mark and trying to win one over their partner. In itself that might
be O.K., but not when this has become an automatic pattern of behaviour, then
it's not a choice anymore and forms a barrier to intimacy. And conversely, when
women are too dependent we can practise behavioural patterns such as not to
worry about questions like `what does he really think of me?', but instead to sit
back and ask `What do I actually think of him?''.

  It might be clear: `an armed Amazon' is a woman who needs instructions
for use. Men who fall in love with her will have to learn to `read' her. Apart
from that men need to be crystal clear themselves. Labrijn give a few practical
tips: `Be as direct as you can about what you don't like and even more impor-
tantly: be also clear about what you do want. Women are still too much the
architects of the relationship. And men are inclined to withdraw if they feel a
woman wants too much. Sort out together what feels right and what doesn't
in the relationship, even if you haven't got ready-made answers. And stick to
your own convictions. If you notice a woman is turning a conversation into a
competition of who is wittiest, don't go along with it. If you initiate a more per-
sonal topic she is forced to respond to that. And when a woman is too depend-
                                                                                                  Appendix193

ent you should be true to yourself too. Don't take on any responsibilities, but
pass them back to her. Be aware of your own limits and make these explicit to
her. Besides, men can also be counter-dependent, too romantic, not critical
enough or perhaps too critical. That influences relationships. So men get the
same advice: look at yourself '.

  The results of her therapeutic sessions fall occasionally on the doormat in the
shape of birth or marriage announcements. `That's really nice', Labrijn smiles.
In the late 80ies she became interested in this topic because she - and a lot of her
friends and colleagues - didn't seem to be able to develop lasting relationships.
Two months ago she herself sent out a huge number of birth announcements
to celebrate the arrival of her first son Tijmen. `He is a real example of Men's
Health,' she beams. `My relationship has been going really well for the past five
years, that is really lovely. But we had to learn, especially women of my genera-
tion. We, women of 30 years and older, belong to the `awareness' generation.
This phase had to be experienced, but there was a sense of rebelling against men
and there was some contempt. During the second feminist wave men were held
individually responsible for all kinds of social injustice, for inequalities. That
encouraged the attitude of contempt for men, and our generation does have
that problem. I think now the time is right for a different attitude.

Inset:

 This is how to recognise a desperada

 There are places where you have to be careful to put an arm over the shoulder of a
 woman. Because when you take your arm away after 10 minutes or so, there's a good
 chance you're wearing a wedding ring. A little exaggerated of course, but the army
 of well-educated women looking for a Perfect Partner, contains many desperate
 women of 30+. And some of these will go a whole lot further than a joke with a wed-
 ding ring. You won't be the first one who has been `accidently' chosen to be a father.
 Watch out for these desperadas. How do you recognise them? Count the points and
 read the result below.

 -- She is between 35 and 45, has a busy well-paid job and lives in a city (5)

Untangling the various approaches to language teaching and their history,
Gerdi Quist maps recent thinking in language studies at university. Us-
ing an interdisciplinary theoretical framework, drawn from educational
philosophy, cultural studies, intercultural studies and language pedagogy,
the author discusses the many tensions and currents in contemporary
language teaching.

The author puts forward an alternative pedagogy, that of a cultuurtekst-
perspective, which engages learners at complex linguistic and cultural
levels. In discussing the case study in which this approach is tested, the
author develops her argument for embracing various critical perspec-
tives through the personal engagement of students. From the start the
author acknowledges her own engaged position as a language teacher in
a liberal humanistic educational environment. She adopts a self -critical
perspective through which her engagement with adverse student reac-
tion leads to deepening insights both for the author and her students as
part of the non-linear process of learning.

`This book should be obligatory reading for all new lecturers in foreign
languages at university. It is extremely thought-provoking and will help
them make sense of the world in which they find themselves.' Jane Fe-
noulhet (Professor in Dutch Studies and co-editor of Mobility and Locali-
sation in Language Learning)

Gerdi Quist teaches Dutch language and lectures on multiculturalism
and intercultural communication. Recent publications included a book
chapter and journal articles on language pedagogy and intercultural com-
munication.
