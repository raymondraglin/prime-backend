Series Editor, Susan H. McLeod

The Perspectives on Writing series addresses writing studies in a broad sense.
Consistent with the wide ranging approaches characteristic of teaching and
scholarship in writing across the curriculum, the series presents works that take
divergent perspectives on working as a writer, teaching writing, administering
writing programs, and studying writing in its various forms.

The WAC Clearinghouse and Parlor Press are collaborating so that these books
will be widely available through free digital distribution and low-cost print edi-
tions. The publishers and the Series editor are teachers and researchers of writing,
committed to the principle that knowledge should freely circulate. We see the
opportunities that new technologies have for further democratizing knowledge.
And we see that to share the power of writing is to share the means for all to
articulate their needs, interest, and learning into the great experiment of literacy.

DEDICATION
    This book is dedicated to the early pioneers in online writing instruction

(OWI), who excitedly and doggedly explored the practices, pedagogies, and the-
ories involved with moving composition to computer labs/classrooms and then
into cyberspace. In particular, we wish to honor such innovators and thinkers as
Cynthia Selfe; Gail Hawisher; Hugh Burns; Patricia Sullivan; Beth Kolko; Car-
olyn Handa; Deborah Holdstein; John Slatin; Fred Kemp and the entire Texas
Tech crew that engaged computer technology for writing instruction in highly
practical ways; the establishing creators and editors of Kairos: A Journal of Rhet-
oric, Pedagogy, and Technology (Mick Doherty, James Inman, Douglas Eyman,
Cheryl Ball, and many other intrepid adventurers) who understood the creative
and collaborative values of asking scholars to write in multimodal, online spaces;
and the many other rhetoricians, technorhetoricians, scholars, and educators
who have taken OWI from its earliest inceptions and brought it into the twen-
ty-first century as a vital and nearly ubiquitous environment for teaching and
learning writing.

 FOUNDATIONAL PRACTICES OF
ONLINE WRITING INSTRUCTION
PREFACE

      Webster Newbold
      Ball State University

    "Screeeeeeeech-squeeeeeeeek-squaaaaaaaawwk!" The 300-baud modems
picked up the incoming calls from a half-dozen students who were then on the
cutting edge of higher education, enrolled in my English composition class,
which was taught via remote access to the Daedalus Integrated Writing Environ-
ment (DIWE) in our department's two local-area network (LAN) classrooms.
The year was 1991. For some time we had been seeking to legitimize comput-
er-assisted instruction (CAI) in language teaching areas by recasting its drill-
and-practice reputation into potential for interactivity between writers--teach-
ers and students--with real exchange and dialogue via networked machines.
Several of us in the composition faculty had persuaded our university to invest
in the possibilities for advancing writing instruction through network pedagogy.
We had sensed the promise of digital technology for revolutionizing not only
personal composing but also writing instruction, and we wanted to experiment
to see what was possible.

    As the dial-up students, or some of them, made the connection with com-
puters on our LAN, they slowly--painfully--logged into the Daedalus system
and began a real time written conversation in the Interchange conferencing ap-
plication.

         "How are you today, Bob?" I sent out into the ether.
         "I'm ... fine ... Dr... . Newbold ... how ... are ... you?" crept
         across the monochrome screen.
         "Steve, are you there too?"
         "I ... think ... so ... gosh ... this ... is ... slow"
         "Did everyone understand the reading for today?"
         "Kind ... of ... what ... is ... our ... assignment ... going ... to ...
         be?"

    And so a long journey was begun with halting steps. It was a kairotic mo-
ment. Opportunity was at the threshold. Computer networks promised to bring
people together, to erase barriers, to promote collaboration. We were riding the
Third Wave and were energized by what we saw ahead. But serious hurdles stood
in the way. What about access? Only some institutions could offer such facilities
as we had, and few individuals outside the professional class owned personal

Preface

computers. What about our technology? It often failed and was difficult for
non-experts to navigate. What about professional legitimacy? Many of our col-
leagues were openly skeptical about teaching writing with computers. Still, the
possibilities for extending and enriching our teaching, and for meeting needs
of students, encouraged us. We knew that "technology was advancing" and at-
titudes toward online education were changing. We had a growing professional
community to rely on and to learn from. So we went onward into the breach.

    Recently, I was hurrying to an on-campus class clutching my Wi-Fi connect-
ed laptop, through which I had access via cloud storage to prearranged teaching
content. Once in the classroom, I connected to the ceiling projector to show
screen images of lesson concepts, examples, and websites, including our Black-
board learning management system (LMS). About three-quarters of my students
had brought their own laptops with Internet access, and could pull up a Google
doc that we would later use for group editing; students without laptops could
use the classroom's own desktop stations. Most students knew what they were
doing--many knew more than I did, in fact, about navigating devices and net-
work pathways. In the middle of this buzz of activity, I suddenly thought "This
has finally come together. This is what we were hoping for years ago. Now it's up
to us to use it wisely."

IMPORTANCE OF THE OWI PRINCIPLES

    Of course, writing educators have been working hard at doing just that--us-
ing digital technology wisely in writing instruction, but individual efforts and
professional projects have not until now been able to draw on a comprehen-
sive, research-based resource representing the potentially most effective practices
in teaching writing online. The group of teacher-scholars behind this volume,
past and current members of the College Conference on Composition and
Communication (CCCC) Committee for Effective Practices in Online Writ-
ing Instruction (OWI) and members of their CCCC OWI Committee Expert/
Stakeholders' Panel, has attempted to provide that resource, under the charge
of the CCCC Executive Committee. The 15 OWI principles articulated in A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for Online Writing
Instruction (OWI) provide a broad, research-based distillation of the problems,
strategies, and conditions of postsecondary writing instruction online (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013).

    Readers may be surprised that the first principle--the keynote of the docu-
ment--deals not with pedagogy but with issues of inclusion and access--equity
for all students who wish to study writing online, especially those with physical
or learning disabilities, socioeconomic limitations, and multilingual challenges:

                                                                                                      Newbold

"Online writing instruction should be universally inclusive and accessible" (p.
7). But seeking greater opportunity for disabled students (sight- and hearing-im-
paired students come particularly to mind) can be seen as just the latest stage
in a struggle to provide learning opportunities to all persons regardless of back-
ground or personal condition. The history of education in the past two centu-
ries, in the United States and elsewhere, has been one of steady effort (although,
admittedly, not in every quarter) to expand opportunity to students at all lev-
els--to remove barriers of economic status, gender, ethnicity, and race. Now the
focus is rightfully on those challenged by disability and similar disadvantages.
Online teaching and learning presents some special problems in this ongoing
struggle for access, problems that A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI addresses forthrightly in Principle 1 and implicitly in
the other OWI principles. Not the least problem is the lack of awareness on the
part of many about the difficulty blind students may face, for example, in merely
reading screen text, or the issues that academic language presented onscreen may
pose for the learning disabled. It is not only right that educators work to meet
the needs of all of our students--indeed make it a first priority for OWI--but
it is our institutions' legal responsibility and ours as employees to make appro-
priate accommodations under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) of
1990 (see also Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973). In addition to
those protected by the ADA, OWI instructors have to proactively create oppor-
tunities and provide access to those who experience academic challenges due
to socioeconomic and/or linguistic challenges. Until my work with the CCCC
OWI Committee, I know that I had thought too little about the broad issue of
access as I designed and carried out my own online classes. The CCCC OWI
Committee hopes that OWI Principle 1 will provide an opportunity for many
in our community to rethink and re-enact access in our teaching.

    Writing pedagogy itself, whose basic theory is valid in any teaching-learning
environment, is the focus of the first section of the document. The principles
remind us of what have been widespread and implicit tenets in our profession:
online writing courses (OWCs) should focus on writing rather than digital tech-
nology; teaching-learning strategies should make use of the affordances of the
digital environment; and appropriate traditional theories, pedagogies, and strat-
egies should be adapted to teaching online. Improving the skill of our students
by retaining the value in proven methods, while adapting them to new forms of
teaching-learning interactions, has always made sense. With elucidation of these
general principles through examples of specific effective practices, the document
points to practical steps that can be taken to support the quality and effective-
ness of our teaching online.

    Related concerns and interests of teachers and students also are focal points

                                                                                                    5

of the document. Teachers have a right to maintain reasonable control of their
intellectual property as technologies enable "teaching" to be offered in a variety
of ways that may benefit institutions more than instructors and their students.
Materials being used in successive courses without the participation of the au-
thoring teacher, stand-alone independent courses, and even massive online open
courses (MOOCs) place stress on existing pedagogical and compensatory mod-
els. Those who teach online must not be put at a personal and professional disad-
vantage: appropriate compensation, workload, and training increase teachers' ef-
fectiveness and enrich students' learning. Teachers' satisfaction, often overlooked
and undervalued, also is a core component of effective OWI.

    Clearly, the needs of students should be understood and addressed. Online
students should be prepared by both the institution and teacher for effective
learning. This learning should take place in the context of online relationships
involving peers and instructors, and general and technical assistance should be
readily available both online and onsite. Helping students learn how to use any
applicable hardware and software systems, and providing clear access to institu-
tional resources such as library databases and research aids are other important
components of student's success online. Major support for online writing stu-
dents from writing centers and online writing labs (OWLs) has been increas-
ingly available; writing programs and institutions need to ensure appropriate
selection and training of tutors to make effective use of the online environment.

    Those in charge--administrators, faculty, and tutors--have a special respon-
sibility to coordinate and maximize the OWI enterprise within our institutions.
This means not only proper oversight of classes and programs, but also orga-
nizing and conducting assessment and research with the goal of improving stu-
dents' achievement and teachers' effectiveness and satisfaction. The whole writ-
ing instruction community can and should benefit from this shared knowledge.

THE URGENT NEED FOR PRINCIPLED OWI

    All of us engaged in OWI have thought at one time or other about these
obligations and challenges, but A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI focuses urgency in presenting them together as prin-
ciples generated from survey, field, interview, and scholarly literature research.
At several levels, the OWI principles can assist, support, and encourage teachers
and administrators to engage in or offer quality, effective OWI as the number
of enrolled students and teachers involved increases every year. In their Intro-
duction to this book, Beth L. Hewett and Kevin Eric DePew report startling
findings released by the Sloan Consortium: over the past ten years, the annual
growth rates of online enrollments in all areas of higher education have varied

                                                                                                      Newbold

from 9.3% to 17.3%, and total enrollments have leaped from 9.6% of all stu-
dents in 2002 to 33.5% in 2012 (Allen & Seaman, 2014). These numbers alone
should make all engaged in English education and writing instruction sit up and
take notice of the need to meet this challenge.

    The broad scope of the OWI principles and example effective practices pre-
sented in this volume makes them particularly valuable for starting discussions
on campuses and within institutions where OWI is increasingly prevalent and
important. The strong position that A Position Statement of Principles and Exam-
ple Effective Practices for OWI and this book take regarding the need for access
and inclusivity in OWI calls everyone to account in making this long-term goal
of literacy education move closer to universal inclusion; students with disabil-
ities and other socioeconomic and language-based challenges know best what
they need, and, indeed, insist on in their education. Teachers, writing program
and departmental leaders, and senior administrators now have a reasonable, re-
search-based foundation for negotiating how best to meet needs on all sides
and how to plan for expanding OWI and making it a strong part of the literacy
curriculum.

    We need OWI to succeed as part of the new culture-wide, digital landscape:
individually, institutionally, and nationally, we must grow in positive ways, with-
out overlooking the interests of any one group or our responsibilities as educa-
tors, including our obligations under the law. The 15 OWI principles explicated
in this book can help us to make genuine and meaningful progress toward this
goal.

This introduction defines OWI and summarizes the research history be-
hind the CCCC Committee for Effective Practices in OWI's The State
of the Art of OWI (2011) and A Position Statement of Principles and Ex-
ample Effective Practices for OWI (2013). To support these practices, this
introduction briefly presents the CCCC OWI Committee's process for
producing these findings is described and the key issues (i.e., the role of
student inclusivity, OWLs, administrative concerns, and faculty and stu-
dent preparation) that are discussed in detail throughout this collection.

    The CCCC Committee for Effective Practices in Online Writing Instruction
(OWI) was first constituted by the CCCC Executive Committee (EC) in March
2007. The members are a diverse group of OWI educators and scholars: those
who work for traditional and for-profit four-year and two-year postsecondary
institutions; part- and full-time composition educators; administrators and oth-
er stakeholders; specialists in multilingual writers,1 disabilities-based OWI, and
other learning needs/preferences; and online tutors and administrators.

    The CCCC OWI Committee's original charges were to:

   1. Identify and examine best strategies for online writing instruction in hy-
       brid and distance-based composition classrooms.

   2. Identify best practices for using various online media and pedagogies
       (e.g., networked classrooms, email and Internet-based conferences,

Introduction

       peer-reviewed papers) for the teaching of writing with both synchronous
       and asynchronous modalities while taking into consideration currently
       popular learning management environments.
   3. Identify best practices for using online writing instruction for English
       language learners and students with disabilities.2
   4. Identify best practices for training and professional development of OWI
       teachers.

    When the CCCC OWI Committee was reconstituted and recharged in
2010, its responsibilities were updated to:

   1. Identify and examine best strategies for online writing instruction using
       various online media and pedagogies primarily used for the teaching of
       writing in blended, hybrid, and distance-based writing classrooms, specif-
       ically composition classrooms, but including other college writing cours-
       es.

   2. Identify best practices for using online instruction specifically for English
       language learners and individuals with disabilities in coordination with
       related CCCC committees.

   3. Create a Position Statement on the Principles and Standards for OWI
       Preparation and Instruction. In consultation with the Assessment Com-
       mittee and the Task Force on Position Statements, review and update the
       2004 Position Statement "Teaching, Learning, and Assessing Writing in
       Digital Environments."

   4. Share best practices in OWI with the CCCC membership in a variety of
       formats.

    As of 2013, the CCCC OWI Committee's charges have evolved to:

   1. Continue to identify, examine, and research online writing instruction
       (OWI) principles and effective strategies in online writing centers and
       in blended, hybrid, and distance-based writing classrooms, specifically
       composition classrooms but also including other college-writing or writ-
       ing-intensive disciplinary courses.

   2. Continue to identify, examine, and research effective practices for using
       OWI specifically for English language learners, individuals with physical
       and/or learning disabilities, and students with socioeconomic challenges
       in coordination with related CCCC committees.

   3. Maintain and update the Position Statement on the OWI principles and
       effective practices.

   4. In consultation with the Assessment Committee and other relevant
       groups, review and update the 2004 Position Statement "Teaching,
       Learning, and Assessing Writing in Digital Environments."

   5. Identify and/or create instructional and professional development ma-
       terials and strategies to be posted on the Committee's Web-based OWI
       Open Resource Web page.

   6. Provide the writing instructional community with access to information
       about OWI-specific faculty and program development that can assist
       with legitimizing online teaching for professional development, remu-
       neration, and advancement purposes.

   7. Share effective practices in OWI with the CCCC membership in various
       formats, including instructional workshops at CCCC conferences and
       events as well as other professional venues.

    In order to meet these charges, which always have been broad, deep, and
challenging, the CCCC OWI Committee has undertaken extensive qualitative
and quantitative research on student, instructional, and administrative OWI
concerns and issues; compiled and analyzed the results; and composed a position
statement outlining foundational principles that can lead to what we believe are
potentially effective OWI practices. Currently, the CCCC OWI Committee is
producing the OWI Open Resource, a Web-based source for OWI administra-
tors, teachers, and tutors to submit their own effective practices grounded in the
OWI principles for publication.

    The primary results of all of these projects are the fifteen principles enumer-
ated in A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) (an official educational statement approved
by the CCCC Executive Committee) as well as in Chapter 1 of this book and
considered in the rest of this book's chapters. Foundational Practices of Online
Writing Instruction particularly responds to the CCCC OWI Committee's cur-
rent seventh charge to share its knowledge by summarizing and explaining these
principles and practices, and this book illustrates applications of these practices
for administrators and instructors with varying degrees of OWI experience.

    Foundational Practices of Online Writing Instruction, written by current and
former CCCC OWI Committee members and acknowledged OWI experts and
stakeholders, actually may pose more questions than it answers because so much
remains unknown about OWI. Although the authors have tried to address their
subjects with straightforward information and thoughtful guidance regarding
the OWI principles enumerated in Chapter 1, they acknowledge that they re-
main curious and uncertain about many issues relative to OWI. This, we think,
is a good thing. We anticipate that our audience will leave this collection with as
many questions as they have answers. Some of these questions reflect the current
state of OWI and the fact that there is still a lot more to learn about its prac-
tice (see Chapters 17 & 18). Other questions provide heuristics for administra-
tors and instructors in local settings. Rather than approaching a local situation

                                                                                                  13
Introduction

knowing exactly what practice to adopt, we want our audience of administrators
and instructors to pose questions to themselves as they design their effective
practices based on the grounded principles presented in this book. Foundational
Practices of Online Writing Instruction has been developed to engage the nuances
and complexities of OWI at a time when higher education is struggling with
its historical bearings, contemporary reputation, financial challenges, and fu-
ture goals. There is no question that OWI will be a part of higher education's
future, but as Chapter 18 states, the future is now. When OWI is addressed in a
principled manner, administrators and instructors will have reasonable guidance
in sometimes murky waters--all to the benefit of writing students, who are
flocking to online courses in unprecedented numbers and often with unrealistic
expectations.

    Take the issue of multimodality and its connections to online writing in-
struction (addressed in Chapter 15), for example. When thinking about multi-
modality as a subject for OWI, we must ask such questions as:

    · What is writing as text, as discourse, as image, as audio, as video?
    · Where alphabetic literacy has been primary--and, quite likely will re-

        main primary--to our society's communication habits, how does OWI
        approach the teaching of multimodality? Or, should it leave such teach-
        ing to courses specializing in digital writing?
    · Are these discourse approaches part and parcel of the same communica-
        tive need in the digital, twenty-first century?
    · How does teaching multimodality in an OWI setting function versus
        teaching it in a traditional onsite setting?
    · How do the complexities of having well-prepared teachers of multimodal
        OWI and sufficiently financed programs affect students from multilin-
        gual and socioeconomically challenged backgrounds, as well as for stu-
        dents with various physical or learning differences?

    When thinking about multimodality as a means for improving inclusion and
access of OWI students with different learning needs and for OWI instructors
with particular teaching strengths, we must ask such questions as:

    · How do OWI and multimodality work together (and against each other)
        when multimodality is one venue used to provide access for students and
        teachers?

    · How do issues of access differ when multimodality is the subject of the
        writing course as well as one means for reaching students with different
        learning needs?

    These kinds of questions complicate an already complex learning environ-
ment that is fraught with multiple levels of teaching and learning considerations.

Similar questions can be asked about the primary topics of each of Foundational
Practices of Online Writing Instruction's chapters. Although we hope we have ad-
dressed readers' most pressing questions about OWI, we recognize that asking
new questions may be even more important than articulating answers at this
point in OWI's history--particularly given that no one answer will work in
every institutional setting.

    This Introduction outlines some of the questions and processes that have
led to a clearer understanding of grounding principles for OWI and what we
have chosen to call effective practices in keeping with the Sloan Consortium's
Janet Moore (2011), who used this term to acknowledge the "rapid" changes
occurring in online instruction overall (p. 93). The CCCC OWI Committee
believes that such changes are ongoing, which suggests that effective practices for
differing settings, institutions, administrators, faculty, and students will evolve
continually.

WHAT IS OWI?

    Online writing instruction, or OWI, can be defined as:

         writing instruction that occurs--at least partially if not ful-
         ly--in a computer-based, Internet, or intranet instructional
         setting. It uses online/digital media to provide instruction; to
         talk about writing; or to distribute, share, and/or collect writ-
         ing-related materials. OWI can occur in either the synchro-
         nous or asynchronous modality using a variety of electronic
         media, platforms, and technologies. (CCCC OWI Commit-
         tee, 2011c, p. 2)

    For some educators and scholars, OWI is a deficit model in comparison
with the traditional, face-to-face (onsite) writing instruction undertaken from
the time of Aristotle until about thirty years ago. As numerous articles attest,
people worry that the loss of body/face/voice occurring in asynchronous settings
particularly lead to a less humanly affective setting for courses that have come
to be understood as social spaces for writing and sharing writing (DePew &
Lettner-Rust, 2009; Gouge, 2009; Powers, 2010). Despite the potential for such
misgivings, the CCCC OWI Committee (2011) determined in its The State of
the Art of OWI that it recognized:

         a difference in a (currently) primarily text-based online
         instructional environment from one that traditionally occurs
         face-to-face. The Committee takes no position on the oft-
         asked question of whether OWI should be used and prac-

                                                                                                  15
Introduction

         ticed in postsecondary settings because it accepts the reality
         that currently OWI is used and practiced in such settings.
         The Committee therefore believes that OWI needs its own
         study, theories, and practices. The Committee fundamental-
         ly believes that OWI has the potential to be an efficacious
         activity for postsecondary students and faculty. It recognizes,
         however, that some students and faculty will be better suited
         to the online educational environment than others. Further,
         it seems that there are certain conditions under which OWI
         can be implemented more effectively than others. Discerning
         and describing such conditions are part of this committee's
         charges. (p. 2)

    Theories of OWI have been scarce, yet a few educators and scholars have
posited new ideas, as shown in Chapter 17 of this book.

BEGINNING OF THE CCCC OWI COMMITTEE'S WORK

    The CCCC OWI Committee's charges provided an exigency that prompted
careful research into OWI. In our first face-to-face meeting, which occurred
at the annual CCCC convention in 2007, CCCC OWI Committee members
looked to one another and considered where to begin. None of us had any
"best" practices ready to offer--particularly for so many different settings in any
modality. Hence, we knew that in-depth research into the problems was needed.
We began the research, as most people do, with a series of questions adapted at
first from Sloan Consortium (2005) materials.

    The Sloan Consortium identified the criteria of effective, or best, practices
in online education, which we considered to be related to OWI and interdepen-
dent with it in that "practices in one area affect quality in another":

    · Innovation--the practice is inventive or original. Of this particular cri-
        terion, we knew that innovation is important to working in the online
        setting; however, we wondered whether innovation is necessary for all of
        OWI. Although certainly innovative practices needed to be developed,
        we believed that at least some non-original practices in composition in-
        struction could be adapted to OWI and would seem to be warranted by
        the context. This notion would later be folded into OWI Principle 4 (p.
        17).

    · Replicability--the practice can be implemented in a variety of learning envi-
        ronments. OWI is used in fully online (i.e., completely asynchronous and
        electronically synchronous) settings as well as with hybrid ones. It is used

16
                                                                                          Hewett and DePew

        for writing students in traditional and for-profit two-year and four-year
        institutions, as well as for learning support in the form of tutoring and
        other question/answer or advice settings. It is used with widely varied
        student populations in terms of ages, educational and economic back-
        grounds, learning needs and preferences, physical abilities, and linguistic
        contexts. While every OWI practice may not apply in all settings, many
        do transfer and can be adapted from a general practice to one that works
        in a specific institution or for a particular teacher's course.
    · Potential impact--the practice would advance the field if many adopted it.
        We immediately saw a need for practices that would help the majority of
        instructors and students in OWI settings. At this point in our process,
        we had not realized that grounding principles might work better than a
        series of so-called best practices, but we did see that many educators and
        administrators in the field had been left to develop their own practices in
        isolation and, in effect, to reinvent the proverbial wheel. A more central-
        ized or focused document would be helpful to move the field forward.
    · Supporting documentation--the practice is supported with evidence of ef-
        fectiveness. Although not every potentially effective practice has been re-
        searched empirically, many educators can point to evidence--anecdotal
        at a minimum--to argue for the effectiveness of their practices. We be-
        lieved we could uncover some of these practices and find in the literature
        and in actual practice reasons for why they work. The need for support-
        ing documentation framed the OWI research we outlined and conducted
        for our first six years.
    · Scope--the practice explains its relationship with other quality elements.
        This notion of scope seems related to the idea that a practice grounded in
        principles holds in multiple settings and connects with other practices to
        create an effective OWI environment. We realized early that there needed
        to be connective tissue for the desired best practices document and later
        discovered that tissue in a series of OWI principles.

    The Sloan Consortium also identified the elements of "quality pillars" in
online learning as:

    · Learning Effectiveness: The provider demonstrates that the quality of learning
        online is comparable to the quality of its traditional programs. OWI research
        into effectiveness was and is relatively slender given the challenges of con-
        ducting any replicable, aggregable, and data-supported (RAD) research
        in composition studies (Haswell, 2005). Yet, learning effectiveness is one
        significant measure of whether OWI is being developed in ways that help
        students learn to write sufficiently for their college settings.

                                                                                                  17
Introduction

    · Cost Effectiveness and Institutional Commitment: Institutions continuous-
        ly improve services while reducing cost. The CCCC OWI Committee re-
        mained aware of the need for cost effectiveness for institutions, but it was
        more conscious of actions that institutions might need to undertake to
        support their learners and teachers in OWI. Cost reduction is especially
        emphasized for contemporary education, but OWI is not necessarily the
        place to achieve it (DePew, Fishman, Ruetenik, & Romberger, 2006) and
        certainly not at the literal expense of teaching and learning.

    · Access: All learners who wish to learn online have the opportunity and can
        achieve success. Although it was not within the CCCC OWI Committee's
        first set of charges, we learned that both access and the intention to pro-
        vide it are crucial for any online communication--let alone OWI--to
        work. Even a PDF file that is not formatted for accessibility can be im-
        possible for a blind individual's screen reader, and either text-heavy or
        image-heavy presentations can disinclude many students from learning.
        Likewise, institutions need to develop methods for making their online
        writing courses (OWCs) and online writing labs (OWLs)3 available to
        students whose socioeconomic status limits their access to the technolo-
        gies that mediate these opportunities. Moreover, administrators and in-
        structors must not systemically limit the opportunities of students who
        produce different or non-standard varieties of English. It took us awhile,
        indeed far too long, but we came to realize that access is a first-degree
        concern, which eventually made it our overarching OWI principle (p. 7).

    · Faculty Satisfaction: Faculty achieve success with teaching online, citing ap-
        preciation and happiness. Faculty need to feel comfortable in the online
        educational setting, and that means they need to experience their work as
        supported through training and professional development. OWI faculty
        often express a sense of feeling alone and overworked. We understood
        immediately that faculty satisfaction is critical to potentially effective
        OWI, and we set out to learn what could foster that sense of satisfaction
        in this newer teaching environment.

    · Student Satisfaction: Students are successful in learning online and are
        pleased with their experience. Students, too, need to feel comfortable in
        the online educational environment. With annually increasing numbers
        of students entering the online educational arena--many born into the
        digital age--it might seem that they easily would find themselves experi-
        encing success in OWI. However, the anecdotal evidence for failure and
        lack of persistence is high, possibly because students--while Internet and
        computer savvy--lack focused experience with educational uses of tech-
        nology or, as Hewett (2015a) suggested, experience a literacy-cognition

18
                                                                                          Hewett and DePew

        gap when learning to write in online settings.

    Using these criteria and elements of effective online practice as initial guides,
the CCCC OWI Committee formulated the following initial questions for its
research:

    Research questions based on elements of effective practices

    Learning effectiveness:
    · What are the principles that ground effective student learning in an OWI

        environment?
    · What conditions foster such learning?

    Cost effectiveness and institutional commitment
    · What are quality benchmarks for OWI?
    · Costs:

         What are the financial costs of OWI?
         What are the hidden costs of OWI?
         How are these costs comparable to traditional writing instruction?
         How should institutions/administrators address these costs?
    · What are the features of institutional support for an effective/successful
        OWI program?

    Access
    · What conditions foster student access to OWI?
    · In what ways do administrators and faculty have similar and different

        responsibilities for fostering such access?
    · Along these lines, what conditions foster faculty access to OWI?

    Student satisfaction
    · What are characteristics of student satisfaction in an OWI environment?
    · What conditions foster student satisfaction?

    Faculty satisfaction
    · What are the characteristics of faculty satisfaction with OWI?
    · What conditions foster faculty satisfaction with OWI?
    · How should online instructors be evaluated, especially in comparison to

        existing evaluation structures used in tenure and promotion?

    Research questions based on specific elements of OWI

    Modality-specific questions
    · What are the characteristics of synchronous technologies in an OWI pro-

        gram?
    · What conditions foster successful synchronous OWI?
    · What are the characteristics of asynchronous technologies in an OWI

        program?

                                                                                                  19

of learning more about OWI in order to determine potentially effective prac-
tices.
    The CCCC OWI Committee has met face-to-face at the annual meeting of
the CCCC and through regular teleconferences from 2007 to date. We made a
commitment to each other that we would propose a panel and special interest
group (SIG) for presentation at the annual conferences to share our findings and
to listen to the needs of our colleagues interested in OWI.

RESEARCH INTO THE NATURE OF OWI

Annotated Bibliography

    The first research project that the CCCC OWI Committee (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2008) undertook was a review of the OWI literature deemed most
likely to outline or address effective practices. We reasoned that scholarship al-
ready might have delineated some ideal practices for OWI that would serve our
mission. The original nine committee members apportioned the literature from
the 1980s through 2008 and began reading. We decided to write an annotat-
ed bibliography and publish it to the CCCC OWI Committee's CCCC Web
page, using this intensive research to teach ourselves more about OWI and to
make our efforts more broadly useful. Edited by Keith Gibson and Hewett, the
bibliography's selected subject areas included OWI Pedagogy, OWI Technology,
E-learning, and Online Writing Centers.

Site Visits and Observations

    While the annotated bibliography enabled an understanding of previous re-
search, the CCCC OWI Committee quickly agreed that action-oriented and
empirical research was needed. The CCCC OWI Committee's earliest solid data

                                                                                                  21
Introduction

in 2008 emerged from three site visits4 to closely located, postsecondary insti-
tutions using OWI. There, Connie Mick and Hewett saw an interesting range
of availability, pedagogy, and support for and comfort level with OWI--all in a
very small geographical region. Because our hosts scheduled the time primarily
for faculty meetings and observations, the CCCC OWI Committee's visitors
were not able to meet with students in any of these institutions.

    At Ball State University, which at that time styled itself as the "most wired/
wireless campus," Mick and Hewett met with faculty and graduate students
who used technology regularly in their writing classes in a hybrid setting. The
hybrid course meant that students and instructors met all of their hours in the
computer lab and blended the technology and traditional teaching methods.
Ball State teachers indicated that they were helping undergraduate students to
navigate the rhetorical issues relative to technology and writing that they would
face in their future working lives. Graduate students had many opportunities for
professionalization regarding technology and writing instruction, and there were
numerous English-dedicated computer classrooms.

    At Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI), a school
where instructors indicated they were in "competition" with Ball State for stu-
dents, Mick and Hewett met with faculty that expressed a sense of being rela-
tively untrained for using technology in writing courses. They stated a future
intention to hire more teachers who were interested in and comfortable with
OWI. They had two dedicated computer classrooms and encouraged the use of
OnCourse, their learning management system (LMS) in a hybrid manner. For
them, hybrid meetings comprised one day in computer classroom and one day
in the traditional classroom, which the CCCC OWI Committee at first distin-
guished as a term from the more blended nature of the Ball State OWCs.

    At Purdue University, Mick and Hewett met with faculty and graduate stu-
dents who also were given technological opportunities that were supposed to
make them "marketable." At that time, relatively little technology-based teach-
ing was being done for first-year writing students. Instructors taught in a hybrid
setting using their computer classrooms; for Purdue, hybrid meant meeting one
day in the computer lab and two days in a traditional, onsite classroom. The
Purdue OWL, which had become famous for its numerous handouts available
online, was in the process of revamping its platform based on empirical usability
research; the new iteration was to be aimed at meeting the needs of a global read-
ership that might use the OWL to fill teacher/textbook gaps. The OWL also was
in the process of field-testing a home-grown asynchronous tutoring application,
a practice the famed OWL previously had rejected.

    Two additional site visits rounded out this stage of the research.
    Hewett visited with administrators and faculty members of the Universi-

22
                                                                                          Hewett and DePew

ty of Maryland University College (UMUC), who shared impressions of their
program. About 70% of courses were taught in a fully online setting; attempts
at hybrid instruction had only just begun there. Twelve writing courses at all
student levels were taught online regularly. With well over 250 faculty members
distributed across the United States and globally, a primary goal of administra-
tors was to train faculty well; they accomplished this through a comprehensive
two-week, financially uncompensated unit on online teaching; any attention to
teaching writing online was accomplished in also uncompensated, asynchronous
writing faculty meetings using a discussion board that teachers were expected to
check and review regularly. Using a home-developed asynchronous LMS called
WebTycho, instructors were provided teaching content through static modules;
they taught actively through group discussions (called "conferences") and essay
instruction. Site-visit participants stated that for students to be successful, they
needed to be self-motivated, disciplined, and willing and able to read the mod-
ules and instruction.

    Finally, Hewett visited Montgomery College, a prominent multi-campus,
community college in Maryland. There, she met with administrators and faculty
members, as well as students, who provided highlights of their OWI program.
Fully online courses taught by both full-time and part-time instructors included
their two-level first-year composition courses and business courses. These same
courses were offered as hybrid models (which they called blended) and in onsite,
networked computer classrooms. All OWCs were capped at 20 students while
other writing courses had higher caps of 25 students (except for developmental
writing, which was capped at 22 students). Students received a "mandatory"
orientation to their OWCs in a face-to-face setting although not all students
attended; however, the college was piloting online orientations for OWI. Stu-
dents shared that they liked the ease of typing over handwriting (a sentiment
echoed by one left-handed writer), the course structure, and a sense of the online
course mirroring the business world. They expressed that they disliked the need
to check online for instructor response and feedback and technology problems
like computer crashes.

    These site visits informed the CCCC OWI Committee on a number of is-
sues. For example, faculty made clear that the CCCC should urge institutional
support (i.e., financial compensation and course release) for training and ac-
culturating existing faculty in OWI pedagogical processes (i.e., moving beyond
familiarizing with the technology itself ).

National Surveys

    The next research project that the CCCC OWI Committee undertook was

                                                                                                  23
Introduction

to develop a trial survey to pilot at a special interest group (SIG) meeting at
the CCCC 2009 convention. Its purpose was to query NCTE members about
various OWI-focused concerns (i.e., administrative concerns, pedagogy, needed
research, teaching issues, and student needs) and to provide the data needed for
a final CCCC OWI Committee report. Questions for the pilot survey emerged
from the original research questions developed by the CCCC OWI Committee
and the previous two research steps of reviewing and annotating the published
literature and questioning and observing administrators, faculty, and students
during the site visits. The pilot revealed gaps in the survey and language issues
that needed to be corrected.

    The resulting survey was extensive, and NCTE's Executive Director Kent
Williamson personally helped the CCCC OWI Committee to revise it. Revi-
sion led to the survey being separated into two different questionnaires, one
addressing fully online OWI and the other addressing hybrid OWI. Because
of the scope of the CCCC OWI Committee's charges and because we did not
want to overtax our disciplinary colleagues by asking them to complete multiple
surveys over a period of months, the surveys remained comprehensive with an
estimated time of 45-60 minutes required to complete. They were fielded on the
NCTE website using Zoomerang in March, 2010 with 139 respondents for the
hybrid survey (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011b) and 158 for the fully online
one (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a). The resulting analysis of these surveys
comprised a report the CCCC OWI Committee called the State of the Art of
OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c) because we realized that the survey was
not yielding anything that could be called "best" or "effective" practices. Instead,
it was providing the then-baseline understanding of OWI. While the Executive
Summary and the entire report can be read online, the following excerpt of
emergent themes summarizes its results:

    1. Pedagogy: Teachers and administrators, to include those in writing cen-
         ters, typically are simply migrating traditional face-to-face writing ped-
         agogies to the online setting--both fully online and hybrid. Theory and
         practice specific to OWI has yet to be fully developed and engaged in
         postsecondary online settings across the United States.

    2. Training: Training is needed in pedagogy-specific theory and practice
         in both fully online and hybrid settings, but particularly in fully online
         settings because of its unique complete mediation by computers. In
         most cases, it appears that "writing" and how to achieve strong writing
         and identifiable student results are left out of online writing instruc-
         tional training.

    3. Supplemental Support: Online writing centers are not developed by
         enough institutions to handle the needs of students in both fully online

24
                                                                                          Hewett and DePew

         and hybrid online settings. To that end, training is insufficiently devel-
         oped to the unique setting as it is, re: above, migrated primarily from
         the face-to-face setting.
    4. English Language (EL2) Users: The needs of EL2 learners and users are
         vastly unknown and insufficiently addressed in the online setting--
         both fully online and hybrid.
    5. Students with Disabilities: The needs of students with various kinds of
         disabilities have not received sufficient and appropriate consideration in
         light of writing courses in online settings, although the hybrid setting
         indicates somewhat of a beginning. Teachers and administrators do not
         know what they are responsible to do or how to do it for any particular
         variation of learning or physical disabilities relative to the Americans
         with Disabilities Act (ADA) or to a particular student's specified needs.
    6. Satisfaction: Instructors are dissatisfied with the levels of support they
         receive regarding technology, course caps, training, pay, and profession-
         al development/interactions relative to OWI in both the fully online
         and hybrid settings. Such dissatisfaction can lead to poor teaching, low
         expectations for students and for an online course, and insufficient re-
         tention of experienced instructors at a time when OWI continues to
         grow. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 7)

    In sum, among other early findings, we learned that educators have a wide
range--from minimal to extensive--of preparation and training for their online
instruction. It appeared that much of the training had an extremely tactical
focus on how instructors can engage the technology used in a course. There
appeared to be less of an emphasis on the pedagogy of teaching with technology.
Along those lines, the issue of actually teaching writing as the disciplinary subject
appeared to be treated somewhat inconsistently at representative institutions.
Some of the respondents expressed a lack of ability to speak to a theory and
pedagogy of OWI. Their responses suggested that discerning effective practices
in areas other than the superstructure and infrastructure of OWI courses might
be the biggest challenge this CCCC OWI Committee would face. These themes
and considerations set the stage for another necessary action research project.

Seeking Guidance from Expert Practitioners and Stakeholders

    A final stage of the action research involved developing a panel of as many
OWI expert practitioners and stakeholders as possible. The CCCC OWI Com-
mittee needed their guidance to cull potential strong or effective practices from
The State of the Art of OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c) and other research.
We reasoned that by learning the successful practices of expert practitioners and

                                                                                                  25
Introduction

stakeholders, we could compare them with the needs revealed through previous
research and develop a Position Statement that best reflected our more thorough
understanding of OWI.

    The CCCC OWI Committee recruited members for this expert/stakehold-
ers panel using professional contacts and requests via listserv and private email.
After receiving nominations, we conducted email conversations with nominated
individuals to gather their academic resumes and gather statements of inter-
est. Then each applicant was individually interviewed by phone and follow-up
email; more than 30 total interviews occurred in August and September 2011.
Twenty-five people were selected, and two left the panel due to schedule con-
flicts. Panelists included educators and administrators from a variety of academ-
ic settings (i.e., traditional university, four-year, and two-year colleges, as well
as for-profit colleges and writing center settings). Skills, interests, and areas of
expertise included:

         1. first-year courses through graduate instruction;
         2. genres like first-year writing through business/tech writing;
         3. community college through the research university settings;
         4. public, private, and for-profit institutions;
         5. writing addressed both in courses and writing centers;
         6. fully online and hybrid OWC experience;
         7. accessibility issues regarding disabilities5 and EL2 learners; and
         8. expressed preferences for either asynchronous or synchronous mo-

              dalities.

    Using synchronous, Web-conferencing software, we met three times with
the expert and stakeholder panel during the 2011-2012 academic year. Each
meeting included a scripted series of questions intended to determine the effec-
tive practices and recommendations of these individuals. We continued these
conversations asynchronously through online discussion media throughout the
same time period.

    In the first meeting, participants discussed OWI pedagogy. They outlined
their most effective instructional strategies for the OWI classroom/environment.
This conversation revealed a number of pedagogies, many of which drew from
extensive knowledge of onsite composition instruction. Expert practitioners and
stakeholders expressed that they needed, for example, to provide ground rules
and clear interaction guidance for students, to address the importance of group
work and participation (in opposition to online courses that required individual
activities alone), to develop and achieve realistic expectations of the course, and
to explain procedures for teacher feedback allowing flexibility for student learn-
ing needs. An example comment was:

26
                                                                                          Hewett and DePew

         One of the things that I am realizing that is the most effective
         strategy for me is to make teaching more of an active verb for
         myself whether it is completely online or the online portion
         of the hybrid class. So that the discussion to this point [is] to
         try to get students involved in laying ground rules for example
         or talking about expectations. I just love that idea of having
         them buy into what is happening. To try to represent myself
         in the online environment as actively teaching the course,
         rather than what I think a lot of students feel like it is there
         waiting for them laid out front to back. As sort of static or
         one long document that happens to be broken up into a lot of
         different units or sections. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d)

    We learned more from a question asking how participants knew these were
the most effective instructional strategies for their particular students. One par-
ticipant indicated that retention numbers were the "proof of the pudding" and
that they would count increasingly in the near future. Another emphasized that
her active presence in the course led to comparable presence from students. One
teacher similarly explained that his own enthusiasm was the key to strong online
teaching and that he received from his students what he gave to them:

         In listening to everyone, one thing that comes across that
         is really needed in any online course is the enthusiasm of
         the instructor/faculty member. When that enthusiasm is
         not there, then no matter how much effort we put into the
         class, in terms of what we load the class with, no matter how
         much software, no matter how many pieces of material, the
         students are not going to be involved. What I get to see from
         my students in whether or not something is working for me
         is a combination of what I do in terms of a strategy and the
         enthusiasm I try to inject in it--I get this back from my stu-
         dents. My enthusiasm and my involvement in the course in
         trying to give them the materials above and beyond perhaps
         the course's mission is loaded with comes back to me with my
         students emails, more engaged, wanting to be more involved,
         wanting to ask more questions, which is exciting to me and
         exciting to the students as well. It shows up in the discus-
         sion; it shows up in the students wanting to learn more in
         why something is right or not right in writing. (CCCC OWI
         Committee, 2011d)

                                                                                                  27
Introduction

    The other primary focus of the first meeting regarded training. We asked
OWI experts and stakeholders about the training they received (if, indeed, they
received any) when they initially prepared for OWI, what elements they had to
teach themselves, what effective training methods for OWI are, and how they
would advise people developing a training program for beginning OWI teach-
ers. One teacher mentioned the quality of the UMUC online teaching training
program (outlined above) and another mentioned Sloan Consortium training.
Other responses ranged from the institution providing no training for online
instruction (which, admittedly seemed to be rare) to no training for OWI par-
ticularly (which seemed common) to creative training methods like online play
rooms. The "trial and error" method of training--or self-teaching--was fairly
frequently mentioned.

    The primary topics of the second teleconference were student and instructor
experiences of OWI. We asked expert practitioners and stakeholders about their
most effective instructional strategies for their particular students, the relative
benefits and disadvantages of OWI for students, and what types of students
benefit most and least from OWI contexts. Regarding instructors, we were con-
cerned with the conditions under which they teach most and least effectively in
OWI contexts, the benefits and disadvantages of OWI for instructors, and the
types of instructors that benefit most and least from OWI contexts.

    In the third meeting, we discussed such administrative issues as reasonable
and appropriate OWI course loads and class sizes, course preparation and week-
ly grading time, and instructor pay. We also asked for participants' thinking
about what CCCC as an organization could do to help them with OWI. Their
overwhelming response involved publishing a position statement and having
free resources like a website with examples of strong instructional strategies and
professional development through workshops and Webinars.

    When all the research was completed, we had a better understanding of what
a set of OWI effective practices might look like.6 The advice and insight of these
experts/stakeholders was instrumental in helping the CCCC OWI Committee
create A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013).

ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK

    Foundational Practices of Online Writing Instruction is an admittedly lengthy
book written to approach the OWI principles and practices comprehensively.
Because of this intention, we are pleased to be publishing in the Perspectives on
Writing series with the WAC Clearinghouse and Parlor Press. Their hybrid model
of providing texts either in free digital form or at-cost printed copy enables read-

28
                                                       Hewett and DePew

ers to access the book as a whole or piecemeal in digital or print forms as suited
to their unique needs. To assist readers who download or purchase the book as
a whole, we offer a commonly used abbreviations list, chart of OWI principles
addressed in each chapter, and an index for easy search. To assist readers who
prefer to download or use only those chapters of interest to them, we offer each
chapter as a self-contained discussion that provides its own abstract, keywords,
and references list. To assist readers who are interested in reading about partic-
ular ways to use the OWI principles, Table Intro.1 provides a cross-referenced
chart of chapters to OWI principles discussed in those chapters. Finally, despite
the number of authors involved in the project whose unique voices we strived to
honor, we have cross-referenced each chapter and sought to develop a consistent
OWI-focused voice.

    Divided into five sections, Foundational Practices of Online Writing Instruc-
tion is guided by the primary principles of OWI. It demonstrates above all the
CCCC OWI Committee's belief that inclusivity and accessibility must be con-

Introduction

sidered at the inception of any program's online writing instructional venture.
To that end, the book includes issues of inclusivity, access, and accessibility in
every chapter while addressing different OWI concerns through the lens of the
OWI principles.

    Part 1, "An OWI Primer," guides writing program administrators (WPAs)
and instructors through the OWI principles and the choices they have regarding
course infrastructure and environment. Every WPA and OWI teacher's first step
should be to determine the course outcomes when developing or revising an
OWI program or designing a course; such outcomes should be decided respec-
tive of the course's primary modality and delivery media. Hewett, in the first
chapter "Grounding Principles of OWI," explains the key principles that the
CCCC OWI Committee believes undergird OWI, why they are foundational,
and how they position OWI similar to and different from traditional composi-
tion. She emphasizes how accessibility issues are central to all principles for OWI
given the need for inclusivity in a sometimes faceless environment and given
the CCCC OWI Committee's view that an OWI program needs to address
inclusivity and access proactively. Hewett provides some examples of effective
practices or strategies for these principles. The next two chapters discuss OWI
infrastructure in terms of the hybrid versus fully online environments and the
asynchronous versus synchronous modalities. Jason Snart's Chapter 2, "Hybrid
and Fully Online OWI," examines the OWI principles and effective practice
strategies for hybrid and fully online OWI. Snart describes such issues as how
these environments differ for teachers and for students--especially regarding
seat time, the kinds of strategies that appear best to foster student learning (to
include sharing of writing), and what it means to work in a hybrid setting versus
that of a completely distributed one. Similarly, in Chapter 3, "Asynchronous and
Synchronous Modalities," Connie Mick and Geoffrey Middlebrook examine the
OWI principles and effective practice strategies in light of determining whether
synchronous or asynchronous modalities--or a combination--will work in a
particular course, class, level, and institution. Mick and Middlebrook consider
the strengths and weaknesses of these modalities from an effective practices per-
spective.

    Part 2, "OWI Pedagogy and Administrative Decisions," is developed to as-
sist readers with the design of OWI in both OWCs and OWLs. In Chapter 4
"Teaching the OWI Course," Scott Warnock explores some of the foundational
principles that ground instructional presence, conversational strategies, response
to student writing, class management and organization, course assessment, and
classroom technologies. Because of rapidly changing technologies, Warnock
particularly considers understanding new technologies from their foundations
before introducing them to the OWC. In Chapter 5, Diane Martinez and Leslie

Olsen's "Online Writing Labs" provides similar guidance about OWLs, empha-
sizing that online writing support is an integral component of the OWI infra-
structure that should be informed by similar principles and effective practices.
Martinez and Olsen examine how OWL practices and fundamentals are similar
to and different from traditional, face-to-face ones. Other logistical decisions
that they address are how to select and train OWL tutors and what to consider
when thinking about modalities of synchronous and asynchronous settings. Part
2 concludes with two chapters about programmatic decisions that WPAs have
to make about OWI. In "Administrative Decisions for OWI," the sixth chapter,
Deborah Minter surveys the OWI principles and effective practice strategies for
determining optimal class sizes, reading/writing literacy load on teachers and
students, and methods for increasing retention. Minter also addresses strategies
for assessing OWI programs and courses that adhere to the OWI principles
outlined in this book. Building upon this discussion in Chapter 7's "Contin-
gent Faculty and OWI," Mahli Mechenbier acknowledges that many OWCs are
taught by contingent and adjunct faculty who typically have little institutional
power. After establishing the institutional realities of such instructors, Mech-
enbier describes the issues that contingent faculty often face when asked to or
volunteer to teach OWCs; she provides recommendations about how WPAs
can protect these faculty and ensure that their students receive the best quality
of instruction. Likewise, she suggests how contingent faculty can protect and
advance themselves professionally in the OWI context.

    As with the traditional, onsite classroom, OWCs enroll many nonmain-
stream students, such as student populations with various learning and physical
disabilities, those from different socioeconomic backgrounds, and those who
have limited access to appropriate online connectivity. Additionally, there are
multilingual student populations who communicate in varieties of English out-
side of the academic standard but for whom OWI presents the most realistic
venue for continuing education. Part 3, "Practicing Inclusivity in OWI," in-
cludes three chapters supporting the argument that if an educational institution
is going to admit these students, then it must develop strategies for incorporat-
ing them in all aspects of the academic experience, including appropriate access
to OWI. Sushil Oswal, in Chapter 8's "Physical and Learning Disabilities in
OWI," examines the unique concerns that students with physical disabilities
and learning challenges have when taking OWI courses; he offers suggestions
for addressing these challenges. Oswal positions OWI Principle 1 (p. 17) in
legal and ethical ramifications for such students. Susan Miller-Cochran raises
concerns about inclusion and access based on linguistic production in Chapter
9, "Multilingual Writers and OWI." Charting nearly unknown territory, Mill-
er-Cochran uses OWI Principle 1 to support practical suggestions for addressing

                                                                                                  31

these challenges. Likewise, Michael Gos' Chapter 10, "Nontraditional Student
Access to OWI," considers the challenges that nontraditional (e.g., adult, re-
motely rural, urban, military, and incarcerated) students may experience when
taking an OWC or trying to access an OWL. Gos provides practical suggestions
for addressing these challenges within the rationale of OWI Principle 1.

    While OWI inevitably will have its complications, institutions can design
methods to prepare and professionalize the faculty and orient the students that
anticipate problems and help stakeholders navigate them. In Part 4, "Faculty
and Student Preparation for OWI," the authors challenge the trope that instruc-
tors and students simply are migrating the writing course to online technologies;
on the contrary, OWI requires extensive and specialized preparation on both
participants' behalf. Faculty not only must learn how to teach using effective and
appropriate methods for OWI contexts, they also need to professionalize while
immersed in the practice of this instruction. In Chapter 11, "Faculty Preparation
for OWI," Lee-Ann Kastner Breuch examines how the training for an OWC dif-
fers from general distance learning training and why this difference is important
for writing instructors nationwide. To this end, Breuch outlines five primary
focal points for designing training that moves beyond merely familiarizing edu-
cators with technology. Rich Rice's Chapter 12, "Faculty Professionalization for
OWI," addresses professionalization as it is tied to labor and compensation. He
uses the metaphor of software design to consider course ownership, adaptable
course shells, and pay for course preparation time. To consider students as im-
portant stakeholders in the OWC, Lisa Meloncon and Heidi Harris' Chapter
13, "Preparing Students for OWI," examines how administrators and instructors
can assess students' readiness for hybrid and fully online settings. It also expli-
cates OWI principles and effective practices for adequately preparing students
for technology-based courses and for learning to write in such settings. To the
end of empowering students to succeed, Meloncon and Harris provide strategies
for student self-assessment and decision making in OWCs. In Chapter 14, "Pre-
paring for the Rhetoricity of OWI," Kevin Eric DePew argues that OWI Princi-
ple 2 (p. 11) opens up an opportunity for both faculty and student preparation;
he addresses OWI as a digital rhetoric with all of the political and ideological
dimensions of a rhetoric. This aspect of OWI preparation is not simply about
learning the nuts and bolts of the technology and composition pedagogies, but
it also is about how to read them rhetorically. DePew considers the rhetorical
features of which OWI instructors should be aware and how they reasonably can
impart this awareness to their students.

    Part 5, "New Directions in OWI," brings this book to a conclusion by exam-
ining more leading-edged OWI-focused composition instruction and technol-
ogies. In Chapter 15's "Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts,"

32
                                                                                          Hewett and DePew

Kristine Blair provides effective practices for instructors who want or need to
move beyond alphabetic, linguistic-based assignments into teaching multimodal
discourse forms. Blair provides examples of multimodal technologies and writ-
ing assignments and explains how they can be taught in OWI contexts. Exam-
ining another new trend in Chapter 16, Shelley Rodrigo's "OWI on the Go"
acknowledges that some students' access to online connectivity comes through
such mobile devices as cellphones or tablets. These technologies, which offer
both unique affordances and challenges for students and teachers, complicate
the OWI principles and enrich effective practices. Finally, because Foundational
Practices of Online Writing Instruction contributes to a much broader, ongoing
conversation, the book concludes with two chapters that guide both OWI and
writing studies in general toward new iterations. First, in Chapter 17's "OWI
Research Considerations," Christa Ehmann and Hewett consider the compli-
cations of and critical need to study distance education in the OWI context.
They explain how to engage in consistent and useful investigation of one's pro-
gram, factors to consider, and how to measure and assess one's program. Then, in
Chapter 18, "The Future of OWI," Hewett & Warnock express their belief that
the future already is here, suggesting that OWI is emblematic of increasingly
digital composition and, as such, has much to offer writing studies scholars and
educators who teach writing in any venue.

    The contexts of writing instruction inevitably will change with the evolution
of online writing and digital communication technologies as well as new ways of
imagining writing instruction. To this end, we hope that the guidance provided
in the final two chapters, the questions that the previous sixteen chapters raise,
and the desire to apply foundational practices for OWI in one's own context will
encourage readers to join this conversation by designing practices, contributing
to the data about OWI, and reshaping its theory.

NOTES

1. Multilingual is a term currently used by scholars in fields that study writers who
speak, read, and write in multiple languages and who may be continuing to learn
the mechanics and expectations of writing in English. Although we use the term
multilingual in common in this book, at times these writers are referred to as English
language learners to reflect language actually used by the CCCC OWI Committee
during a historical time.

2. Addressing students with disabilities was added to the charges after the first two
years of the OWI Committee's work together.

3. An online writing lab, or OWL, also is called an online writing center, or OWC,
in many institutions. In this book, we use OWL to designate a writing tutoring

                                                                                                  33

service and OWC to designate an online writing course.

4. This research was funded by the CCCC Executive Committee.

5. As evidence of the critical need to address access issues, only one respondent
indicated interest or expertise with this area.

6. It is important to acknowledge, however, that students were the OWI stake-
holders we researched the least thoroughly. We believe that the needs of the learner
are paramount, and that students need to be more actively included as a voice in
future investigation, as indicated in Chapter 17.

GROUNDING PRINCIPLES OF OWI

This chapter lists and explains the key principles that ground both hybrid
and fully online OWI. It discusses why they are foundational and how
they inform OWI similar to and different from traditional composition.
The chapter emphasizes how accessibility issues are central to all principles
for OWI given the need for inclusivity and access in a sometimes face-
less environment and given the Committee's view that an OWI program
should address them proactively.

    My 21-year old relative recently failed her fully online, first-year writing
(FYW) course. This young woman is bright and motivated as evidenced by
five years of employment with a prominent fast food company where she had
worked her way up to full-time assistant manager. Her accomplishment stems
from self-discipline, an ability to meet deadlines and schedules, and hard work.
Quite frankly, most people simply cannot last long in that work environment.
Although I confess that I have no idea how strong her writing is because she
wanted to do the course without my tutorial, she expressed her failure as a se-
mester where the teacher "didn't care" and "didn't communicate--it took two
weeks to get a response email any time I emailed!" She complained that the
teacher did not teach and she did not learn anything. She also expressed that
the information for where to go for the monitored final exam did not get posted
until too late to get a space at a testing center where she could schedule it to
match her work and other test schedules. So she gave up, did not call each test-
ing center, and did not take the exam.

    Did everything happen exactly this way? The teacher has her own story that
might indicate other or additional reasons for this failed OWI experience. None-
theless, my young relative makes points that many students have expressed; fur-

thermore, many students fail their OWCs through lack of persistence, a sense of
not learning, failure to post essays on time or in the right portal, dropping out
without properly withdrawing, or giving up at the last minute. The problem of
failed OWI students is the mirror image of the failures expressed by faculty and
administrators. OWI is not an easy way to learn to write, yet it is absolutely a
legitimate, do-able, and often a necessary option for taking a writing course or a
writing-intensive disciplinary course.

    As the Introduction indicates, the CCCC OWI Committee was tasked with
understanding OWI from a variety of angles. Our first charge was, "Identify and
examine best strategies for online writing instruction using various online media
and pedagogies primarily used for the teaching of writing in blended, hybrid,
and distance-based writing classrooms, specifically composition classrooms, but
including other college writing courses." In addition, we originally were charged
to consider online tutoring and students with multilingual student experiences
and, given what we learned from working with a disabled committee member,
we also considered those with physical and learning disabilities. These broad
charges led us to examine the published literature; observe practices at various
institutions; survey the composition community's perspectives; and tap the ex-
periences of expert practitioners, administrators, and stakeholders to come to
some notion of effective practices in OWI.

    One of the biggest surprises in this process was discovering just how little
information existed relative to OWI and practices that might possibly be called
"effective," let alone "best." In fact, although the CCCC OWI Committee's in-
tensive, six-year research projects suggest that OWI is, indeed, receiving atten-
tion, scholars appear to be working so much from their local settings that a glob-
al teaching and learning perspective is difficult to achieve. This local focus has
led to publication of some interesting practices that potentially are adaptable,
but these practices do not transfer broadly to two-year and four-year college
settings and with widely varied student populations. We needed to understand
OWI from a more universal perspective, allowing scholarship to provide in-
formed guidance from which educators can address their local concerns.

    Furthermore, most OWI research tends not to be replicable, aggregable, and
data-supported (RAD) (Haswell, 2005). As such, the literature provides great
ideas to try out in individual course settings and some thoughts about strategies
to avoid, but it fails to provide theory-based or theory-generating guidance that
can be applied more broadly to OWI and writing studies' needs. Thus, there
remains too much practitioner lore surrounding OWI (North, 1987), and the
writing studies field passes on much of that lore along in scholarship, confer-
ences, and online chats. Anecdotally speaking, when I meet with faculty from
different institutions, I see a lot of wheel reinvention because people do not

know how others have addressed similar concerns.
    Additionally, in some places, although thankfully fewer than in the past,

scholars still are arguing the relative value of using OWI over onsite teaching,
sometimes viewing it as a deficit model for teaching a skill so intimately commu-
nicative as writing. Perhaps my young relative now would agree since she claims
she will never again take an online course, but I do not believe the deficits are
in the model itself or even in the students. The deficits, if any, are in our under-
standing of how to teach students to write through primarily written materi-
al--particularly in asynchronous settings but also in synchronous ones. Boiled
down, that is the essential problem for which the CCCC OWI Committee was
formed and charged. Yet, the CCCC OWI Committee also was formed and
charged with understanding OWI from the faculty and administrative perspec-
tives. One cannot provide excellent instruction to students in the online (or any)
environment without also providing excellent support to those who teach and
administer the program.

    Once we completed research--knowing there was so much more to do--we
found our first major writing challenges when we tried to draft a position state-
ment of best practices. We quickly realized that (1) there can be no "best" in such
a rapidly changing field, and (2) none of the practices that we had learned from
our research would transfer to all the settings we were asked to address. For those
reasons, we agreed to use the term "effective" practices as the Sloan Consortium
did (Moore, 2011). Lacking sufficient theories of OWI particularly, we also re-
alized we needed to rely on common educational principles that could be artic-
ulated and adapted in view of OWI's particulars. Indeed, colleagues have told
us repeatedly that they needed foundational guidelines for potentially successful
OWI. After those decisions, writing became more natural and the research fell
into place. For each of the OWI principles, example effective practices emerged
from our research, and these seemed to be both general and specific enough
that they could be adapted to various settings and teacher/student populations.
Additionally, as much as possible, we refrained from naming, supporting, or
promoting any particular technology or software, which inevitably will change.
Although technology change is certain, there is relative stability in modality
(e.g., asynchronous and synchronous) and media (e.g., text, images, audio, and
audio/video) on which OWI teachers can count.

    Some respondents to A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effec-
tive Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) have remarked that the
principles and example effective practices are "nothing new" or "not surprising."
That is a good thing, we believe. It signals that OWI is, indeed, a familiar form
of writing instruction to which common disciplinary knowledge and familiar
educational philosophies about strong teaching, learning, and support strategies

                                                                                                  41

apply. If A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
was overly shocking in content, it would indicate that educators have been doing
things all wrong! On the contrary, the very familiarity of the OWI principles
and example effective practices demonstrates that most WPAs and teachers are
on the right track, which may reassure educators who experience OWI as a long,
lonely trek through uncharted territory.

    Some words about definition and language are important here.
    First, merely using a word processing program to write does not constitute
being online or working through computer mediation. OWI occurs by using
computer technology to learn writing from a teacher, tutor, or other students
and by using it to communicate about that writing, to share writing for learning
purposes, and to present writing for course completion purposes. Being online
can mean working at a geographic distance or even in an onsite computer lab
using technology that enables the learning about and sharing of writing; in es-
sence, the computer technology facilitates the communication about writing,
often through an LMS. With this definition in mind, A Position Statement of
Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee,
2013) and this book refer to OWI as including both the hybrid and the fully
online settings unless otherwise stated. We consider the hybrid course setting,
often called blended or mixed mode, to include any OWI that is not fully on-
line. An OWC is hybrid if any of the course interactions occur in comput-
er-meditated settings, whether distance-based or in Internet/intranet-enabled,
traditional onsite classrooms or computer labs. Fully online courses occur en-
tirely "online and at-a-distance through the Internet or intranet" and students
respond from geographically distributed sites whether they meet from "short
(i.e., campus-based) or long (i.e., across state/international borders) distance"
(Hewett, 2013, p. 196). If face-to-face interactions among teachers and students
are scheduled (and "scheduled" is a key part of the definition being advanced
here) parts of the course, however, and the course includes computer-mediated
interaction, then the OWC is hybrid.1 Pedagogically, both hybrid and fully on-
line OWCs make use of similar teaching and learning strategies; yet the hybrid
OWC, as discussed in Chapter 2, has significantly different administrative con-
ditions relative to seat- and face-time; in meeting those conditions, the timing
and deployment of selected OWI-based pedagogies will differ in various ways.
These considerations are important to remember when reading and using this
book because the CCCC OWI Committee was tasked with addressing both hy-
brid and fully online settings, and we quickly realized that although each course
setting has basic similarities, they differ vastly in how individual institutions will
define, imagine, and organize the OWC.
    Second, because we envisioned the principles as foundational to potentially

42

effective OWI, we decided that using the word should "indicates that among
several possibilities one is recommended as particularly suitable, without men-
tioning or excluding others; or that a certain course of action is preferred but
not necessarily required (should equals is recommended that)" (IEEE, 2012, p. 9).
This use of should can be contrasted with our decision not to employ the words
shall ("equals is required to") or must (used "to describe unavoidable situations")
(IEEE, 2012, p. 9). While we have received understandable criticism that A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013) reads as a prescriptive set of rules, our goal was to de-
velop more descriptive guidelines for all involved in OWI. We had to balance
the desire to present these guidelines such that stakeholders could adapt them
to their settings with the need to provide the kinds of language that educators
and administrators have requested--language that would enable them to ar-
gue at their institutions for fairness, equity, and educationally sound conditions
and teaching and learning expectations. In essence, the principles are an ideal,
but certainly an attainable ideal that writing programs should work toward. We
hope that readers of this book will appreciate the semantic challenges that these
crossing purposes revealed, and that you will use these principles and effective
practices as guidelines to support OWI in your particular settings.

    This chapter tells the story of how the 15 OWI principles were determined
by the CCCC OWI Committee, leading to effective practices that provide ex-
amples of the principles. It is a microhistory born of the exigency outlined above
and of the research detailed in this book's Introduction. It is, as well, a story that
admits of uncertainty and a need for A Position Statement of Principles and Exam-
ple Effective Practices for OWI to be organic; changing with research, scholarship,
and experience; and one to which the practitioners in the field can contribute
as well as from which they can benefit.2 Finally, the discussions in this chap-
ter--and the book as a whole--should not be read as presenting universal rules
but as grounded guidance about sound OWI instructional practices regardless
of the particular technologies. In the following sections, each OWI principle is
reproduced with its rationale from A Position Statement of Principles and Exam-
ple Effective Practices for OWI; additional explanatory discussion completes the
chapter.

OWI PRINCIPLE 1

    As articulated in A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Prac-
tices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013), OWI Principle 1 is overarching,
and the CCCC OWI Committee believes that those who use these principles
should consider inclusivity and access at every step of planning and implement-

                                                                                                  43

ing OWI.

         OWI Principle 1: Online writing instruction should be uni-
         versally inclusive and accessible.

Rationale for OWI Principle 1

    The primary ideas driving the OWI principles outlined in this document are
inclusivity and accessibility. Hence, OWI Principle 1 supersedes and connects
to every principle in this document. In particular, the CCCC OWI Committee
believes that the needs of learners with physical disabilities, learning disabilities,
multilingual backgrounds, and learning challenges related to socioeconomic is-
sues (i.e., often called the digital divide where access is the primary issue) must
be addressed in an OWI environment to the maximum degree possible for the
given institutional setting. Furthermore, given that OWI typically is a text-in-
tensive medium where reading is a necessary skill, addressing the accessibility
needs of the least confident readers increases the potential to reach all types of
learners.

    The CCCC published in 2006 and reaffirmed in 2011 its statement regard-
ing disability issues for educators, staff, and students. This statement recognizes
that fully inclusive environments are necessary for the equitable and appropriate
teaching of writing at the postsecondary level. The CCCC statement regarding
disability issues strongly indicates that a proactive approach to physical and ped-
agogical access is superior to one that includes "added on" or retrofitted alterna-
tives. It further states that:

         Making writing classrooms and curricula inclusive and
         accessible to those with disabilities means employing flexible
         and diverse approaches to the teaching of reading and writing
         to ensure pedagogical as well as physical access; using multi-
         ple teaching and learning formats; welcoming students with
         disabilities in course syllabi; and including disability issues
         or perspectives in course content and faculty development
         workshops.

    Additionally, this statement specifically addresses electronic environments:
"CCCC is committed to accessible online environments, including making the
CCCC website accessible, as well as working to teach others about ways to make
their program and course websites fully inclusive."

    Such inclusivity must be a fundamental part of any initiative that includes
OWI, given its inherent connection to technology; patterns of exclusion have
too often resulted from an uncritical adoption of digital technology and an in-

44
                                                                                                        Hewett

difference to how it could be used by persons with various disabilities and learn-
ing challenges. The CCCC OWI Committee therefore posits that no statement
of OWI principles and practices can be appropriate if it does not fully recognize
and accommodate educators and students with varying physical, learning, lin-
guistic, and socioeconomic challenges.

    We specifically include multilingual learners who may have a different work-
ing knowledge of academic English and/or different cultural backgrounds.3 The
CCCC Statement on Second Language Writing and Writers (2009) advocates that
all writing teachers should be prepared to address pedagogically the linguistic
and cultural diversity of the multilingual students in their classes.

    Thus, both the CCCC Committee for Second Language Writing and Writers
(2009) and the CCCC Committee on Disability Issues in College Composition
(2011) agree that such teachers' and writers' needs must be addressed at all levels
of writing courses to include such concerns as content, teacher training, and
administrative actions. To this end, the CCCC OWI Committee holds that--to
the degree possible--all of its OWI principles and effective practices should ad-
here to the need for inclusivity and accessibility at all levels of pedagogy, student
satisfaction, faculty satisfaction, and administrative concerns, including selec-
tion of the technological modality and software for OWI.

    Some of the guidelines presented below are adapted from Burgstahler and
Cory's (2008) principles of universal design while others are developed primarily
for this document:

    · Equitable use: The course and its digital designs should be usable by all
        students and teachers to include those with physical, visual, hearing,
        learning, attention, and communication differences (inclusive of multi-
        lingual students whose first language may or may not be English).

    · Technological equality: The technology should be financially accessible to
        all students and teachers in the course.

    · Flexibility in use: The course and its digital design should accommodate a
        wide range of individual preferences and abilities.

    · Simple and intuitive use: Use of the course materials and the digital design
        should be comprehensible regardless of the user's experience, knowledge,
        language skills, or current concentration level.

    · Perceptible information: The course materials and the digital design should
        communicate necessary information effectively to the user, regardless of
        ambient conditions or the user's sensory abilities.

    · Tolerance for technological error: The course materials and the digital de-
        sign in particular should minimize the potential for failure based on acci-
        dental or unintended actions such as a technological crash. They should,
        for example, provide automatic protection of data entered and simple

                                                                                                  45
Grounding Principles of OWI

        means for recovering such data.
    · Tolerance for mechanical error in writing: Teacher response and assessment

        of writing should reflect an awareness of the relatively low value to be
        placed on mechanical and usage errors in student writing particularly for
        multilingual and physically and learning-challenged writers. Although
        grammar, mechanics, and usage need to be taught, evaluation should
        focus primarily on how well ideas are communicated and secondarily on
        sentence-level errors.
    · Low physical effect: The OWC's digital design should be usable efficiently,
        comfortably, and with a minimum of fatigue.
    · Size and space for approach and use: The physical design of the comput-
        er- or other classroom should be of the appropriate size and space for
        approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of the user's body size,
        posture, or mobility.

    We must note that adhering to the principles of universal design "reduces,
but does not eliminate, the need for accommodations for students with dis-
abilities" (Burgstahler & Cory, 2008, pp. 24-25). Therefore, there will be times
when--regardless of how well prepared an OWI program is for faculty and stu-
dents with different needs--some accommodations may need to be made (Burg-
stahler & Cory, 2008).

Discussion

    The CCCC OWI Committee decided that access and inclusivity should
comprise the overarching principle for all of OWI in part because educators
never really have thought that way. While this decision was critiqued by one
CCCC EC reviewer as "political," making a political statement was not our
goal--although we can see how it has political ramifications. Our goal was to
make a moral and ethical statement with respect to a significant legal issue upon
which thoughtful educators could ground OWI. This decision was prompted by
several considerations.

    One consideration emerged from responses to questions about access in our
hybrid and fully online surveys. What we discovered shocked us. Closed-ended
responses regarding access, disabilities, and the ADA in the fully online survey
were especially disheartening because in hybrid courses, presumably, teachers
and students may have shared more information about disabilities:

         In FO-Q51,4 50% of respondents indicated that they had
         taught students with either disclosed or obvious disabilities in
         their fully online courses, while 23% said they had not taught

46
                                                                                                        Hewett

         such students and 28% did not know. The number of nega-
         tive responses to earlier FO-Q 49, 50 and 51 also raises some
         red flags about the lack of preparation for delivering accessible
         online writing instruction. Out of overall 158 respondents,
         eight did not respond to FO-Q49, seven did not provide an
         ADA-compliant course, and 39 did not know whether or not
         their courses were ADA compliant. Likewise, responses to
         FO-Q50 about the availability of ADA training at their insti-
         tution indicates that out of 152 respondents, 43 did not even
         know whether or not their institution provided this training.
         In another 24 cases, the institution lacked arrangements
         for educating its instructors in ADA and disability issues.
         In FO-Q51, the ratio of instructors who did teach disabled
         students--85 as compared the 41 who did not know whether
         they did or did not--is worrisome. (CCCC OWI Commit-
         tee, 2011c, p. 30)

    In open-ended questions about what they wanted to know about access and
OWI, respondents on the whole demonstrated a poor understanding of the
ADA and of their responsibilities to students, as well as challenges in working
with their administration and offices of disabilities. Some respondents, like the
three cited below (see CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a, and 2011b), were oddly
lackadaisical and expressed willingness to bar students needing accommodations
from their OWCs:

    · "How different disabilities react to online environments--are certain
        disabilities necessarily prohibitive to being successful online, or can any
        environment be adapted?"

    · "What's a reasonable accommodation in the online environment and
        when should you just refuse and declare that the student must take the
        class in the face-to-face setting? (I have a dyslexic student this term and
        have been required to post audio files of every single text file or website
        that is required reading in the course, as well as audio versions of the
        textbooks and essays.)"

    · "If they have a disability it is good to know, but, really, legally I don't
        think we are to make accommodations."

    I cite these statements here because I think many--many--educators have
thought these very thoughts, especially in regard to OWI but also regarding
composition education generally. The frustration expressed by the second-cited
respondent may resonate with faculty who have not had successful dealings with
the institution's office of disability where students and teachers both can receive

                                                                                                  47
Grounding Principles of OWI

assistance and from whom online instructors especially should receive training.
Without appropriate professional development around access and the ADA's le-
gal rulings, it can feel impossibly overwhelming to have to account for inclusion
and access when a student self-discloses a need or otherwise self-advocates. In-
deed, I have seen educational institutions take a legalistic stance and deny those
needs if the student has not been tested formally for a learning challenge. For
example, testing for dyslexia or auditory processing disabilities after public high
school graduation tends to be the student's responsibility, and it can be prohib-
itively expensive and possibly shaming in a culture where learning abilities still
are measures of self-worth. Similarly, multilingual writers may not want to ad-
mit they have problems learning something--whether culturally or otherwise--
given already considerable linguistic challenges, and those who have limiting
socioeconomic backgrounds also may not want to admit additional difficulties.

    To be sure, from a common retroactive perspective, once a course has been
developed, it is disconcerting and strategically challenging to adjust it for stu-
dents who self-disclose a need for special access or inclusive materials. In such
cases, one must re-plan to address the problem and find ways to help the stu-
dent, which may require additional and creative work to make online material
accessible and more time on the teacher's part. Such situations are highlighted
by such legal cases as the recent lawsuit against Harvard and MIT, where these
institutions have provided online material freely to the public but have failed to
make it accessible through closed captioning to the deaf, for example (Lewin,
2015). Scratching the surface likely would reveal other ADA problems in these
courses that have been otherwise generously offered. This difficulty is one rea-
son the CCCC OWI Committee strongly recommends taking the access and
inclusivity "problem" and turning it into a proactive mindset that welcomes all
enrolled students from the inception of the class to its ending. I like to call this
a spirit of generosity toward all of our students. Traditionally, inclusion and access
have been handled with retrofit, but if they become part and parcel of our think-
ing about teaching online, we will be able to accommodate more students with
more varied challenges than we might imagine--without them even having to
self-disclose their issues. Although hopefully students will recognize an inclusive
environment and will be willing to share their abilities and disabilities to the goal
of achieving success in their OWCs, educational research reveals that students'
particular learning needs, while not necessarily disabilities, may be difficult for
them to name let alone disclose (Hewett, 2015a).

    Another consideration that prompted us to rethink issues around access and
inclusivity regarded a series of the CCCC OWI Committee's communication
failures with one committee member who is a professor of some note in his
work with technical communication and digital accessibility. He also happens

48
                                                                                                        Hewett

to be blind. Perhaps because he once was sighted, he understands and eloquently
conveys the difficulties of a blind or otherwise physically challenged person. A
professor with a disability like blindness has daily challenges that sighted people
cannot imagine. The time it takes me to draft and revise an article, for example,
is exacerbated in a blind person's life because he has to read everything that has
been produced with only able-bodied readers in mind. On the one hand, online
instruction in principle is a boon for blind faculty and students because it solves
the eternal problem of arranging transportation to get from one point to another
in an automobile-oriented culture. On the other hand, screen readers used by
blind computer users can only process information that is designed following
international standards for Web accessibility. When instructional designers and
faculty ignore these standards or are ignorant of them, the average eight hours
of a typical work day can be expanded to many more for people with serious
disabilities like blindness, and we should remember that disabled individuals
like my committee colleague still have the rest of their family lives to live in the
given 24-hour day.

    In purposeful ways, our blind colleague prodded the CCCC OWI Commit-
tee to become more aware of access issues, and that was useful. Just as important,
however, the CCCC OWI Committee members have embarrassed ourselves re-
peatedly over the years as we have communicated via email with attached docu-
ments and through Wikis, file sharing software, and Internet-based synchronous
meetings. More times than I can count, we unintentionally dis-included this
colleague from the conversation by perfectly natural (read learned) actions like
sending email in colors unreadable by his screen reader, using marginal com-
ments in Microsoft Word that his screen reader could not access, choosing inac-
cessible Wiki or file-sharing software tools without consulting him, and setting
up synchronous meetings without sending him meeting information sufficiently
early to check out the accessibility of the connections to the screen reader. We
are not mean people, but we are all a part of a thoughtless academic culture that
considers access for the disabled as a retrofit, an afterthought, a proviso that
should take place when the disabled faculty or student is knocking at our door.
Our mutual embarrassment provided ample teachable moments and opportuni-
ties to challenge our natural-sounding, able-bodied thinking and to change our
behaviors. If online technology access was such an issue in a CCCC committee
where we were charged to consider access for OWI, surely it is a greater issue in
the classroom.

    In 2012, the CCCC OWI Committee gave a workshop at the CCCC con-
vention. While it was not as successful as we would have liked, the 30 attendees
who stayed for the entire workshop sent our committee an encouraging message
by rating the final access-related component of the workshop as the best part of

                                                                                                  49
Grounding Principles of OWI

the experience. Interestingly, we had done what everyone else does about acces-
sibility--we had placed it last on the agenda, and we had done that every single
year in our conference panel presentations, too. It suddenly dawned on me after
this workshop that access is not just something that OWI needs to address; it is
the key concern with which we should be engaged at every step. As a result, the
CCCC OWI Committee drastically changed our thinking about inclusivity and
access. In 2013, by giving our drafted OWI principles a green light, the CCCC
EC, the top leaders of our profession, also recognized that it is time to place
inclusivity and accessibility in the interface of our online pedagogy and not let it
trail as an add-on or save-it-for-later application like a Band-Aid.

    Additionally, we must acknowledge other populations needing inclusion and
access. The CCCC OWI Committee has had specialists in multilingual learning
and those who know socioeconomically challenged populations well. Multilin-
gual students, for example, often are placed into separate classes for both onsite
and online writing. Those who have taught such students realize that they may
have writing markers signaling their first language, dialect, or spoken language
other than English. Some students are not selected for such homogenous online
courses because they enter OWCs under the radar or because only heteroge-
neous courses are offered. Additionally, some institutions do not separate multi-
lingual and typical native English speakers in their writing courses. Given varied
student language abilities, faculty need to be able to accommodate some of the
primary writing differences multilingual students may exhibit--particularly in
a setting where reading and writing are the primary teaching and interpersonal
communicative means. In keeping with their institutions' administrative deci-
sions about working with students who have language-learning concerns, all
OWI teachers should be prepared to help multilingual students with their writ-
ing using potentially effective online technology and strategies.

    Similarly, students from various socioeconomic backgrounds elect online
courses in part because of family requirements, outside jobs, and the illusion
that OWI will more easily address those concerns. Many of these students will
not be familiar with online learning strategies--some may not even own the
required technology (Hewett, 2015a) and others may use cellular phones as the
sole technology for their OWI courses (see Chapter 16). Regardless of one's
opinion about such technology uses for educational purposes, we must prepare
for these students' specific needs. When an OWC is developed with inclusivity
and access at the front instead of the backend, teachers are better prepared to
help the socioeconomically challenged writing student to succeed.

    The CCCC OWI Committee includes faculty and administrators with stu-
dents as stakeholders in the legal need and ethical imperative for inclusivity and
access. Faculty should consider how OWI Principle 1 can be used to improve

50
                                                                                                        Hewett

the learning needs of a wide variety of students as opposed to, for example, one
self-disclosing vision-impaired student. However, administrators have an equal
responsibility to set faculty up for success. Unquestionably, just as students have
different learning styles, teachers have different learning and teaching styles for
OWI that should be accommodated in an ethical workplace.

    Finally, I want to acknowledge a growing cohort of writing scholar teachers
who are involved in a new field of Rhetoric and Disability. They have advocated
for, worked in, and led efforts at integrating accessibility in writing studies peda-
gogy and scholarship. Many of these colleagues either themselves have a disabil-
ity or are related to someone with a disability. Despite their path-breaking work,
however, accessibility is practiced and felt only in isolated pockets of writing
studies. We could say that we have some individuals who practice accessibility,
and then we have some other individuals and groups who support the cause of
accessibility, but as a discipline we still see it as an exception, an add-on, or a
problem to solve. In this book, the authors employ OWI Principle 1 to endorse
and explore a more wide-ranging and complex understanding of inclusion, ac-
cess, and accessibility that aims to change the status quo for students and teach-
ers with disabilities, linguistic diversity, and place-boundedness in our writing
programs, particularly in our online instruction, which always has been sold as
a panacea for these groups.

    Access is about being inclusive at all levels of the educational pyramid, and
although providing access is not necessarily cost-effective, the onus is on higher
educational institutions to serve out their missions of helping their entire stu-
dent bodies to learn and their faculty to teach. This effort and its costs should be
seen as an investment--and an ethical and moral imperative--not as a burden.
A spirit of generosity goes a long way.

OWI PRINCIPLE 2

    The second OWI principle is the first of five principles outlined regarding
pedagogical practices. It addresses the primacy of writing instruction over tech-
nology.

         OWI Principle 2: An online writing course should focus
         on writing and not on technology orientation or teaching
         students how to use learning and other technologies.

Rationale for OWI Principle 2

    Unlike a digital rhetoric course an OWC is not considered to be a place
for stretching technological skills as much as for becoming stronger writers in

                                                                                                  51
Grounding Principles of OWI

various selected genres. To this end, it is important to recall the access and in-
clusivity issues found in OWI Principle 1. Students should use the provided
technology to support their writing and not the other way around. It must be
clear that OWI teachers and students alike do not need to be technology experts,
computer programmers, or Web designers to accomplish the instructional pur-
poses of an OWC.

Discussion

    The CCCC OWI Committee acknowledges that, as with OWI Principle 1,
OWI Principle 2 has controversial implications (see Chapter 14, for example).
Scholarship in computers and writing (e.g., Journet, Ball, & Trauman, 2012;
Prior et al., 2007; Selber, 2004; Selfe, 2009, 1999) frame the writing done with
digital technologies as rhetorical acts; the CCCC OWI Committee endorses this
framing. However, the responses from the CCCC OWI Committee research
revealed that there is both an absence of experts in digital writing at many in-
stitutions and of administrators and instructors familiar with this scholarship
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d, 2012a, & 2012b). Moreover, administrators
and instructors at some of these institutions support efficient, correction-based
writing instruction and see the digital technology merely as a tool for achieving
these ends. These issues must be considered in light of the fact that many OWI
instructors are underprepared instructors and under-supported contingent fac-
ulty (see Chapter 7), who are much more versed in writing instruction than
they are in teaching with technology or theorizing the technology's role in their
own teaching. While these conditions do not comply with the ideals of writing
studies' scholarship, they are the reality at many institutions, and A Position
Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2013) has been articulated in its current form to acknowledge the
contemporary realities while pushing institutions toward the ideal practices.

    Unquestionably, contemporary students live in a digital age where the world
seems to shrink with the speed of connectivity and constant communication.
College graduates should leave their education with a broad understanding of
various technologies, their functional effects, and rhetorical implications, as well
as with experience in using technologies in settings that may assist them in work-
place and home environments (Selber, 2004). However, such goals are not the
primary function of OWCs and of most writing-intensive disciplinary courses.

    This statement might seem to be obvious, but teachers and other stakehold-
ers shared with the CCCC OWI Committee their concerns about their per-
ceived need to constantly learn newer and different technologies and software in
order to keep up with student uses of those technologies outside the classroom.

52
                                                                                                        Hewett

We realized that the pull of increasingly new technologies could create the im-
pression that newer is better or that what students use in their daily lives must
be used in their educational lives. Certainly, cogent arguments have been made
for that kind of thinking (Alexander, 2006; Jukes, McCain & Crockett, 2010;
Selfe & Hawisher, 2007; Small & Vorgon, 2008).

    Nonetheless, a writing course should be primarily about writing--whether
that writing is an alphabetic essay or a multimodal composition. When essay
writing instruction is supported through technology, then only the selected
technology is necessary for the course and students need to become function-
ally and rhetorically literate in it alone. When the writing instruction teaches a
multimodal composition, again only the selected technology is necessary for the
course and students need to become functionally and rhetorically literate in it
alone. Practically speaking, if they are to use particular word processing software,
students might be required to learn certain features of that software such as
setting margins, using spell checkers, creating automatic tables of contents, and
the like. In some classes, instructors may introduce students to different types
of writing technologies (e.g., blogs, Wikis, slideware, and audiocasting) and give
them the opportunity and choice--keeping issues of access in mind--to fulfill
the assignment using the most appropriate writing technology for its purpose.
But even in these cases, the assignment should focus on writing--composing, if
you will--and not on proficiency with the technology. In the LMS, students might
be required to learn how and where to post completed essays; how to reach their
instructors privately or publicly; how to meet peer groups, if used, and so on.

    Furthermore, teachers and students should not need to be particularly tech-
nologically astute to interact through the selected technologies for an OWC.
For example, teachers should be trained and enabled to use the institution's
LMS to build out the writing course components, but they should not need to
learn how to create a separate Web page to teach the writing course.5 Despite the
deficiencies of any one LMS (and every LMS has them, albeit some worse than
others), teachers should be enabled to use it and only it for fulfilling their course
outcomes and optimal pedagogical strategies. Similarly, students may be asked
to use a Wiki in the LMS if that is a component of the writing course, but they
should not have to learn how to design and create unique Wiki pages. The focus
should be on the writing in the Wiki and not the HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) or even "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) construction of it
unless the instructor or writing program can pedagogically justify learning these
type of skills in light of the rhetorical focus of the writing course (e.g., technical
writing course, FYW for engineers and computer science majors).

    Interestingly, two members of our expert/stakeholder panel clarified this idea
for the CCCC OWI Committee when they recommended the opposite ap-

                                                                                                  53
Grounding Principles of OWI

proach--going outside the LMS for additional technology that would (1) con-
nect students to the "real" world and (2) vary the technologies to keep student
interest levels high. While these goals are laudable, their focus on the technology
over the writing itself seem more likely to risk the necessary emphasis on student
writing rather than to enhance it. Especially when keeping inclusivity and acces-
sibility in mind, the writing needs to drive the technology choices and not the
other way around (Hewett, 2013).

    In this way, the CCCC OWI Committee believed that OWI Principle 2
also addressed inclusion and access. Institutions typically provide an LMS of
some sort that the institutional information technology (IT) department ideally
will have chosen for a high degree of access. In a leveling of the playing field,
all online writing students--and many onsite students--will need to navigate
that LMS in some way; it is part of their common educational experience de-
termined by institutional choice. Students with particular disabilities, such as
sight or sound, should be enabled to use that LMS as part of the institution's
responsibility to meet the ADA's legal requirements. However, when outside
game, role play, or social networking software is added to the writing course,
the playing field no longer is level. Even when access to these technologies is
free of financial cost, there may be high costs in terms of students' time and ef-
forts. Downloading software for entertainment is different from being required
to do so for educational purposes. Writing instruction easily can become lost--
for uncounted precious hours--to the potential confusions surrounding using
such outside software in educational settings. If an instructor or WPA is going
to adopt any of these programs--which we do not recommend--the resulting
writing course should be taught by someone who can effectively and efficiently
teach the software to potential new users of all learning styles and abilities in
that course. More importantly, such instructors need to be able to pedagogically
theorize and explain why these students would benefit from this pedagogical
approach to writing and how to induce required learning outcomes for student
writers using the respective technology. Courses that employ these programs
should never be taught by casual users or instructors who merely know how to
functionally use the program without being taught why they are using it and
how to effectively use it to teach writing.

    To these ends, the CCCC OWI Committee believes that technologies out-
side the LMS should be reserved for courses that specialize in them--such as
digital writing or technology-focused, multimodal courses--and should not be
required of teachers or students of such primary OWI courses as FYW, advanced
composition, or writing-intensive disciplinary courses. Even then, we believe
that inclusion and access should drive the technological choices. To be sure, this
issue is complex, as Chapter 14 aptly discusses. There is a fine line to be walked

54
                                                                                                        Hewett

when a course addresses the highly metacognitive issues involved in composing
with technology. When students are asked to rhetorically assess the technologies
with which they are asked to write and to deliver their compositions--both al-
phabetic and image-based texts--they also may need to learn and use different
technologies. In such cases, the CCCC OWI Committee recommends thought-
ful, balanced application of both OWI Principles 1 and 2 when developing the
course and selecting digital technologies.

OWI PRINCIPLE 3

    The CCCC OWI Committee's research suggested that traditional writing
instruction requires some changes of habits, thought, and even of theory to
accommodate an online environment.

         OWI Principle 3: Appropriate composition teaching/learn-
         ing strategies should be developed for the unique features of
         the online instructional environment.

Rationale for OWI Principle 3

    Some changes in traditional composition pedagogy are necessary for teach-
ing writing in the OWI setting, an environment that is by nature text-centric
and reading-heavy and that requires intensive written communication. Educa-
tors who develop and teach OWCs should use pedagogical theories and strat-
egies that account for the distinctive nature and opportunities provided by the
online setting. New pedagogies should be explored and implemented to leverage
the inherent benefits of the electronic environment in relation to composition
instruction (e.g., discussion boards and blogs that allow students to exchange
thoughtful claims and support in writing or private messaging that allows stu-
dents to communicate with one's teacher through writing).

    OWI-specific pedagogies can address the diverse learning needs of students,
who can benefit from the different ways writing can be taught online. Such
approaches foster a culture of learning and knowledge creation--rooted in the
multimodal online environment--that opens up new opportunities for student
thought and expression and prepares students for the 21st-century skills and
modalities that will help them thrive as citizens and workers.

Discussion

    As its first emergent theme in the Executive Summary of The State of the Art
of OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c), the CCCC OWI Committee found,

                                                                                                  55
Grounding Principles of OWI

"Teachers and administrators, to include those in writing centers, typically are
simply migrating traditional face-to-face writing pedagogies to the online set-
ting--both fully online and hybrid. Theory and practice specific to OWI has yet
to be fully developed and engaged in postsecondary online settings across the
United States" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 7). In later research with
the expert/stakeholder panel, panelists told us about such instructional strategies
for OWI that included building clear online communication expectations, scaf-
folding assignments in specific ways, and providing repetition and redundancy
of information. What neither the survey respondents nor the panelists addressed
in any depth were theoretical explanations and unique strategies that consider
OWI's particular characteristics. We believe that reality stems from rather sparse
OWI theory-making.

    Some migration of contemporary theories and practices from onsite to on-
line settings is necessary and appropriate as the discussion in OWI Principle 4
below should make clear. Writing instruction maintains certain goals in both
settings. Good composition instruction is necessary for OWI, and the online
setting is not alien to education. Indeed, one might consider OWI Principle 3
to be the yin to the yang of OWI Principle 4 in that most OWCs reflect tradi-
tional onsite writing pedagogy, but the medium in which instruction is set also
changes the approach to writing instruction. More importantly, because the me-
dium also may affect both student writing and student learning about writing,
it makes sense to search for new composing theories for a digital instructional
environment.

    In previous publications, I have called for theories of OWI, stating that there
is something different about OWI from onsite writing instruction that incorpo-
rates yet goes beyond the technology (Hewett, 2001, 2004-2005, 2006, 2010,
2013, 2015a, 2015b; Hewett & Ehmann, 2004). This request for theorizing
OWI is not so much about providing new teaching strategies; strategizing is
a natural part of educational expertise where we would link our pedagogies to
available technologies that enable the instruction (Warnock, 2009, p. xiv). In-
stead, it is about providing fundamental explanations for the unique qualities
and challenges of OWI, which then will lead naturally to new strategies. Two
theories for OWI have emerged in my own research: (1) a need for semantic
integrity6 in the teacher's writing to the student (Hewett, 2010, 2015b) and (2)
the complex needs for different of literacy strategies for students and teachers in
text-rich settings (Hewett, 2015a).

    In this light, research (see Chapter 17) helps educators to articulate what
happens in the OWI setting. Theorizing helps to synthesize and explain what
happens and it grounds appropriate instructional strategies as well as helps ed-
ucators to discern the relative benefits of existing strategies that can be adapted

56
                                                                                                        Hewett

to OWI settings. Current research offers tiny pieces of a much larger puzzle. Al-
though general online instructional theory, which is relatively robust, can help,
it is important to learn more about OWI specifically. The fact that writing is
both the subject under study and the textual venue for reading about and learn-
ing to write makes OWI significantly challenging. Questions that OWI theory
should address include:

    · If in any way at all, how does affect change among students and teachers
        when moving from onsite to online settings and the concomitant loss of
        real-time, non-mediated body/face/voice?

    · If such change exists, how does it influence writing growth, development,
        and improvement if in any way at all?

    · Given the media of text, audio, and audio/video, what are the effects of
        such mediation on writing instruction and learning if in any way at all?

    · If in any way at all, how does the loss of body/face/voice affect:

          Student cognition of what is being taught about writing?
          Student reading of related fiction or nonfiction for the course, of in-

             structional content, of response to writing, or of interpersonal com-
             munications?
          Student writing interests, practice, growth, or maturity?

    · How does the loss of body/face/voice affect teachers' instructional meth-
        ods regarding writing about writing if in any way at all?

    · How does the loss of body/face/voice affect instructional response to stu-
        dent writing whether the response is text-based or audio/video enhanced
        if in any way at all?

    · How, if in any way at all, does the loss of body/face/voice affect the in-
        teractions between teachers and students with different learning styles,
        disabilities, multilingual histories, or challenged socioeconomic back-
        grounds?

    Such theorizing would help OWI educators to move beyond old percep-
tions that online instruction is naturally inferior to onsite instruction, which
can open the field to a better understanding of how people learn to read and
write in a digital age and in technologically enhanced settings. This movement
is crucial because hundreds of thousands of students are learning to write using
digital technologies and in OWI settings, and educators can benefit them more
with composition theories that match currently used modalities and media.
Such theorizing would help to address the loss of body/face/voice connection
in most OWI settings and explain the relative benefits of different ways to com-
municate online. Finally, it would help to address whether and how the heavily
text-centric nature of both asynchronous and synchronous OWI affects learning

                                                                                                  57
Grounding Principles of OWI

and requires different or stronger reading skills, leading to practical ways of un-
derstanding student reading and writing challenges in contemporary digitally
enhanced settings.

OWI PRINCIPLE 4

    Through our research, the CCCC OWI Committee realized that many of
the contemporary theories, pedagogies, and strategies of onsite composition
courses apply to OWI, which is reflected in OWI Principle 4.

         OWI Principle 4: Appropriate onsite composition theories,
         pedagogies, and strategies should be migrated and adapted
         to the online instructional environment.

Rationale for OWI Principle 4

    OWI Principle 3 explains that those teaching OWCs should think of ways
to maximize the distinct opportunities of the electronic environment. However,
one impediment to those moving their instruction online is the unfounded be-
lief that everything about their teaching will have to change.

    Composition studies has a rich research and teaching history, and the CCCC
OWI Committee recognizes that many core pedagogies of onsite writing in-
struction can and should remain in OWI. Many pedagogical theories and strat-
egies that have not been designed with OWI in mind can be adapted to the
online setting. Indeed, various foundational rhetorical and writing theories and
their connected onsite pedagogies and strategies can be migrated online success-
fully. Teachers should seek opportunities to use their established practices when
moving online while seeking alternative ways of offering those practices within
digital spaces and using electronic tools.

Discussion

    OWI Principle 4 presents the yang to OWI Principle 3's yin. Both the Fully
Online and Hybrid OWI surveys (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a & 2011b)
strongly supported the belief that OWI is an extension venue for contemporary
writing instruction. Although to differing degrees and with different emphases,
both surveys indicated participant beliefs that writing is a process; writing should
attend to audience, purpose, and occasion; writing is a social process; and/or
writing and revising are generative and recursive acts (CCCC OWI Commit-
tee, 2011c, pp. 21-24, 48-52). Participants also included common instructional
philosophies such as the necessity of peer feedback for writing improvement and

58
                                                                                                        Hewett

that face-to-face interaction is important even in OWI, a belief expressed heavily
in the hybrid participant group.

    Our research taught the CCCC OWI Committee that such common com-
position theories as social construction, writing process, Aristotelian rhetoric,
and expressivism all continue to fit the beliefs that OWI teachers have about
writing instruction in the online environment. The only contemporary belief
that participants almost universally indicated would contraindicate OWI is that
writing is not teachable and it can only receive reader response; only 7 of 297
total respondents indicated agreement with that statement. One survey respon-
dent stated:

         I do not agree entirely with the first clause; however, my expe-
         rience has been that student needs vary to such a great extent
         that most writing instruction needs to be greatly individual-
         ized. I find the discussion forums allow students to work with
         other students' texts and to develop a sense of what their writ-
         ing practices are and how their practices affect the response to
         and perceived quality of their work. (p. 52)

    Scott Warnock (2009) also presented a strong case for migrating strategies
stemming from contemporary composition theory into the online setting (pp.
xiii-xv). Among those familiar strategies are transferring peer and teacher dis-
cussions online using asynchronous text-based conversation forums, assigning
small peer groups in a similar forum for peer review of drafts and other tasks,
requiring multiple drafts of essays, asking students to read books and modules
about writing, assessing portfolios, and using teacher response--both text-based
and audio-based--as part of the learning experience. Such strategies work in
OWI because they speak to core composing theories that have proven value for
writing instruction overall.

    The key to migrating theory and strategies that originated in onsite compo-
sition instruction to OWI seems to be a willingness to adapt and to be creative.
Adaptation requires that one consider the nature of an asynchronous discussion,
for example, to be as legitimate a way to talk as in-class, face-to-face, oral talk.
Creativity engages this modality as an educational bonus because it offers stu-
dents additional opportunities to write for real audiences and to practice critical
reading (often of imperfect text) for thinking and response purposes (Palmquist,
1993).

    Inclusivity and access can be addressed in this migration of theories and
strategies in highly practical ways. With text-based discussion, for example, the
LMS should have been selected such that screen readers can read the discussion,
enabling the sight impaired to respond. The asynchronous setting means that

                                                                                                  59
Grounding Principles of OWI

students with such challenges as writing disabilities, dyslexia, and physical dif-
ferences can take more time to keyboard their responses. Students who cannot
use the keyboard for whatever set of reasons or who need to take a break from
physically writing can use speech-recognition software and still complete the as-
signment. Students with varied learning styles, skill levels, and personality types
(e.g., slow readers, poor typists, and shyer students) all can participate.

    In terms of presenting instructional modules or texts for students to read, as
would be done through textbooks and handouts in most onsite writing courses,
the online setting invites the visual additions of photographs, drawings, charts,
tables, brainstorming diagrams, and such audio/video media as YouTube mov-
ies. Such variety again can appeal to a wide variety of student learning styles.
Access, however, should be addressed further by providing captions to images
and transcripts of audio/video pieces.

OWI PRINCIPLE 5

    Teacher satisfaction is important as described in OWI Principle 12, but so is
student progress. This OWI principle speaks to conditions for instruction that
should promote both goals.

         OWI Principle 5: Online writing teachers should retain
         reasonable control over their own content and/or techniques
         for conveying, teaching, and assessing their students' writing
         in their OWCs.

Rationale for OWI Principle 5

    Particularly in FYW courses, a tension can exist between institutional/pro-
grammatic instructional requirements and outcomes and the flexibility that ex-
perienced educators need to teach effectively. Within the context of institution-
al/programmatic outcomes, online writing teachers should have the freedom
to develop their OWCs with content, methods, and technologies that best suit
their purposes, expertise, and teaching style. Because achieving advanced levels
of fluency in writing requires the complex integration of different kinds of skills
and knowledge (e.g., rhetorical awareness, linguistic competency, and genre lit-
eracy), highly qualified writing teachers not only are "content experts" in rhetor-
ical, linguistic, and genre literacy but also are knowledgeable about composing
and assessing learning situations in response to their specific students.

    This principle speaks to the larger issue that faces many institutions with vast
numbers of OWC writing sections. The pressures of these large programs lead to
unified (and often restrictive) course templates and core syllabi and sometimes

60
                                                                                                        Hewett

even more restrictive course shells. These features often are the result of pro-
grams that rely heavily on contingent faculty; it is well known that institutions
turn to uniformity of method and materials in lieu of hiring, training, and re-
taining expert, full-time writing teachers.

    Online writing teachers do their best work when they retain some control
over their courses, and OWI effective practices should be accounted for in help-
ing to balance necessary institutional pedagogical goals with teacher flexibili-
ty. This recommendation (and every listed effective practice for this principle)
strongly relies on teachers having received the training, professional develop-
ment, and assessment described in OWI Principle 7.

Discussion

    One of the quality pillars in online learning is faculty satisfaction as indicat-
ed by a sense of being appreciated and of professional happiness (Sloan Consor-
tium, 2005). When we asked field interviewees, CCCC panel audiences, SIG
participants, survey participants, and the expert/stakeholder panelists about this
issue, one concern emerged repeatedly: Teachers wanted the autonomy to devel-
op their courses per their expertise and personal preferences. People expressed
that they did not like being made to use predesigned or shell-based courses, yet
they also expressed worries about the amount of work that free-form course
development requires in online settings.

    For example, in the CCCC OWI Committee (2011a & 2011b) surveys, in
response to open-ended questions, teachers claimed they had wanted "teacher
autonomy"; the CCCC OWI Committee found it interesting that "those who
tended to see their teaching as isolated (negative) also tended to see their ac-
ademic freedom as more limited" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, pp. 36,
66). There seemed to be a correspondence between having little sense of an
association with other OWI teachers and a sense of being able to develop their
courses as they saw fit. Furthermore, the survey respondents saw "consistency/
inconsistency among sections (this concern seems to contradict concerns about
academic freedom, which tended to suggest a common syllabus and rigid course
structure)" as a major issue (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, pp. 37, 67). In
this case, the CCCC OWI Committee sensed that both WPAs and teachers were
expressing that courses were not necessarily consistently robust or rigorous for
students when they were not predesigned. Indeed, Andrew Cavenaugh, Director
of Writing at UMUC, confirmed that concern from a WPA's perspective (per-
sonal communication, July 17, 2012).

    In a survey-based open-ended statement, one professor working in a five-
week FYW format stated, "I think student learning is very much affected by the

                                                                                                  61
Grounding Principles of OWI

compressed format coupled with online. Changing the course to incorporate
new technology and pedagogical ideas is attractive and responsible but seriously
daunting. And I'd have to undertake it pretty much alone" (CCCC OWI Com-
mittee, 2011c, p. 38). This statement seemed to suggest that having indepen-
dence to redevelop portions of a writing course is desirable but challenging in
potentially energy-sapping ways. In the second online meeting with the expert/
stakeholder panel, one professor raised the issue of using predesigned course
shells several times: "Adjunct or not, I prefer a choice and opportunity for aca-
demic freedom, but the first time I've taught for any institution, I've preferred
having a predesigned course, just to start" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013a, p.
42).

    The CCCC OWI Committee understood the feedback we were receiving
to represent a mixed concern of (1) desiring to be an autonomous teacher of
writing, (2) understanding the occasional need for predesigned course formats,
and (3) needing to balance the two to achieve a reasonable potential for positive
student outcomes and professional satisfaction. To this end, OWI Principle 5
strives to recognize that experienced and appropriately trained teachers of OWI
should have as much control as possible over their course content, instructional
techniques, and assessment methods. This need for training, addressed in OWI
Principle 7, takes into account the tension between consistency of courses and
the autonomy to make one's own professional choices.

    However, OWI Principle 5 also recognizes that institutions have the re-
sponsibility of ensuring equally robust OWI courses regardless of the individual
teachers' pedagogical preferences. Sometimes course shells are necessary to de-
velop that baseline equality for which the institution and/or writing program is
responsible. To that end, we think that the first time newly trained OWI teach-
ers instruct an OWI course or the first time experienced OWI teachers instruct
for the institution, they should be provided a predesigned course; such a course
enables them to both gain and demonstrate expertise and may provide needed
breathing space to settle into the OWI and institutional environment. We rec-
ognize the complexity of seeing OWI Principle 5 as a guideline and not a rule,
however; WPAs might adapt this recommendation wholesale or to individual
teachers based on their unique backgrounds and strengths.

    This issue concerns inclusion and accessibility, of course. Students (and their
teachers) have a right to expect that their courses will fairly represent the out-
comes dictated by the writing program. Yet, students also have a right to have
their needs addressed individually so that they can learn writing using their
strengths; such an inclusive attitude requires that teachers be free to bend el-
ements of a predesigned course as they perceive necessary to meet all student

62
                                                                                                        Hewett

needs and to support student learning optimally. At the same time, as we ad-
vocate for more agency for instructors, we also should acknowledge that these
pre-designed shells offer an opportunity to OWI programs to develop accessible
courses from bottom up without duplicating effort and with minimal invest-
ment in instructional design and curricular personnel.

    This OWI principle, like most of them, reflects the recognition that there al-
ways is a balancing act among institutional, writing program, individual teacher,
and student needs. To the greatest degree possible, we believe that experienced
and trained teachers do their best work when given appropriate amounts of
autonomy within the strictures of a developed and functional OWI program.

OWI PRINCIPLE 6

    This OWI principle shows the CCCC OWI Committee's recognition that
OWI takes more than the form of a writing course that has moved into online
settings; indeed, it is an organic base for transitional and newly developing edu-
cational products and processes.

         OWI Principle 6: Alternative, self-paced, or experimental
         OWI models should be subject to the same principles of
         pedagogical soundness, teacher/designer preparation, and
         oversight detailed in this document.

Rationale for OWI Principle 6

    As emergent forms of online teaching increasingly are offered by many col-
leges and universities, and as these fall outside traditional onsite education mod-
els, some credit-bearing, online-supported, composition entities will receive less
professional oversight and may fail to offer students adequate preparation for
later work. OWCs listed as "self-paced" or "independent learning" frequently
have a fixed syllabus that students work through at their own pace, with varying
amounts of oversight from an educator, depending on the institution and the
individual teacher. These self-paced OWCs are a component of OWI in the
sense that they use digital technology, occur in online settings, and typically
are geographically distributed. Hence, they are subject to many of the strengths
and limitations of online teaching generally; they should reflect the principled
approaches of OWI as outlined in this document. Similarly, experimental mod-
els for OWI, such as Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), are emerging.
These, too, should reflect the principled approaches of OWI as described in this
document.

                                                                                                  63
Grounding Principles of OWI

Discussion

    OWI Principle 6 speaks to the essence of who is responsible--and in what
ways--for the online learning of writing students. Studying alternative, self-
paced, and experimental models of OWI was not a part of our committee's
charges or major research given the need to address common FYW, advanced
levels and genres of writing, and other writing-intensive disciplinary courses.
Instead, our interest in alternative, self-paced, and experimental OWI models
emerged primarily from a "what about" series of questions regarding self-paced,
credit-bearing writing courses that once were conducted through mail, then cas-
sette tapes, then television, then email, and now the Internet. Who creates such
courses? Who oversees their quality? Who are the teachers, and who prepares the
teachers? How well do such courses prepare student writers? Any answers to our
questions most likely vary by individual settings and participants. Sometimes
the courses are certified by an academic institution and promoted by a corporate
entity; other times, they are strictly in-house in the academic institution; and
still other times, they are developed by a corporate entity and promoted as equal
to that provided by a more traditional academic institution. Students may suc-
ceed, as they always seem to do, on a uniquely individual basis. Yet, such courses
need a series of guiding principles, and the CCCC OWI Committee believes
that A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) provides them.

    Recently, in fact very close to the time for publishing A Position Statement
of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI, an increasingly deliberated
experimental form of online learning--the MOOC--gained headline reportage
in a variety of daily educational publications such as The Chronicle of Higher Ed-
ucation and Inside Higher Ed, as well as scholarly journals (College Composition
and Communication, 2013, pp. 688-703) and edited collection (Krause & Lowe,
2014). Most often, the deliberation about MOOCs involved a few humanities
and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses, but
not OWI courses. For example, the three MOOC-participating scholars writ-
ing for College Composition and Communication's (2013) "Symposium on Mas-
sive Open Online Courses" were not taking writing classes per se although their
music appreciation MOOC did include writing assignments to be commented
upon and scored by peers. Some composition MOOCs were piloted and ana-
lyzed for potential benefits to student writers as of summer 2013 (i.e., Duke
University, Georgia Tech University, Ohio State University, and Mt. San Jacinto
College--all funded partially by The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation7). Typ-
ically, however, the massive nature of a MOOC precludes teacher response to
writing and, instead, promotes peer response as the primary feedback method

both for content and writing process.
    Of interest to the CCCC OWI Committee is a commitment to quality OWI

and fairness to all stakeholders. While MOOCs are being touted theoretically
for their ability to educate a great number of people, practically speaking they
do not allow for individualized teacher instruction through response to writing
(as opposed to individual peer response that is neither required nor moderated),
which is a primary way of teaching writing online, as our research confirmed
(Head, 2013). In particular, expert/stakeholder panel participants indicated that
written response to writing was a necessary and important part of their OWI
work: "Yes ... part of it [amount of time spent in OWI] has to do with the amount
of feedback we give students versus what we would give on physical assignments
... also, there is much discussion, versus nearly none in a face-2-face class" and
"more attention to individual students with text feedback, etc. because one can't
do that with nods and eye-contact, etc." (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012b, p.
49; also see Hewett, 2010 & 2015b). For the purposes of the CCCC OWI
Committee's work, OWI primarily has been defined regarding credit-bearing
writing courses of all levels and writing-intensive disciplinary courses. Therefore,
we have been skeptical of how a MOOC can provide an adequate framework for
OWI particularly given the inability of a teacher to connect with students indi-
vidually. Much research needs to be done to determine whether peer response in
the MOOC setting is sufficient to bring about writing development (Halasek et
al., 2014). Chapter 17 offers key research questions about MOOCs to that end.

    Just as important, the OWI principles were developed with inclusivity and
accessibility as the overarching guiding theme. Alternative, self-paced, and ex-
perimental models may prove to be excellent ways to address the needs of par-
ticular students. For example, a student who cannot function intellectually or
socially within the typical multi-student onsite or online course setting that re-
quires collaborative work or discussions may excel in a self-paced OWI setting.
Students who do not have the money to pay for the typical three-credit OWI re-
fresher or developmental course may benefit from practicing rusty writing skills
in a MOOC or an individualized course first. Nonetheless, we believe that even
an experimental OWI model should be guided by a strong foundation in writing
studies, specialized training in OWI (see OWI Principle 7), fair and equitable
compensation for teacher's work (see OWI Principle 8), a reasonable course load
for instructors that enables instruction by essay response (see OWI Principle 9),
and so on.

OWI PRINCIPLE 7

    OWI Principle 7 is the first of three principles regarding teacher's concerns.

                                                                                                  65
Grounding Principles of OWI

It encompasses a wide variety of professional needs that should help to develop
strong, confident, and satisfied OWI faculty.

         OWI Principle 7: Writing Program Administrators (WPAs)
         for OWI programs and their online writing teachers should
         receive appropriate OWI-focused training, professional
         development, and assessment for evaluation and promotion
         purposes.

Rationale for OWI Principle 7

    This principle establishes an environment in which WPAs and their on-
line writing teachers can develop, thrive, and meet OWI students' needs. Prior
to supervising OWI teachers, WPAs need to have training and experience in
OWI. Regarding faculty, OWI-teacher candidates should be selected first from
a pool of experienced and proven writing teachers. Teachers--especially novice
teachers (e.g., graduate student teachers) and contingent faculty--should not
be placed into OWCs until they have received appropriate training by their
WPAs and institution. Although such a requirement places restrictions on the
teaching pool, institutions should establish some way of training teachers and
having them demonstrate their ability to teach writing online before they do so
with an OWC.

    WPAs and OWI teachers need proficiency in three specific areas. (1) They
must be able to teach writing. (2) They must be able to teach writing specifically
in a digital environment. (3) They must be able to teach writing in a course
in which text is the primary communicative mode. Similarly, WPAs and OWI
teachers need support through regular professional development opportunities
and mentoring. As professional knowledge and theories change regarding OWI,
active OWI teachers and WPAs who supervise them need to be educated and
given opportunities to enact new ideas in their teaching and programs. Addi-
tionally, OWI programs and teaching should be assessed regularly and appropri-
ately for the environment and in a manner comparable to traditional courses/
writing program in the institution or unit.

Discussion

    The first requisite of this OWI principle is that teachers need training in
OWI, not just in online technology or settings. To make such professional de-
velopment fully useful, however, teachers first need WPAs who also have had
adequate training and course experience in OWI. When teaching writing online
is just an adjunct to a broader writing program and the WPA has little-to-no

66
                                                                                                        Hewett

personal knowledge of it, then OWI teachers enter a situation where their work
is not understood completely and may be underappreciated or--worse--not
understood for its high-level skill requirements. Furthermore, WPAs with OWI
training and experience more likely will understand the need for ongoing pro-
fessional development opportunities for their OWI teachers. Perhaps most im-
portant, only WPAs with OWI training and experience are qualified to evaluate
OWI teachers because the technology changes the pedagogy, as OWI Principles
3 and 4 point out; certainly, appropriate assessment is a cornerstone of a strong
OWI program. Without training and course experience, WPA evaluators can-
not understand how best to judge such factors of OWI course teaching and
management as discussion facilitation and writing response; indeed, they do not
know how best to help the teachers develop more effective skills. Hence, training
WPAs first and then preparing their teachers for OWI is crucial.

    In the CCCC OWI Committee's national surveys, respondents indicated that
while training relative to the LMS was mandatory and other training included
peer mentoring and instructional design as part of campus outreach and sum-
mer institutes, "training is inadequately developed at the level of online writing
pedagogy and somewhat unevenly applied" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c,
p. 34). Experts/stakeholders from the CCCC OWI Committee's panel, site visit
interviewees, and survey respondents strongly agreed that not only should OWI
teachers receive training relative to teaching writing online (as opposed to ge-
neric online instruction), but that they should be experienced teachers of writ-
ing from the outset. This concern stems from OWI teachers' almost universal
need to understand student writing issues without body/face/voice connections.
It means they should be able to read the writing, "listen" to students' written
self-reflections, understand potential difficulties of an assignment, and decide
how to help students using primarily written and asynchronous media. While
some OWI courses are synchronous, anecdotal evidence suggests that many are
fully online asynchronous courses. The ability to communicate about writing us-
ing writing is crucial (Hewett, 2010, 2015a, 2015b). This work cannot be done
well by inexperienced writing teachers who do not have the fuller understanding
of, or vocabulary for, describing writing. While it is not only fine but often in-
credibly helpful to pick up the telephone for a voice conversation or to use free
audio/video software for connection, no teacher--regardless of experience--can
manage the OWC load if every teaching interaction has to be accomplished as
a scheduled voice conference. The CCCC OWI Committee offers this guidance
with the full knowledge that following it may tie the hands of WPAs and gradu-
ate advisors seeking to flesh out their teaching pool or to educate their graduate
students with OWI. However, a combination of experience with onsite writing
teaching (environmentally familiar in some sense to all who have ever been in

                                                                                                  67
Grounding Principles of OWI

the onsite student seat) and training with mentoring or even co-teaching in hy-
brid and fully online settings is preferable to putting novice teachers in OWCs
and expecting a strong outcome for the teachers or the students.

    Professional development opportunities take time and energy, but OWI
teachers have told the CCCC OWI Committee repeatedly that they crave them.
In a written chat related to the second synchronous voice conference with ex-
perts/stakeholders, one respondent stated, "There is also an issue with the lev-
el of professional development with regard to elements of online instruction
comes into play, too, right? [sic]" To this, another replied, "Institutions are all
over the board in terms of training, support, development, mentoring" (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2012b, p. 24). The "The State of the Art of OWI" (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2011c) stated, "Instructors are dissatisfied with the levels of
support they receive regarding technology, course caps, training, pay, and pro-
fessional development/interactions relative to OWI in both the fully online and
hybrid settings" (p. 7). The CCCC OWI Committee concluded, "Such dissat-
isfaction can lead to poor teaching, low expectations for students and for an
online course, and insufficient retention of experienced instructors at a time
when OWI continues to grow" (p. 7). Areas in which research revealed that
professional development is needed include:

    · Inclusion and accessibility, which means becoming educated about stu-
        dents with physical, learning, socioeconomic, and multilingual challeng-
        es in addition to being well-versed in writing studies (i.e., preparing the
        course, appropriate expectations for students with varying learning styles
        and needs, fair assessment and evaluation for OWI settings, communi-
        cating with students who have accessibility needs [including issues re-
        garding those who have and have not self-disclosed such needs], ADA le-
        gal requirements, and educationally ethical requirements, among others.)

    · Learning about and applying OWI theories and strategies that are unique
        to the digital environment.

    · Migrating appropriate strategies from familiar onsite writing instruction-
        al settings to hybrid and fully online settings.

    · Writing accessible and helpful essay response in time-saving ways.
    · Communicating with students about writing in online settings.
    · Encouraging critical reading of peer writing and discussions.
    · Experiencing the OWI course from the student seat in order to learn the

        LMS, how long an assignment takes to complete, and the temptations of
        multitasking from the student view.

    Professional development topics may be particular to an LMS or institutional
setting, of course. For example, in an LMS that hosts what it calls a Wiki, OWI

68
                                                                                                        Hewett

teachers benefit from technological familiarization with that Wiki feature from
both the student and the instructor view; moreover, they benefit from training
in how a Wiki may help (or hinder) certain types of writing development and
how to match its benefits to their overall course goals. Undoubtedly, professional
development is a key to strong OWI.

    Finally, OWI teachers need fair and equitable assessment for evaluation and
promotion purposes. Regular evaluation is crucial to an effective writing pro-
gram in that it helps WPAs to match teachers to their courses and learn their
program's strengths and weaknesses. Without adequate evaluation, it is difficult
to guess at its success. Respondents at all levels shared with the CCCC OWI
Committee a sense of feast or famine when it comes to OWI evaluation. Either
they expressed a sense of being watched in a "big brotherly" fashion given the ca-
pability of a supervisor to log into their courses and read the interactions at any
time or they received no feedback or formal evaluation--thereby receiving no
help from a supervisor or mentor in improving their OWI teaching. To this end,
the CCCC OWI Committee believes that assessment of OWI courses should
occur at least as often as those for onsite teachers and no more often or rigorous-
ly. To view a teacher's OWC more often than onsite courses is akin to multiple
evaluations. While ongoing views might help particular teachers to teach better
or even reveal an exemplary teacher's strategies, it places onerous and unfair ex-
pectations on them versus their peers in onsite classrooms. However, if the WPA
determines a need for more than one opportunity to review an OWI course and
if an evaluative process is developed that is equitable with onsite writing courses
and that keeps the OWI teacher informed, then different but equal evaluation
may be effective. Furthermore, if OWI teachers are brought into their own as-
sessment by, for example, allowing them to invite the evaluator to preview or
review particular course components, the evaluative process may lose some of
its high-stakes nature and engage a more collaborative spirit of cooperation and
optimism for OWI improvement.

OWI PRINCIPLE 8

    A second OWI faculty-level issue is the need for fair and equitable compen-
sation.

         OWI Principle 8: Online writing teachers should receive fair
         and equitable compensation for their work.

Rationale for OWI Principle 8

    The work involved with OWI is new to some institutions and, as such, re-

                                                                                                  69
Grounding Principles of OWI

quires additional effort on the part of WPAs and faculty. At a minimum, the
efforts involved in developing and teaching new OWCs should be presumed to
represent intellectual and pedagogical labor equivalent to (and no less than) de-
veloping a new onsite writing course. Thus, also at a minimum, the compensa-
tion currently in place for teachers concerning the development of a new onsite
course also should apply when asking teachers to develop an online course.

    Other issues arise in terms of how much time and effort go into OWI-based
teaching. For example, new research indicates that there is a quantifiably heavier
reading load for teachers particularly in asynchronous settings, as well as a heavi-
er reading and writing load for both teachers and students (Griffin & Minter,
2013). In the online writing setting, teachers need to build informational re-
dundancy into a Web-based, LMS format. In other words, they often need to
provide a syllabus in more than one form or in more than one online space. As-
signments need to be written and distributed in more than one module or more
than one format for ease of finding and retrieval. Furthermore, teachers need to
provide content and instructional accessibility through redundant voice, visual,
and text-based materials, in keeping with OWI Principle 1.

    Altering course materials in these ways requires time and energy as well as
thoughtful literacy approaches and knowledgeable language choices. Although
some effective practice strategies can help to mitigate time load issues, they may
add up for teachers. Therefore, the CCCC OWI Committee recommends ad-
ditional compensation for first-time OWI teachers who are learning how to ac-
commodate such necessary organizational and pedagogical strategies. Compen-
sation in various forms (e.g., pay adjustments, course load modifications, and
technology purchases) should be provided.

Discussion

    Educators told the CCCC OWI Committee that fair and equitable compen-
sation is important to their continuing interest in and development of OWI.
In terms of importance of factors contributing to willingness to teach fully on-
line courses, 62% of survey participants rated "time/money compensation for
development of course" as "significant" or "very significant." Fifty-five percent
similarly rated "time/money compensation for learning a sophisticated set of
skills, theories, and technologies." In contrast, "Flexibility in teaching schedule,"
which some people consider to be a benefit of OWI, was rated highest in sig-
nificance at 95% (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, pp. 37-38). For the same
survey questions about hybrid courses, 57% of respondents rated "time/money
compensation for development of course" as "significant" or "very significant"
and 48% rated "time/money compensation for learning a sophisticated set of

skills, theories, and technologies" similarly. (Presumably the difference is indic-
ative of the hybrid course's often tricky similarity to traditional onsite courses;
see Chapter 2 for a detailed discussion.) In response to open-ended questions,
respondents also said:

    · "Having time and/or compensation for course development would be
        another great plus, because it is very time consuming to develop an on-
        line or blended course, especially one that is as rigorous and pedagogically
        sound as a face-to-face course, and we don't have that, and, to be honest,
        I don't think our online courses are, in general, nearly as high of quality
        as our face-to-face courses." (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 64)

    · "Alert administrations to the need of adequate workload compensation
        for the difficulty of digitizing a course and a curriculum." (p. 70).

    As stated in OWI Principle 8's rationale, equitable compensation for de-
veloping OWI courses and for new OWI teachers is important for a variety of
reasons. Anecdotally, educators have shared how much time and energy they put
into developing an OWC and how challenging it can be to teach OWI for the
first time. For contingent faculty, as Chapter 7 discusses, compensation regard-
ing time and money are incredibly important factors to achieving excellence in
OWI courses.

    While the CCCC OWI Committee takes the position that OWI is different
from onsite composition instruction but not alien to it, OWI in a disciplinary
sense is only about 30 years old, and relatively few teachers have had adequate
training that would help them to develop sound new strategies and to migrate
their most useful onsite strategies. The most experienced teachers have won their
skills through trial and error. As newer writing teachers with different levels of
involvement with digital tools engage students, they also will need to find the
most effective ways to teach online despite their frequent uses of online media
for social and even business settings (Hewett, 2015a). Educational uses of digital
media in writing instruction are still relatively new and require much study (see
Chapter 15). In addition to pay adjustments for newly developed courses, course
load modifications, and technology purchases, other types of compensation may
include stipends for training and professional development, financial assistance
or grants for conferences, permission to work from home or alternative sites,
official recognition of effort, and teaching assistants or co-teaching assignments
to share the higher literacy load (Griffin & Minter, 2013; see also Chapters 11
& 12). Additionally, because not all teachers have the economic means to be
technologically mobile in the anytime/anywhere nature of online instruction,
they may be denied access to desired OWI courses. Finding creative ways to in-
clude such teachers can meet the needs of both OWI Principles 1 and 8. Finally,

                                                                                                  71
Grounding Principles of OWI

consideration of course "ownership," an issue bigger than this chapter's scope,
also may lead to appropriate compensation venues.

OWI PRINCIPLE 9

    This OWI principle considers how many students should be enrolled in an
OWI course.

         OWI Principle 9: OWCs should be capped responsibly at 20
         students per course with 15 being a preferable number.

Rationale for OWI Principle 9

    The CCCC's Statement of Principles and Standards for the Postsecondary
Teaching of Writing (1989), regarding the teaching conditions necessary for
a quality education, stated that no more than 20 students (and preferably 15)
should be in a college-level writing course. Further, it indicated that teachers
should have no more than 60 students of writing in any one term. These guide-
lines were written in 1989 before the major onset of OWCs that continue to
increase in number. Teaching writing through digital media is a text-intensive
enterprise, even when voice and video are used. Text-heavy writing instruction
leads to a high literacy load in terms of reading and writing for teachers and
students, as noted in the rationale for OWI Principle 8. Because contemporary
writing pedagogy encourages high-quality, individualized teacher-to-student
interactions as well as peer reading and written discussion opportunities, the
literacy load must be made manageable. Given these realities and the necessity
to provide a robustly accessible teaching and learning environment (see OWI
Principle 1) the maximum number of students in an OWC should adhere to
these teaching conditions.

    Coordinating the statement cited above with the principles of the CCCC
Statement on Second Language Writing and Writers (2009) and with OWI Princi-
ple 1 of this document, any OWC solely comprised of physically-, learning-, lin-
guistically-, or socioeconomically-challenged writing students (i.e., sometimes
called "developmental" or "basic" writers) should have no more than 15 stu-
dents. In such cases, teachers should be assigned a maximum of 45 such writing
students per term. The added concerns of assisting students with basic reading
and writing skills in a text-intensive online setting requires additional time and
especially thoughtful writing on teachers' parts, as well as possible offline phone
or in-person interventions. Fifteen students remains a reasonable number in
these conditions.

Discussion

    A colleague recently described composition teaching in this way: teaching
one course of 20 students is like teaching 20 courses of one student each. The
simile describes the discipline's collective efforts to individualize writing instruc-
tion through conferences and written response to papers as well as personalized
answers to students' individual questions. Personalization is an important skill
when working with student writers, and it becomes still more important in hy-
brid and fully online courses where digital tools mediate the interactions. Loss
of personalization can lead both to affect-based attrition (e.g., such as my young
relative at the beginning of this chapter) and to cognitive reading and writing
difficulties, as I theorize (Hewett, 2015a). Many teachers have multiple OWI
courses of 20 or more students in each. When too many students are in any of
those courses, teachers burn out, courses are depersonalized, and students fail to
persist.

    A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI's
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) principle of capping OWI courses at 20 stu-
dents with 15 as the optimal number might be considered by some to be a fanta-
sy. Indeed, although the CCCC Statement on Second Language Writing and Writ-
ers (2009) has remained steady, the CCCC's Statement of Principles and Standards
for the Postsecondary Teaching of Writing was updated after the publication of the
OWI Principles to read simply "reasonable class sizes" (2013). The specific num-
bers have meaning to WPAs and teachers in writing studies, however, and the
CCCC OWI committee indicated as much in its November 2014 report to the
CCCC EC. In December 2014, Howard Tinberg, then CCCC EC Chair indi-
cated in an email to CCCC OWI Committee co-chairs that specific numbers
likely would be reinstated in the near future through the CCCC position state-
ment review process in response to requests by many CCCC members.Writing
class size is a highly debated issue in the field because it is so critical; the realities
of institutional contexts regarding financial decisions have to be weighed against
varying factors, only some of which are whether teachers are fully prepared by
their institutions to work with writers of varying skills--such as multilingual
writers--and writers in online contexts. Anecdotal evidence suggests that many
OWI courses are capped by their institutions in the low to high-twenties, yet
some teachers of multiple courses describe as many as 100 OWI students in a
semester. When asked about their institutions, expert/stakeholder panelists cited
numbers that were:

    · low (e.g., "Developmental: 10-15. First year: 15-18. Upper class: no
        more than 15"; "My tech comm UD class is capped at 15"; and "At my
        community college, it is 15 students for online or on ground"),

                                                                                                  73
Grounding Principles of OWI

    · high (e.g., "online writing classes have the same cap as our f2f classes:
        24"; "26 students for composition"; and "it is 28 in the classroom, but it
        isn't unusual for half the class to drop"), and

    · ideal (e.g., "15 to 20" and "Comp ideal 15-18") (CCCC OWI Commit-
        tee, 2013a, pp. 5-6).

    Text-rich courses require text-heavy work. Although more research should be
conducted regarding retention in OWI, survey participants anecdotally reported
that given the "same grading and feedback demands" in OWI as in onsite classes,
"increases in student numbers would decrease feedback and ultimately effective-
ness." A typical participant open-ended response was, "Frankly, online teaching
should be called online writing. The sheer volume of interactive discussion posts
and emails makes for a more labor intensive class than a face-to-face class. In ad-
dition, you can't simply speak to clarify a point. You must write and think even
more carefully about how that writing will come across" (CCCC OWI Com-
mittee, 2011c, p. 44). On top of writing essay responses, respondents indicated
that additional communications increased their workloads (e.g., commenting
on discussion posts, crafting class announcements, responding to emails and
questions)" (p. 44). One participant stated that while her institution's "face-to-
face attrition rate is 2-4% in writing courses," the "State's online attrition rate is
50% in writing courses" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 45).

    Although OWI is sufficiently different from onsite writing instruction to
warrant new theories and strategies, the CCCC OWI Committee sees it as equal
to onsite writing instruction in terms of course content, potential for quality,
and credit-bearing nature. The CCCC OWI Committee decided to adhere to
the reasoning provided by previously established CCCC committees regarding
course caps because it could not find research that contraindicated them for ei-
ther onsite or OWCs. This decision presented an interesting conundrum when
a recent WPA-L listserv discussion (April 17, 2013) considered OWC caps in
light of A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013). Having cited deeper attrition rates for the
online courses than for onsite ones, one writer questioned whether the CCCC
OWI Committee would suggest higher caps for onsite courses in light of its rec-
ommendation of 15-20 students in online courses. As one of the interlocutors,
I responded:

         ... it is true that we are not suggesting a lower cap for an on-
         line course than for an onsite one. Certainly, we are aware that
         most FY writing courses are capped too high to begin with,
         and we believe that many, many online courses are capped too
         high for the quality of instruction that needs to be conducted

         in an environment with a heavy literacy load. To be clear, we
         do not believe that a course cap of more than 20 student [sic]
         in an online FY writing course is advisable or effective.

    Course caps also need to be developed with inclusion and access in mind.
When students have special needs--be they learning, physical, multilingual,
or socioeconomic--these needs should be addressed upfront with an inclusive
course design. However, such needs also demand attention during the academic
term as personalization and individualization requirements arise. Additionally,
students who do not necessarily fit into the defined populations for accessibili-
ty may require attention when--for whatever reason they exist--literacy chal-
lenges arise in the online setting. OWI teachers who are teaching their courses
actively will find themselves providing supplementary consideration to different
students at various times with many of their interactions occurring through text.
Unquestionably, lower course caps will assist OWI teachers with providing more
accessible courses.

OWI PRINCIPLE 10

    OWI Principle 10 is the first of five principles categorized as primarily a
responsibility of the institution to WPAs, teachers, and students. This principle
involves setting students up for success prior to taking an OWI course.

         OWI Principle 10: Students should be prepared by the in-
         stitution and their teachers for the unique technological and
         pedagogical components of OWI.

Rationale for OWI Principle 10

    Adequate preparation is another issue of access, enabling students to succeed
in a different learning environment by assisting them with technological and
cognitive challenges. Any individual online course should include some form of
orientation for students. Sometimes such orientation is left to general technology
or advising units and is not provided within each course. Having been appropri-
ately oriented to the institution's LMS (in keeping with Effective Practice 2.1),
for example, students still need to understand what the OWC will be like. For
this understanding, they need formal preparation particular to learning writing
online. For instance, unlike some online courses, an OWC is not a self-paced or
individually managed course in that regular and frequent student-to-group and
student-to-teacher interactions are necessary within a well-defined time frame.

    To this end, a clear OWI-orientation program should be provided at the in-

                                                                                                  75

stitutional or unit level such that students are made aware of the unique require-
ments and technological opportunities of the OWC. Whether an institutional
or unit trainer prepares and delivers such orientation, teachers should be primed
to support and/or repeat elements of that training in the OWC to assist with
student success. Neither institutional/unit administrators nor teachers should
assume that because many students are frequent technology users, they will be
successful with OWI. Indeed, the kind of online communicating that tech-savvy
students do in their personal lives often is fast, frequent, and informal, which
typically is not the kind of communicating they will need to do regularly to be
successful in OWCs.

Discussion

    In the CCCC OWI Committee's research, one of the most frequent com-
ments that educators made about students and OWI regarded a general lack
of preparedness for the online settings in which they were expected to learn.
Such preparedness is necessary on two levels: (1) the institution's LMS and other
prescribed technology and (2) using that technology for writing instruction.
Preparing students for using technology in the course was mentioned more often
than learning writing with technology. For example, in the nationwide surveys,
the CCCC OWI Committee learned:

         The most important issues that respondents indicated stu-
         dents needed to be adequately oriented for OWI courses were
         technology orientation, time management skills, and the
         "ability to be successful." Admitting to the importance of all
         of these issues for success in any online course, none of these
         indicate successful indicators for an online writing course.
         Indeed, the expectation that students need to be able to read
         or write well to succeed in these courses fell at or below 6%
         response in both surveys. The differences between online
         courses and online writing courses, between online training
         and online writing instruction training, and online teaching
         and online writing teaching blur throughout this report,
         indicating that traditional ideas and strategies simply have
         migrated to the online setting without sufficient consideration
         of what the specific media mean for learning in a particular
         disciplinary area like writing. (CCCC OWI Committee,
         2011c, p. 10)

    These themes were repeated when talking with interviewees at site visits,

76

audiences at CCCC panel and SIG presentations, and expert/stakeholder panel-
ists. The CCCC OWI Committee realized that students did, indeed, need tech-
nology orientation, yet they also needed preparation for using that technology
in support of writing instruction. To this end, we wrote OWI Principle 10 to in-
clude both responsibilities and to indicate that the institution bears primary re-
sponsibility for the technology orientation as its absolutely minimal obligation.

    The institution should develop basic orientation materials and strategies for
helping students to learn the LMS. Site-visit interviewees suggested that such
orientation might occur synchronously in an onsite computer lab with IT in-
structors or through an asynchronous, quiz-based delivery system. Such basic
orientation is not a writing teacher's responsibility because the LMS is selected
for students by the institution for multiple courses.

    However, both the institution and the individual writing teacher might have
responsibility for orienting writing students to the LMS for the purposes of
writing instruction. The decision for responsibility should be made mutually
among the institution, WPA, and IT department. All these stakeholders should
understand that while an LMS can be used for delivering many courses, writing
instruction is unique in the variety of LMS components students may be asked
to use. Writing students typically are asked to:

    · Post essays for teacher response, retrieving them when advised
    · Post essays for peer response and respond to peers' essays
    · Respond to discussion questions and to their peers' responses
    · Work in small study groups, posting responses and document files
    · Write private journals for teacher review and response
    · Write publicly in Wikis or blogs for class review and response
    · Write private IM-like chats to teachers and peers
    · Write and respond to LMS-based emails
    · Read instructional writing-focused modules and content
    · Read announcements, class messages, and assignments from the teacher

    These varied LMS uses differ from that of many disciplinary courses that
limit LMS uses to posting completed assignments, reading modules and con-
tent, reading announcements and class messages, taking multiple choice or
open-ended response quizzes, and using the LMS-based email. Writing courses,
having been "flipped" for many years, are active work spaces, and students need
to know how to use the LMS differently for this work. To this end, while the
institution might have the best resources for developing and delivering an orien-
tation to writing using the LMS at the overarching writing-course level, writing
teachers also have some responsibility to help students succeed through early,
carefully scaffolded orientation. One expert/stakeholder panelist expressed:

                                                                                                  77
Grounding Principles of OWI

         But also even scaffolding the learning of the technology... ..
         You got to give all the students training wheels to get through
         all that material. I think a lot of people underestimate how
         important the first couple of weeks of getting started stuff are
         and hit the ground running. So bad practice is hitting the
         ground running without slowly, carefully articulated, carefully
         designed scaffolding assignments that hit both course design,
         course adaptation, technology, technology of how the course
         is delivered as well as the technologies they may be using
         within the course content. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a,
         pp. 16-17)

    Because students have differing levels of ability for using technology and
especially using technology for educational purposes, it will not hurt them to
receive both institutional-level, general LMS/technology orientation and writ-
ing-specific LMS/technology orientation. Indeed, doing so will increase their
potential to succeed in their OWI course as the expectations for how and why to
use various LMS components will better match their experiences (see Chapter
13). Such orientation is an important way to keep accessibility upfront rather
than retrofitted because it will enable the institution, WPA, teacher, and student
to learn early whether accommodations or other changes will help individual
students to succeed.

    For example, when students have had adequate and timely orientation, they
can make better decisions about whether their family situations, work sched-
ules, and learning preferences will work for them in OWI. I learned about this
during my dissertation research (Hewett, 1998). Two students were in settings
not suited to their unique needs; one student was in the hybrid and the other
in the onsite setting. The student in the hybrid class had a documented reading
and writing disability; he was challenged consistently by the high literacy expec-
tations of a primarily asynchronous content delivery, peer reading and response,
and the need to communicate primarily through writing. The student in the
onsite class had a documented auditory processing disorder that caused her fre-
quent face-to-face peer group meetings to give her headaches as she struggled
to deal with incomprehensible, competing voices in a primarily voice/auditory
setting. Each student might have fared better in the other setting had they (and
I) but known from appropriate orientation how to judge learning style against
the literacy and communication loads of an OWC.

    Finally, it is important to note that the CCCC OWI Committee differenti-
ates OWI Principle 10 from OWI Principle 2, where we clearly state that writing
should be the focus of the writing course and not technology orientation or

78
                                                                                                        Hewett

teaching students how to use learning and other technologies that may or may
not be useful in work and outside life. The goal of OWI Principle 10 is to ensure
helpful orientation by the right parties, at the right time, and for the right pur-
pose. The goal of OWI Principle 2 is to ensure that writing remains the focus of
a writing course and that technology introduction and orientation should be for
the purposes of such writing instruction.

OWI PRINCIPLE 11

    A sense of aloneness easily can accompany OWI, and this principle seeks to
help individuals--teachers and students--feel more connected to their OWI-re-
lated interactions within courses and among educators.

         OWI Principle 11: Online writing teachers and their institu-
         tions should develop personalized and interpersonal online
         communities to foster student success.

Rationale for OWI Principle 11

    Students' motivation as learners often is improved by a sense of interper-
sonal connectedness to others within a course. Composition teachers long have
practiced pedagogy of collaboration and individualization in which students are
encouraged to see themselves as connected to their peers while being unique
writers. It is believed generally that such writing courses inspire student success
and satisfaction.

    To that end, student investment is thought to be fostered when OWCs cre-
ate community among teachers and students. Developing community is driven
both by the institution and faculty interaction with students. Institutions not
only must be committed to students and the delivery of highest quality OWI,
but such a commitment should be communicated clearly by institutional lead-
ership. It also should be fostered by an instructional practice of ongoing, stu-
dent-centered evaluation of course work and learning.

Discussion

    Although in retrospect it could be expressed more clearly, OWI Principle
11 is about building student success by addressing the needs both teachers and
students have for a sense of association among their peers. Regarding commu-
nity building for teachers, in the CCCC OWI Committee's research, teachers
often expressed a need to be connected to a broader online community, "a group
of peers/mentors to build a teaching community for online teachers" (CCCC

                                                                                                  79
Grounding Principles of OWI

OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 34). More than 65% of surveyed teachers expressed
this need (pp. 36, 65). One member of the expert/stakeholder panel expressed
that she was grateful to have a "community" when she had a faculty develop-
ment experience with other teachers but that the community could not help her
when she got into the classroom and had to "figure things out on my own to
a large degree" (CCCC OWI Committee 2012a, p. 20; see also CCCC OWI
Committee, 2012b, p. 11). To be truly helpful, then, it appeared that a teaching
community should have experience that one can call upon when faced with
actual work challenges.

    Regarding community building for students, "how to create a community
of learners in an online environment" was a concern that expert/stakeholder
panelists mentioned; particularly, community building was discussed regarding
student retention and as an indicator for effective practices (CCCC OWI Com-
mittee, 2012a, pp. 32-33). One of the ways that educators stated they responded
to student needs was to "build community" among the disparate students, en-
couraging retention and helping to avoid the ghost student who fails to commu-
nicate yet remains on the roles (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 10). One of
the most popular of community-building activities that teachers indicated was
"incorporating media that allow students to have some other encounters with
each other (building personal Web pages so students can `see' what classmates
look like, for example)." Although no more than 26% of surveyed online writing
teachers stated that they offered this option (pp. 28, 57), the idea was repeated in
site-visit interviews, during CCCC panels and SIGs, and in expert/stakeholder
meetings. The loss of body/face/voice seemed to inspire student and teacher bi-
ographies, postings of photos, and even the use of free conferencing technology
outside the LMS to help people interact synchronously (CCCC OWI Commit-
tee, 2012a, p. 14). As one survey respondent stated, "Maybe I'm romanticizing
online teaching a bit, but I don't think so. As a reluctant online teacher, I have
been immensely gratified by my involvement with a broader (students are from
all over the nation and the world) learning community" (p. 39).

    The notion of an online community for teachers and students is fraught with
challenge because it is romanticized to a degree. Will teachers spend leisure time
communicating with their online communities? Should they? In such cases as
tightly formed listserv groups, perhaps some will. Are students genuinely inter-
ested in developing "community" in the sense that composition instructors may
desire? According to anthropologist Rebekah Nathan (2005), students construct
their primary networks among smallish, ego-based groups of "two to six friends
who formed their core university community" (p. 56). These relationships ap-
pear to occur early in one's school life and rarely include someone met in "an
academic class or in an activity or club related to their major"; more frequently,

80
                                                                                                        Hewett

the social networks develop "in some shared affiliation, whether voluntary or
not, such as freshman dorm assignment, special freshman summer program,
ROTC, ethnic club, or sorority and fraternity rush" (Nathan, 2005, pp. 57-58).
Course-based "community" may need a different definition to make the work of
OWI Principle 11 realistic. Indeed, such community may require concrete ob-
jectives on which all participants can agree (DePew, Spangler, & Spiegel, 2014).

    In Preparing Educators for Online Writing Instruction: Principles and Process-
es (Hewett & Ehmann, 2004), the authors argued for a notion of communi-
ty-building among educators that overtly recognizes the transactional versus
social nature of academic groups. Their thesis was that teachers want to connect
online because it can help them in their jobs by enabling them to share problems,
solutions, challenges, frustrations, and successes. Called an "association" (Buber,
1923) to differentiate transactional from social communities, such connection
can foster teacher and tutor satisfaction. Similarly, in OWI courses, when viewed
as an association, student connections and course-based group interactions can
be fostered to increase student satisfaction.

    Whatever educators choose to call it, providing the possibility of online as-
sociation among teachers, between teacher and students, and among students
seems necessary to help people in the OWI setting see others as individuals with
genuine writing needs and concerns. Online communities help to make the me-
diated interaction more human. In light of A Position Statement of Principles and
Example Effective Practices for OWI's (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) example
effective practices for this OWI principle, it seems helpful here to remember that
people will have different preferred methods of computer-mediated interaction
(e.g., IM chat, email, lengthy posts, texting, phone and other voice-based me-
dia). Given that variety, teachers would do well to set expectations for a partic-
ular LMS-based medium that easily is used by the entire class for building some
level of connections while understanding that students (and teachers) naturally
will choose a preferred medium for various kinds of communications. Allowing
that not all group-building interactions may occur using the course's preferred
medium is one way of addressing inclusivity and accessibility for OWI Principle
11. Overall, the writing studies discipline still needs to consider how to over-
come various access and inclusivity issues in order to enable the possibility of a
sense of community.

    Finally, a sense of being in the course together is fostered by teachers when
they return student writing promptly, offer response to online discussions rather
than asking students to conduct all conversations without them, request that
students evaluate the course or module midstream (potentially leading to change
during rather than after the term), and include students in decision making.
Such affirmation of students as responsive people who can help to guide their

                                                                                                  81
Grounding Principles of OWI

OWC is an andragogical principle that may lead to a more bonded class (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2012b, p. 10).

OWI PRINCIPLE 12

    This OWI principle addresses the need for institutions to plan and engage
support for OWI teachers.

         OWI Principle 12: Institutions should foster teacher satis-
         faction in online writing courses as rigorously as they do for
         student and programmatic success.

Rationale for OWI Principle 12

    Teacher satisfaction in an OWI environment is critical. Many teachers
learned their craft in traditional, onsite settings, so they may experience anxiety
and/or dissatisfaction in this newer educational setting. Teacher satisfaction is
dependent on a number of affective factors, including being personally suited
to teaching online and being comfortable communicating with students using
digital/electronic means.

    Teachers should be helped to understand the relative advantages and disad-
vantages of teaching an OWC in their institution, which includes such peda-
gogical factors as understanding how communication in the OWC environment
differs and learning the benefits and challenges of the asynchronous and the
synchronous modalities. Developing that understanding includes clearly de-
scribing any employment conditions specific to teaching an OWC course in the
institution such as onsite and/or online office requirements; whether teaching an
online course is understood to be equal in time or weight to a traditional onsite
course; and how teaching an OWC is assessed for job retention, promotion, and
tenure.

    Time is a particularly sensitive issue for teachers, onsite as well as online.
However, a standing misconception is that teaching and learning in an online
environment is less time-intensive than teaching on campus because the teach-
ing and learning often can be accomplished asynchronously and at one's own
convenience. Research consistently has indicated that teaching online can be
more time-intensive (Allen & Seaman, 2010; Seaman, 2009; Worley & Tes-
dell, 2009) because most communications and interactions (e.g., instruction,
assignments, questions, answers, and grades) in OWCs are fully online. Teach-
ing writing online involves focused teacher responses that are crafted to specific
student compositions. Unlike what people might imagine can be done in other
disciplines, most of these communications cannot be automated; there is no

82
                                                                                                        Hewett

"leveraging" or "scalability" of these essentially unique interactions (as compared
to, for example, providing the same content video to hundreds, if not thousands,
of students). To that end, concerns about time management can be an issue that
contributes to teacher dissatisfaction.

    With their individual habits, logistics, time management, and personal ca-
reer issues, teachers who are more suited to online modalities can engage the
students and invest them in their own learning online, all of which contribute
to teacher satisfaction.

Discussion

    Students are not the only ones whose satisfaction is important in OWI. Ac-
cording to the Sloan Consortium (2005), faculty satisfaction leads to online
instructional success, and it is fostered by appreciation and happiness with their
institutions and instructional settings. OWI Principle 12 was articulated to sug-
gest ways to achieve such satisfaction, which we believe can lead to retaining
strong OWI teachers and, ultimately, to student success.

    In the CCCC OWI Committee's surveys of OWI teachers, we were dis-
mayed but not surprised to learn that many participants were dissatisfied in their
OWCs and online instructional opportunities. Among the problems leading to
such unhappiness were "the levels of support they receive regarding technology,
course caps, training, pay, and professional development/interactions relative to
OWI in both the fully online and hybrid settings" (CCCC OWI Committee,
2011c, p. 7). Survey analysis suggested that "such dissatisfaction can lead to poor
teaching, low expectations for students and for an online course, and insufficient
retention of experienced instructors at a time when OWI continues to grow" (p.
7). As a result of their general unhappiness, respondents expressed "ambiguity"
about "recommend[ing] their online setting to other writing instructors[;] only
58% of the fully online respondents and 46% hybrid respondents said they
would" (p. 13).

    The respondents also indicated that they were more interested in logistical
(e.g., technical support, increased training, off-campus office hours, and lower
course caps) and intrinsic (e.g., mentoring and companionship while teaching
online, expressed student appreciation, and student success through reading the
online materials) rewards more than additional financial remuneration (pp. 37,
38, 66). These interests relate directly to OWI Principles 8 and 9. The CCCC
OWI Committee determined that "concerns among respondents would seem to
be connected directly to perceived lack of administrative and technical support,
as well as desires for ongoing training in terms of both technology and course
design" (p. 66).

                                                                                                  83
Grounding Principles of OWI

    OWI Principle 12 outlined some specific, reasonable strategies for helping
teachers to find more satisfaction in OWI. Most of them revolve around respect-
ing the teacher's need to learn about what constitutes effective OWI: a need to
know about OWI practically and theoretically; a need to connect with other
OWI teachers at the institution and across the nation; a need to have regular,
compensated professional development; a need to be informed about institu-
tional OWI-based outlook and the forecasted teacher pool; and so on. Once
enumerated, these needs may seem self-evident, but teachers across the nation
have informed us that they are not so evident to their WPAs or their institutions.
Steady nationwide increases in OWI courses strongly suggest that more teachers
will be needed, but without frank discussions for and among an institution's
OWI teaching pool, those most involved in increasing effective OWI courses will
not know what to expect.

    Such an issue of respect also is one of inclusivity and access. Just as not every
student will do well in OWI, not every teacher is well-suited to it. Teachers need
to know whether their teaching preferences suit them to OWI, which is an issue
of appropriate access to the OWI course. Teachers who prefer to teach online
over onsite writing courses should be given fair opportunities to do so because
they more likely will excel in their preferred setting. Frank discussions about pre-
ferred media for communicating, theories of writing instruction, and notions of
student learning and success can help teachers to place themselves appropriately
in online and onsite settings. Teachers who are not good candidates for OWI
should not be made (or allowed) to teach such courses; inclusivity, in this case,
does not mean that everyone should be teaching OWI equally often regardless
of skill and ability. (However, as Warnock and I discuss in Chapter 18, given the
future of OWI, we believe that all new teachers should be prepared for OWI in
such ways as to help them find their strengths in the online teaching environ-
ment.) Finally, mentoring, appropriate hand-holding, regular assessment, and
thoughtful communication also can foster teacher satisfaction. Without satisfied
and competent OWI teachers, the program is dead in the water; student success
levels will confirm that reality.

OWI PRINCIPLE 13

    OWI Principle 13 addresses the need for institutions to provide online stu-
dents with online support services.

         OWI Principle 13: OWI students should be provided sup-
         port components through online/digital media as a primary
         resource; they should have access to onsite support compo-

84
                                        Hewett

nents as a secondary set of resources.

Rationale for OWI Principle 13

    Writing instruction that is conducted online requires online support sys-
tems. Such support should take the form of online writing labs (OWLs; also
known as online writing centers) as well as online libraries, online accessible
information technology (IT) support, and distance-based student counseling.
Such reinforcing programs provide student access to the same support compo-
nents that students in traditional, onsite courses receive. This issue is one of ac-
cess and inclusivity (see OWI Principle 1), but it also is one of enabling students
to use the digital educational environment more fully (see OWI Principle 10).
When students are in a "learn-anytime" environment, they should have broad
access to support services.

    OWLs, for example, support the process-oriented elements of writing as well
as its social nature. As do brick-and-mortar writing centers, OWLs foster one-
to-one relationships between tutors and writers and provide tailored feedback
and assistance to students as a complement to in-class, faculty-led instruction.
Tailored, personalized feedback from peer or professional tutors can afford in-
valuable learning opportunities for student writers. With institutional and fac-
ulty support, students must be prepared to use OWLs as sites of interaction and
dialogue and not as linear "drop-off" points to "fix" papers. OWLs can further
benefit OWI students by strategically modeling asynchronous or synchronous
interactions within the writing process.

Discussion

    The CCCC OWI Committee quickly learned through its research that on-
line writing students need online support systems. That tenet might seem to be
self-evident, but when OWI still carries some stigma of being a deficit model in
comparison with traditional onsite writing instruction, it follows that support
services also lag in valuing online components. OWI Principle 13 addressed the
need for consistently available online library, IT assistance, and student counsel-
ing, but it focused primarily on the need for OWL support.

    Even though useful literature exists that supports OWL development (see,
for example, (Driscoll, Brizee, Salvo, & Sousa, 2008; Hewett, 2002, Inman &
Sewell, 2000; Hobson, 1998; IWCA, 2002; Karper & Stolley, 2007; Wolfe &
Griffin, 2013;), the writing center field has not yet embraced OWLs as equal to
traditional writing centers. Chapter 5 addresses some of the underlying issues.

    The CCCC OWI Committee's nationwide surveys supported information

                                        85
Grounding Principles of OWI

gained through our field visit interviews; most students who took their writing
courses in hybrid or fully online settings did not have access to OWL services:

         The survey assumed that online tutoring would be available
         to students in both fully online and hybrid settings given that
         their instruction was occurring at least part time in an online
         setting. In the fully online setting, barely 50% of the respon-
         dents reported such availability; asynchronous tutoring was
         more often available to these students than synchronous. The
         vast majority of supplemental support was available through
         static online materials with a text-based nature. The results for
         the hybrid setting were remarkably similar with the exception
         that outsourced online tutoring was made available to 2-year
         community college students more often than for other fully
         online students. Quite a few respondents in both settings in-
         dicated either no access to online writing center assistance or a
         need for students to come in to a traditional brick-and-mortar
         writing center if one was available. The possibility that some
         students, particularly those in fully online settings, could
         not access the campus-based writing center did not emerge
         in open-ended "other" responses. The lack of supplemental
         support for students in online settings is worrisome. (CCCC
         OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 9)

    Students who did have online tutoring available typically did not receive
instruction in how to access or use those services: "as many as 30% (fully on-
line) and 47% (hybrid) reported that students did not receive any instruction
for using those tutoring services" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 9). Most
instruction that they received was text-based, which can be inaccessible to many
students because of physical or learning challenges, difficulties with educational
technology, or because they simply do not read instructional text well.

    OWLs that did exist were primarily asynchronous (50.3% for fully online
respondents and 51% for hybrid respondents), with fewer synchronous tutorials
provided (25.8% for fully online respondents and 23% for hybrid respondents).
Interestingly, 22% of fully online respondents indicated they had outsourced
tutoring available and 8% of hybrid respondents indicated outsourced tutor-
ing (pp. 24-25, 52). The higher number of outsourced tutoring in fully online
settings had a clear connection to the inability to require students to use an
onsite writing center; from a logistical standpoint, hybrid students who met at
least some of their classes on campus could be required to use the onsite writing
center instead of providing online support. Hence, writing tutorial services were

                                                                                                        Hewett

overwhelmingly provided in traditional onsite centers with text-based, mod-
ule-like resources available online.

    Although most online tutorials were accomplished asynchronously accord-
ing to the surveys, our expert/stakeholder panels indicated a preference for syn-
chronous tutorials, which anecdotally are preferred most often by tutorial pro-
viders on the national writing center listserv (WCenter) as evidenced by posts.
One panelist expressed the preference challenge as, "I think it is a big question,
an important question and the idea of comparing versus just saying they are
different, one is not better than the other. I think this a huge discussion that we
can talk about for a long time" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a, p. 25). This
open-mindedness about modality was countered by a distinct preference for
synchronicity in the discussion:

         So, we don't have the young super tech savvy students neces-
         sarily. So what we find works the best for synchronous online
         tutoring is using Adobe Connect to share documents so we
         can be looking at it together or chatting. But we don't always
         use the audio feature along with it; we use the telephone,
         because of bandwidth issues mainly. We also use the phone
         with email; if they email the paper we are both looking at the
         paper and talking on the phone. (CCCC OWI Committee,
         2012a, p. 13)

    To date, the CCCC OWI Committee has not found evidence that syn-
chronous online tutorials are superior to asynchronous ones although there are
some studies suggesting student preference for audio and audio/video feedback
(Moore & Filling, 2012; Sommers, 2012, 2013); more research certainly needs
to be engaged. It does not seem reasonable, however, to develop tutoring based
on the tutor's or OWL administrator's modality preference alone.

    Indeed, contrary to a general sense among research participants that syn-
chronous tutorials were superior to asynchronous ones given their likeness to
traditional onsite tutorials, the CCCC OWI Committee realized that students
needed to have access to tutoring that mirrored their course technology and its
typical modality. To that end, we recommend providing high quality tutoring
in the same modality and using the same media that students have available for
class. If the course is provided asynchronously through the LMS, then it makes
sense to use the LMS to address one-to-one tutoring; if the LMS is inappropriate
to the task, then it makes sense to do so through similar software that would be
familiar to students because of their educational uses of the LMS. If the course
is provided synchronously, then it makes the most sense to provide synchro-
nous tutorials. When it is possible to provide both modalities, then students can

                                                                                                  87
Grounding Principles of OWI

choose the modality based on their personal learning preferences, which engages
the spirit of generosity to which I referred earlier in the chapter. Similarly for the
medium: If the course uses text primarily, it is helpful to use text-based tutorials;
when the course uses audio/visual response primarily, then such response makes
sense for tutorials. Certainly, to address all learning styles, both modalities and
media could be offered for student choice.

    Finally, the CCCC OWI Committee learned that some educators were con-
sidering accessibility issues in developing their OWL services:

         From a tutoring perspective, I mean tutor presence is also
         important but also what someone mentioned, about teach-
         ing really being adaptable to the student needs and using
         whatever technology works with the students, whether that is
         texts, email ... that we are prepared to go where the student
         is comfortable, technologically and with their learning styles.
         We really tried to do that in the writing center. So that we are
         working with voice, over the phone or in Adobe Connect like
         this meeting is. Whatever we need to do to help the student
         focus on their writing [sic] and not so much on the environ-
         ment that might be strange to them. (CCCC OWI Commit-
         tee, 2012a, p. 12)

    Another panelist expressed, "Now in the writing center, we produce a lot
of different resources including movies or tutorials; we have to make sure all of
those are accessible, sometimes including a transcript or a PDF needs to be ac-
cessible" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a, pp. 27-28). This awareness of acces-
sibility appeared to be higher among those involved directly in providing writing
tutoring than among OWI teachers more generally; the heightened awareness
possibly stemmed from the writing center field's attention to students' individu-
al needs in their traditionally one-to-one setting.

    When OWI Principle 1 is held as the overarching principle, then inclusivity
and access are the most critical considerations for OWI Principle 13. Providing
inclusion and access means selecting the tutoring modality and media with stu-
dents' course modality and media in mind--making the interaction as simple
and familiar as possible. It also means providing OWL access despite an insti-
tution's current capability (or lack thereof ) to build and house an OWL; when
an OWL cannot be developed in-house or when doing so may take months
or years, then students should be provided interim tutorial support through
connections with other educational institutions or by outsourcing to other pro-
viders. When inclusivity and accessibility are the first principle, the decision to
have OWL-based tutoring support is automatic; how to provide high-quality

88
                                     Hewett

tutoring is the only question left.

OWI PRINCIPLE 14

    If OWLs are to be upheld as necessary sites for OWI-based tutoring support,
then they require high-quality, environment-specific tutor selection, training,
and professional development.

         OWI Principle 14: Online writing lab administrators and
         tutors should undergo selection, training, and ongoing pro-
         fessional development activities that match the environment
         in which they will work.

Rationale for OWI Principle 14

    As it is with writing instructors, tutor (peer or professional) training and on-
going professional development are paramount. Such training and orientation
must address the distinctive nature of online writing tutoring in asynchronous
and synchronous venues.

    The OWL coordinator should be well-versed in both traditional writing cen-
ter and OWL pedagogy and theory. This individual should be experienced with
the environments and modalities in which the tutoring occurs. To this end, the
coordinator should select online tutors for their (1) writing tutoring potential
and/or experience; (2) strengths in expressing writing instruction in writing; and
(3) comfort level with online technologies, which can be developed further in
training. For OWL tutors to model technology use for students, it is crucial that
they be trained through and with the settings, modalities, media, and technolo-
gies in which they will tutor. Further, they should receive individualized mento-
ring as well as any group training. All tutors should be trained to interact with
students using diverse media--print and electronic text, audio, and video--and
they should be prepared to work with students with diverse abilities and learning
styles, in line with OWI Principle 1.

    The OWL's commitment to screening, training, and professional develop-
ment will yield higher quality tutorial sessions that ultimately benefit all stu-
dents. For peer and professional tutors alike, such commitment ultimately will
refine and hone their practice and understanding of OWL tutoring.

Discussion

    Online tutors should be selected for their suitability and desire to teach on-
line, need environment-specific training in OWI, and require on-going profes-

                                     89
Grounding Principles of OWI

sional development for the same reasons that online writing teachers need these,
as outlined and discussed under OWI Principles 7 and 12. The CCCC OWI
Committee's research strongly indicated that contemporary online tutors are not
yet receiving such assistance.

    Our national surveys, for example, showed that the training provided typ-
ically is not occurring in the setting in which the tutoring is to occur, which is
a foundational educational principle for teacher and tutor preparation (Hewett
& Ehmann, 2004). When asked "to check all applicable responses to a question
about how tutors were trained for online writing center work," "up to 47%" of
fully online respondents "indicated that the tutors received the same training
as face-to-face tutors, while 31% indicated that their tutors received non-cred-
it bearing training dedicated to online tutoring" (CCCC OWI Committee,
2011c, p. 25). Furthermore, "only 1% indicated that their tutors had some kind
of credit-bearing online-specific tutor training, while 7% reported that tutors
received credit-bearing training in non-online specific processes and 9% report-
ed that their tutors received credit-bearing training on technology and online
pedagogies" (pp. 25-26). Of the hybrid-focused respondents:

         Up to 60% indicated that the tutors received the same
         training as face-to-face tutors, while 25% indicated that their
         tutors received non-credit bearing training dedicated to online
         tutoring. Zero percent indicated that their tutors had some
         kind of credit-bearing online-specific tutor training, while
         8% reported that tutors received credit-bearing training in
         non-online specific processes and 8% reported that their tu-
         tors received credit-bearing training on technology and online
         pedagogies. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 54)

    In reviewing these numbers, the CCCC OWI Committee expressed concern
that "the `same training' as face-to-face tutors may account for some common
tutoring principles, but not the particular strategies and/or principles necessary
for a text-based tutoring asynchronous or synchronous (chat) setting, nor for the
faceless telephone synchronous setting" (p. 54).8

    Selecting suitable tutors for the online environment is important because
they have to be able and willing to work primarily in text for asynchronous set-
tings and without facial or body language for most synchronous settings. Many
tutors and their writing center administrators train and conduct their work from
traditional, onsite theories and practices that are not necessarily helpful in online
settings. As a result, they express a sense of working in a less viable environment
(Ehmann Powers, 2010). Moving a one-to-one writing tutorial to an online
environment can be off-putting and can cause tutors to lose track of their goals.

One respondent in the expert/stakeholder panel discussions stated:

         And I actually did a research project on this a few years ago
         and what I found specifically was that these wonderful face to
         face tutors didn't have to be explicitly told who their student
         was. When they got online, all of a sudden they forgot their
         role and they started fixing papers instead of providing rec-
         ommendations and suggestions, and so I had to go and create
         some new online strategies for this faculty. (CCCC OWI
         Committee, 2012a, p. 25)

    This respondent saw the problem as a "disconnect between online strategies
and face-to-face strategies" (p. 25). Unfortunately, the published literature often
does not address the specific differences between online and onsite strategies
for tutoring (Bruce & Rafoth, 2009; Ryan & Zimmerelli, 2010; see Hewett,
2015b, 2010, 2011 for research and strategies that do address these differences).
Additional research can expand knowledge about how online tutoring shapes
student understanding and writing perceptions (see Wolfe & Griffin, 2013, for
example).

    As indicated in the discussion regarding OWI Principle 13, inclusivity and
accessibility demand that online writing students have online tutoring. That tu-
toring is most accessible in the online environment in which students are learn-
ing although it is reasonable and inclusive also to offer another online modality
or medium or to welcome (but not force through lack of other options) online
students to onsite settings. Nonetheless, online tutoring differs drastically from
onsite tutoring; using asynchronous text to explain and intervene, for example,
is quite different from orally talking a student through writing strengths and
weaknesses or encouraging change while never touching the student's paper with
a pen. These very differences place inadequately trained tutors in the position
of going against what they believe to be tutoring best practices and can leave
the online student with less than the best assistance and feedback. Genuinely
accessible online tutoring will meet students at their points of need rather than
allowing what the tutor is comfortable or familiar with to be the guiding factor.
Appropriate tutor selection, online training, and ongoing professional develop-
ment can mitigate these problems.

OWI PRINCIPLE 15

    This final OWI principle is in a category of its own, which is research.

         OWI Principle 15: OWI/OWL administrators and teachers/
         tutors should be committed to ongoing research into their

                                                                                                  91
Grounding Principles of OWI

         programs and courses as well as the very principles in this
         document.

Rationale for OWI Principle 15

    Emerging from the CCCC OWI Committee's work is a repeatedly articulat-
ed need for professional development in the area of OWI and OWLs (see OWI
Principle 12 and OWI Principle 14). To be sure, there is urgent need to educate
the writing community on OWI and OWLs and to help direct the teaching and
learning of our students with what is known about state of the art and effective
practices. Advances in OWI and OWLs should be grounded in valid and reliable
research findings and systematic information dissemination. OWI and OWLs
are particularly well positioned as sites of ongoing research in that almost all
interactions are saved and archived (e.g., via email, platform communication,
online group discussion, writing revisions), enabling empirical analysis.

    Therefore, to bolster the theoretical and pedagogical frameworks for OWI
and OWLs, OWI and OWL administrators and teachers/tutors alike should be
committed to ongoing research of their courses, students, and programs. Such
research should draw directly from these courses, students, and programs when
appropriate. Such pedagogically driven research must be validated both by the
scholarly community and administrators in composition studies. Empirical, re-
peatable, and longitudinal research that addresses questions regarding the phe-
nomena of OWI and OWLs will drive a deeper understanding of OWI and
OWLs, ultimately benefiting students and the teaching and learning of writing
in online contexts. Both qualitative and quantitative methodological designs can
be employed to address key questions surrounding OWI and OWL outcomes,
processes, and participant perspectives.

Discussion

    We simply do not know enough about OWI, OWCs, OWLs, and all the
ways that students learn and fail to learn to write through digital technologies.
That is the point of OWI Principle 15, which is addressed in great depth in
Chapter 17. The ongoing need for research also is addressed to some degree in
the rest of the chapters in this book. The research conducted by the CCCC OWI
Committee in support of developing these 15 OWI principles and their example
effective practices offers a beginning. Without additional research, however, as
education moves more firmly into the digital arena, our collective gut feelings,
anecdotal experiences, and guesses will not be enough. The CCCC OWI Com-
mittee's annotated bibliography and the research gathered for various CompPile

92

documents (see Warnock, 2013, for example) help us to learn and understand
OWI more. Inclusivity and accessibility concerns are among the least well-un-
derstood of all OWI issues. Mainstream students are more often studied than
those with physical, learning, multilingual, or socioeconomic challenges. Neces-
sary research would examine student writers with such concerns to improve and
advance our understanding of OWI teaching and learning overall, as well as to
better enable OWI access to all students who want or need it.

    Clearly, a new generation of research is necessary. OWI Principle 15 urges
scholars and educators to address that need.

NOTES

1. There are differences between the pedagogical aspects and the institutional/ad-
ministrative aspects of how writing courses are delivered. When is homework just
homework, and when does that work constitute a hybrid experience? Does hybrid
always mean digital, out-of-class experiences? As we completed this book, we real-
ized that the definitions and terminology inherent to our work likely will need to
undergo some change to better depict what is happening in OWCs across various
institutional contexts.

2. The OWI Committee expects to reconsider and revise as needed the particulars
of A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI trienni-
ally.

3. Multilingual learners are not conflated here with students who have disabilities
although some certainly may have such needs. On the contrary, their needs stem
primarily from linguistic and cultural concerns that may inhibit their learning in
online environments. Similarly, students from impoverished or "different" socio-
economic backgrounds require an inclusive setting that recognizes their challenges
in OWI.

4. "FO" is shorthand for "Fully Online" as opposed to "H" for "Hybrid" survey
respondents. "Q" indicates "question."

5. In the CCCC OWI survey of fully-online faculty and administrators, respon-
dents rated their need for advanced Web design skills at 20% in comparison with,
for example, the ability to respond to student needs in a timely manner at 100%
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 36). In the survey regarding hybrid OWI,
they rated advanced Web design skills at 22% (p. 65). For both cases, these ratings
were the lowest and revealed that instructors were less concerned with technolog-
ical proficiency than with other aspects of composition instruction. These results
also may reflect who institutions hire to teach writing, the limited scope some
teachers bring to writing instruction, and the limited preparation they receive to
teach writing.

                                                                                                  93

6. Semantic Integrity theory indicates that the teacher's message is written in a
straightforward, linguistically direct manner and that it matches her intention and
that the intention can be read and correctly interpreted by the average student.

uted workplace other than tutoring (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d, p. 21).

HYBRID AND FULLY ONLINE OWI

      Jason Snart
      College of DuPage

        This chapter outlines key similarities and differences between hybrid and
        fully online writing instruction. Both instructional settings offer challeng-
        es and opportunities and neither is necessarily preferable to the other in
        all circumstances. Nor should these instructional settings be understood
        as mere variants of the imagined norm of fully face-to-face instruction. In
        fact, creating and delivering effective writing classes requires grounding
        in basic principles of sound pedagogy regardless of instructional setting.

        Keywords: accessibility, blended, fully online, hybrid, institutional plan-
        ning, instructional design, instructional setting, marketing, professional
        development, scheduling, student engagement, student success, student
        support

    Early in my teaching career, I had a situation that highlighted some of the
perils of teaching a hybrid FYW course. It was final exam week, and I was head-
ed to the classroom where my hybrid composition class was scheduled to take
its final exam, an in-class reflective essay. Lo and behold, the room was already
occupied by another class taking its final exam. My students were waiting ner-
vously in the hallway. I started to get nervous, too. I double-checked the exam
schedule and, yes, this was where we were supposed to be. We were a Tuesday/
Thursday class and this room was where we were to meet for our final exam and
this was the right time... . Now what? Luckily, there was an available room not
too far away, so my students and I moved there and they wrote their essays.

    Later, I tried to figure out the mix up. Were two classes accidentally sched-
uled into the same room at the same time during finals week? I reread the final
exam schedule and this time saw when our final was supposed to have occurred.
I realized that the error was mine and that it was a revealing one.

    I had mistakenly assumed that my FYW class, a hybrid that met face-to-face
on Tuesday but not on Thursday, would still be treated as a "Tuesday/Thurs-
day" class for final exam scheduling purposes. Despite everything I thought I
knew about effective hybrid course design, I still basically understood my class
as a Tuesday/Thursday class that just did not meet face-to-face on Thursdays

Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

throughout the term. For some reason, I seemed to have thought of my course
as just a variation, maybe even a deficit model, of face-to-face instruction since
it "skipped" a part of its physical meeting time every week. The result was that I
instructed the class to meet in the wrong room for the exam.

    It is hard to pinpoint exactly where or how this notion arose for me. As for
many writing teachers, it may have emerged from a lack of institutional support
for hybrid learning, at least in its earliest existence at my campus, in the form of
professional development opportunities and cross- or inter-disciplinary conver-
sations. Interestingly, in order to teach a hybrid course at my institution, faculty
must complete an administrative form. The first question asks for a descriptive
paragraph indicating "the differences between the traditional format offering of
this course and the proposed hybrid format" ("Request to Teach Hybrid De-
livery Course"). Why did this form not ask simply for a descriptive paragraph
about the "proposed hybrid format"? Why was the hybrid positioned immedi-
ately as a variant?

    While the language on the form may not be ideal, some sort of admin-
istrative process for distinguishing the hybrid course certainly was important
because it ideally ensured that the course would be identified as hybrid in the
registration system, enabling students to know (and choose) the course setting
in advance. Additionally, faculty certainly had to think about course design at
some point, and doing so at the outset has its advantages. My point, however,
is that the hybrid proposal form positioned the hybrid setting only relative to
the traditional, onsite course setting, inviting faculty to think about the hybrid
OWC as relational alone. In considering my mistake with the hybrid course's
final exam, I simply may have lost sight of the fact that my hybrid OWC could
be--even needed to be--understood as in a unique setting and not just relative
to an established or implicitly normative instructional setting.

    As I have studied hybrid learning and now become its spokesperson for
the CCCC OWI Committee (Snart, 2010), I realized that a hybrid is its own
unique kind of course. It is not face-to-face learning with a piece missing--not
a deficit model. Nor is it a "class and a half," with all the instructional material
I normally would present face-to-face, somehow compressed into half the time,
in addition to an online component.1 Similarly, a fully online OWC is not just
a digital mirror of the traditional onsite course. Both the hybrid and fully online
OWCs are as unique to their electronically mediated environments as they are
similar to what many experienced teachers still consider the norm of a brick-
and-mortar classroom.

    This chapter addresses hybrid (sometimes called blended) and fully online
educational environments as course settings both in terms of what they share in
common and how they differ. Foundational Practices of Online Writing Instruc-

tion is explicitly about teaching writing in the online setting, which of course is
where the hybrid and fully online settings implicitly are most alike. The hybrid
OWC, however, is a balance of onsite and online environment and pedagogical
strategies in nuanced ways. This chapter therefore gives hybrid OWCs more ex-
plicit consideration as a primary way of addressing the similarities and differenc-
es. In particular, I emphasize access, seat time, course organization, and course
design, especially in terms of engaging students and allowing for both students
and instructors to become invested and to see learning, fully online or otherwise,
as at least to some degree a personality driven endeavor rather than an isolated,
mechanical set of tasks to be completed.

HYBRID AND FULLY-ONLINE OWCS

    For the purposes of this book, the term hybrid describes an environment
where traditional, face-to-face instruction is combined with either distance-based
or onsite computer-mediated settings. Sometimes, hybrid courses are conduct-
ed through computer-mediation while face-to-face in an onsite computer lab
(Hewett, 2013, p. 197; see also Chapter 1). This definition of hybrid course
settings allows for the wide variety of ways in which instructional settings can
be combined in the hybrid format. A fully online course setting describes classes
with no onsite, face-to-face components. It occurs completely "online and at-a-
distance through an Internet or an intranet"; students can connect to the course
from short distances such as the campus or longer geographic distances such as
across national or international borders (p. 196). When inclusivity and equita-
ble access are factored into the equation, fully online instruction may make use
of--while not requiring--alternative communicative venues such as the phone
or onsite conferences (when geographically possible and amenable to both stu-
dent and teacher).

    I often hear from colleagues that institutions considering moving their cur-
ricula online will envision a face-to-face course that might become a hybrid class
that might then become a fully online class. Although each of these courses will
share something in common given that they ostensibly cover the same material,
to imagine instructional settings as mere variations of one another is unlikely to
produce either good hybrid or good fully online OWCs. Scott Warnock (2009)
noted that some teachers may be able to "view [their] move into the online
teaching environment as a progression that will begin with teaching a hybrid
first" (p. 12). Yet, even though hybrid instruction may appear to be a middle
ground or even a step between tradition and fully online instruction, such a per-
spective misses the nuances and challenges of hybrid learning for OWI as well
as the need to design both hybrid and fully online OWCs with the instructional

                                                                                                 101
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

setting in mind from the ground up.
    Finally, because hybrid and fully online OWI already occur in higher edu-

cation, their potentially effective practices need to be addressed. In other words,
this chapter will not debate the merits of hybrid and fully online OWI in terms
of whether they should or should not exist at all. To be sure, this debate is hardly
settled; a 2013 Inside Higher Ed survey of faculty attitudes toward online learn-
ing indicated that fewer than half of those surveyed believe that online courses
are as effective as face-to-face courses (Lederman & Jaschik, 2013). Nonetheless,
to debate the value of instructional settings that already are a mainstay at many
institutions does not seem productive, as the CCCC OWI Committee observed
in The State of the Art of OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 2).

Similarities between Hybrid and Fully Online OWCs

    Hybrid and fully online OWCs are similar in that they both involve in-
structional time mediated by technology. Even though a hybrid OWC meets at
least part of the time in a traditional face-to-face setting, it uses the electronic
environment for similar activities and teaching purposes. In both settings, the
computer or other devices are used for such activities as:

    · Word processing
    · Paper submission and reposting to the student
    · Peer review activities
    · Discussion forums
    · Journal and other writing
    · One-to-one and one-to-group/class communications such as instant

        messages, email, and message board2 postings
    · Wiki/collaborative writing development

    Chapter 4 particularly enumerates some of these activities as pedagogical
strategies for writing instruction.

    In the fully online setting, which remains new to many students and teach-
ers, activities typically occur asynchronously, making time one of the key dis-
tinctions of fully online OWCs from both hybrid and traditional learning (see
Chapter 3 for a discussion of asychronicity and synchronicity). Both teachers
and students need to learn to use the technology for activities that they previ-
ously have experienced as synchronous, oral, and aural. Thus, writing becomes a
way of speaking and reading a way of listening (Hewett, 2010, 2015a, 2015b),
which means that the literacy load increases exponentially (Griffin & Mint-
er, 2013; Hewett, 2015a) leading potentially to stronger writing skills through
sheer amount of text as well as focused communicative effort and, of course,
attempting to meet course goals (Barker & Kemp, 1990; Palmquist, 1993). In a

hybrid setting, on the other hand, some unique concerns arise--consequently,
my focus on the differences among hybrid, fully online, and face-to-face learn-
ing in this chapter. Many of the issues that arise for hybrid learning are pertinent
to fully online OWCs, but hybrid OWI also involves a balance with traditional
writing instruction that fully online instruction does not.

Differences between Hybrid and Fully Online OWCs

    The primary difference between hybrid and fully online OWCs, at least in
their most basic forms, is the degree of physical face-time, or seat time, involved
(see Table 2.1).

Table 2.1. Primary differences between hybrid and fully online OWCs

Hybrid Writing Course                          Fully Online Writing Course
Some face-to-face classroom interaction        No face-to-face classroom interaction
Some distance-based online learning as deter-  Completely distance-based online learning
mined by institutional needs

    This distinction of face-time may seem elementary, but it is essential. Edu-
cators need to understand hybrid and fully online course settings as unique be-
cause, from a design perspective, no instructional setting should be understood
as so much a version or variation of another that the job of the instructional de-
signer or teacher is simply to migrate learning materials from one setting to the
other. Indeed, given the potential dilemma of trying to see instructional settings
as both deeply related but necessarily unique, two key OWI principles should
be coordinated. OWI Principle 3 stated that "appropriate composition teaching/
learning strategies should be developed for the unique features of the online
instructional environment" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013, p. 12). OWI Prin-
ciple 4, on the other hand--and seemingly contradictorily--indicated that "ap-
propriate onsite composition theories, pedagogies, and strategies should be mi-
grated and adapted to the online instructional environment" (p. 14). As Chapter
1 revealed, there remains a need to develop strategies and theories unique to the
online setting while using the most appropriate of current strategies developed
from traditional, onsite learning.

    Migration is a pedagogical approach that OWI Principle 4 acknowledges
and that Warnock (2009) advocated, yet migration alone may lead to poorly
designed courses and low teacher and student satisfaction. The notion of ad-
aptation is crucial to understanding the practicality behind OWI Principle 4.
Even where basic pedagogies can be applied across instructional settings, they
invariably will need to be adapted to suit the new context. Migration of strategies

                                                                                          103
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

and theories to either online setting necessitates adaptation because it ultimately
requires that the learning strategy or pedagogy be reimagined relative to what is
happening in a course as a whole. Although it may seem counterintuitive, such
is especially true for hybrid instruction, where onsite composition strategies are
transferred from the fully face-to-face instructional setting to one that includes
an onsite, face-to-face component but has an equally important online compo-
nent. In other words, just because a teaching strategy from an onsite, face-to-face
class is migrated into the face-to-face portion of a hybrid class does not mean
that that strategy will function equivalently in both settings. That teaching strat-
egy will bear a new relationship to what is going on around it.

    For example, I have often used a peer group technique in my fully onsite
composition classes in which students work in teams of three or four to develop
a set of relevant questions about a text we are reading. Although I transferred
this technique into my hybrid writing class, it exists differently in that setting. In
the fully onsite context, the questions that the students develop are then posed
orally, in real-time, to other student teams in the class. Oral discussion continues
as we narrow our set of questions to one or two key approaches for writing about
what we have read. In the hybrid setting, students take their group questions
from the oral portion of the class and then post them to their online discussion
board. All students then evaluate and respond to each group's questions using
writing. It is not until a later face-to-face class period that we return orally to
the initial questions that students developed in class and the response material
that has been generated online. Thus, the initial group activity exists in both
the face-to-face and hybrid iterations of the writing class, but it exists differently
because of how it interacts with other environmental elements in the course.
Transferring the same activity to a fully online course typically means that no
oral discussion occurs, making all discussion about the readings text-based, with
the activity occurring perhaps in two separate discussion forums. Students be-
come responsible for listening to their classmates through reading their remarks
and then for talking through written responses; the process can lead to thought-
ful discussions if well handled (Warnock, 2009), but the give-and-take of the
discussions differs considerably from that of the oral ones (Hewett, 2004-2005).
That said, because an LMS might offer synchronous conferencing, it is possible
(yet likely uncommon) to return some of the traditional oral discussion to the
process.

    One practical difference regarding how this activity functions concerns
the quality of the developed questions. Because students in the hybrid writing
course ultimately post their questions in text to a discussion board, those ques-
tions tend to be more refined and focused relative to what is generated and then
shared immediately in their real-time, face-to-face setting--the setting that they

104
                                                                                                           Snart

have in common with onsite courses. The quality of these initial questions has
implications for how students' writing process unfolds, since those in the hybrid
setting tend to start writing with questions that already are somewhat refined
and focused, as they might be in the fully online setting as well. In the fully
onsite setting, to achieve a similar quality of initial questions, one must build
writing time into the class meetings such that students can work textually, rather
than just orally, to refine the questions generated in the initial inquiry period.

    With this sense of migration as necessitating adaptation, educators can see
both the hybrid and fully online OWI settings as unique from the traditional
onsite one rather than as distortions of other instructional settings, transitional
steps from one setting to another, or somehow as lesser relatives of an imagined
norm. But even as unique instructional settings, both hybrid and fully online
OWI share the same need for grounding in solid pedagogy and effective prac-
tice, and in both cases educators will need to provide opportunities for student
engagement and success.

    Therefore, while certain onsite, face-to-face teaching and learning strategies
naturally will find their way into hybrid and fully online OWCs, OWI Principle
3 requires consideration (p. 12) as described in Chapter 1. New strategies may
require new theory to explain why and how they can work effectively in online
settings. Such strategies may include teaching students using a combination of
text and audio/video media and providing text in visually appealing (hence,
more readable) ways.

    Ultimately, some obvious differences between these two technologically en-
hanced teaching settings notwithstanding, they share the need to be grounded
in effective pedagogical practices, as described in the OWI principles. Further-
more, regardless of instructional setting, faculty need to be supported by their
institutions when working in either course setting. What makes for a success-
ful learning experience is not the technology or any particular personality type
working within a given setting, but rather accessible tools to engage students'
creativity and ingenuity and to help them realize an intellectual and emotional
presence in the learning environment, digital or otherwise.

NUANCES THAT DEFINE INSTRUCTIONAL SETTING

Institutional Definitions

    There can be many variables at work in defining the parameters of hybrid
and fully online OWCs, such that the relatively straightforward comparison
presented in Table 2.1 quickly becomes more nuanced with each variation pre-
senting new implications for design and teaching. For example, in some cases,

                                                                                                 105
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

institutions might require limited onsite meeting times in what they call ful-
ly online instruction to meet institutional desires or perceived needs. Students
might be required to take major tests or complete timed writing assignments in a
proctored environment, be it a campus testing center or other designated testing
site, for example. This scenario begs the question of exactly what is a fully online
setting, while it illustrates how policies designed for all online instruction may
not be universally applied and in some cases may be detrimental to the ways that
courses in certain disciplinary material, like OWI, can be taught.

    Many institutions have developed course classification guidelines such that a
course that is entirely distance-based is defined as fully online (although as indi-
cated earlier, in certain cases this setting might still require physical trips to cam-
pus, belying its classification as fully online). In the case of hybrid OWCs, there
always will be both a physical classroom component and an online component,
but the exact ways in which these two instructional settings are combined is de-
pendent on individual instructor choices and on institutional requirements that
mandate a minimum or maximum time for one instructional setting relative to
the other. A course that is predominantly face-to-face, but trades some limited
seat time for online work may be called Web-enhanced (or another equivalent
term), yet its needs are similar to the hybrid course.

    There being no single definition, the hybrid OWC appears to be the most
nuanced in terms of how it is defined and structured within various institu-
tions. One institution's hybrid course description read, "You will periodically
meet on campus for face-to-face course sessions with your instructors" (Kirtland
Community College, 2014). For another institution, the hybrid OWC was de-
fined a little more specifically: "at least 30% of the course content is delivered
through the Internet" (Ozarks Technical Community College, 2014). The "Hy-
brid Courses" website for the College of DuPage (2013) indicated that "hybrid
courses integrate 50 percent classroom instruction with 50 percent online learn-
ing." Unfortunately, even this description is not exact, as anybody who teaches
a Monday/Wednesday/Friday class in the hybrid format will realize, since that
type of class is unlikely to split classroom and online time fifty-fifty each week.
The Sloan Consortium defined a "blended" course--another term for the hy-
brid course--as one for which the online component comprises from 30% to
79% of a course (Allen, Seaman, & Garrett, 2010). Each of these definitions
leads to a somewhat different course setting where the oral and written features
of the course play out differently and uniquely.

    With increasingly accessible and usable technological affordances available to
higher education, there has grown a new diversity of instructional settings that
can be bundled within one course. There are fully online classes during which
students experience no physical face-to-face time with peers or their instructors.

Sometimes, though, fully online classes can involve a portion of class time that
is conducted online synchronously, so there is face-time but instead of being
physical, it is virtual. Such a synchronous online meeting requires that everyone
be able to attend the course at the same time and day of the week; it must be so
listed in the registration guide. Alternately, classes might be conducted entirely
face-to-face onsite while also meeting in a computer lab such that while all class
participants are physically together, in real-time, the class work occurs largely at
the computer: students write, research, or collaborate digitally, all while synchro-
nously, physically present. Still other classes might involve a mix of face-to-face
time in a classroom with computer lab time. And, in so-called traditional class-
rooms, students may be asked to work with and present to peers using the en-
hanced technology of networked, digital tools. Finally, as Chapter 16 explains,
mobile learning, which involves the use of handheld networked devices like
smartphones, is becoming a feasible reality in some instructional settings, which
means that teachers need to be aware of the kinds of hardware on which students
might be learning.3 It is hard to imagine what else might be on the horizon when
it comes to technology and teaching.

    Realistically, higher education institutions probably will not come to agree-
ment on precise definitions for various course settings. On a practical level, over-
ly standardized course setting definitions might cause institutions to lose the
ability to adapt course settings to their own unique needs. However, defining
course type clearly matters on several levels. Students who take classes at various
institutions would benefit from knowing whether a hybrid class at one campus
is roughly the same as a hybrid at another campus from which they might select
a course. Additionally, broadly standardized definitions may help policy-making
organizations across higher education speak to each other and to their member
constituents in consistent ways. Ideally, some level of standardization will hap-
pen at the institutional level as individual campuses develop and refine their
unique approaches to instructional design and delivery. Such standardization
would enable local faculty, who have direct contact with a particular body of
students, to have a voice at the table.

    Perhaps most important regarding course setting definitions, students should
be provided with as much information as possible about what a hybrid or fully
online writing class might entail before registering, which means that academic
advisors and counselors need to be fully versed in what these course types involve.
Student preparedness for any online setting is, according to OWI Principle 10,
an institutional responsibility primarily (p. 21). To this end, students should be
informed about course setting and its requirements as part of the registration
process. Many registration systems provide students with boiler plate language
describing a hybrid course as involving some face-time and some online time

                                                                                                 107

but offer no further specifics. Therefore, a student might register for three sep-
arate hybrid courses, each of which coordinates onsite and online instruction
differently, and each of which requires adjustments in the student's schedule and
work habits. Setting student expectations accurately and appropriately is one
way to help them avoid potentially unnecessary attrition or failure.

Access Issues

    Access concerns also play out in OWI with respect to how an OWC is de-
fined institutionally, making OWI Principle 1, which calls for inclusivity and
accessibility (p. 7), relevant to course description. Take the aforementioned fully
online course that requires any kind of onsite meetings. In the strictest sense of
the OWI environment, requiring onsite meetings means that the learning no
longer is fully online, and using this terminology not only may confuse stu-
dents and teachers but likely will limit access to some. For example, generally
it would be impossible for a geographically distributed student in Colorado to
attend a meeting at a Virginia institution in which she is enrolled as an online
student. An accessible OWC would not ask such travel of its students. Howev-
er, Texas is one state with state-mandated definitions for instructional settings,
and it defined a "fully distance education course" as, "A course which may have
mandatory face-to-face sessions totaling no more than 15 percent of the instruc-
tional time. Examples of face-to-face sessions include orientation, laboratory,
exam review, or an in-person test" (Texas Administrative Code, 2010, RULE
§4.257). Anecdotally, I have seen another interesting case occurring in Speech
Communications. Since the majority of a student's grade is based on speeches
delivered to the class, some programs have instituted a requirement that students
taking a fully online class must be prepared to come to campus periodically
throughout the term in order to speak in real-time in front of a live audience; it
is easy to imagine similar scenarios with Technical Communication, multimodal
writing, and even some FYW courses. Having online students record themselves
speaking and then supplying that file to an instructor presents a number of dif-
ficulties, not least being how to manage large video files. In any case, when fully
online classes are defined in this manner, they are neither one-hundred percent
online nor fully accessible, which detracts significantly from the nature and ben-
efits of a fully online course.

    Transparent advertising of the kind described above also is a basic access
issue. If students know that a particular course setting will require a certain
amount of virtual and physical time in a classroom relative to time online cours-
es, they can discern, self-disclose, and indicate necessary accommodations. Fur-
thermore, with a good understanding of the learning settings available to them,

108
                                                                           Snart

students can make informed decisions about which instructional setting best
suits their needs and abilities. Their decisions can help them to self-place into
appropriate course sections that take advantage of useful onsite and online af-
fordances. Without institutionally standardized language that defines various
course settings, advertising to students becomes difficult and many will find
themselves in classes that are not suited to their needs or abilities. I am frankly
and consistently surprised to discover how many students arrive to my hybrid
writing classes not knowing that the class is a hybrid and/or not knowing what
that term means generally or for their writing work specifically.

    In other cases, despite what the CCCC OWI Committee's effective practices
research indicates, some institutions may not have fully developed student re-
sources that are available online, including writing center/tutor (OWL), library,
or IT support. So students might enroll in a fully online OWC, but if they need
additional instructional or research support, or if they have basic IT issues, a trip
to campus might be required. Such a campus visit can be impossible for some
students; a lack of online support limits reasonable access to such resources as
suggested by OWI Principle 13 (p. 26). Note that OWI Principle 13 empha-
sized digital access as primary for online learners as opposed to being merely an
adjunct to it. How "online" is an online course for which most of the student
support is only available onsite at a campus setting?

    Table 2.2 illustrates the types of learning that might happen through digital
tools in different instructional settings. These varied tools have ramifications for
the socioeconomically challenged, for example. Given how education, and par-
ticularly writing instruction, has become increasingly technologized, the degree
to which students have equal technology access also is diversified. A Position
Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI indicated that
"learning challenges related to socioeconomic issues (i.e., often called the digital
divide where access is the primary issue) must be addressed in an OWI environ-
ment to the maximum degree" (p. 7). To this end, while I note differences and
similarities between hybrid and fully online OWI throughout this chapter, all
students should have equitable access to learning resources regardless of instruc-

                                                                           109
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

tional setting; therefore, students' learning needs, preferences, and general access
should inform decisions between hybrid and fully online course settings.

    Furthermore, educators always must ask the costs of such necessary resourc-
es. Literally, what is their cost? The New Media Consortium's Horizon Report
(2013) noted, for example, that "Tablets have gained traction in education be-
cause users can seamlessly load sets of apps and content of their choosing, mak-
ing the tablet itself a portable personalized learning environment" (p. 15). Who
buys the tablet? Who pays for the apps? Who provides the broadband Internet
connection? And who buys the new tablet three years later when the old one
is out of date? Indeed, while the digital divide might be shrinking, it has not
disappeared. A recent Pew Research Center report (Zickhur, 2012) indicated
that "While increased Internet adoption and the rise of mobile connectivity
have reduced many gaps in technology access over the past decade, for some
groups digital disparities still remain" (p. 1). Therefore, when thinking about
questions of technology and the role it plays in effective hybrid and fully online
writing instruction, we should not lose sight of educational equity and access to
resources. This one aspect of instructional design and delivery perhaps unites all
instructional settings.

Instructional Place and Time

    Consider also the effect that digital student support availability has on in-
structional design. For example, if there is little-to-no research support offered
online, to what degree can certain kinds of research or digital literacy projects
be included in a fully online OWC? Or, when those types of assignments are
included (since they are fundamental to many writing courses), how might lack
of fully online support services negatively affect those students who need such
support? Relative to OWI Principle 1, at-risk students or those in need of learn-
ing or technology accommodations are even more challenged in these cases (p.
7). Therefore, the assumption that a fully online course unfolds equally for all
students and that it does so entirely online does not always bear out, which re-
quires WPAs to consider its institution's resources and ability to support a fully
online OWC before signing up its first teachers and advertising it to students.

    Table 2.3 illustrates this challenge by presenting a range of contractually de-
fined course types in terms of instructional setting for the College of DuPage, a
two-year institution. From an instructional standpoint, teachers of writing need
such information to make important decisions about how to manage class time
and, in cases where multiple instructional settings are available for one course,
about what activities might work best in what setting. Conceivably, a writing
teacher could face a semester teaching just one course like FYW but be assigned

110
                                                                      Snart

a full load of four FYW classes in the form of one hybrid, one fully online,
one onsite, and one Web-enhanced class. This undesirable situation is possible
particularly for contingent faculty who teach at more than one institution (see
Chapter 7), and it deeply affects the preparation and performance of teachers
(and, subsequently, their students) faced with these differing settings.

Table 2.3. Course types defined by instructional setting(s) at the College of
DuPage

Course type   Instructional setting(s)
Onsite        Instruction is entirely classroom-based
Fully Online  Instruction is entirely distance-based
Hybrid        Instruction is at least fifty percent classroom-based
Web-enhanced  Instruction is at least ninety percent classroom-based

    In this example, despite the common FYW course, materials, and desired
outcomes, the four different settings lead essentially to four course prepara-
tions--even though this situation would purport to protect teachers from an
onerous number of separate course preparations. Consider the effect this variety
of instructional settings has on faculty working conditions. For example, my
contract stipulates that "class preparations for Faculty will normally be limited
to three (3)" (College of DuPage, 2012). Notice that this preparation limitation
is framed in terms of a "class," but with no acknowledgment of instructional set-
ting. So my English composition hybrid, English composition fully online, and
English composition in the onsite classroom are all counted as one preparation.
This unrealistic understanding of my job presents both challenge and disincen-
tive for those who wish to teach writing in a variety of course settings where
the material is delivered and addressed differently. In fact, as an extension of
OWI Principle 8, which argues that "online writing teachers should receive fair
and equitable compensation for their work" (p. 19), I would add that part of a
fair and equitable working environment should include institutional recognition
that a single class, taught in a variety of environments and/or formats must be
designed, taught, and managed--or prepped--differently.

Opportunities and Challenges of OWI Settings

    My early thinking about hybrids, as suggested in the anecdote that begins
this chapter, revealed my sense, and maybe my institution's sense, of hybrid
OWI as being somehow an alternative or distorted version of the traditional
instructional setting. This distortion colored how I initially designed a hybrid
OWC. Perhaps I unconsciously assumed that I should think in terms of a face-

                                                                      111
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

to-face course that fit instruction into one day a week, instead of the traditional
two, and then supplemented that face-to-face work with online material, ancillary
to the "real" work we did in the classroom. The result is that I probably did not
integrate well the various instructional settings involved in a hybrid OWC and
failed to position them as equals. Jay Caulfield (2011), a teacher of educational
psychology, admitted something similar in How to Design and Teach A Hybrid
Course: "For me, integrating the in-class and out-of-class teaching and learning
activities ... was the toughest to learn. Sometimes I still don't get it right, yet I
know it is an essential component of effective hybrid teaching" (p. 62).

    I first began designing and teaching hybrids in 2007. While I think my ear-
liest hybrid OWCs worked well, I simply was not able to see the hybrid setting
in any way but relational to an onsite course, which may be the most common
perspective. The final exam scheduling snafu that I described at the beginning of
this chapter is an example of the degree to which I had not yet fully understood
a hybrid course as existing as its own legitimate instructional setting. It also
illustrates how my understanding did not necessarily align with administrative
understandings of the hybrid setting. Indeed, neither was my thinking neces-
sarily coordinated in any meaningful way with any other instructors who were
designing and teaching hybrids.4 We may have talked about such things casually
and informally in hallway conversation, but there was no institutional mech-
anism to enable teachers who taught in the hybrid setting to meet and share
challenges and successes.

    Honoring the uniqueness of instructional settings is crucial to successfully
teaching both hybrid and fully online OWCs, and in this way they are similar:
Neither should be understood as an altered or deficit version of some other
instructional setting, even though onsite instruction seems continually to be up-
held as the standard of instruction and the normative measure to which all other
instructional settings should be compared and to which all other instructional
settings should aspire. Consider how often success, retention, and persistence
rates are compared across instructional settings, often with fully online instruc-
tion on the low end of these measures. Such apples-to-oranges comparisons miss
the important point that individual instructional settings come with their own
unique opportunities and challenges. Furthermore, the conditions under which
students register for classes can be vastly different depending on instructional
setting. In many cases, for example, the student who would not otherwise have
time to take an onsite class may register for that course online. In fact, students
who might not have seen themselves as college students or who are unprepared
for college work might take a fully online OWC, believing it to be easier than
the onsite version of the course. This situation can be a recipe for student failure
regardless of the quality and robustness of the course itself.

UNIQUE CONSIDERATIONS OF HYBRID OWI

Integration and Hybrid OWI

    Although this chapter focuses on the overall design and teaching challenges
and opportunities shared by both hybrid and fully online writing instruction,
one aspect of building a hybrid writing course is unique: integrating the face-
to-face and online instructional settings. I use it here as an example of designing
course time with OWI students to help readers understand the exigencies of
developing hybrid and fully online courses. Aycock et al. (2012) asserted that
"integration is the most important aspect of course re-design and because inte-
gration can be difficult and easily overlooked it is an aspect of course re-design
that is often taken much too lightly."

    In a hybrid course particularly, focus on integration needs to be intentional
and persistent, from the earliest design efforts to enacting daily teaching activi-
ties. Particularly challenging might be students' (mis)understanding about how
the hybrid setting operates, which is connected to the pervasive transactional
language that surrounds hybrid course definitions and descriptions and that of-
ten works against instructors who are trying to clarify for students precisely what
the hybrid setting entails. In other words, a hybrid often is defined as a course
type that trades, replaces, or exchanges one instructional setting for another.
For example, the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee Hybrid Learning web-
site (2013) reads, "`Hybrid' or `Blended' are names commonly used to describe
courses in which some traditional face-to-face `seat time' has been replaced by
online learning activities." Other institutional Web pages have used even more
explicitly transactional language, as in this example from Aiken Technical Col-
lege (2014): "A hybrid class trades about 50% of its traditional campus contact
hours for online work."5

    The College of DuPage (2013) provided a preferable definition in that it
is less transactional: "Hybrid courses integrate 50 percent classroom instruc-
tion with 50 percent online learning." Even though this definition is too nar-
row--because, as noted earlier, some hybrids will not divide instructional time
in a fifty-fifty split--it does focus productively on integration of instructional
settings, rather than exchangeability between them. Even so, students in my
hybrid classes often ask whether we trade classroom time for online time such
that the online work must be done on Friday, in a fifty-minute block, or when-
ever the onsite meeting otherwise would occur. Students typically need help
understanding that this block of learning time is integrated into a weekly plan
and that it occurs online, perhaps distributed in chunks throughout the week.
Furthermore, students and instructors alike are challenged by thinking in terms
of learning time, as though each week we need to do activities online that would

                                                                                                 113
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

equate in some precise way with the amount of time we would otherwise be
in the classroom. Indeed, this challenge is increased in the fully online setting
where typically the instruction occurs asynchronously and no specific time is
allotted to face-to-face meetings (see Chapter 3).

    The transactional language surrounding hybrids probably persists because
on some level instructors do need to imagine roughly how much work should
occur online so that a three credit course remains a three credit course whether
it exists in the hybrid or fully face-to-face instructional setting. The danger of
adding too much or too little work outside of the face-to-face meeting exists.
Beyond this need, any sense of a hybrid as a course type that trades instructional
time in one setting for another can paint the wrong picture of how the hybrid
actually works, as if a precise trade of fifty minutes per week of face-time for
online time should lead to an equal, discrete, fifty-minute activity regardless of
course setting.

Pedagogy and Hybrid OWI

    Consider this example of a straightforward hybrid OWC: A fifty-minute,
onsite writing class at University X meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The
equivalent hybrid OWC meets Monday and Wednesday in the traditional class-
room. The Friday session has various possibilities for instructional time. For in-
stance, it could meet in a computer classroom where the teacher and students see
each other face-to-face but use the computer terminals. Or, the hybrid nature
of the OWC means that the Friday time might be integrated as online learning
for which students complete the work independently. In either case, the setting
should be the same weekly so students can build the course structure into their
schedules, keeping them on track. The CCCC OWI Committee's The State of
the Art of OWI (2011c) indicated that time management is one of OWI students'
greatest challenges (p. 10). I stress to students that they should begin from week
one to organize their schedules and make allowance for sufficient time to com-
plete online work (which likely will need more than the fifty minutes they see
in the onsite class trade-off), in the same way that they block out time for when
they have to attend class in person. In fact, students taking fully online classes
should be encouraged similarly to block out time specifically for course work,
rather than letting it slide to the bottom of the to-do list, to be completed when
"everything else" is done.

    Although a weekly hybrid arrangement has some benefits, it is by no means
the only way to effectively organize learning time in the hybrid format. In some
cases, instructors might find it beneficial, and in keeping with their personal
teaching style and pedagogy, to meet face-to-face for longer periods during the

114
                                                                                                           Snart

course--multiple weeks in a row, for example--and then to transition to a lon-
ger phase of online time. This arrangement might work particularly well if one is
looking to integrate online writing conferences into a course. As Hewett (2010)
stated in The Online Writing Conference, "the one-to-one online conference is an
increasingly popular, vital, and viable way to teach writing" (p. xxii). Conduct-
ing such conferences online, rather than as part of the face-to-face component
of a hybrid course, helps to keep the dialogue between instructor and student
grounded in textual communication--a key component of the writing course it-
self.6 It also affords students the opportunity to manage their time more flexibly,
rather than being locked into blocks of onsite seat time. As writing instructors,
we may find that we need more time with students and their writing individually
rather than in the group classroom setting, especially as writing students take
concepts and strategies we have introduced in the classroom and begin to apply
them to produce their own, individual texts.

    In relatively short order, the straightforward weekly division of hybrid learn-
ing time can morph into any number of forms. Is there a guiding principle
regarding how much of a writing course should be conducted onsite and how
much should be online and for how long at a stretch in each instructional set-
ting? In a general sense, OWI Principle 5 provides important direction: Writ-
ing instructors "should retain reasonable control over their own content and/or
techniques for conveying, teaching, and assessing their students' writing in their
OWCs" (p. 15). In the case of teaching a hybrid OWC, OWI Principle 5 sug-
gested that the instructor should be making decisions about how to best arrange
instructional time. The hybrid design should not be automated by some kind of
institutional scheduling system in an effort to maximize classroom space usage
or haphazardly designed by a department chair or WPA who does not have a
developed understanding of OWI and hybrid learning, in particular.

    However, institutions may seek overly simplistic efficiencies by trying to cap-
italize on the hybrid learning model. Administrators may, for example, take two
hybrid classes that in their fully onsite formats would meet twice per week, and
pair them in a single classroom: Class A meets onsite Tuesday but not Thursday,
while class B meets onsite Thursday but not Tuesday. This kind of administrative
control over how a hybrid operates serves neither instructors nor students, nor
am I convinced that efficiencies of this kind could ever be achieved on a scale
that would have any measurable impact campus-wide. The degree to which fac-
ulty must give over curricular design to a centralized scheduling system in this
scenario ultimately is unacceptable, particularly in terms of course goals and
pedagogical strategies for meeting those goals. There is no one "right" division of
learning time in the hybrid setting since an ideal arrangement for one instructor
may not be ideal for another. Actually, the impact of hybrid design on student

                                                                                                 115
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

success is an area of much needed OWI-based composition research (see Chap-
ter 17). But in keeping with OWI Principle 5 (p. 15), arranging instructional
time should be within the instructor's curricular control, and as such can reflect
his or her individual teaching style, personality, and pedagogical approaches.

    Instructors wanting to explore how a hybrid writing course can be configured
to best serve the students, however, probably will have to navigate a number of
institutional constraints that potentially include mandates about exactly how a
hybrid class must divide its time. Further, the instructor may have to sell the idea
of a hybrid that does not divide its time on a weekly basis, in which case I advise
presenting one's case with particular reference to established, disciplinary effec-
tive practice where or if those practices exist. In many ways, A Position Statement
of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee,
2013), which is this book's genesis, provides an ideal framework within which
to situate individual teaching strategies.

    Take the case of a faculty member who notices that in dividing her class time
on a weekly basis, students are losing connection with their writing as process or
they are responsible for returning to their online writing work without having
accomplished much in a single weekly classroom session. Her students would
seem to benefit from an extended set of classroom meetings to learn writing
strategies in a real-time, onsite setting that allows for immediate interaction with
peers and with the instructor. Then, having learned some strategies for inven-
tion and organization, an extended period of individualized online conferencing
might seem most beneficial such that each student can apply material learned
from those classroom meetings to produce a polished piece of writing. Confer-
encing online provides both teacher and student the opportunity to talk about
the student's writing in writing, which can help students to clarify challenges
they are facing as they express those challenges in writing rather than verbally
(Hewett 2015b, 2010). A particular benefit of moving the learning online at
this point in a writing course is that instruction can become much more adap-
tive and individualized since the instructor is no longer trying to deal with all
her students as a group in the onsite setting. Rather, instruction can become
much more specific to each student's needs. In this example, therefore, the in-
structional time for one-to-three weeks might be onsite and face-to-face. Then,
the writing course would occur in a distance-based, online format for an equal
period, featuring some or all of the following: asynchronous and/or synchronous
online writing conferencing, online peer revision exchanges, and asynchronous
instructor feedback on student drafts as they unfold.

    Now let us extend this theoretical hybrid writing class design so that the
week of onsite face-to-face meetings becomes a month or even two. Perhaps
the hybrid writing class would meet every Tuesday and Thursday for the first

116
                                                                                                           Snart

half of a semester, just as a fully onsite writing course would (thus, requiring
available classrooms and seats for this configuration). Then, perhaps all the work
would be integrated to an online setting for the last half of the semester. This
configuration still represents a 50% face-to-face/online split, adhering to at least
the letter of the contractual law at the College of DuPage, for example. But will
such a hybrid arrangement be supported by the administration? In most cases,
this creative course design would be a hard sell in terms of seat space alone, but
also in those cases where administrators are skeptical of (even resistant to) what
are perceived to be "alternative" instructional settings. Like it or not, it will be
incumbent on the teaching faculty member to establish sound pedagogy as the
basis for dividing onsite and online time in the hybrid setting.

    Perhaps, ultimately, OWI Principle 6 provides the guiding principle here,
at least from the instructional perspective: "Alternative, self-paced, or experi-
mental OWI models should be subject to the same principles of pedagogical
soundness, teacher/designer preparation, and oversight detailed" in the position
statement document (pp. 16-17). While hybrid writing instruction should not
be understood as experimental or alternative, certain instructional designs that
coordinate online and face-to-face time in seemingly unconventional ways are
likely to be perceived as experimental or alternative. To that end, in Chapter 1,
Hewett explains that experimental OWI models especially need to be developed
and grounded by principles of rhetoric and composition. The instructor who
wants to be creative with hybrid writing course design may have to demonstrate
to administrators the sound pedagogy behind the design. But if the pedagogy is
sound, A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) supports the assertion that hybrid writing in-
struction could take a number of successful forms.

DESIGNING HYBRID AND FULLY ONLINE OWI

The Special Need for Organization in OWI

    Although effective organization of writing course content, assignments,
grading--everything that goes into teaching writing in any setting--is import-
ant when teaching fully face-to-face, something about the regularity of the on-
site meetings helps to make an onsite course feel unified and organized even
when instructors have made no special design choices in this regard. The onsite
instructional setting is probably the most natural for students and teachers in
that both teachers and students are most familiar with it, and a potential sense
of class continuity may emerge by virtue of that familiarity and the regular face-
to-face meetings. A natural sense of organizational structure is not necessarily

                                                                                                 117

the case for either hybrid or fully online writing instruction, so the next section
focuses on organizational strategies that can help both instructors and students
navigate an OWC successfully. It will not surprise readers that a well-organized
course is more likely to be effective than a poorly organized course, but such
organization is a basic necessity in both fully online and hybrid writing courses.
It is not something that will somehow take care of itself in either instruction-
al setting, and developing a well-organized online course requires consciously
thoughtful work on the instructor's part.

    Organization suggests that course objectives are laid out clearly on the LMS
and reiterated (repeated, as Warnock, 2009, and Hewett, 2015a suggested) in a
number of website pages throughout a syllabus and the course itself. A course di-
vided into units, modules, or weeks is likely to benefit from having each of those
divisions introduced with learning goals, ones clearly linked to general course ob-
jectives. Basic organization of this kind (ideally) will help students to understand
the why of what they are doing and, in turn, provide that important opportunity
for intellectual and emotional presence. I have too often heard students com-
plain about what they perceive to be busy-work in classes--including my own.
In such cases, typically I learned that I had not made transparent enough the unit
goals and how those were linked to course goals. For example, if we were writing
paragraphs instead of full essays or creating outlines before starting rough drafts,
it might have felt like busy-work disconnected from the supposedly real work of
writing that was to be the focus of the course because I had not done a good job
of connecting those activities to a bigger picture. Thoughtful course organization
that includes reiteration of course and unit goals throughout can help give stu-
dents a sense of why those small-scale activities are important.

    Figure 2.1 is a screenshot of what students see in the Blackboard LMS in
both my fully online and hybrid writing courses. Course and unit-specific goals
help students to understand how pieces of the course are related and how or why
materials are organized the way they are.

    As Figure 2.2 demonstrates, instructional units can be introduced with goals
that help to outline what activities will be taking place. These unit-level goals in
many cases can be tied back to course goals as a way of making course organiza-
tion transparent. In other words, student are invited to see how what they do in
an individual week, for example, is part of a larger overall structure.

    The goals shown in these figures are not groundbreaking nor are they exhaus-
tive for everything that we might cover in a given unit; indeed, some students
may not even read them or, upon reading them may not comprehend them suf-
ficiently (Hewett, 2015a). However, these statements provide the basic expected
outcomes for the course and, by the end of a given OWC, I hope my students
have done a lot more than accomplish the basic course objectives. Making these
goals clear and reiterating them for students throughout a fully online or hybrid
writing course can help to provide a sense of basic organization and purpose that
might be missing for some learners when they are not meeting weekly with the
same group of people in an onsite setting. These goals operate as textual remind-
ers of what we are doing and why, whereas in the onsite, face-to-face course, I
more likely would provide these reminders verbally in class.

    One particular element of organization that is specific to the hybrid OWC
is the coordination of the face-to-face and online instructional settings. In both
settings, students should feel connected to the course and should feel they are
participating in one, unified course whose onsite and online settings are equiv-
alent in importance. In other words, the hybrid writing instructor should avoid
giving students the sense that they are in a face-to-face class that is merely sup-
plemented by online materials. Similarly, the hybrid writing instructor should
create the course with such organizational unity that students do not feel that
they are participating in two related, but ultimately separate, courses: a face-to-
face course and a fully online course. Doing so can help prevent students from
experiencing such courses as more than the credit-load for which they signed up
(i.e., a three-credit course should not seem like a four-credit course just because

it is hybrid).
    In addition to stating course and unit-level learning goals as clearly and as

often as possible, another organizational strategy is to make sure that students
understand how the syllabus (which lists weekly course activities and assign-
ments) is coordinated with the course as it exists in the LMS. In my hybrid
OWCs that divide time weekly, for example, I label each unit in the course the
same way on the syllabus that is intended to be printed and that is designed for
online presentation (e.g., "Unit 1 - Introductions"). Within each unit on the
syllabus, I list days we will meet onsite and generally which readings or activities
we will be doing (without being too exhaustive); additionally, I always include,
in line with useful repetition, a reminder of the online component. Figure 2.3
provides a typical example.

                                                                                                           Snart

    When students then go into the LMS, they know to look for the "Units" area
of the course where they will find units that correspond with each of the units
identified in the syllabus. Figure 2.4 provides an example. Basic coordination be-
tween the course schedule as revealed in the syllabus and the online component
of the class helps students to see the two pieces of the class as connected rather
than as two distinct endeavors.

    Of course, the surface coordination that can be achieved through clear, re-
dundant labeling will be part of a much deeper integration of what is occurring
in the classroom and online. The work that students will find within each unit
reflects what we have discussed in class. Sometimes the work that students com-
plete online will then feed into what we cover in subsequent onsite meetings,
which for fully online courses has to be accomplished digitally as well. For exam-
ple, in the hybrid course, using student posts to online discussion boards as con-
versation starters for subsequent face-to-face discussion is an effective approach.
Classroom discussion does not have to start from scratch, nor does the instructor
have to put forward the first idea. Seeing their online work made present in the
classroom also helps students to see the mixed instructional settings of their hy-
brid class as deeply related. In fact, making virtual discussion into physical and
real-time onsite work also helps students to see themselves as members of a class
both online and face-to-face.

    Coordination between the online and face-to-face components of a hybrid
writing course can be demonstrated in many ways. In the end, a hybrid writing

course will, ideally, feel like one learning experience. Through good integration,
students will feel as present online as they do onsite.

Building Community

    The need for social presence is shared by both hybrid and fully online OWI.
By social presence, I mean the idea of people in a course together, even if that
togetherness is virtual and not physical. Addressing presence means creating op-
portunities for learner engagement on the intellectual and the emotional levels.
In other words, students are challenged, rewarded for creative thinking, and
have the opportunity to demonstrate competency in a variety of ways. Further-
more, students need the opportunity to care about what is going on in a course.
They ideally care about what they are doing but also what others are doing.
They, again ideally, believe that they are part of a group of learners engaging in
interesting and challenging material and they express a sense of pride in accom-
plishment. The course matters to them.

    The term "ideal" is relative since I am talking largely about OWC design.
That is, I am focused on what the instructor can control. Teachers can afford
opportunities to students who in best-case scenarios will take advantage of them.
But for whatever reason, some students will not take advantage of those oppor-
tunities or see the value in allowing themselves to be invested--intellectually or
emotionally--in any given learning opportunity. These situations are not in-
structional failures on the part of the teacher (and may not be infrastructural
failures of the LMS either). Writing teachers tend to provide well-organized and
interesting opportunities for learner engagement and they encourage that en-
gagement, but the teacher's work should not be judged on whether every single
student becomes intellectually or emotionally connected to one particular writ-
ing course because it is, in all likelihood, an impossibility. Hence, the notion of
"ideal" is just that--a generally unreachable goal of perfection.

    OWI Principle 11 called for "personalized and interpersonal communities"
(p. 23) to foster student success. Experience has shown that successful writing
instruction in both hybrid and fully online learning situations is most likely to
occur when instructors and students are given the opportunity to be present, to
realize that both teaching and learning are, as Warnock (2009) asserted, "per-
sonality-driven endeavors" (p. 179). In other words, learning writing online (or
in the traditional onsite setting, for that matter) should not be a solitary, passive
experience. A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for
OWI makes abundantly clear that teachers and students alike need to be sup-
ported in the endeavor to make learning to write in the hybrid and fully online
formats an engaging, challenging, and ultimately rewarding experience.

    Creating opportunities for presence is one of the most important design
guidelines for both hybrid and fully online OWI. In addition to scholarly re-
search in this area (see, for example, Picciano, 2001; Savery, 2005; Whithaus
& Neff, 2006), ultimately my personal experience as an educator causes me
to see presence as crucial across instructional settings. The need for presence is
grounded in OWI Principle 11, which stated, "Online writing teachers and their
institutions should develop personalized and interpersonal online communities
to foster student success" (p. 23).

    When instruction shifts to the fully online environment, whether in the con-
text of hybrid and fully online OWI, the learning situation can become isolating
and even alienating for some students. It may feel like a correspondence course:
each student works individually through material and communicates with a
virtual "grader" who remains faceless. Being present as a virtual instructor--
whether through photographs, text-based conversation, quirky posts, (Warnock,
2009), or personalized and problem-centered writing conferences and draft feed-
back (Hewett, 2010, 2015a, 2015b)--is an important part of building overall
student engagement and success.

    What happens when student and/or instructor presence is lacking in OWI?
Every online educator likely knows the answer to this question from experience:
Students are less likely to engage; they are prone to participate insufficiently in
the course; and, in the worst situations, they lose focus, fall behind and either
fail or withdraw. As Julia Stella and Michael Corry (2013) indicated, "Lack of
engagement can cause a student to become at risk for failing an online writ-
ing course." They cited studies suggesting that "exemplary" online educators are
those who challenge learners, affirm and encourage student effort, and who "let
students know they care about their progress in the course as well as their per-
sonal well-being" (2013) To do any of this, let alone all of it, OWC instructors
need to demonstrate presence in consciously purposeful ways. The hope is that
when students experience the presence of others in a class with them (virtually
or otherwise), they can feel supported in what they are doing.

    The CCCC OWI Committee's The State of the Art of OWI (2011c) report-
ed that writing teachers generally see writing as both a generative and a social
process. One respondent cited in the report said, "My online writing courses are
intensely social and collaborative--much more so than my face-to-face writing
courses. Students collaborate to produce texts" (p. 22). Educators surveyed for
this report also indicated that they viewed the "ability to establish a presence
online" as very important (76%) or important (23%), indicating the degree to
which OWI practitioners value being present for students (p. 90). These survey
respondents were speaking from their experiences and belief systems as OWC
instructors. Like them, my consistent experience has been that students who are

                                                                                                 123
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

familiar with each other work better together and are more engaged in what is
happening in a class, regardless of whether those students know each other (and
know me) online, onsite, or some combination of the two.

Goal-Based Design

    Effective hybrid and fully online OWC design often means taking what a
teacher already does well in a writing class and adapting activities and assign-
ments so that some or all of them occur online. Here is where the notion of
migrating content and practices meets the needs for conscious adaptation and
change for a different environment. However, as this chapter outlined earlier,
the hybrid and fully online settings also present the opportunity to completely
re-envision teaching and to start from the ground up, rather than thinking in re-
lational terms alone. An effective approach to hybrid and fully online OWC de-
sign that seeks to honor both the uniqueness of the instructional settings while
preserving what is already most effective about one's own teaching is to think in
terms of course goals and learning objectives: in other words, goal-based design.

    Ultimately, both using what is already available and starting fresh can work
together. Many instructors can name a classroom activity that seems to work
well for them. In such activities, students are engaged. Class time is enjoyable
for the instructor. And students produce good writing. But taking that particular
classroom activity and trying to migrate it verbatim to the online setting might
not be possible or advisable. The onsite and online instructional settings simply
are too different in many cases. To take advantage of a good onsite activity, it
is necessary to take a step backward and consider what course goal or objective
is achieved with it. Does the activity do a good job of getting students to think
critically or creatively? Does it get students attuned to nuances of language?
Does it get students actively working with sources and evaluating information
effectively? These are important course goals in many writing classes.

    Once an instructor has a sense of the goals that are being achieved effective-
ly in the onsite setting and of what seems endemic to the activities that foster
student success relative to those goals, he or she can begin course design from
the ground up. In other words, instructors are not obliged to work from a com-
pletely clean slate when it comes to designing a hybrid or fully online OWC,
but neither should they try to reconfigure every last classroom activity so that it
can exist online.

    For example, suppose that an instructor who typically teaches a fully onsite
writing course wants to spur students to generate ideas about a text. To achieve
this goal, she has her students work in groups for ten minutes at the start of class.
In designing a similar activity for the online setting, however, it is difficult--and

124
                                                                                                           Snart

likely unproductive--to try to duplicate the face-to-face brainstorming activity
by including a ten-minute chat-based synchronous session for her online stu-
dents. First, that amount of time is probably too short a time for students to
get situated online and to type meaningful ideas back and forth. Second, if the
brainstorming activity includes shifting to synchronous conferencing software,
there also is a likely time lag for getting students together; additionally, such
software--even if available on the LMS--may introduce potential technical
challenges (for both instructor and student) that can inhibit full participation
by everybody in class and that may not meet the access needs suggested by OWI
Principle 1 (p. 7). Indeed, although I have used Web-conferencing applications
successfully in my own courses, their use simply to reproduce as closely as pos-
sible what happens in the onsite, face-to-face environment seems more compli-
cated than necessary given what it is likely to achieve.

    Instead, while the goal of having her students brainstorm together remains,
the teacher would do well to change the activity. For example, students could be
asked to collaborate through an asynchronous discussion board or a group Wiki
located within the LMS. When multiplied across the various activities that are
developed for a writing course, the goal-based design approach likely will pro-
duce an online course that looks drastically different from an onsite, face-to-face
course--despite the fact that they share common basic learning goals.

    Aycock et al. (2008) suggested that "performative learning activities may be
best face-to-face" and "discursive learning activities may be best online" (p. 26).
Similarly, instructors might find in the case of hybrid writing course design, as
opposed to the fully online setting, that they ultimately think about which ac-
tivities work best online and which work best face-to-face. Here, "best" can be
quite subjective. Depending on a teacher's disposition and teaching style, he or
she might believe that discussion is a good face-to-face activity that benefits from
the dynamic, real-time give-and-take of classroom presence and non-verbal cues
to engage students' interest. By the same token, much can be said for discussion
enabled online, either asynchronously or synchronously. Especially with asyn-
chronous discussion, students who might not otherwise be eager to participate
in the face-to-face environment may be more at ease joining in, not to mention
that the instructor can see readily who has participated and who has not, which
can enable the teacher to draw out the students who fail to participate for what-
ever reasons. Additionally, asynchronous communication opportunities allow
students to discuss ideas informally among themselves, but, unlike an informal
oral discussion, students can reflect first about their contributions. They can
write, edit, revise, delete, and post, taking more time than would ever be feasible
in a real-time, oral situation.

    If there is any conventional lore-like wisdom regarding hybrid course design

                                                                                                 125
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

in particular, it is probably that writing-based activities occur best online and
that discussion-based activities occur best face-to-face. I would like to challenge
this wisdom, however, not necessarily by claiming the reverse, but by emphasiz-
ing that instructors can vary which activities they use in any instructional set-
ting. Variety is more useful than overly prescriptive approaches that dictate that
all activities of one kind or another always must occur in a given instructional
setting. To that end, thinking in terms of goals to be achieved is an important
step away from the sense that the job of the educator in the fully online and hy-
brid settings is somehow to duplicate, however imprecisely, exactly what occurs
in onsite teaching.

OWI SETTINGS ARE NOT ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY

    As described above, goal-based design asks writing instructors to take a broad
view of their teaching, and it inevitably leads to specific questions about the
technology involved. If instructors are not somehow trying to reproduce pre-
cisely online what happens onsite and they instead consider how learning goals
can be achieved in new ways, the question of which digital tools can be used
most effectively to achieve those goals inevitably will arise. Considering and
selecting technology and software is one of the most challenging tasks that OWI
teachers face. Especially regarding teaching writing online, educators often may
think that technology and pedagogy are in a tense relationship with one another.
Which comes first? And which ends up requiring the majority of our energy and
attention?

    Hewett (2013) argued that "to let the technology drive the educational ex-
perience" for OWI is ultimately to "abandon instructional authority to the tech-
nology" (p. 204). She recommended that instructors first examine course setting
(i.e., hybrid or fully online), pedagogical purpose (i.e., course type, genre, and
level), digital modality (i.e., asynchronicity versus synchronicity), the desired
media (i.e., text, voice, audio/video), and student audience (i.e., age, expecta-
tions, and capabilities, as well as physical disabilities, learning challenges, so-
cioeconomic backgrounds, and multilingual considerations) before considering
technology--available or desired. It is well and good for instructors to consider
technology last, yet the reality remains that technology may be what is most em-
phasized institutionally. Often, for example, professional training and support
for those desiring to teach hybrid or fully online OWCs (when such support
exists) come almost exclusively in the form of IT training: how to use the latest
tools in the LMS, how to master the gradebook, how to develop a test bank, and
so on (OWI Committee, 2011c).

    To be sure, it is hard to separate thinking about hybrid or fully online writ-

126
                                                                                                           Snart

ing instruction from technology, since what seems to differentiate these settings
from a fully onsite writing class is the technology. And, certainly, practical train-
ing in an LMS is crucial for teachers, but that is only one aspect of what training
needs to be, as OWI Principle 7 indicated (p. 17; see also Chapter 11). There
also must be ample discussion and training regarding the underlying pedagogy.
A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI provid-
ed important guidance in this regard in that it asserted the primacy of pedagogy
over technology. OWI Principle 2 stated, "An online writing course should focus
on writing and not on technology orientation or teaching students how to use
learning and other technologies." Furthermore, it said, "Unlike a digital rhetoric
course an OWC is not considered to be a place for stretching technological skills
as much as for becoming stronger writers in various selected genres" (p. 11).

    It is important for OWI teachers to have these OWI principles at their dis-
posal because so often we find ourselves being asked, explicitly or otherwise,
to be technology experts when we teach writing in the hybrid or fully online
settings. We also are asked routinely to make good writing instructional use of
LMSs or other institutionally supported technologies that are not well suited to
OWI because they were not designed with writing instruction in mind.

    Yet, while we always want to foreground the pedagogy of our work and not
technology, there really is no escaping the fact that OWI is mediated through
technology in ways that fully face-to-face writing instruction is not. In fact,
OWI Principle 13 asserted that "students should be prepared by the institution
and their teachers for the unique technological and pedagogical components of
OWI" (p. 26). Thus, while OWI Principle 2 indicated that the writing course is
not the place to teach technologies per se, the writing instructor, along with the
institution, retains some responsibilities for orienting and assisting students in
OWCs to use the technology for writing course purposes (p. 11). As many OWI
educators probably have discovered, regardless of the setting, a student who has
technical trouble tends to go to the teacher first for technology help--and with
complaints.

    The technology-pedagogy question is not an easy one to parse, even as in-
structors seek to emphasize pedagogy. For example, the Horizon Report (2013)
stated, "Adoption of progressive pedagogies ... is often enabled through the ex-
ploration of emerging technologies" (p. 10). However, the report also affirmed,
"Simply capitalizing on new technology is not enough ... new models [of educa-
tion] must use these tools and services to engage students on a deeper level" (p.
10). In some ways, these two statements encapsulate the tension many educators
experience between writing pedagogy and technology. Technology can enable,
and is sometimes necessary, in realizing creative new pedagogy. Yet, that tech-
nology left on its own, no matter how flashy, hyped, or slick, ultimately will fall

                                                                                                 127
Hybrid and Fully Online OWI

flat in its efforts to engage students. On the contrary, such technology is likely
to become a barrier to learning--a chore for students to use, a headache for in-
structors to troubleshoot--and in the end not worth the effort at all.

    As educators, especially those who teach writing using technology, we often
find ourselves trying to balance an interest in exploring new technology tools
with the need to ground the use of those tools in sound pedagogy. It is easy,
though often exhausting, to chase the latest technology trend as that final solu-
tion needed to solve teaching challenges. But technology is ephemeral. What
is here one semester is gone the next. To this end, pedagogy ultimately must
ground use of technology, as Hewett (2013) indicated.

    In addition to keeping OWI Principle 2 (p. 11) in mind, thinking about
design as framed by learning goals, as is discussed above, also can help avoid the
pitfall of techno-centrism into which hybrid and fully online writing instruction
can fall. A good design-based process might be:

   1. I have outlined a learning goal I would like to achieve.
   2. What online tool can I use to accomplish that goal?
   3. What barriers, if any, is that technology likely to produce?

    Alternatively, a technology-centered version of this same process might be:

   1. I have this technology tool.
   2. How can I make students use it online?
   3. Which of my learning goals might apply?

    In this latter scenario, the cart is before the horse, or, to use a more twen-
ty-first century version of the adage, it is a solution (the technology) in search of
a problem (the learning goal).

    Staying fundamentally goal- rather than technology-focused also can help
to mitigate a common assumption about students and technology, which is the
belief that since students (of all ages) often are familiar and savvy with certain
technologies for social networking--be it Facebook or their phones--they will
be equally savvy when it comes to using LMS digital tools in an OWC. In my
experience, students' facility in one digital environment is not a predictor of fa-
cility in a different one (see also Hewett, 2015a). I have seen little correlation,
in fact, between students' proclivity toward technology in their daily lives and
their ability to perform well within the digital piece of a writing course. In fact,
much of what writing teachers ask students to do online is precisely the opposite
of what they usually do online. As writing instructors, we might ask for students'
considered reflection about a reading, for example, and that they communicate
in language that has been carefully crafted and revised. What we receive may ap-
pear to be quickly written and off-the-cuff, which usually is appropriate for a text
message to a friend, but that writing style does not translate well into an OWC.

    In the end, though, as Hewett (2010) noted, "without adequate preparation
and understanding about OWI, educators do not control the most basic of their
online pedagogies; instead their teaching is mediated by the online environ-
ment" (p. 159). Instead of teaching with technology, instructors end up teach-
ing to technology, which is unlikely to benefit students and is almost certain to
exhaust educators.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    Certainly hybrid and fully online writing instruction are different in many
ways. But despite how different these instructional settings look on the sur-
face, they share fundamental design and effective practice realities in common.
Somewhat paradoxically, they share uniqueness in common. In other words, it is
important to think about each setting as its own, free-standing learning model.
Neither hybrid nor fully online writing instruction should be understood as a
modification of another instructional setting like classroom-based instruction.
As unique environments with countless possible configurations, the design of
effective hybrid and fully online OWCs should happen from the ground-up,
with attention to what learning objectives are to be met and with a focus on
pedagogy before technology.

    Furthermore, in both hybrid and online settings, teachers can work to cul-
tivate opportunities for presence for themselves and their students in order to
combat what Hewett called that "sense of aloneness" that can accompany OWI
(Chapter 1). As OWI Principle 11 (p. 23) asserted and Mick and Middlebrook
address in Chapter 3; "Online writing teachers and their institutions should
develop personalized and interpersonal online communities to foster student
success."

    In conclusion, let us return to Table 2.1, which presented hybrid and fully
online writing instruction as, at least on the surface, quite different. Here, let us
revise that table as Table 2.4 to present the similarities between the instructional
settings instead.

    Those who teach in either the hybrid or fully online environment would
benefit from the following recommendations:

    · Understand that educational settings are unique in that neither the hy-
        brid nor the fully online modality is a variant of some imagined norm or
        theoretical standard; yet each of these settings shares the need for ground-
        ing the OWC in effective pedagogy.

    · Highlight opportunities for students to be intellectually, socially, and
        emotionally present in face-to-face, hybrid, and fully online settings.

                                                                                                 129

Opportunities for interaction  Yes                   Yes

    · Emphasize core educational aims like critical and creative thinking equal-
        ly across educational settings, be they hybrid, fully online, or face-to-face.

    · Ground teaching in effective pedagogy and allow that pedagogy to guide
        instruction rather than letting technology dictate what does, or does not,
        happen in the class.

NOTES

1. Aycock et al. (2008) discussed the problem of hybrid courses sometimes becom-
ing "a course and a half " when teachers "take everything from the face-to-face course
and add online work on top" (p. 30).

2. Message boards also are commonly known as discussion boards; the authors in
this book use these terms interchangeably.

3. The New Media Consortium's Horizon Report (2011) noted:,"Mobiles continue
to merit close attention as an emerging technology for teaching and learning." See
also earlier works like Liz Kolb's (2008) Toys to tools: Connecting student cell phones
to education.

4. Since 2007, I have been part of many formal and informal professional develop-
ment opportunities at my institution related to hybrids as we look to inform the
various stakeholders across campus about what hybrids are, how they can work,
and how they need to be supported. In Spring of 2014, I offered an 8-week Teach-
ing and Learning Center workshop on campus (delivered as a hybrid, of course),
which marked an important step on the institutional level to facilitate good hybrid
course design, delivery, and administrative support going forward.

5. I unfortunately used such transactional language throughout Hybrid Learning:
The Perils and Promise of Blending Online and Face-to-face Instruction in Higher Ed-
ucation (2010). This oversight reminds me of how much I am continuing to learn
about designing, teaching, and even talking about hybrid courses, as well as how
embedded this transactional language is within our academic culture.

6. Hewett (2010) noted, "Teaching through text is the essence of teaching in on-
line settings" (p. 161). This premise is threaded throughout Hewett's work, includ-

ASYNCHRONOUS AND
SYNCHRONOUS MODALITIES

        Along with formulating specific, observable, and measurable learner out-
        comes, one of the basic decisions that OWI administrators and instructors
        must confront involves course design and delivery, and more specifically,
        choosing from among the many tools and techniques available for OWI.
        That decision-making process inevitably requires managing the questions
        of digital modality: when, why, and how to deploy asynchronous (non-re-
        al time) and synchronous (real time and near-real time) modalities. This
        chapter addresses those questions along with the dimensions of inclusivity
        and accessibility, technical viability and support, and pedagogical ratio-
        nale.

        Keywords: accessibility, asynchronous, impact, inclusivity, modality/ies,
        near-real time, non-real time, pace, permanence, scale, social presence,
        synchronous, technical viability

    There are the two digital modalities through which OWI is conducted, the
asynchronous and the synchronous. Sometimes one modality alone is used and
sometimes they are mixed. This chapter addresses the digital modalities used in
both hybrid and fully online OWI settings described in Chapter 2.

    Asynchronicity occurs in a different time setting in that interactions occur
with a time lag between and among them. Participants can be geographically
distributed or even in the same room, but if they interact in "non-real time,"
their communication and work is asynchronous. Almost all writing instructors
already engage in asynchronous instructional practices when they post course
materials to an LMS or respond to individual student emails. Asynchronous
OWCs typically enable teachers and students to interact over a longer period of
time such as, for example, two days or a week, and they provide wide latitude

Asynchronous and Synchronous Modalities

with scheduling coursework and interactions. They use such media as text, im-
ages, recorded audio, and recorded audio/video.

    Synchronicity, on the other hand, occurs in the "same time" setting in that
interactions transpire without a time lag in "real time" or with a very short one in
"near-real time" (indicating a very short time between interactions as with text-
based instant messaging [IM] or short-message service [SMS]). Again, partici-
pants can be geographically distributed or located in the same room. Synchro-
nous OWCs typically require teachers and students to be communicating with
immediacy, and they must meet at a particular scheduled time for the activity
to be genuinely synchronous and equally accessible to all in the course, much
as in a traditional onsite course setting. They use such media as text and live au-
dio/video where the participants talk and see each other in real time. However,
synchronous OWCs typically also take advantage of asynchronous media for
distributing and collecting assignments, providing content, and requiring text-
based discussions (Hewett, 2013).

    The scholarly literature suggests that successful online teaching and learning
are facilitated by "high authenticity ... , high interactivity, and high collabora-
tion" (D'Agustino, 2012, p. 148). These components are especially salient in
OWI, where vibrant virtual writing communities must thrive in order to meet
the requirements of all students for timely and effective feedback together with
a sense of real audience, regardless of participant differences in cognition or per-
sonality. Phrased another way, in addition to formulating specific, observable,
and measurable learner outcomes, when it comes to course construction and im-
plementation, the question that OWI decision makers should ask is not whether
either the asynchronous or synchronous option is intrinsically better but rather,
as Stefan Hrastinski (2008) stated, "when, why, and how" to deploy both (p.
52). In order to address those deployment questions, this chapter examines the
discrete and combined implications of asynchronous and synchronous modali-
ties in the domain of OWI. In so doing, the most relevant OWI principles serve
as framing devices and instruments of analysis.

MODALITY OPTIONS, EXPECTATIONS, AND RESOURCES

    To set the stage for making informed choices in OWI, we begin with a brief
delineation of asynchronous and synchronous modalities in terms of the media
and tools they typically use.1

    Commonly used tools for the asynchronous modality include email, discus-
sion boards, blogs, Wikis, social networking sites, e-lists, and streaming audio
or video. Among the frequently identified advantages of using asynchronous
technology in OWI are (1) higher levels of temporal flexibility, (2) increased

cognitive participation because of the time allowance for amplified reflection,
(3) higher potential to use the increased allowable time for processing informa-
tion, (4) multiple opportunities to write and read, and (5) the existence of an
archival record for transactions conducted in the environment. Yet, asynchro-
nous platforms lack immediacy and thus may contribute to a sense of partici-
pant isolation, or what the online education literature would call loss of social
presence. Asynchronous pedagogy includes asking students to read the syllabus,
assignments, and content for the OWC--in their own timeframe and at their
own speed. Students also are asked to write their thinking out in whole-class and
peer-group discussions that teachers will read and, hopefully, to which teach-
ers also will respond. Teacher-to-student conferences about the course or as re-
sponse to written papers tend to happen asynchronously, requiring teachers to
construct readable and cogent text and requiring students to read with care to
understand the messages (Hewett, 2015a, 2015b). Both students and teachers
must go online fairly often to interact; instructors may need to go online more
often given their responsibilities to read texts from and write texts for multiple
students.

    Synchronous tools, by contrast, involve media relative to meeting concur-
rently through text and voice (i.e., live chat), live document sharing, live audio
or video conferencing (both one-to-one and one-to-group), meetings in virtual
worlds, and white board sharing. Some synchronous work can occur through
the institution's LMS depending on its built-in capabilities, but sometimes out-
side software are brought to the classroom for this work. Synchronous media's
primary advantage typically is identified as interpersonal rather than cognitive,
ostensibly owing to participants' feelings of intimacy and real-time engagement,
which tend to be associated with student satisfaction, student learning, and low-
er rates of attrition. Such synchronous interactions can help to avoid miscom-
munications and to address problems when miscommunication has occurred.
Nevertheless, synchronous media can create significant scheduling challenges
particularly if the teacher wants to speak with the entire class, but even for one-
to-one interactions. Additionally, synchronous media/software can be costly and
may require significant bandwidth to be efficient and effective. Relative to OWI
Principle 1 (p. 11), they may be challenging to provide in terms of student
access unless the LMS offers the necessary accessible portals; even then, some
students will not have the video or audio capacity using their home computers
and on-campus computer labs.

    Table 3.1 outlines some of the tools that the asynchronous and synchronous
modalities use in OWI settings. It is worth noting that asynchronous OWCs by
their nature typically take advantage only of asynchronous media while synchro-
nous OWCs may take advantage of both asynchronous and synchronous media.

                                                                                                 137

                                           Documents)
  Google Documents)

    Presently, asynchronous resources seem to be more widely used with on-
line learning, in large part because the implementation barriers are lower. Ac-
cording to empirical evidence, that preference apparently holds true for OWI,
but it seemingly varies with the selected tool. For instance, the fully online dis-
tance-based survey results gathered by the CCCC OWI Committee in 2011
indicated that 93.8% of the surveyed faculty relied on asynchronous discussion;
regarding the asynchronous tools used, however, only 10.1% employed blogs,
7.9% took advantage of Wikis, and 5.3% used social media sites, some of which
have synchronous affordances (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a). For the OWI
hybrid survey findings, the figures were 78% for asynchronous discussion, to-
gether with 13.9% for blogs, 10.3% for Wikis, and 3.5% for social networking
sites (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011b). Those survey data suggest that asyn-
chronous modalities are more frequently used in OWI, but not why. Possible
reasons include the general capabilities of most LMSs as they are configured for
higher education disciplines, which may be an issue of cost, and the degree to
which teachers value or are prepared to use asynchronous tools in their OWCs.
The potential for choosing and using one modality over or with the other is nu-
anced. In Preparing Educators for Online Writing Instruction, Beth L. Hewett and
Christa Ehmann (2004) observed that "asynchronous writing instruction looks
very familiar to instructors," in terms of their experience with providing writ-
ten response to student papers whereas "synchronous writing instruction can
be highly useful," yet "tricky in that it requires highly developed verbal teach-
ing skills and vocabulary about writing along with strategies for encouraging
students to commit to writing out their thinking" (pp. 116-117). A few years
later, Scott Warnock (2009) noted in Teaching Writing Online that "having an
asynchronous textual presence" is foundational in OWI (p. 2).

                                                                                     Mick and Middlebrook

    In the early stages of OWI course formulation, it is essential to consider
the ramifications of multiple variables, not the least of which are the choice
to use asynchronous and synchronous modes. To do so well requires closely
interrogating the expectations and resources of stakeholders in order to balance
practical and pedagogical concerns, with the key cohorts being students, in-
structors, WPAs, and relevant information technology representatives from the
institution. For instance, data gathering and discussions could help course de-
signers determine the feasibility and thus allocation of asynchronous and syn-
chronous tools. On this point it is worth noting that the CCCC OWI Commit-
tee's nationwide surveys (2011a & 2011b) indicated that many OWI teachers
inherited a course design or interface, while others worked to configure their
own course--typically within the confines of a previously selected LMS. Yet, in
the interests of outcomes, orientations and workshops could facilitate conver-
sations about pedagogical expectations and available resources. For example, if
instructors or WPAs think it is essential for students to share full drafts of their
papers while conversing about them in real time, but the IT personnel state
that campus infrastructure will not reliably support Web conferencing or that
students may not have such access, then text-based chat may become the nec-
essary synchronous platform of choice. This decision and others like it should
be reinforced by a clearly articulated rationale for how a modality enhances the
teaching of writing as well as how such a choice enhances access and inclusivity,
per OWI Principle 1 (p. 7).

    Selecting a modality for an OWC could be facilitated by surveying the stu-
dents as the course's primary audience. According to Janet C. Moore (2011),
Chief Knowledge Officer at the Sloan Consortium, "clear expectations help man-
age the volume and quality of interaction" that promote effective learning online
(p. 97). With that in mind, surveys could invite students to share information
about their own resources and levels of expertise that would assist in selecting an
institution's LMS or choosing between asynchronous and synchronous modal-
ities when creating an OWC, while sessions and materials that outline policies,
processes, rights, and responsibilities would provide a touchstone for support
before and throughout a course. Such training is entirely consistent with OWI
Principle 10, which stated that "students should be prepared by the institution
and their teachers for the unique technological and pedagogical components" of
online writing (p. 21). Taking all stakeholder groups into account, the following
are fundamental questions to help identify expectations and resources related to
choosing asynchronous and synchronous modes for teaching and learning writ-
ing online. Only after gathering and assessing this information can one make
solid decisions about specific media, tools, and online instructional techniques.

   1. Students: To what extent do you need technical assistance accessing asyn-

                                                                                                 139

       chronous materials from the institution's LMS? Do you own a computer
       camera and/or microphone for participating in synchronous chat, video,
       or audio exchanges? To what extent would you need additional access
       or technical assistance for participating fully in synchronous chat, video,
       or audio exchanges? Describe the technical profile of your primary and
       secondary connectivity sources. If you use assistive technology, please de-
       scribe what it is and what you know about its connectivity to the campus
       chat, audio, and video.
   2. Instructors: To what extent do you need technical assistance accessing
       asynchronous materials from the institution's LMS? Do you own or have
       available a computer camera and/or microphone for participating in syn-
       chronous chat, video, or audio exchanges? To what extent would you

INTERACTION AND COMMUNITY

    Chapters 1 and 2 made clear the importance of connectedness among par-
ticipants in an online writing environment. Connection, in fact, is at the core
of OWI Principle 11, which asserts the need to develop "personalized and inter-
personal online communities to foster student success" (p. 23). As scholars have
suggested, digital connectedness is correspondingly accompanied by challenges
(see, for example, DePew, Spangler, & Spiegel, 2013). However, with a teaching
focus on process and revision, writing instruction even in onsite environments
has always confronted the dynamic nature of knowledge construction through
alphabetic text, and writing instructors, therefore, bring a wealth of disciplinary
knowledge that can help inform community-building online. Indeed, the recent
focus on flipping the classroom for more interactivity and individualization is

a relatively old practice in writing pedagogy, and many writing faculty have
years of experience designing activities that enhance interaction; these activities
include group tasks that balance guided, scaffolded prompts with the need to al-
low for wandering and depth in discourse. Administrators responsible for OWI
training, then, would be well advised to foreground and tap into that existing
knowledge, as it will help instructors to make effective choices about how to
employ asynchronous and synchronous modalities that lead to online intercon-
nectedness, while emphasizing the pedagogical nature of such choices over mere
technological feasibility.

    Despite such experience, as reports amass documenting and sometimes
championing the swift shift toward online learning in higher education (Allen
& Seaman, 2013), instructors may experience uncertainty about their ability to
adjust to new modalities for delivery, and as a result, they may feel breathlessly
squeezed by this convergence. WPAs who shepherd OWI teachers from "face-
to-face" to hybrid or fully online environments not surprisingly may encounter
a range of attitudes and levels of preparation for that shift.

    Veteran writing faculty who express anxiety about moving to OWI should be
reassured that they already possess a foundational familiarity with asynchronous
and synchronous modes. By definition, face-to-face teaching is primarily syn-
chronous because onsite classroom activities happen in real time, and instructors
accordingly develop methods and preferences for managing such exchanges in-
formed by their training and course learning objectives. Such synchronicity and
onsite, face-to-face interactions are a significant part of hybrid OWI, as Jason
Snart discusses in Chapter 2. Beyond face-to-face interactions, digital synchro-
nicity also uses the common qualities of talk and turn-taking whether accom-
plished through oral talk or text-based chat. Moreover, these same instructors
use asynchronous communication increasingly often through their institution's
LMS to exchange such digital products as syllabi, assignment descriptions, es-
says, and assessments. This experience means that writing faculty can by default
follow the recommendation outlined in OWI Principle 4 that "appropriate on-
site theories, pedagogies, and strategies should be migrated and adapted to the
online instructional environment" (p. 14). The challenge is to transfer that expe-
rience with an awareness of the nuances of the online medium.

    On the other end of the spectrum, less-seasoned writing teachers might pos-
sess competence with asynchronous and synchronous digital technologies, yet
they may not have thought critically about how to transfer that aptitude for
teaching purposes. In this case, teachers with technological expertise run the risk
of assuming that students share that fluency and access. OWI administrators
might, as a precaution, require these teachers to articulate a clear rationale for
each technology they propose to use and to run an assessment that lists the risks

                                                                                                 141
Asynchronous and Synchronous Modalities

of those tools given the potential challenges to students, along with possible
adaptations and accommodations. The imperative to anticipate and thus avoid
frustrations over digital technology that can spread from instructors to stu-
dents--breeding discontent and distraction in online settings--is part of what
animates OWI Principle 7, which stated that "online writing teachers should
receive appropriate OWI-focused training, professional development, and as-
sessment for evaluation and promotion purposes" (p. 17). While it might not
be feasible to consider all potential challenges and solutions, thinking through
these possibilities will better prepare instructors for their online teaching duties.

    In considering challenges and solutions, OWI instructors would be well ad-
vised to consider the implications of shifting from asynchronous to synchronous
modalities or vice versa. Even when an LMS offers primarily asynchronous over
synchronous media, for example, it is possible to switch modalities in the inter-
est of assisting students, individually or collectively. For example, if a student is
in danger of failure or if she expresses uncertainty or frustration, the teacher can
connect with her synchronously via text (IM chat) on the LMS, in a Web confer-
ence using the LMS or free software, or with the telephone, which is accessible
to almost all students. Switching modality and/or medium enables reconnection
and forward movement. Considering when to reverse modalities or when to use
both modalities in order to meet different learning styles and objectives is proba-
bly the best way to prepare for all students to participate fully and fairly in online
coursework. Not only that, but instructors should work with their institutions
to compose documentation for novice student users of required course technol-
ogies; if, in so doing, they conclude that possible discomfort among students is
of a certain magnitude, the problematic tools should be abandoned for ones that
requires less knowledge or management.

    Kevin Eric DePew & Heather Lettner-Rust (2009) posited that if synchro-
nous communication is the default delivery mode in the onsite classroom, the
asynchronous mode plays that role online. They observed that historically, dis-
tance education was designed primarily to allow students to pace themselves,
asynchronously interacting with instructors through the postal service initially
and through digital tools more recently. But champions of distance education,
then and now, have sometimes been motivated by efficiencies and not pedagog-
ical value, and OWI stakeholders should be cautious of approaches that do not
align with the recommendations of such leaders in the field as the Sloan Con-
sortium. With that said, while the asynchronous modality is currently dominant
in OWI, a movement to develop more affordable, reliable, and efficacious syn-
chronous tools suggests that the latter could become a more significant feature
on the OWI landscape. Synchronous platforms may well offer new pedagogical
opportunities and challenges, which teachers and researchers should continue

to explore and research. This exploration is part of OWI Principle 3's message:
"Appropriate composition teaching/learning strategies should be developed for
the unique features of the online instructional environment" (p. 12). Neverthe-
less, mere access to tools should not be the guiding force in using them. On the
contrary, understanding the advantages and limitations of asynchronous and
synchronous resources for teaching writing is a sine qua non for OWI stakehold-
ers, who are the focus of the next section.

ACROSS THREE DIMENSIONS

    The emerging consensus regarding the choice of asynchronous and synchro-
nous modes is that neither is inherently better, but that they complement one
another and should be employed after considering the instructional and rhe-
torical situation of each activity in an OWC (Hewett, 2013). This observation
invokes the previously mentioned questions of when, why, and how to deploy
these modalities to advance OWI. The following discussion examines three di-
mensions across which asynchronous and synchronous options can be compared
to determine which are suited for a particular situation: inclusivity and accessi-
bility, technical viability and IT support, and pedagogical rationale. The order
is significant here for the first two are practical and must be addressed before
moving on to the third. To state the obvious, if students or instructors cannot
participate fully in the life of the course or if the technology sets up access road-
blocks the IT support cannot address, that course should be redesigned until
the obstructions are removed. Table 3.2 and the following discussion provide a
comparative overview given these dimensions.

Inclusivity and Accessibility

    OWI Principle 1 rightly declared that "online writing instruction should be
universally inclusive and accessible" (p. 7). This overarching need has profound
implications for course design and execution, and Section 3, "Practicing Inclu-
sivity," offers extensive theoretical and practical insight on the issue. In this chap-
ter, however, the emphasis is on inclusive and accessible design as a dimension
of asynchronous and synchronous modalities. Broadly speaking, asynchronous
approaches afford students time to use adaptive technologies that remediate
physical, cognitive, or linguistic challenges. For example, research suggests that
persons with Autism spectrum disorders might work best in such asynchronous
modes as email (Wyatt, 2012). Similarly, Hewett (2000, 1998) suggested that
students with audio-processing disorders might fare better in online, text-based
peer groups, while students with certain kinds of writing disabilities might

                                                                                                 143

Asynchronous and Synchronous Modalities

accomplish peer group work more efficiently and effectively in synchronous or
onsite settings. Likewise, in an especially text-rich setting like the asynchronous
modality where nearly all exchanges are text-based, students can benefit from
consistently reading and writing, but students with particular learning styles
may flounder when their reading or writing skills--although rightly challenged
by the mode--are weaker than needed (Hewett, 2015a). In such cases, real-time
talk may provide students with necessary relief and added capacity for under-
standing. Although researchers need to continue to research the access issues
related to asynchronous tools, there remains a potentially greater challenge in
reaching full and fair standards for OWI participation with synchronous op-
tions. The synchronous modality can provide a vehicle for meaningful student
involvement in OWI, such as oral discussion and real-time document sharing to
complement less dynamic textual interchange. This potential notwithstanding,
in terms of socio-economic stratification, to raise just one dynamic, the continu-
ing digital divide confirms that many students still have hardware, software, and
bandwidth impediments that make more advanced connections such as Web
conferencing difficult if not impossible for taking an OWC.

Technical Viability and IT Support

    The second dimension is technical viability and IT support, which resonates
with OWI Principle 2 that an "online writing course should focus on writing
and not on technology orientation or teaching students how to use learning and
other technologies" (p. 11). OWI Principle 13 also is relevant in stating the "stu-
dents should be provided support components through online/digital media as
a primary resource; they should have access to onsite support components as a
secondary set of resources" (p. 26). That is, course expectations and learning ob-
jectives need alignment to available infrastructure, with information technology
staff available to address students' and instructors' difficulties directly. This need
can be appreciated in the CCCC OWI Committee survey (2011a) of fully online
distance-based courses, where instructors named "technical problems" as one of
their most challenging areas. It is reasonable to conclude that robust asynchro-
nous and synchronous training and--in particular--IT support would free in-
structors to focus their priorities on teaching or tutoring writing. Even so, Hewett
and Ehmann (2004) noted that "asynchronous instruction tends to be less costly
and simpler to develop than synchronous instruction" (p. 69). With that under-
stood, the attempt to minimize expenses and technical problems may manifest in
the form of avoiding synchronous tools in the teaching and learning of writing
online, as these are typically associated with more technical problems--or at least
more panic-inducing problems. Yet, if time and experience are helping to address

146
                                                                                     Mick and Middlebrook

issues with asynchronous tools, the same will in all likelihood eventually arrive
for synchronous feature sets as well. Until then, WPAs or instructors seeking
to reduce uncertainties in OWI will probably continue to use well-established
asynchronous tools for the majority if not all of their course needs. Although
understandable, this represents a concern to the field if, as discussed in the next
section, there are pedagogical reasons for using both modalities.

Pedagogical Rationale

    Issues of inclusivity and accessibility together with technical viability and
support must be resolved in order for OWI to be successful. However, these
two dimensions will be of dramatically less consequence if OWI instructors and
administrators do not ascertain the pedagogical merits of asynchronous and syn-
chronous modalities. Below, therefore, are comparative analyses of those modes
according to four metrics: permanence, pace, scale, and impact.

Permanence

    As noted earlier, asynchronous communication entails the intermittent ex-
change between sender and receiver during which the receiver, at a time of his
or her choosing, actively retrieves the former's message to complete the com-
munication thread. Given the nature of asynchronous tools, in particular those
housed in a course LMS such as discussion boards, these interactions are more
likely to create an archived record of exchanges, which can be highly useful for
participants to refer to later. For instance, from the students' perspective, that
archive assists with essay revision by permitting a return to teacher, peer, and
tutor recommendations on an earlier version of the document. With regard to
OWI faculty, the record created through automatic saving and digital archiving
offers, among other things, information on student engagement with one an-
other as well as with the course materials, which may be pedagogically useful for
identifying outliers who are not fully invested in or perhaps are unclear about
the nature of course assignments and processes. While quantity of time spent is
no substitute for quality of time, and one cannot be certain that these measures
of quantity are precisely accurate, such elements do add information to an in-
structor's understanding of students' asynchronous performance.

    In contrast, synchronous communication can be defined as the near imme-
diate (with simultaneous potential), interactive exchange of messages between
sender and receiver. Not surprisingly, creating permanence in this mode is of-
ten far more complicated than in asynchronous discourse. Typically, participants
must turn on recording devices for synchronous exchanges and ought to have
the permission of all parties to do so since recording might not be the default

                                                                                                 147

setting. Furthermore, while some chat, whiteboard, and voice conferencing tools
have the option of recording, a challenge may be the generally large synchronous
file size that requires capture and storage capacity. If synchronous interactions in
OWI cannot be recorded, participants are obliged to rely on notes and memories,
which is the very method they would employ in an onsite classroom. What might
be gained from a technologically mediated synchronous interchange that facili-
tates robust, expressive interaction--complementing communicative intentions
through such kinetic acts as body gestures, facial reactions, and tone of voice--
could be offset by the inability to revisit these encounters for future review. That is
obviously consequential when, for example, it comes to feedback during an essay
writing invention session online. Analyzing recorded text-based chat in their class
on argumentation, Leena I. Laurinen and Miika J. Marttunen (2007) noted that
"chat debates in computerised [sic] learning environments can easily be stored,
which opens up a possibility for reflecting on debates later on, and students can
use them as source material for the further development of their ideas," such as by
using the text of the chat to create "argumentation diagrams" (p. 244).

Pace

    The conventional dynamic in asynchronous communication is, broadly
speaking, self-paced, thereby both accommodating learning differences and al-
lowing cognitive room for the careful construction and understanding of con-
tent. Pace represents a core affordance for online instructors of writing who
teach and assess a variety of written student products, for it gives students the
opportunity to draft and revise in ways that reflect their deepest understanding
of writing and rhetorical precepts. Whether the task is a two-hundred word post
at a course blog or a two-thousand word thesis-driven argument, the students'
asynchronous tempo for writing and talking through writing can be conducive
to thoughtfulness and polish.

    Regarding synchronous communication, on the other hand, pace is both its
strength and challenge. Hrastinski (2008) asserted that the synchronous mo-
dality is especially suited to secondary, lighter objectives, including "discussing
less complex issues, getting acquainted, and planning tasks" (p. 54), but he ex-
plained that students are nonetheless highly motivated to participate in syn-
chronous discussions because they know that responses happen rapidly. Hewett
(2006) and Hewett and Ehmann (2004) indicated differently that synchronous
conferences represent an ideal modality for discussing singular issues of impor-
tance like brainstorming an idea or taking a concept and working it into a thesis.

    Of course, synchronous interactions can be equated with "quick" responses
(Hrastinski, 2008), and such immediate responses are not always carefully con-
sidered. The OWI setting is no exception. Poorly prepared or unfiltered "knee-

148
                                                                                     Mick and Middlebrook

jerk" answers easily could diminish the value of a lively session on any facet
of the writing process. Pace is moderated by medium, as well. For example,
synchronous voice interactions are more quickly responsive than text-based IM
chat. The latter becomes threaded and convoluted even between two partici-
pants who think and type at different rates. With that said, many students who
have grown up immersed in online communication are likely to be at least famil-
iar with, if not thoroughly comfortable at, a synchronous pace, and instructors
should consider how those exchanges could be integrated into the class ecology.

Scale

    A seminal aspect of asynchronous modalities is that they allow instructors
the latitude to scale the provision of material to individuals, groups, or the whole
class. Simply stated, email and other documents are as readily delivered to one
student as to every student. Warnock (2009) described how years of experience
have led him to rely on asynchronous communication for its reliability and in-
clusivity, allowing even quieter students to be involved, in contrast to synchro-
nous discourse, which he describes as "fairly linear, almost always meaning that
not everyone can participate" (pp. 69-70).

    In comparison, perhaps the most restrictive aspect of synchronous resources
is the criterion of scalability. Just as large class size inhibits active participation by
all members in onsite settings, digital synchronous tools have an inherent ceiling
for authentic interaction. Instructional technologists, however, are playing with
the power of synchronicity in promising ways. Such play can be innovative, if
dicey for OWI, as one Coursera MOOC designed for a composition course
demonstrated.2 Its purpose was to offer a sense of simultaneity to its hundreds of
participants who nevertheless could not all interact with the instructor at once.
A strategy was to schedule live lectures that students could attend in real time
or watch recorded thereafter. This synchronous experience was one-directional
as students could not insert questions into the lecture; they could, however, join
in the course's chat-based discussion areas while watching the lecture. Another
synchronous experience for this group was a series of live video-conference writ-
ing workshops comprised of the instructor and a handful of students who were
selected from a pool of course applicants; the rest of the MOOC students could
watch the workshops live or recorded later. OWI Principle 15 calls for "ongoing
research" by administrators and teachers (p. 31), and that is very much needed if
synchronous options are to be made scalable for purposes of OWI.

Impact

    One of the most significant critiques of online learning is that too often nei-
ther instructors nor students indicate that they have forged satisfying relationships

                                                                                                 149
Asynchronous and Synchronous Modalities

with one another. In relation to this phenomenon, the CCCC OWI Committee
(2011a) found in its research that instructors in fully online distance-based cours-
es emphasized the importance of actively nurturing engagement with students,
noting that "courses do not run by themselves," but instead require careful atten-
tion to connection and community. The symptoms of low levels of impact are
clear in, among other ways, the high attrition rates associated with online courses
compared to their face-to-face or blended counterparts (Dziuban, Hartman, &
Moskal, 2004). Many scholars have addressed this issue, and it is the reason why
OWI Principle 11 asks instructors and their institutions to attend to the potential
associative power of online communities (p. 23). Asynchronous modalities can
and do contribute to the ties that bind course participants, in ways such as re-
flective blog postings shared in class space, member profiles, and open discussion
areas that invite more playfulness and self-sponsored participation (Kear, 2011).
Instructors, too, can and should perform "immediacy behaviors" (Arbaugh, 2001,
p. 43) by, for instance, stepping into student discussions at appropriate times to
confirm they, too, are part of that constitutive community.

    Even so, it is probably in the area of impact that synchronous resources hold
the greatest promise for shaping the quality of future OWI, as these platforms are
especially vital in helping to establish and sustain an immediacy of "social pres-
ence," a feeling among course participants that real people are connecting even
though they are geographically distributed. Synchronicity in OWI most naturally
echoes the call and response of face-to-face conversation and animates, according
to Hewett (2010), the "turn-taking, spontaneity, and relatively high degrees of
interactivity" that forge social connectedness (p. 25). In peer review, to cite one
example, a student-to-student chat can facilitate the critique through shared greet-
ings that personalize the activity and establish goodwill and camaraderie in a diffi-
cult task. Proponents and practitioners of OWI alike should take note that many
comprehensive strategies for developing deeper relationships in online courses
include some type of synchronous communication, whether it is through phone
calls, chat, or face-to-face meetings. Indeed, the CCCC OWI Committee (2011a)
survey of fully online courses found that faculty at every position level agreed
that "even with OWI, face-to-face interaction with students is important" (p. 8).
Thus, while synchronous communication might constitute a smaller percentage
of course time, it is nonetheless an integral component to developing a successful
pedagogical strategy in the online teaching and learning of writing.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    While asynchronous feature sets have been and currently remain dominant

150
                                                                                     Mick and Middlebrook

with regard to OWI course infrastructure, under certain conditions, the evolu-
tion of hardware and software makes synchronous platforms a desirable option
for particular OWI purposes (e.g., facilitating rapid conversational exchanges
that establish the social presence necessary for honest but encouraging peer writ-
ing workshops online). In the future, advances in bandwidth and increases in
access to greater connectivity are likely to make synchronous activities more
accessible to OWI teachers and students, but OWI instructors and administra-
tors still will need to assume responsibility for ensuring adequate access for all
students.

    Although the two modalities and their ability to be used separately or togeth-
er in an OWC may not change, the media and tools developed for asynchronous
and synchronous uses will continue to develop. To this end, the advantages of
differentiated instruction means that instructors should continue to use avail-
able media and tools from both modalities thoughtfully and with access as an
upfront value, just as they should do in the traditional face-to-face classroom.
Furthermore, instructors should have a clear pedagogical rationale for using
asynchronous or synchronous communication in OWI (Hewett, 2013). The
following list of recommendations may help WPAs and teachers in making their
decisions about digital modality for their OWCs.

    · For accessibility purposes, survey students, instructors, and institutions
        about available modality and media.

    · Survey students regarding their comfort levels with any social media and
        interactions built into the course, enabling those with invisible disabili-
        ties to express their social needs.

    · Ensure 24/7 or otherwise sufficient IT support of both asynchronous and
        synchronous modalities for all instructors and students.

    · Use asynchronous tools for a wide range of course-critical tasks, and take
        advantage of synchronous tools as needs and resources permit.

    · Upon confirming student access, use asynchronous and synchronous
        modes to appeal to different learning styles and for specific pedagogical
        purposes.

    · Ensure that the students and instructor have backup access on campus or
        elsewhere (or another backup plan) in case connectivity is lost or severely
        downgraded.

    · Confirm that synchronous tools have recording capacity and ensure that
        students use that feature to document course interactions.

    · Create a course "social contract" that identifies expectations for civil dis-
        course to be followed by the students and instructor, and convey whether
        those expectations differ according to modality.

                                                                                                 151

TEACHING THE OWI COURSE

Scott Warnock
Drexel University

This chapter examines some foundational principles that ground instruc-
tional presence, conversational strategies, response to student writing,
class management and organization, course assessment, and classroom
technologies. Because of the rapid changes to technologies, the chapter
pays particular attention to how to understand new technologies from
their foundations before introducing them to the OWI course, or OWC.

Keywords: assessment, asynchronous, composition, conversation, hybrid,
message board, OWI, presence, redundancy, response, teaching, teacher
training

    While there are many nuanced sub-positions within it, the CCCC OWI
Committee's (2013) A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective
Practices for OWI is, in essence, about teaching writing online effectively. Even
the most teaching-centric principles, the ones discussed in this chapter, do not
offer a template because there are so many ways to teach writing online effec-
tively. Like onsite teaching, OWI works or not based on context and the specific
dynamics of an instructor and students--and institutions, of course. As Wilbert
McKeachie (2002) pointed out, teachers must consider the various cultures and
subcultures of their instructional environment (p. 4). The general "problem"
that the pedagogy-specific principles address, though, is simple to articulate:
How do instructors teach writing online well?

    Framed by that question, this chapter attempts to cover a lot of ground. It
discusses the five OWI principles focused on pedagogy (OWI Principles 2-6),
examining such aspects of online instruction as:

    · teacher presence
    · strategies for building and encouraging conversation in OWCs
    · responding to student writing and how, if at all, that might differ in OWI

        than it does in onsite courses
    · class management and organization
    · course evaluation and assessment
    · class[room] technologies

Teaching the OWI Course

    This chapter does not and cannot serve as a stand-in for a full instructional
guide for teaching writing online. Other publications have done that essential
work, and they are addressed throughout this chapter. Instead, I look at these
five OWI principles and accompanying effective practices and how they con-
sider certain obstacles, issues, and challenges that instructors will encounter in
both hybrid and fully online courses. In fact, the problems teachers face can in
many cases be articulated as an inversion of these instructional OWI principles.
For many reasons, writing teachers are placed and/or pressured into teaching
situations and scenarios that may not enable them to offer their best teaching
selves, perhaps preventing them, as Peter Filene (2005) said of teaching practice,
from being "true to yourself " (p. 12). The challenge may be finding ways to hold
onto teaching persona and voice while cultivating and sharing good pedagogical
ideas and practices. These are the issues that the instructionally driven practices
discussed in this chapter are designed to address.

OWI PRINCIPLE 2

         An online writing course should focus on writing and not
         on technology orientation or teaching students how to use
         learning and other technologies.

    Many writing courses, and FYW in particular, have a history of becoming
a catch-all for college students; Wendy Bishop (2003), for example, wrote of
finding composition's "pedagogical roots" (p. 65). Teachers find themselves do-
ing everything in these courses--geographical orientation, technological orien-
tation, psychotherapy, library skills--and the course can become so divided with
these other activities that it only tangentially discusses writing. That situation,
while common, is not effective for any kind of teaching; yet, technology compli-
cates the issue in particular ways. As Diana G. Oblinger and James L. Oblinger
(2005) expressed, students respond to learning activities more than they respond
to any specific use of technology (p. 12). OWI teachers must use technology in
the service of the compositional/pedagogical goals of their courses.

    This curricular atomization can be a particular issue online, the CCCC OWI
Committee's Expert/Stakeholders' panelists noted repeatedly during the research
into A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013). Even though composition has changed and
shifted from applied rhetoric to a variety of writing studies' approaches (see
Downs & Wardle [2007]), when writing instruction occurs in digital environ-
ments, the OWI teacher's goal is clear: "Whatever we need to do to help the
student focus on their writing and not so much on the environment" (Shareen

158
                                                                                                      Warnock

Grogan, CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d). Because an OWC is facilitated with
technology and FYW instructors in particular are often at the front line of in-
teraction with an institution's students, teachers can turn into a regular (and,
if they are not careful, all-hours) contact point for student technology woes.
OWI Principle 2 (p. 11) is explicit: Teachers need to make sure their efforts are
focused on teaching writing, and they need multi-level support to maintain that
focus. Teachers will support students with all of the material and technological
conditions in which they compose because those types of concerns often are
inextricable from writing/composing itself, but they cannot be placed in the role
of technology expert/support person.

    This stance may seem obvious in terms of larger technological applications.
Teachers may want to help students with issues like securing their LMS ac-
counts. But on the practical level, this activity quickly becomes complicated. For
instance, years ago an FYW student sent me this email:

         I'm having trouble veiwing the syllabus because i deleted my
         microsoft word on accident. I know that as drexel students we
         can download it for free but it does not allow me to log in.
         I'm doing the whole drexel\userid thing.

    Teachers, especially those new at their school, could be drawn into many
well-meaning hunts to help students like this. Instead, the institution should
provide clear, easily accessible help through IT departments and 24/7 (or rea-
sonably accessible) help desks.

    OWI Principle 2's example effective practices supports that a teacher's focus
on the writing of the course must be articulated and reinforced throughout a
program and even an institution. Effective Practice 2.1 stated, "The requirement
for the institution's initial technology orientation should be handled by the in-
stitution's information technology (IT) unit and not the OWI teacher of any
OWC" (p. 11), and this practice is followed by 2.2: "An OWI teacher should not
be considered a technology point person" and "reasonable technical assistance
should be available to teachers" as well as students in person (if onsite) and by
phone, email, or instant messaging during all instructional hours (p. 11).

    In case of technology failure, teachers also should have an alternate lesson
plan when the technology cannot be fixed on the spot. Since my earliest use of
digital instructional technology, I have always used a risk-benefit-type analysis
structure, accepting, as David Jonassen (2012) said in an article about educa-
tional decision making: "Risk assessment decisions assume that consequences
are not in the hands of the decision maker but rather depend on chance, nature,
and luck" (p. 346). I introduce or use tools and technology because I think the
benefit justifies it. This decision is no different than anything we introduce to

                                                                                                 159
Teaching the OWI Course

our courses. A simple onsite teaching analogy: If I invite a guest speaker to my
onsite course, I think the benefit to students outweighs the risk that the speaker
may get a flat tire (which happened to me once, resulting in no speaker). Teach-
ers do not abandon chalkboards because one day the chalk might be missing.
But teachers should have a back-up plan so that when something does not go
right--say the conferencing software crashes--they can still do what they need
to: Maybe, in this case, use the phone. Technology opens up teaching oppor-
tunities, but the challenge is to prevent the experience from hinging on the
function of a few irreplaceable tools. Sometimes, perhaps, it is best just to stay
simple. OWI experts Beth Carroll and Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch said that a least
effective practice for them and their colleagues was using anything too technolo-
gy-heavy: Simple technology like Microsoft Word documents, GoogleDocs, and
even telephones are good tools (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a).

    The excessive focus on technology can be a problem not just in terms of
students emailing or phoning teachers because they cannot get their LMS work-
ing or a teacher's overreliance on breakable apps. Online environments by na-
ture lend themselves to multimedia and Web-based/focused assignments and
work. This nature provides tremendous opportunities for students to work with
a mindset toward the capabilities and affordances of the digital writing environ-
ment (see also Chapter 14). Of course, composition broadly conceived includes
images, sounds, and other media, but FYW and most other writing teachers and
students do not and should not have to know the technological and rhetorical
nuances of HTML code, for instance--especially now, when so many tools pro-
vide easy ways to do everything from design work to video recording. According
to Effective Practice 2.3, the instructional focus should be on "the rhetorical
nature of writing for the Web," on the compositional aspects of using technology
to create writing (p. 11). Aside from access obstacles--outlined thoroughly in
OWI Principle 1--most students, despite technological skill, can create a blog
in a minute. Asking them to create a blog is well within the scope of many
writing courses because blogs are a contemporary genre with teachable writ-
ing conventions for reaching particular audiences. In asking students to write a
blog, however, as Effective Practice 2.3 emphasized, students should "focus on
learning composition and not on learning technological platforms or software"
(p. 11). In other words, students should not have to create a homepage or spe-
cialized Web page outside the affordances of their institutional LMS in order to
accomplish a typical writing assignment. Significant access and inclusivity con-
cerns arise when students are required to learn such technological skills in the
typical writing course without training in the tool's use. In other circumstances,
these tools themselves might lack accessibility or might be incompatible with the
student's adaptive technology. Worse yet, such technology might not be suitable

160
                                                                                                      Warnock

for certain students due to particular learning styles and abilities. Note, howev-
er, that if instructors--and, more importantly, their writing programs--want
to incorporate a rhetorical exploration of platforms and tools, particularly in
advanced writing courses, they should do so while conscientiously taking on the
responsibility for providing access and inclusivity, as well as necessary teacher
and student preparation. A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective
Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) was developed not to forbid
changes in composition studies but to protect those who may have such instruc-
tion forced upon them without essential technical support and training.

    Of course, planning always helps maintain course focus. According to Effec-
tive Practice 2.4 (p. 11), a teacher's focus on writing can be aided significantly
if the teacher receives institution-supported professional development before the
course starts (also see Chapters 11 & 14). The real world of staffing involves
pressure to get things done quickly and sometimes without adequate planning,
particularly when contingent faculty are hired late (see Chapter 7), but ideally
teachers would have a full semester or more before teaching online to become
trained in the necessary pedagogies and technologies.

    Ultimately, this conversation is centered in access. As Larry LaFond (2002)
stated more than a decade ago, many have viewed distance learning as a way to
broaden access, but the promise of access also brings problems; the digital divide
still prevents many students--and even teachers--from full access to OWI. By
being mindful of access and overall composition goals, teachers are better posi-
tioned to maintain an environment that is inclusive for all.

OWI PRINCIPLE 3

         Appropriate composition teaching/learning strategies should
         be developed for the unique features of the online instruc-
         tional environment.

    OWI courses are writing courses, first and foremost, but, as I have argued
elsewhere (Warnock 2009), teaching writing with digital technology tools opens
up incredible opportunities. Technologies should not control what teachers do,
but teachers would be remiss not to take advantage of the affordances of educa-
tional technologies for writing courses. In fact, after using digital tools, most
teachers develop new approaches that influence their core pedagogy. Susan Low-
es (2008) called teachers who move back and forth from face-to-face to online
platforms "trans-classroom teachers." She stated:

         And as a teacher moves, either simultaneously or serially, from
         one environment to the other, the course being taught will

                                                                                                 161
Teaching the OWI Course

         also be transformed as it is shaped and reshaped to fit first
         one context and then the other. Much like immigrants who
         leave the cultural comfort of their home societies and move to
         places with very different cultures and social practices, those
         who teach online leave the familiarity of the face-to-face class-
         room for the uncharted terrain of the online environment,
         whose constraints and affordances often lead to very different
         practices. (para. 2)

    These "different practices" can--and probably should--compel teachers to
look closely at their teaching selves, helping them find new ways to work with
and engage students.

    However, the astonishing rapidity of digital technology change means teach-
ers must think about technologies in foundational ways before introducing
them to an OWI course. This point returns us to how teachers conceptualize
themselves: They should consider what they are trying to accomplish and then
think about ways that technology complements those goals and philosophies,
as discussed to some degree in Chapters 2 and 3. Doing so may require some
earnest (and perhaps painful) self-reflection. Teachers do not want to become
pigeon-holed into particular, highly specific types of technology; instead, they
should think about how various applications help them accomplish their course
goals.

Straightforward Communication and Clear Textual Teaching
Practices

    Online courses put more pressure on teachers' communication skills
(Hewett, 2015a) because most of what is communicated and taught is mediated
by technology. In asynchronous courses, almost all instruction, content, and
teaching through feedback to student writing is done with text and provided
to students without the certainty of future in-person meetings. In synchronous
courses, which are rarer, the same largely holds true. When spoken language is
used in real time or in audio and audio/video recordings, for example, specificity
of language and what Beth Hewett calls semantic integrity (i.e., fidelity between
the writer's intention and the reader's inference) also are crucial (Hewett, 2010,
2015a, 2015b). Effective Practice 3.1 provided overt guidance in this way: OWI
teachers should use "written language that is readable and comprehensible," and
the many written instructions should be "straightforward, plain, and linguisti-
cally direct" (p. 12).

    Teachers should re-consider how their messages appear to their students, be-
ginning with the initial design and practices in course documents. CCCC OWI

Committee Expert/Stakeholder Jim Porter said:

         Early on I was too reliant on emails and long narratives on
         description of things and that just wasn't very effective [for]
         presenting information. But I think shorter, more compact
         things, shorter presentations, shorter videos, shorter agenda
         [...] I think focusing and cutting the extra verbosity and
         making the information design really sharp helps students to
         understand what's due when and what the main principles
         are. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d).

    OWCs need various new "ground rules," Porter said, about things like "How
are we going to communicate with one another? How are we going to have dis-
cussions?" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d), and the articulation of the rules
themselves must be clear. CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder Rich
Rice said that "a best practice" he applies is to create an "expanded" syllabus with
lots of hyperlinks "to lead individual students to different things, giving them
more active practice" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a).

    As Hewett (2015a) argued extensively in Reading to Learn and Writing to
Teach: Literacy Strategies for Online Writing Instruction, cultivating good OWI
practices also requires developing a culture of reading and re-reading in the
course--for both teacher and students. Text-rich settings also are text heavy, as
Hewett says in Chapter 1. Indeed, the reading for students in OWI can be in-
credibly different than in comparable onsite courses. June Griffin and Deborah
Minter (2013) compared the required reading of students in one fully online
and two traditional onsite writing courses, finding that "the reading load of the
online classes was more than 2.75 times greater than the face-to-face classes" (p.
153). Given this reading load, a teacher's incomplete or underdeveloped thought
in an email or discussion post can lead to multiple problems of student compre-
hension and teacher ethos. Instructors must carefully proofread their own work
for content and clarity; this work places them in the role of modeling commu-
nication behavior and strong writing skills, a key point for me (Warnock, 2009)
and for Hewett (2010, 2015a, 2015b). It is interesting how such modeling can
change practice; for instance, in my message board conversations, I ask students
to use cited evidence whenever possible. Online, with search engines at your
fingertips, there is little excuse to say, "I once heard about a study." Of course,
as a teacher I am pressed for time occasionally and want to say, "I once heard
about a study," but I just cannot say that and expect students not to do so, too.
Everything I write in an OWC provides a model--strong or weak--for student
writers. These points all connect with issues of instructor presence. CCCC OWI
Committee Member Jason Snart1 said in a meeting of expert/stakeholders: "So

                                                                                                 163
Teaching the OWI Course

I think from my perspective on the instructor side of it, is the more I can make
my involvement obvious to the students on a regular basis, the more effective
that seems to be for me to get them to feel like they need to be involved with
the class, with each other, with me on a regular basis as well" (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2011d).

    In asynchronous, text-based courses, the pressures of heavy reading and writ-
ing loads and the need for clarity and teacher modeling increase. The course is
primarily, if not exclusively, textual. As we mention throughout this book, this
text-centric nature of the asynchronous course (and of many features in online
synchronous writing courses as well) provides many opportunities to help stu-
dents learn to write. However, teachers must step back and think in a usabili-
ty-centered way (see Redish, 2012) about the documents as well as the commu-
nication experiences in the course. Access issues are monumental when writing
is taught through text primarily and students, some of whom are poor readers
of instructional text, must teach themselves through what they read (Hewett,
2015a).

    Time is a factor in OWI, and time is necessary to communicate well with
students. Initially, the time to teach an OWC can be daunting, as many argue.
But I have found that teachers will (or should) develop a vast pool of carefully
crafted communications. I have files of easily searchable message board prompts,
general pieces of advice, even course announcements, and I believe teachers can
leverage their time rapidly in online environments if they use these tools well.
While OWI teachers may not have the onsite room of students with whom to
discuss general issues in a writing project, they can create a document or post
of such observations, which students can revisit as often as they want. There is
a quality of thoughtful repetition in OWI that gives online students, who can-
not line up outside the office after class asking for a repeat performance of the
"General issues with Project 1" speech, opportunity to access needed answers to
their questions.

Using Audio and Visual Technology

    While technology can be integral to response, in line with broader OWI
principles, the strategies are what matter. This thinking digitally also means that
teaching writing online, interacting with students' documents, and writing in
ways that are exclusively digital open up communication opportunities teachers
might not have considered onsite. Using audio/video is one-way technology can
enhance communications, whether the course is text-centric and asynchronous
or live video-based and synchronous, as Effective Practice 3.2 suggested. Those
audio/video technologies can be used either asynchronously in recorded form in

164
                                                                                                      Warnock

response to student writing (J. Sommers, 2002; Warnock, 2008) or as a means
of facilitating synchronous conferences. In line with other key ideas in A Position
Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2013), as long as access issues have been addressed adequately, us-
ing these modalities helps learners in various ways while also providing crucial
communicative redundancy in course lessons.

    Because of modeling and other text-centric teaching philosophies, WPAs
and instructors can make strong arguments to use text-based writing as the core
of course communications, but in the interest of clarity, textual experiences in
the course can be enhanced significantly by multimedia. The barriers that might
impede the use of audio and video are dropping precipitously, so instructors
can more easily and effectively incorporate audio/video technologies into their
courses. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that although teachers' commu-
nications may be in audio and video as well as text, even audio/video technolo-
gies do not relieve instructors of the challenges of conciseness and clarity. Audio
and video--even synchronous, video dialogue-- still rely on clear and unambig-
uous messages, as even the best technologies obstruct common in-person cues of
facial and body language.

Responding to Student Writing

    In OWI, teachers may have to think differently in the area of the classic
writing teacher communications to students--response to student writing proj-
ects. As any writing teacher knows, responding to writing is one of the most
significant aspects of our interaction with students, and we do much individual-
ized teaching in this process. Although response once was dominated by teach-
ers' (mostly) one-way interactions with students' major written projects, OWI
teachers and students are in a constant cycle of response that can be much more
dialogic and complex (Hewett, 2015a). Researchers have long described patterns
of vagueness, terseness, and sometimes outright meanness in teaching response
(N. Sommers, 1982)--the product of writing thousands of words about similar
problems in a short period of time. Writing is difficult, no matter who you are,
and that does not change at all--at all!--when teachers write to students. In
fact, an audience of developing students seeking advice for writing may be the
most challenging audience a writer can face.

    Teachers have to consider the use of stylistic approaches such as rhetorical
questions, idioms, and metaphorical/figurative language. Will they work? In
many cases, Hewett thinks they will not (2010, 2015b), advocating linguisti-
cally direct (not necessarily directive) response instead. Is it better to be as direct
as possible? How much does a teacher balance prescriptive advice with Socratic

                                                                                                 165
Teaching the OWI Course

questions? Is certain redundancy necessary in these stylistic and rhetorical choic-
es to accommodate the cognitive needs of students with differing learning abil-
ities? How helpful will it be for comments to be anchored to a rubric? Effective
Practice 3.5 suggests one approach, a problem-centered approach to write to stu-
dents. As Hewett (2015a) indicated, such a problem-centered approach could
include asking open-ended questions; demonstrating; illustrating; and, again,
modeling (specifically modeling at the level "being required of the student").
Teachers cannot assume that the ambiguity inherent in open-ended questions
is appropriate for all learners, and they should provide additional scaffolds for
those who might process information differently. Teachers need to think about
the clarity of writing vocabulary and other instructional terms (Hewett, 2011,
p. 12). Developing revision strategies is integral, and teachers must think about
such strategies differently than in onsite instruction. CCCC OWI Committee
Expert/Stakeholder panelist Errol Sull said a top problem students cite in OWI
course is "that they get lack of instructor feedback or get lack of instructor's feed-
back in time"; to maintain the student-teacher connection, he indicated "that
custom feedback has to be there" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d).

    While strategy matters most, technologies exist to make written response to
student writing more efficient and effective. CCCC OWI Committee Expert/
Stakeholder panelist Angela Solic revealed that, "another best practice is using
software to help grading" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a). Such technologies
are not exclusive to online learning, of course; their use simply represents anoth-
er way writing instruction in general can be inflected by digital environments.

Responding to Small Assignments

    In an OWC, teachers often will look at many smaller writing assignments
as well as multiple essay drafts, so that classic teacher response to larger projects
may change. CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder Rich Rice said in
his technical writing course he does not grade many papers but he sees lots of
message board posts: "A best practice would also be realizing as an instructor you
do not have to read every single post or grade every single thing to be effective.
The point is they are contributing; the point is not that you are grading every-
thing that they are contributing." CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder
Melody Pickle, elaborating on that point, indicated that looking at and grading
"discussion boards and things like that" are "significantly going to change the
grading time or time in the class" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012b). In fact,
responding to these small assignments might not be best thought of as grading,
as CCCC OWI Committee Member Web Newbold said: "Perhaps `assessment'
would be a good term to use" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012b).

166
                                                                                                      Warnock

    Interestingly, even though evaluating a stack of projects is time consuming,
teachers quickly understand the time expectations. Working with small assign-
ments, especially in a dialogic way, can disrupt those expectations. CCCC OWI
Committee Member Heidi Harris cautioned that instructors might supplant
large projects with "a bunch of small assignments" and then "they can't get stu-
dent feedback there on time and this pushes that feeling that students have
to constantly be doing something to be constantly connecting with the class"
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a). Such actions actually are counter-produc-
tive, as Snart indicates in Chapter 2. It is too easy to think students need to be
online more hours per week than they would when engaging onsite course work,
and such tasks can become busy work both to students and teachers.

Text-Wise, Medium Meets Message

    Many writers decry the use of emoticons, and exclamation point overuse is
rampant; yet, word processing and HTML writing environments offer a variety
of communication and rhetorical opportunities that OWI teachers should con-
sider. Although instructors may not want to create an intricate, layered hypertext
narrative every time they write a course announcement, they can take advantage
of those tools. Effective Practice 3.3 addressed teachers' uses of different writing
tools if for no other reason than "to mirror the types of online writing students
most often read" (p. 12) This practice is in line with the central pedagogical
principle that OWI is about writing instruction, not Web design, and using the
various text-production capabilities can help clarify a message. Such tools in-
clude such simple strategies like emphasizing text by strike-through, highlight-
ing, and graphics and drawing. As writers and rhetoricians themselves, OWI
teacher-writers should make the most of the opportunities and tools available for
textual communication with students.

Redundancy and Support

    OWI teachers should employ redundancy in their OWCs--in the content,
instructional texts, and any documents students must read or ideas that are cru-
cial to their writing growth. In line with Effective Practice 3.6 (serendipitously
also expressed in Effective Practice 4.6), it is important to consider that strategic
redundancy provides students with various ways of receiving the same informa-
tion (p. 15). In Teaching Writing Online (2009), one of my own guidelines is that
"Redundancy is crucial when you deliver information in your OWcourses"; for
example, I suggested that teachers provide information about the due date of a
final project using the syllabus, specific project instructions, course announce-

                                                                                                 167
Teaching the OWI Course

ments, and even email (pp. 56-57). If teachers provide information in different
ways using various tools and media, they can help students--especially those
who may have a disability impeding their comprehension in one medium--to
understand both the information and its importance to the course. (By the way,
this type of redundancy is different from the "Redundancy Principle" of Ruth C.
Clark and Richard E. Mayer (2011), which advised against simultaneous redun-
dancy in multimedia, such as the triple-presentation (e.g., text on slide, spoken,
hand-out) of information in a presentation).

    Teachers can use electronic tools to replicate--and I believe strengthen--
their communicative approaches in the course. This redundancy is not nagging
because it provides all learners, and perhaps particularly those with disabili-
ty-based obstacles to textual comprehension, with a better chance to succeed.
Most institutional LMSs offer multiple "places" for teachers to give students
information, such as individual pages for the digital syllabus and a static down-
loadable syllabus, discussion post spaces, class announcement spaces, individu-
alized spaces like email or journals, and the like. It is standard practice for many
teachers to provide library modules, connections to student support services (in
line with OWI Principles 1 and 13), and other helpful materials. Students should
have particular places to discuss assignments (and not just with the teacher but
with each other), to pose questions (my "Questions about the course" thread
often is the most high-traffic thread in a class), and to provide meeting spaces
for students, whether synchronous or asynchronous. Such variety lends itself to
teachers posting messages, assignments, and comments redundantly.

    Finally, teachers also will want to think about ways that digital tools can
replicate behaviors they perhaps do not even think about as part of teaching. For
instance, the end-of-class onsite verbal assignment reminder may be a common
practice, but education technology can provide other, sometimes better ways to
keep students on track, such as a weekly video assignment reminder.

Remember to Connect Via Writing

    Again, a great--and perhaps revolutionary--thing in OWI is that students
will engage in most course interactions via writing, and, although plenty of
technologies exist to connect students and teachers without writing (including
the humble phone), OWI teachers may want to encourage students deliber-
ately to pose logistical questions via writing. In doing so, students can learn
by practicing the "how to" variety of exposition while seeing how teachers and
peers explain step-by-step directions. After all, students can learn from these
transactional written interactions, including simple things like how to provide a
good subject line or how to name documents effectively. While teachers all have

168
                                                                                                      Warnock

amusing teaching anecdotes of receiving emails with subjects like "Yo dude" or
receiving a pool of student project files and discovering 50 of them are named
"Essay1," there are deeper rhetorical ideas at work in such practices--especial-
ly in terms of providing students with reflective moments in fast-paced digital
communications.

Hybrid Articulation Between Onsite and Online Activities

    As Snart addresses in Chapter 2, it is crucial to plan what onsite and online
activities will occur, particularly in hybrid courses. I like teaching hybrid courses
and try to do a good job when I do. But something that continues to bedevil
me is how teachers can maximize the articulation between onsite and online
experiences. Teachers should seek ways to "expand" the class[room] productive-
ly, using the differentiation among modalities not only to help students write
and learn but to conduct arguments and discussions using the different skills
demanded by different communication modalities--all of which can improve
their overall digital communication skills. Teachers certainly can have conversa-
tions face-to-face and online to complement and draw on the strengths of differ-
ent environments. They can develop an invention exercise for a major project as
an in-person group, drawing on brainstorming and frenetic discussion, and then
productively take the conversation onto a message board in which the individual
authors describe their ideas more formally in writing.

    Teachers should be thinking along those lines. Effective Practice 3.9 stated,
"From a writing instructional perspective, teachers should take full advantage
of the flexibility of electronic communications in the planning and guiding of
projects and activities" (p. 13). To this end, teachers should conceive their use of
electronic tools around the general concept of "expanding the classroom." The
notion of a "flipped classroom" currently is in vogue. A quick Internet search
of "flipped classroom" provided numerous perspectives on this teaching strat-
egy (EDUCAUSE, 2012, offered a good summary), but in essence, this is a
new term/frame for an old teaching approach: Have students do their passive
learning (which might include listening to a lecture) outside of the class[room]
and use the onsite/in-class time to collaborate, write, or work in a lab. Hybrid
teaching, as Snart (2010) said in Hybrid Learning, "does present the opportunity
for truly re-imagined teaching" (p. 112).

    To experienced OWI teachers, it may seem rudimentary to read in Effective
Practice 3.9 that "The concept of the `classroom' can be expanded productively
to include time when students and teacher are not physically present in a room"
(p. 13). Nonetheless, a complex notion underlies this idea--learning is contin-
uous. "Continuous" is a deliberate word choice because it invites students into

                                                                                                 169
Teaching the OWI Course

an ongoing relationship with their learning experiences, a relationship that helps
them challenge the idea that learning takes place exclusively "in" school settings.
This notion helps set up undergraduate students for the goal of lifelong learning
that we see most often in effective adult learners and workers.

Moderation Is an Art

    Moderating a good conversation in any venue is both art and craft, but on-
line moderation, whether asynchronous or synchronous, introduces additional
challenges. In my observation of OWCs and reading student evaluations asso-
ciated with them, a common disappointment that students voice is the lack of
engagement in the asynchronous discussions by their teachers. Effective Prac-
tice 3.10 stated, "Teachers should moderate online class discussions to develop
a collaborative OWC and to ensure participation of all students, the free and
productive exchange of ideas, and a constant habit of written expression with a
genuine audience" (p. 14). Fortunately, teachers can respond to this practice by
learning more about moderating conversations online. George Collison et al.
(2000) wrote an excellent book about teaching in these environments (Facili-
tating Online Learning: Effective Strategies for Moderators), as did Tisha Bender
(2003) (Discussion-Based Online Teaching to Enhance Student Learning: Theory,
Practice and Assessment) and Gilly Salmon (2000) (E-Moderating: The Key to
Teaching and Learning Online).

    Teachers unaccustomed to the dynamics of a group of students having a
textual discussion will need to be ready for something quite different from their
typical onsite experience. I mentioned in Teaching Writing Online (2009):

         In synchronous or onsite environments, the conversation is
         fairly linear, almost always meaning that not everyone can
         participate. With message boards, conversations can build in
         parallel fashion. Some students may be shy about speaking
         their minds in a classroom conversation or even a fast-paced
         chat setting, where by the time you respond, the rest of the
         group is on to another topic. (pp. 69-70)

    Teachers can capitalize on the anonymity (or at least suppressed presence) of
messages boards, which two decades ago Gail Hawisher (1992) found open to
more equitable participation (p. 88). The class conversation forum is in theory
an open place with opportunity for "talking" that students may especially enjoy
because, even though they are experienced with texting and Facebooking, they
may have never been pushed to have a serious conversation about something
that does not involve their personal lives (and personal affinities). Remember,

170
                                                                                                      Warnock

though, that students' "digital nativeness" can be an impediment in this way
as well, leading some to respond to formal discussion requests with informal
language, a lack of thoughtfulness, and too much personal information. The
technology of threaded conversations itself can be a barrier for others with neu-
rological or visual disabilities who might miss social cues or who might experi-
ence confusion when confronted with a volley of little-structured, impromptu
verbal exchanges.

    Effective Practice 3.10 suggested that teachers should find ways to capitalize
on the positive traits of the digital dialogic environment (p. 14). Teachers can
push students in ways they may not be comfortable doing in class. For instance,
I find that I am more effective at calling students out in constructive ways when
working with them online. If they make an unsupported assertion, I am quick
to ask them for necessary support in online conversations. Onsite, if students
struggle to make a point, to articulate their perspective, I sometimes find myself
shying away from pressing them in the interest of avoiding embarrassing them.
Online, my class culture allows for this kind of pushing: "What do you mean?--
and being clear about what you mean is a natural part of the course."

    Teachers can take advantage of the gaps in online dialogue, which occurs in
part because reflection time is built-in and is particularly conducive to asynchro-
nous environments, to ask highly difficult questions. In a way, that also is a kind
of class flipping. In an onsite class, teachers might be concerned about having
a room full of students turning pages or scrolling in an effort to mine texts for
specific concepts, but online, I assume they have the space and time to hunt and
reflect. I want them to do so. The use of research represents a major shift in my
expectations for students' communications practices. I can ask them for research
in ways I could not do onsite because every student in the conversation has the Web
immediately available. But teachers need to find out when to query, to prod, to
challenge--all while having built a structure that keeps students engaged. This
type of teaching does not come easy, but the opportunities are rich.

Meta Learning

    Teachers should maximize the inherently archival nature of OWI as much
as possible. Students in an OWC have virtual piles of their own low-stakes writing
to work with and analyze, and teachers should think rhetorically and metacog-
nitively to help students write more effectively. Effective Practice 3.11 suggested
that metacognitive activities are ideal opportunities for process-based work and
even for approaches like writing portfolios:

         The inherently archival nature of the online environment
         should be used for learning. To this end, teachers should use

                                                                                                 171
Teaching the OWI Course

         the digital setting to encourage students to rhetorically and
         metacognitively analyze their own learning/writing processes
         and progress. Such strategies can identify growth areas and
         points for further assistance. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013,

    Why is low-stakes writing important in encouraging students to work on
meta aspects of writing? Consider this in-class exercise, which I admit to cruelly
administering to my students. Students come to an onsite class with a hard-co-
py paper to turn in, and, right before they do so, I ask them to pair up and
read the paper aloud to each other. Ouch. Of course, the well-meaning teacher
only does this to demonstrate the power of collaborative proofing, but singed
students who really engage with the exercise find errors in a paper that is about
to be turned in for a grade. The high-stakes nature of the project--an essay due
that day--could undermine the endeavor. Using the vast amount of low-stakes
materials assembled in most asynchronous courses, teachers can achieve similar
meta/reflective practices while students can do what we really hope they do: look
at their own work critically but without too much pressure that can obstruct
their ability to see the text as it is. When I write on deadline, I know I will myself
into believing my text is error-free because that is what I need to believe at that
time; students should learn that all writers have this need and editing still may
be necessary.

Timing of Response and Feedback

    Responding to students is crucial teaching work because feedback provides
students' with their most individualized teaching experience in online settings.
It also is time-intensive and time sensitive. Remember that in an OWC, teachers
are not spending that three hours or more a week in a classroom, even if some of
their time is spent in synchronous interactions via virtual classrooms or onsite
for hybrid courses. The interactions they do have often are presented in a written
form to students, and teachers will need to define with some care and precision
the parameters of that response. Effective Practice 3.12 indicated, "The feedback
loop both for essay response and question/issue response as well as the expected
timing for these processes should be well-defined in any OWC" (p. 14). One
reason for establishing feedback timing is to aid students in their writing and
planning, but another important reason is for the teachers' benefits. OWI teach-
ers do not want students to have unreasonable (maybe on a human endurance
level) expectations of response. As CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder
Joanna Paul said simply, "I think it's important not to overload ourselves with
graded writing to review" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a). Whether OWI

172
                                                                                                      Warnock

teachers provide response windows or give students timing expectations in days
or hours, they should create an understanding of expectations of how issues
might be resolved; in the language of Effective Practice 3.12, "Doing so builds
appropriate boundaries, trust, and a sense of relationship" (p. 12).

    Timeframes for essay, journal, and discussion post responses might best be
set program-wide by the WPA, but, in keeping with OWI Principle 5, individu-
al teachers should retain reasonable control over the amount of time they spend
and when they write those responses (p. 15).

OWI PRINCIPLE 4

         Appropriate onsite composition theories, pedagogies, and
         strategies should be migrated and adapted to the online
         instructional environment.

    In line with remembering they are teaching a writing course--albeit on-
line--and that there are nuances to OWI that lend themselves to new theories
and strategies, OWI teachers also need to foreground, perhaps in a more fun-
damental way, their role as teacher. Many teachers still come to online teaching
from onsite teaching. Migration of pedagogy is key. In other words, OWI teach-
ers--particularly novice instructors--should begin with what they do best on-
site and adapt those strategies to online settings. I remember, while working on
my dissertation in 2000, sitting down with a senior faculty member. Our con-
versation turned to education technologies. In a pleasant conversation, he told
me that his concerns about educational technology took this form: While he was
well regarded as a teacher and took his teaching seriously, he believed there was
an assumption that he would change to accommodate educational technologies.
In short, he expressed that he felt "colonized" by teaching technologies. I think
it is important not just for teachers but also for those involved with faculty
development and instruction design to understand this thread of colonization

    OWI Principle 4 (p. 14) highlights the concept of migration, or taking what
we know of writing pedagogy and "moving" it to an online setting, albeit with
adaptation, as OWI Principle 4 indicated and Snart explains in Chapter 2. The
world of educational technology offers much that is new. But it does not mean
that dedicated teachers have to abandon what has made them effective. Instead,
this principle recognized prior effectiveness and encouraged: "Teachers should
seek opportunities to use their established practices when moving online while
seeking alternative ways of offering those practices within digital spaces and us-
ing electronic tools" (p. 14). While shifting to OWI can be a heady experience,
modality, media, and technology change should offer opportunity and promise,

                                                                                                 173

not chaos and anxiety.

Building Assignments

    For many writing instructors, building assignments piecemeal, in compo-
nents, is integral to good instruction. As many chapters in this book describe,
technology facilitates division of work into process components. Some simple
asynchronous technologies--message boards, blogs--facilitate the kinds of con-
versations that help build dialogue around course projects and assignments.

    In my own courses, I have always felt good about having open, in-class,
onsite conversations about topics for major projects. These have been lively and
productive, and I often end up listing the topics on the board and providing
every student with an opportunity to contribute. In moving online (both hybrid
and fully online), I realized that this useful in-class discussion practice could be
even better. Providing a message board on which students can openly discuss
project topics through text has proven excellent; in this case, they are writing
their responses, providing additional time to reflect and offer substantive com-
mentary. Meanwhile, I also have the time provided by asynchronous environ-
ments to look at all of the topics in toto and to generate, in addition to focused
responses to individual students, a collective message--with quoted evidence--
to the whole group. All our work becomes an artifact for the course that we refer
to through the process of developing the writing project, which is a useful way
for teaching students how to scaffold their own thinking and writing.

Building Course Knowledge

    Long-standing ideas about knowledge creation and rhetorical theory make
for tremendous partners with online writing environments. Electronic platforms
and conventional modalities and tools provide strong opportunities for students
to think about their own composing processes and thinking processes together
(for example, see Bruffee, 1984).

    For instance, message boards--a simple way to enable students to have asyn-
chronous written conversations--provide many meta-writing opportunities to
help students think through their writing process and practices as well as those
of other students. As I described in "The Low-Stakes, Risk-Friendly Message
Board Text?" (2010), I have asked students to "share your secrets" about research:

         "Where do you start? How do you do it? What techniques do
         you use? How do you stay organized? How do you remem-
         ber how to incorporate quotes? ... Let us know some of your
         research tricks." Although one might think students would

174
                                                                                                      Warnock

         respond tepidly to a post about research process, that has not
         been the case. In fact, they have revealed so many interesting
         aspects of their research process that I have abstracted the best
         of these responses into one file and provided them as a "gift"
         to the whole class at the term's end. (p. 103)

    Through these types of practices, we rip through the silence surrounding
many student writing practices. Rather than just learning "best practices" from
me--one voice--they see strategies their peers use. Some of these practices are
sophisticated, and peers immediately remark on that. They learn a whole crowd-
sourced array of research practices. While teachers could do this kind of work
onsite, the asynchronicity and lack of face-to-face immediacy seem to provide
opportunities for students to have deep online conversations that might fall flat
onsite.

    Teachers certainly can use the vast amount of student-generated writing to
ask students to proof their own work, to reread and re-evaluate their arguments,
and even to think through how they converse rhetorically in an online forum
versus a similar argument made in a "formal" project. At the 2007 Penn State
Conference on Rhetoric and Composition, I discussed my student "Nick," who
wrote a superb message board counterargument to several classmates during a
debate about intelligent design. After I suggested he convert this counterargu-
ment into a major project, he deflated his writing. In the presentation, I point-
ed out changes from the message board conversation to Nick's "official" paper:
"`Thesis statement' runs on grammatically; voice is strained: seems afraid to say,
`In my opinion,' giving the prose a contrived, inflated sense of objectivity" (War-
nock, 2007, July). Somehow, the writing changed--perhaps to Ken Macrorie's
(1970) "Engfish"--and it lost its edge, but in our discussions about the post,
Nick seemed to realize that his writing could have power.

Using the Technology to Facilitate Dialogue

    Many onsite teachers may wonder what will happen to their course interac-
tions when they move to OWI. But teachers have an opportunity to, as Effective
Practice 4.4 pointed out, "extend the reach of classroom interactions" (p. 14),
while helping students at all times to be cognizant of the rhetorical nuances of
the electronic realm. As I mentioned earlier regarding moderating online discus-
sions, electronic tools for writing and thinking provide opportunities to create a
collaboration- and writing-centered course experiences.

    Leslie Blair (2005) wrote about the potential of message boards for students'
writing: "The practice they receive through writing to communicate with their
instructor and peers can be as influential to their writing skills as major essay

                                                                                                 175
Teaching the OWI Course

assignments." When students begin to communicate online, Blair said, "Their
perception of audience begins to shift," as the instructor and other students
create a multifaceted audience and "they begin to recognize the biases, opin-
ions, and preconceived notions of their audience, which allows them to practice
writing for the addressee." Also, quiet students now "are much more likely to
make their opinions known in an online environment where they can contem-
plate their words before the rest of the group has access to them" (sect. 2, para.
5). Blair suggests the ideal of what can happen in an OWC, making the digital
environment a cornerstone of a good composition course.

OWI PRINCIPLE 5

         Online writing teachers should retain reasonable control
         over their own content and/or techniques for conveying,
         teaching, and assessing their students' writing in their
         OWCs.

    As writing teachers, let us acknowledge that our teaching may not be ours to
control fully. The CCCC OWI Committee developed OWI Principle 5 (p. 15)
to account for this teaching reality; it provides WPAs and their OWI teachers
with language that will prevent teaching from morphing into a mass-produced
good or service.

    In the CCCC OWI Committee's conversations with CCCC OWI Commit-
tee Expert/Stakeholder panelists, a recurring theme arose about teaching from
prescribed syllabi: it is not a recommended practice, to say the least. CCCC
OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder Angela Solic said, "The least effective
strategy for me has been to use content that another instructor created." CCCC
OWI Committee member Web Newbold said, "I strongly support Angela's
point about using someone else's course. It's often tempting (or required) to
use pre-packaged content, and some may be able to do that well, but it hasn't
worked for me." CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder Melody Pickle
reinforced this thought, saying, "I think a best practice would allow the teacher
to have some of his or her own content" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a).
CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder Rich Rice took the conversation
a pedagogical step further, pointing out that even teaching one's own "core syl-
labus" can be a problem: "One of the least effective strategies has always been if
I just copy and paste a previous course into a new semester and then don't leave
room to change the nature of the course based on where students take it without
taking into consideration the students and what their interests are, reading and
writing assignments things like that" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a). The ex-

176
                                                                                                      Warnock

perts strongly expressed that there was a responsibly to personalizing courses, in
line with what D. Randy Garrison and Terry D. Anderson (1999) called "little
distance education" (LDE), a structure reducing industrialization and maximiz-
ing aspects like interaction, meaningful learning outcomes, and active learning.
LDE is considered to be "flexible in design," and "course materials are created
[...] and stored such that they can easily be modified, augmented, annotated"
by students and teachers (p. 54). These CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stake-
holders seem to be pointing to a similar model.

When a Template or Core Might Be Useful

    The word "reasonable" appears in OWI Principle 5 because the CCCC OWI
Committee recognized, particularly with FYW, that many institutions and
programs have some understandable levels of uniformity or standardization in
their syllabi and outcomes. Students travel through the writing requirements
and courses in some progression, and most teachers would agree that Technical
Writing II should extend logically from the work in Technical Writing I. I think
back to a thought-experiment conversation I had with one of the best teachers
I know. We were talking about sequencing a FYW program, and, in defending
a core syllabus and outcomes for such an approach, I asked, "What if students
took an English 101 that featured War and Peace and then they took an En-
glish 102 and discovered that instructor also wanted to use War and Peace?" My
colleague said she could envision a situation in which students would learn a
tremendous amount from two such courses. Perhaps she was right (especially if
she were one of the teachers), but in most situations, students in required course
sequences have expectations that they will build on knowledge they acquired in
the previous course and will not be reliant on a kind of super-teacher who can
make the most of repeated content. This expectation seems obvious in a math
curriculum (where Algebra I content would mostly not be retaught in an Alge-
bra II course), and it seems obvious for writing courses if outcomes are clearly
defined. Hence, the idea of reasonable control for an instructor of a given OWC,
we understand, has to exist in the context of program and course requirements.

    Certainly, a writing program should encourage that core syllabi may contain
supports, structures, and pacing that can work for students with disabilities,
different learning styles, challenged socioeconomic backgrounds, multilingual
skills, and the like. WPAs rightly can expect some standardization and unifor-
mity with issues of access and inclusivity, as OWI Principle 1 indicated. These
are reasonable areas where template language can be helpful.

    Such templates and core requirements also provide areas of certainty for
teachers--in other words, some boundaries and well-defined limits are helpful.

                                                                                                 177
Teaching the OWI Course

For example, while having some teaching independence was widely supported
in CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder conversations, several panelists
discussed how templates can be useful, especially for first-time OWI instructors.
For instance, CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder Shareen Grogan
said, "It's really nice to have a parameter so that you know, maybe a template
that helps you decide how much is appropriate for a given week in an online
course, but then with a lot of freedom to add, to embellish, to adapt to tweak
the assignments" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2012a). What appeared important
was not just the freedom to do whatever one wishes for the sake of freedom, but
a sense that independence of choice is better for teaching and, thus, for OWI
students.

    As an inherent part of teaching, OWI instructors still need to conduct cours-
es in ways allowing them to provide the best of themselves, and the example ef-
fective practices associated with OWI Principle 5 attempt to reflect that through
a focus on flexibility, as discussed below.

Working with Teachers and Flexibility

    Good communication is a key practice in which flexibility is critical. Teach-
ers must be informed about alterations to their programs, for example, via reli-
able communications. Embedded in this idea of flexibility is the quality of trust:
Teachers need to be trusted to provide quality OWI. WPAs and institutions
must work with teachers and should communicate with them about the shape,
progress, and direction of OWI initiatives. WPAs should work closely with fac-
ulty in their programs to design curricula that account for expected and antici-
pated OWI aspects of these programs. Faculty and administrators also must have
a clear means of communication about OWI, as indicated in OWI Principle 11
(p. 23) and explored in Chapters 11 and 12.

    Interviews with the CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholders suggested
concerns that any standardization in online learning may lead to teachers losing
their freedom to create and deliver writing courses that match their strengths
and educational philosophies. However, nothing inherent to OWI leads to such
an outcome; administrations and institutions that want standardized educa-
tion will seek it regardless of the course learning environment. Additionally, the
threat posed by some online models, in which teachers could lose control of the
intellectual property of a first-time-generated course and then be replaced in
subsequent semesters, seems more difficult to enact in writing courses, since the
subject matter is so different from "content" courses (a key point about OWI
made throughout this book).

    Flexible teaching takes shape in many different ways, and the CCCC OWI

178
                                                                                                      Warnock

Committee focused on articulating some of these ways in the example effective
practices for OWI Principle 5 in a "while/should" structure that addresses strat-
egies for retaining reasonable instructional control in relation to institutional
realities:

  · Effective Practice 5.2: While institutions and programs should have clear-
       cut ways of providing accommodations for all students, teachers should
       still have flexibility in offering help, such as, if necessary, moving outside
       an LMS to provide a more accessible environment.

  · Effective Practice 5.3: While it is reasonable that programs have unified
       textbook choices (maybe for cost relief alone), teachers should have some
       choice in their own subject matter and be able to focus text-driven con-
       versation in the way that best suits their teaching. This is especially rele-
       vant in OWI courses; a link is an easy thing to share with students, and
       teachers need to be able to engage in perhaps one of the most enjoyable
       aspects of OWI: Providing an "aha" moment in the term when they come
       across a reading that they think ties in beautifully with what they are
       teaching.

  · Effective Practice 5.4: While many teachers must work with core as-
       signments, OWI teachers should have flexibility in assignment specifics.
       Teachers should be able to embed assignments within the particular "class
       culture" of their course. For writing courses in particular, this flexibility
       has a practical side: It enables programs to avoid the problem of having
       hundreds and maybe thousands of similar student writing submissions at
       the same time, a heterogeneity that discourages plagiarism.

  · Effective Practice 5.5: While programs should develop methods of col-
       lecting teaching materials, teachers should also have ways not only of
       individually adding and sharing such materials. Again, communication
       is invaluable.

  · Effective Practice 5.6: While programs should provide ways of consistent
       response to student writing, OWI teachers should have the room to ex-
       plore ways of engaging and communicating with students. Like moder-
       ating, interpersonal contact is one of the great arts of teaching, and this
       only increases in written forums or through audio/video-type synchro-
       nous discussions, which require different approaches.

  · Effective Practice 5.7: While programs should have consistent grading
       and assessment practices, OWI teachers need flexibility in grading and
       course-level assessment. Teachers might answer to an overall grading ap-
       proach--e.g., As, Bs, and Cs--but still should be able to establish meth-
       ods of grading online discussions and weighting various course compo-
       nents. Programs should encourage program-wide conversations about

                                                                                                 179
Teaching the OWI Course

       grading. (Warning!: From my faculty development experience, these con-
       versations might be hotly contested.) (p. 16).
    A culture of reasonable control and flexibility gives an OWI program the best
chance of doing what it is there to do: teach students to write more effectively.

OWI PRINCIPLE 6

         Alternative, self-paced, or experimental OWI models should
         be subject to the same principles of pedagogical soundness,
         teacher/designer preparation, and oversight detailed in this
         document.

    Readers will have heard a great deal about Massive Open Online Courses
(MOOCs), a highly touted experimental educational platform. In preparing for
a conference in 2013, I compiled over 100 news stories about MOOCs in less
than six months. Yet, in delivering MOOCs or the next greatest teaching inno-
vation, OWI teachers should not forego what makes great teaching and what
makes institutions of higher education work.

    Of course, as Patrick Deneen (2013) said, institutions and their faculty are
having trouble articulating the logic against MOOCs because we in higher edu-
cation have long been complicit in many practices that discourage good teaching
and student-teacher interactions. How many students have sat in a class of 600
and/or taken a course with an adjunct that was not provided professional devel-
opment opportunities and was paid a mere $1,500 for that course? (see Chapter
7). By their actions, institutions have said, "We will stick you in a huge lecture
hall and let you gawk at the oak trim while hoping you would not notice that
you could get this kind of education in many other ways"--other ways that
include, astonishingly enough, reading a book, having your friends read the same
book, and then talking to them about it. Some MOOCs have been shown to be
effective, and why not? People who want to learn are pretty good at doing so,
and that is something all institutions of higher education should think about.
The real challenge may not be getting the stuff into learners' heads, but in moti-
vating them in the first place. I probably should not admit this, but one of my
children had the recurring issue of having his elbow pop out of the socket when
he was little. Using Web instructions from an orthopedics journal, I once re-set
his arm. Please do not extrapolate too much from my quackery, but people can
learn specialized things from the Web. If higher education thinks its forte is
guarding and disseminating that knowledge, it is in big trouble.

    Soon after publishing A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective
Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013), one of the first requests

180
                                                                                                      Warnock

the CCCC OWI Committee received was to take a stronger stance specific
to MOOCs. While OWI Principle 6 does address these alternative forms, we
state our case more overtly regarding such delivery systems in OWI Principle 9:
"OWCs should be capped responsibly at 20 students per course with 15 being
a preferable number" (pp. 20-21). There is an interesting kind of logic at work
here. While OWI Principle 9 was written inductively based on the experiences
of many writing teachers, extrapolating its use for MOOCs or other teaching
structures, we hope, will be a deductive exercise. Thus, a 60,000-person digital
experience is not a course and does not fit any reasonable description of one. In
fact, Hewett and I believe our conversations regarding MOOCs actually should
be about but MOOEEs: Massive Open Online Educational Experiences. Can
people learn to write in such an environment? Sure. As mentioned, the time
of the autodidact is upon us. But such an experience should not be confused
with the disciplinary concept of a writing course, in which interaction with the
instructor is integral. Because, for better or worse, many content courses onsite
have already been instructor-less in many ways, those involved cannot complain
about MOOCs. But that situation does not fit the composition community, and
we must consider such experimental forms differently.

WPAs and Writing Instructors Need to Approve Even Experimen-
tal Writing Courses

    Decisions about online writing curricula (and, of course, all writing curric-
ula) need to be made by writing teachers. In some institutions, there may be
a temptation or even overt desire by administrators to suggest the way that a
writing course curriculum will be developed and taught. Many of the effective
practices associated with OWI Principle 6 are designed to support and empower
WPAs to make decisions crucial to writing programs. To this end, the CCCC
OWI Committee also believes WPAs "should have final approval of alternative,
self-paced, or experimental OWI models integrated into the online curriculum."
These courses and structures should not just emerge from administrators who
have little understanding of writing studies and then be foisted upon the writing
program. Similarly, WPAs should be able to select teachers for OWI courses--
experimental and otherwise--in ways that make sense for the pedagogy and
philosophy of that writing program.

WPA- and Teacher-Centric Training

    Faculty training is a big, underappreciated--certainly it is under-discussed--
problem in OWI, as OWI Principle 7 (p. 17) and Chapter 11 reveal. WPAs need

                                                                                                 181
Teaching the OWI Course

to have a clear, ever-present voice in how writing program faculty not only are
selected but are trained to teach writing courses. A primary consideration in this
area, which is addressed more fully in Chapter 11, is how administrations must
provide space and support for training and ongoing professional development.

    Effective Practice 6.3 makes clear that teachers of any OWI course, exper-
imental or otherwise, should be offered the same professional training and de-
velopment opportunities as other OWI faculty (p. 17). Because that strategy
assumes a more functional training structure for onsite, face-to-face writing pro-
grams than perhaps is occurring in many institutions, the CCCC OWI Com-
mittee hopes OWI Principle 6 may be extended to writing instruction more
generally.

WPA- and Teacher-Centric Assessment and Evaluation

    Another weak point in OWI and some onsite writing programs is assessment
and evaluation of teachers. In particular, writing programs may not observe and
assess teachers adequately. Effective Practice 6.4 stated that any "alternative,
self-paced, or experimental" OWC should be observed regularly by a WPA or
teaching peer and assessed based on quality markers of online instruction (p.
17). These evaluators and the evaluations on which they are working cannot
just come out of nowhere. As Vincenza Benigno and Guglielmo Trentin (2000)
said, evaluation of online courses often is based on faulty comparisons to onsite
instruction and/or is conducted by teachers who do not have OWI training or
experience; indeed, sometimes they do not even have training or experience in
writing instruction itself. Effective Practice 6.5 could be helpful for assessment
of writing instruction in general: "Alternative, self-paced, or experimental OWI
course teachers should be evaluated/assessed by a peer or supervisor who has
similar training and equal or superior abilities/experience in writing instruction
generally and OWI particularly" (p. 17). The onus, thus, is placed on programs
and perhaps institutions to find quality people who understand the theories and
pedagogies of OWI and provide them with reasonable and fair means to evaluate
such courses.

    Cristie Cowles Charles (2002), in "Why We Need More Assessment of On-
line Composition Courses: A Brief History," indicated that the complexity and
sometimes rigidity of OWI makes the need for fair and adequate evaluation
even more important: "For example, the more funding, administration, pro-
gramming, video production, graphic design, and structured curriculum go into
creating a course, the harder it is to change that course's content." Furthermore,
"In fact, I submit that the more fixed a course's content and environment be-
come (whether the course is traditional or online), the more evaluation becomes

182
                                                                                                      Warnock

absolutely necessary because the instructor and students become increasingly
restricted in their ability to adapt the course to their needs" (sect. 2, para. 3).
Charles' words have particular meaning under OWI Principle 6 because even
experimental OWI structures can be seen as written in stone after a semester
or two of teaching, making the experimental course's efficacy and its teachers'
abilities less well understood even while they become standardized and fixed.

    As a final point on evaluation, Effective Practice 6.6 (p. 17) emanated from
the idea that often OWI courses are subjected to a kind of evaluative scruti-
ny and rigor that few onsite courses have (see, for example, Warnock, 2007).
There are various reasons for this unbalanced assessment, including institutions'
and particular administrators' poor understanding of educational outcomes and
the difficulty of measuring educational cause-and-effect. At times, when asked
about the effectiveness of online and hybrid courses, as a WPA, I have responded
with: "Well, where is our outcome data about our onsite courses?" Or, I have
said: "Where is our ironclad and empirical outcome data about the usefulness of
attending this institution over the one across town or about students taking the
200k and not going to college?" My words have been spoken in the spirit of what
Peter Thiel (n.d.) was attempting with his Thiel Fellowships (The Thiel Founda-
tion). At some point, teachers have to believe in what they are doing as educators
despite the astonishing pressure driven by standardized assessments and testing.

    Pedagogically sound OWCs, even experimental ones, should not be subject-
ed to a gauntlet of assessment that an institution's onsite writing courses have not
been subjected to. Effective Practice 6.6 helps steer writing teachers in this way;
if teachers want information to stave off such assessments, they might look to
a CompPile bibliography prepared about such comparisons (Warnock, 2013).
They also can view the extensive No Significant Difference website. Although the
CCCC OWI Committee certainly wants alternative courses to be good, we also
want standard online and onsite courses to be good. Teacher evaluation is one
area that requires a broader conversation about a program's pedagogy, and online
writing programs should encourage that type of dialogue and self-reflection.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    Readers will have noted that this chapter is not about the nuts and bolts of
an OWC; they also will have noted that the OWI principles, even with their as-
sociated effective practices, do not represent an out-of-the-box recipe for teach-
ing composition online. OWI is a vast, open mission such as befits any writing
instructional setting. Recommendations and ideas are good, but it is impossible
to say generally, "Yes, this is the one way to be successful." The adventure and di-
versity of OWI and of teaching in higher education provide more opportunities

                                                                                                 183

and challenges than that simplistic statement would allow.
    The five instructionally-framed OWI principles addressed in this chapter were

designed to create a structure upon which well-trained and knowledgeable OWI
teachers can build specific instructional approaches and philosophies. They em-
phasize key concerns regarding writing in online settings to help WPAs and teach-
ers to orient and direct themselves in the online setting. The effective practices
offer details and examples to spur OWI faculty thinking for localized settings.
Experienced onsite teachers moving into OWI need to think deeply about who
they are as teachers and then work forward as they initially delve into electronic
environments, being always mindful of the ways many students will access OWCs,
as Chapter 16 addresses. Nonetheless, OWI teachers should take advantage of the
many helpful tools and approaches facilitated and enabled by technology.

    The CCCC OWI Committee has provided these guidelines to facilitate in-
course OWI practice, not to dictate it. In short:

    · The course is a writing course. Teachers should not let it slip into being
        something else, such as a course orienting students to institutional tech-
        nologies.

    · Teachers will want to develop new theory and pedagogy to account for
        the many exciting attributes and opportunities of digital tools ...

    · ... and they also should migrate and adapt their best teaching practices
        and approaches from onsite to online teaching.

    · Writing programs--and institutions themselves--should provide teach-
        ers with appropriate flexibility and independence in how they teach their
        courses.

    · While OWI is inherently an innovative way to teach writing, teachers
        cannot abandon effective practices just because they have found a new
        technology platform or modality. OWCs should maintain core effective
        teaching practices.

    I want to end this chapter with one final, admittedly redundant point: OWI
WPAs and instructors always should remember that we are writing teachers first.
If we do that, a world of teaching opportunity opens up in online settings. The
pedagogy-focused OWI principles are designed to support teachers as they work
to capitalize on that opportunity.

ONLINE WRITING LABS

OWI should be supported by online writing centers, most often referred
to as online writing labs or OWLs. Developing these support structures,
however, can be a daunting endeavor for many institutions, as OWLs are
plagued with issues related to the perception that it is a deficit model for
tutoring, accessibility issues, appropriate tutor training, and technology.
OWL administrators and tutors can use the OWI principles to overcome
many of these obstacles in developing and delivering quality writing in-
struction through tutoring.

nous tutoring, tutor/s, tutoring, tutor selection, tutor training

    Online writing centers, also called online writing labs or OWLs, extend
the reach of traditional writing centers and, in some cases, are developed inde-
pendently of their onsite counterparts. An OWL can be considered an outgrowth
of an onsite writing center in that it offers similar writing support services but
in an online forum, and, many times, to a new type of audience (Hewett, 2002;
Moberg, 2010). With the surge of online courses being offered across the nation,
the need for online writing support also is growing.

    According to the International Writing Centers Association (IWCA) (2013),
writing centers were established "in reaction to the `literacy crisis' of the mid-
1970s" (para. 11). While writing centers often were seen as supplemental sup-
port for writing courses and mistakenly viewed as "drop off" centers where stu-
dents could send or leave their papers for someone else to edit or "fix," writing
center staff have worked diligently to correct this perception by educating facul-
ty and students about the writing center experience and creating a field of study
through research and presentations that undergird writing center theories. As a

Online Writing Labs

result, many onsite writing centers now are recognized as valuable and integral
components of writing programs and writing-across-the-curriculum efforts--
serving students of all levels and in all types of courses where writing is assigned.
While writing center directors and staff continue their struggle to educate facul-
ty and students about the writing process and the collaborative role of the writ-
ing center in helping students become better writers, there is general acceptance
about the usefulness of onsite writing centers; to date, thousands of onsite writ-
ing centers exist world-wide in postsecondary and secondary schools (IWCA,
2013). Interestingly, most likely because they are newer and use technology to
reach students, OWLs are experiencing the same perception issues today that
their onsite counterparts experienced not so many years ago.

    OWLs vary in the services and resources they offer, but they generally pro-
vide students with online writing resources, such as PDF files or Web pages
that relate to the writing process or grammar and mechanics. More technolog-
ically advanced OWLs tend to have interactive resources, allowing students the
opportunity to apply new writing skills as they are learning how to use them.
Some OWLs hire tutors to offer feedback on student writing through asynchro-
nous means, such as email or Web-based software. Other OWLs have tutors
or writing consultants who meet with students and offer synchronous, one-to-
one consultations through text-based chat or voice-based conferencing software.
The form of consultation and feedback is highly dependent on the technology
available at the institution and in the OWL itself, as well as available technology
among the student body. Whatever the makeup of the OWL, providing online
writing support addresses issues of access and inclusivity for online students
because, according to OWI Principle 13, "such reinforcing programs provide
student access to the same support components that students in traditional,
onsite courses receive" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013, p. 26).

    Like traditional writing centers, OWLs vary in their services and philoso-
phy depending on the institution and the unique needs of its students (Breuch,
2005; Hewett, 2002). For instance, some small, private universities may use
a Web page as their OWL, which advertises the school's onsite writing center
services because their entire student body resides on campus, there are no online
courses offered, or students are expected to meet with tutors in person. Two-year
community colleges, on the other hand, serve a student body that generally has
more time constraints than students at private and traditional universities; thus,
they are more likely to offer online resources and consultations (Neaderhiser &
Wolfe, 2009). In addition, both onsite and online universities may outsource
their tutoring to such privatized companies as Smarthinking, Inc. or NetTutor
to meet the needs of the growing online student population ("Smarthinking,"
2013; Thiel, 2010).

    While Beth L. Hewett (2002) classified the functions of OWLs according
to their relationship to the Current-Traditional, Neo-Classical, Neo-Platonic/
Expressivist, and Social Constructivist schools of thought, Lee-Ann Kastman
Breuch (2005) categorized OWLs according to writing philosophy. Her cate-
gories include: the "participant-observer model," which advances the idea that
the goal of a writing center is to "produce better writers, not better writing" (p.
26); the "Storehouse Center," which is akin to a resource center; the "Garret
Center," a place where students learn to find their individual voice and strengths;
and, the "Burkean Parlor" that values collaboration in the writing process. The
model that most writing centers and OWLs do not subscribe to is the fix-it
shop, a place where students drop off or email their papers and allow tutors to
revise, edit, and correct their writing for them. The fix-it shop model has been
the source of many misperceptions garnered by students and faculty about what
onsite writing centers do, and this misperception has been extended to OWLs.
However, even for those OWLs that offer only asynchronous consultations, stu-
dents are expected to be part of the writing process and responsible for their own
revisions and corrections (Breuch, 2005; Dailey, 2004; Hewett, 2002; Neader-
hiser & Wolfe, 2009; Wolfe & Griffin, 2013). In an OWL, just like in an onsite
writing center, students should remain the agents of their own writing.

    Whichever model is used, flexibility with teaching and learning at a distance
helps to establish OWLs as the perfect support service for OWI--that is, if they
actually are available. Results from the CCCC OWI Committee's national fully
online and hybrid surveys indicated that fewer than half of the respondents in
all categories reported the existence of an OWL or any asynchronous or synchro-
nous tutoring available for online students at their institutions (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2011a, 2011b). Offering OWCs without online writing support
has serious implications for students because it creates inequity of available and
accessible support services. Moreover, if an OWL is available, other issues may
affect student learning and retention in online classes due to tutors and students
being unfamiliar with how to use the technology, resources, and services of the
OWL in ways that facilitate quality instruction and learning opportunities. Al-
though OWLs have distinct differences among them, Eric Moberg (2010) iden-
tified several characteristics that successful OWLs have in common: ensuring
access for all students, offering online consultations that focus on the writer and
not the writing, providing tutor training, and using technologies that provide
pedagogical value to the services of an OWL. These characteristics, however, do
not always come about easily and many OWLs face serious challenges in these
areas. While the issues associated with providing quality OWI through the ser-
vices and resources of an OWL are complex, they are not insurmountable.

    Technology has changed the way we read and write (Hewett, 2015a). OWLs

                                                                                                 191
Online Writing Labs

can be considered places where "technology and writing have the ability to con-
verge in the form of tutoring and collaboration" (Neaderhiser & Wolfe, 2009,
p. 49). In this chapter, we argue that OWLs are integral to OWI as sites of
tutoring and collaboration, just as onsite writing centers have been found to be
integral to onsite writing instruction. First, we describe some of the challenges
associated with developing and maintaining online writing center services and
resources--access, consultations, training, and technology--and then we pro-
vide recommendations for how to address those issues at both the institutional
and individual tutor levels. Central to our discussion are OWI Principles 1, 13,
and 14 in their regard of OWLs as a place of access and inclusivity (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2013). Using the OWI principles as guidelines reveals solutions
that institutions and individual tutors can institute to ensure that students re-
ceive a quality education in a distance setting.

OWI'S CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR OWLS

    Online students are like face-to-face students in that they, too, need feedback
at multiple stages of their writing. Learning in a digital environment is different
from learning in a face-to-face classroom, especially when it comes to writing
instruction, because it is text-heavy (Griffin & Minter, 2013; Hewett, 2013,
2015a). Almost all communication is read and written, from the discussion board
to the assignments to the feedback and grading. Therefore, to best assist students
in the online writing process, OWLs should have a pedagogically sound philoso-
phy about teaching writing online, as indicated in OWI Principles 3 and 4. While
some OWI-specific theories need to be developed, traditional composition theo-
ries, pedagogies, and strategies can be migrated from an onsite environment to an
online environment, but they need to be modified or adapted to meet the unique
challenges of online instruction and needs of online students (Breuch & Racine,
2000; Hewett, 2010, 2015b; Olsen, 2002; see also Chapters 1 & 4).

    Before reviewing suggested strategies for developing OWLs and preparing
tutors, it is helpful to have a full understanding of the challenges that OWL
administrators and tutors face. These challenges include access and inclusivity,
online consultations, training and professional development, and technology.
Understanding the complexities of these issues helps administrators and tutors
foresee potential problems, find solutions, and mitigate problems before they ac-
tually occur, before students are lost or not well served, or before money is spent.

Access and Inclusivity

    Primary considerations to developing an OWL should be to ensure that the

192
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

services and resources of the OWL are accessible and inclusive of all students
and offered in a modality that matches students' learning environments. Spe-
cifically, in OWI Principle 1, the CCCC OWI Committee recommended that
all learners, regardless of their physical disabilities, learning challenges, language
backgrounds (i.e., multilingual students), or socioeconomic status, should be
supported in their educational endeavors. Along those same lines, access and
inclusivity also pertain to the modality and medium in which support services
and resources are offered. OWI Principle 13 explained that support for online
students should be offered primarily online with onsite support as a secondary
resource. Furthermore, in order to provide an equitable learning environment
for all students, the CCCC Committee promoted a proactive approach in A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013) to making all online resources and services accessible
and inclusive. We encouraged institutions to address issues of inclusivity and
accessibility at the forefront of any online educational endeavor, instead of as an
afterthought as add-ons or retrofitted alternatives.

    Accessibility and inclusivity address the different needs inherent to a widely
diverse population, which include students, faculty, and staff with physical or
learning disabilities, multilingual backgrounds, or socioeconomic challenges--
the traditionally underserved. Currently, up to 45% of college and university
students are underserved partly due to the lack of access to support services
(Twigg, 2005). Underserved populations are "less likely to persist and graduate
after enrolling in college" and are encouraged by faculty and advisors to choose
a college that offers academic support services, including writing center access,
that meets the needs of the student ("Maximizing," 2012, para. 1). In fact, Carol
A. Twigg (2005) found that providing academic support helped create a learn-
ing community, a place where intellectual and social interactions integrate, thus
increasing inclusivity, which "is critical to persistence, learning, and satisfaction"
(p. 4).

    The implications of OWI Principle 1 are that classrooms, curricula, and
pedagogy should be flexible and employ alternatives for various learners. Taken
further and with OWLs in mind, all resources--including websites and Web re-
sources, services, and any technology being used--should be selected and devel-
oped with inclusivity and accessibility as primary guidelines. To this end, OWL
administrators, tutors, and helpdesk personnel should be trained and comfort-
able serving all students--including multilingual and multicultural students--
regardless of their disability, challenges, or background. OWL administrators
should select technology that is financially available to all students--to enable
them to have distance-based access--and that includes alternatives for sensory,
size, and space preferences.

    In A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013), the CCCC OWI Committee (2013) encour-
aged developing materials and technology that use universal design, which em-
bodies equitable and flexible features for simple and intuitive use. Even with
universal design as a foundation for developing OWL services and resources, it
should be noted that there is no way to foresee and prepare for all situations;
universal design simply "reduces, but does not eliminate, the need for accommo-
dations for students with disabilities" (Burgstahler & Cory, 2008, pp. 24-25).
Accommodations may need to be made with various students, as new situations
arise, and whenever new technologies are employed.

    The principle of providing inclusivity and accessibility grounds all of the
OWI principles and should be considered at the onset of developing solutions
instead of as an afterthought. Accessibility often is considered in terms of disabil-
ity, and while that certainly is one aspect and one reason that OWLs should be
thoughtful of access, disabilities are not the only issues that can prevent students
from receiving an equitable education. One's socioeconomic status may limit
the ability to use synchronous tutoring, for example, in that lack of cameras/
microphones or Web conferencing technology (i.e., technology that might oth-
erwise be available in a campus lab) in one's home or public library may impede
certain kinds of access for geographically distributed students. Varying learning
styles and levels are other issues to consider when designing OWI materials. For
example, some students may learn better with the time flexibility allotted in
asynchronous tutoring; to limit tutoring to only synchronous settings would do
a great disservice to such students.

    As OWI Principle 1 "supersedes and connects to every [OWI] principle" (p.
7), any solutions and recommendations for OWL administrators begin with
access. Accessibility and inclusivity are issues that all learners face, whether in an
online or an onsite course, because they address the different needs inherent to a
widely diverse population. Issues associated with access and inclusivity are more
numerous than can be covered here, but an overarching guideline is that "OWI
teachers should determine their uses of modality and media based not only on
their pedagogical goals but also on their students' likely strengths and access" (p.
9). Instead of throwing a wide net of resources to an unknown audience, OWL
administrators can take specific actions to get to know the student body better.

Recommendations for Access and Inclusivity

    Increasing inclusivity and access in online writing instruction begins by
working with the institution's disability office. Appropriate planning includes
asking the right questions. For instance, asking about the types of accommoda-
tions already afforded to onsite students can inform how they might be adapted

194
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

for online students. In addition, including IT support professionals in the con-
versation with staff from the disability office will help ensure that OWLs and
the resources included in them are all ADA compliant and that the OWLs are
accessible. These institutional partners can help determine which types of tech-
nologies can be used and which should be avoided, particularly when creating
online learning communities.

    A learning community--a place where the academic and social interests of
students potentially can intersect--can increase inclusivity and assist in learning
more about students' strengths and concerns. OWLs offer several opportunities
to build learning communities online, which help to develop trust and rapport
between students and tutors. Common software and familiar online platforms,
such as the institution's LMS, can be used to create an open shell, where the dis-
cussion board invites focus groups with faculty and students to ask them about
their online writing needs. This open forum allows students to get to know
the tutors, become familiar with the online communication process, and know
that their concerns are being heard. Scheduling weekly drop-in groups provides
consistency to the conversations taking place in the discussion board. Additional
forums include Wikis, blogs, and podcasts. An OWL Wiki can be open to every-
one and serve as a place to hold and archive questions about writing, and with
daily monitoring, the tutors can maintain an online presence in the community.
Blogs written and monitored by the tutors about common writing issues will
also increase their online presence. Podcasts with mini-lessons or OWL adver-
tisements can place faces with names, which may encourage students who oth-
erwise might have been reluctant to seek the services. The key is to convey that
the OWL and tutors are available and accessible in various online formats, and
inclusive of all students, whether in fully online, hybrid, or fully onsite courses.
Alternative technologies that assist students with disabilities also should be in-
cluded when these learning communities/resources are established.

    To sustain inclusive online learning communities, it is important to maintain
easy access to and an online presence in the OWL. Online and onsite contact in-
formation, as well as availability information, should be prominent on the OWL
homepage. Student expectations should be highlighted, including anticipated
response times for answers to questions or feedback on papers. Responding to
students within a reasonable, advertised timeframe of 24-48 hours has been an
industry standard for returning emails and phone calls, but with faster technolo-
gy, students are looking for faster ways to communicate. Depending on budget-
ary constraints and institutional needs, administrators might consider reducing
the response time in keeping with student needs and expectations.

    As technology progresses, so do the online literacy levels and expectations
of the students. While the OWL discussion boards, Wikis, blogs, and podcasts

                                                                                                 195
Online Writing Labs

offer multiple ways to transmit information, there should also be multiple ways
for students to retrieve it. OWLs should enable student access through a va-
riety of mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, and electronic
notebooks (see Chapter 16). Finally, social media can provide access as well,
including sending announcements, daily writing tips, OWL advertisements, or
generalized writing advice. Be wary, however, that not all students subscribe to
every form of online access, so redundant messages in alternate media can help
reach a larger student body audience.

    To develop more universally inclusive and accessible online writing support,
OWI Principle 13 indicated that students who choose to take courses online
should receive support services in the modality and medium in which their
course meets with a secondary backup resource onsite (p. 26). This guideline
suggests that students who meet asynchronously through the LMS should have
asynchronous tutoring available, while students who meet synchronously should
have synchronous tutoring available. When possible, having both modalities
available is helpful to learners with varied preferences and access needs. Because
having multiple venues to access writing support is essential to increasing re-
tention in online learners, it is important not to assume that because tutors
may be used to and/or prefer synchronous communication that it is either best
for or preferred by students. When such assistance can occur using the same
technologies as the OWC, the LMS may be called upon for double duty, thus
saving the institution from purchasing or developing a separate OWL platform.
When students can access and participate in various university intellectual and
social circles, they become part of a new community, a learning community that
promotes persistence. Thus, inclusivity and accessibility are foundational to the
other OWI principles discussed in this chapter.

Online Consultations

    Online consultations also are referred to as online tutoring or online con-
ferences. According to Stephen Neaderhiser and Joanna Wolfe (2009), such
"one-to-one interactions between a consultant and a writer ... can take place
synchronously, in real time ... or they can take place asynchronously through
technologies such as email" (p. 54). Online conferencing, however, is often
viewed as being inferior to face-to-face conferences (Carlson & Apperson-Wil-
liams, 2003; Hewett, 2010, 2015b; Wolfe & Griffin, 2012). The online distance
between tutor and student often is considered impersonal where the "tutoring
table is replaced with a computer screen: cold, sterile, and, to many, uninviting"
(Carlson & Apperson-Williams, 2003, p. 233). Even tutors who like their online
tutoring work may express this concern (Ehmann Powers, 2010).

196
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

    In addition, there is a common assumption among some scholars that online
consultations lack the quality of instruction that comes from face-to-face tutor-
ing, which often stems from a perceived lack of conversation (Wolfe & Griffin,
2012) and a perception that conversation is always superior to problem-cen-
tered instruction, a precept with which Hewett (2010, 2015b) disagreed given
the text-heavy focus of online tutoring and OWI overall. Likewise, Wolfe and
Griffin (2012) reported that there are innovative OWI methods that are just as
effective as face-to-face consultations, and that in some instances were preferred
by students over in-person tutoring sessions. In fact, while a majority of tutors
surveyed preferred face-to-face consultations because they could work better
from body language and facial cues, an overwhelming majority of students pre-
ferred the online environment. Students reported liking the convenience and
time-saving aspects of online conferencing, as well as being able to make imme-
diate changes to their papers during the tutoring sessions. Students especially
liked sharing a screen and the audio aspect of some online conferencing.

    Despite student preferences found in Wolfe and Griffin's (2012) research,
Neaderhiser and Wolfe (2009) reported that from their survey, only about 10%
of all online conferencing took place synchronously. This low percentage may
be attributed to several possibilities including funding, unfamiliarity with more
advanced types of software and how they can be used effectively for OWI, or, as
mentioned previously, access needs of the student body. As Connie Mick and
Geoffrey Middlebrook indicate in Chapter 3, asynchronous technologies are
more commonly used in OWCs, which may be an issue of cost; similarly, they
are more common for OWLs at this point in their development. Consequently,
email is used about 90% of the time for online conferencing (Wolfe & Griffin,
2012), and online consultations can also take place on discussion boards.

    Asynchronous and synchronous conferences offer different challenges with
engaging students; however, there are ways to overcome those challenges that
can be satisfying for students (Wolfe & Griffin, 2012). Whether using asyn-
chronous or synchronous technology for online consultations, it is important to
consider pedagogy. Traditional face-to-face classroom pedagogy often does not
directly transfer to online environments (hence, the "yin" and "yang" of OWI
Principles 3 and 4, per Chapter 1), and effective OWI requires online-focused
training for tutors and students.

Asynchronous Tutoring

    Asynchronous tutoring is a complex process that requires training to do it
well. Hewett (2010) explained that "the roles of teacher and tutor naturally in-
tersect" (p. 8), but one difference between the two is that tutors "listen, read, and
provide formative feedback uninvolved with grading" (p. 8). The most common

                                                                                                 197
Online Writing Labs

types of asynchronous tutoring include email and discussion boards. As Hewett
(2010, 2015b) indicated, some critics argue that asynchronous consultations
do not promote conversation between tutors and students because it is delayed
communication and any interactions that may occur over email, for instance,
are short-lived. Even though there is potential for students to email additional
questions to a previous tutor, the dynamic often is criticized as being a question/
answer session instead of a dialogue. Additionally, technology most often asso-
ciated with asynchronous tutoring, such as email and discussion boards, often
is seen as limiting conversation because there is no shared space for students
and tutors to view papers together and discuss multiple questions that usually
arise in face-to-face consultations (Neaderhiser & Wolfe, 2009). An additional
challenge of asynchronous tutoring involves the funding to build or source it to
begin with. Some institutions outsource feedback services to for-profit educa-
tional companies. Such services may be financially difficult for institutions to
maintain, and there is concern (often expressed anecdotally on listservs) that the
feedback received from personnel outside of an institution may counter what
instructors expect at the students' institutions.

    Opportunities to interact with online students in meaningful ways, however,
are highly dependent on how tutors use the OWL technology and, of course,
on how tutors are trained. For example, when providing asynchronous com-
mentary, tutors should envision what happens after the student's paper has been
returned. Is there opportunity for follow-up and interaction with the tutor? If
so, how does a tutor continue a dialogue about a student's paper and engage the
student to think through and write his or her own revisions? George Cooper,
Kara Bui, and Linda Riker (2003) reported that such a relationship can take
place, that "there are online strategies for establishing a relationship between
the tutor and writer, for empowering writers to share in their own revision, and
for dealing with specifics of grammar and mechanics--all done by relying on
collaborative techniques and leading to a facilitated knowledge between tutor
and client" (p. 257). Additionally, students benefit from training--either in class
or through OWL-developed and provided videos--in how to read the tutorial
so that they can make the best use of the advice they receive (Hewett, 2015b,
2010).

    It may seem that providing written comments on student writing is fair-
ly straightforward, but once again, the type of commentary should align with
the philosophy of the OWL and the institution. Those philosophies can range
from a holistic view, where writing from invention to proofreading is seen as an
integrated, generative, circular process, to a more categorized approach, where
writing is divided into content, style, format, and grammar and mechanics. If
an OWL subscribes to a holistic philosophy of writing, then a tutor's strategies

198
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

and comments should reflect that philosophy. Even when a student asks for help
with only grammar and mechanics, there are ways to provide that assistance
without correcting his or her paper. One of those ways is the Four-Step Interven-
tion Process that Hewett (2011, 2015b; see also Effective Practice 3.4), a prob-
lem-centered lesson approach that teaches students what the problem is, why
it is a problem, how to address it or avoid it, and asking them to do something
about it. Such a process involves modeling different writing possibilities for the
student using the students writing, which should not be confused with doing for
them. It is a teaching process that can be enacted for any level of problem from
higher-to-lower order concerns.

Recommendations for Asynchronous Tutoring

    All writers have their own strengths and weaknesses, as well as unique back-
grounds, and it is important that tutors understand there is no one tried and
true approach to writing. That said, there are some strategies for providing com-
ments that are more helpful than others. Before commenting on a student pa-
per, tutors should be familiar with various levels of writing competence and the
challenges that go along with those levels, such as how novice writers often voice
frustration with issues of control or being able to make the words on a page
reflect their thinking. Novice writers also often mention that they are unsure
about how to organize their thoughts enough to write them coherently. All of
these factors can influence a tutoring session and tutors have to know when,
where, and how to comment in ways that will help students better understand
the process of writing versus getting an assignment right using any particular
definition of that word. As with OWI overall, where the best online writing
teacher is an experienced writing teacher, the best online tutors will understand
writing regardless of setting.

    Text-based asynchronous conferencing is both common and useful, but it
also places stress on students' reading abilities (and, according to Hewett, 2015a,
on teachers' and tutors' writing abilities). One way to help students is to con-
textualize the feedback within the student's writing and in connection to the
assignment (when available) because the online setting often lacks the tutor's
body language that student might use to make sense of the response. Another
way is to build redundancy into the feedback (a strategy outlined in Chapter 4)
to enable the student to triangulate the communication's meaning and assess its
value to the writing overall. These strategies have the additional benefits of ad-
dressing access concerns such as those inherent to writers with neural processing
disorders as well as those with weaker reading skills relative to instructional text.

    To further help students with varied learning styles, asynchronous confer-
encing does not have to be entirely text-based. Successful OWLs use a variety

                                                                                                 199
Online Writing Labs

of technologies, such as audio and audio/video feedback (for which students
need speakers, an issue of access). Wolfe and Griffin (2012) reported on research
that suggested "audio feedback was more effective than text-based feedback in
conveying nuance and was associated with increased student involvement, con-
tent retention, and student satisfaction" (p. 63). They also stated that "audio
feedback was associated with the perception that the instructor cared about the
student" (p. 63). Although more research is needed on both text-based and au-
dio feedback in asynchronous settings, it is not difficult for tutors to provide
such feedback with adequate training on what kinds of feedback might be most
helpful. Free software allows tutors to screen capture and narrate comments that
students can see and hear when they receive their returned essays. Audio and
audio/video comments also can be combined with written comments for a more
comprehensive review that provides students with written next steps or other
summary material. With some practice, audio and audio/video commentary
does not take any more time than written comments alone. As a caution, how-
ever, unless the commentary is limited by time, it is easy to provide the student
with an unfocused or overly lengthy response that may confuse their efforts to
revise (Vincelette, 2013; Vincelette & Bostic, 2013).

    Other ways to make asynchronous online conferences effective and satisfying
include knowing how to use various technologies to draw out information from
students and engage them in the writing process. First, it is important for tutors
and students to establish goals or learning expectations (Hewett, 2010, 2015b;
Ryan & Zimmerelli, 2010). Expectation and goal setting can be accomplished
in several ways, such as having a student explain the assignment and concerns in
an email or online form before submitting a paper to an online tutor. Further-
more, expectation and goal setting provides students with a moment of reflec-
tion about their writing in relation to the assignment, and it sets a common goal
between student and tutor (Hewett, 2010, 2015b).

    To create an asynchronous virtual relationship between tutor and student,
tutors can provide personalized comments of the global and local kind (Cooper,
Bui, & Riker, 2003; Crump, 2003; Hewett, 2010, 2011, 2015b; Ryan & Zim-
merelli, 2010). Global comments, sometimes provided as opening comments,
can appeal to students and may create a personal tone that prepares them for
what follows, especially when a student's name is used and the tutor uses com-
ments that are informal and friendly (Cooper, Bui, & Riker, 2003; Hewett,
2010, 2015b). Opening commentary can be used to get acquainted with the
student and to introduce the student to what will follow by offering general ob-
servations of the paper that invite the student to continue reading and actively
think through revisions.

    For localized comments, dialogue, one of the main criticisms of asynchro-

200
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

nous conferencing, can be promoted through carefully structured instructional
comments. Cooper, Bui, & Riker (2003) suggested using questions to facilitate
a Socratic approach to "engage the learner, not to manipulate him" (p. 259) in
the online conference:

         Ideally, the tutor asks questions before giving directions and
         engages the client's own knowledge to solve a problem... .
         writing [is] a dialogic process within the mind of the writer,
         especially to initiate, recognize, and cultivate the dialogic
         process used by experienced writers. Online tutors can also
         use questions to engage writers in this exercise. Because the
         tutor is not waiting for an answer, the writer is free to act as
         she wishes. The door to genuine contemplation is open and
         the writer remains in control. (p. 259)

    In other words, the dialogue that may result from an asynchronous confer-
ence made possible through a tutor's written comments is "intended to create
dialogue within the writer's mind" (p. 260). One common suggestion is that
instructional comments should be structured by using praise or a compliment
followed by a genuine question that considers a weak spot in the paper (Coo-
per, Bui, & Riker, 2003). Hewett (2010) recommended that tutors "offer clear,
honest, critical responses to the writing. This strategy includes phrasing, such
as: `I'm awed by your strength in this situation'" (p. 123), followed by critical
feedback like "`I'm confused by this entire paragraph. What did you want readers
to understand?'" (pp. 123-124). She also recommended using straightforward,
linguistically direct language that has semantic integrity in terms of not asking
rhetorical or closed ended questions or using linguistically indirect (conditional
and suggestive) statements that students were unlikely to use in revising their
writing. Hewett (2010, 2011, 2015b) considered so-called "genuine" questions
to be what, when, where, why, who, and how because actually addressing them
requires thoughtful answers that might lead to revisions when posed with some
instruction.

    When students ask for feedback on only grammar and mechanics, tutors
may have a tendency to want to edit and correct student papers, but choosing
patterns of errors is much more effective than marking every mistake in a student
draft (Cooper, Bui, & Riker, 2003; Hewett, 2010, 2015b; Ryan & Zimmerelli,
2010). One reason for its effectiveness is that students can become overwhelmed
with new information during conference. There is little value in pointing out 15
errors that a student cannot fully address; "students can only absorb so much
feedback during one sitting" (Hewett, 2015b, 2010, p. 91), whether that is a
synchronous or asynchronous event. Hewett also explained that "the student is

                                                                                                 201
Online Writing Labs

being taught through the piece of writing" (2010, p. 91); therefore, when tutors
point out patterns, they should also provide an explanation of the error using the
student's own writing and how to fix it (Hewett, 2010, 2011, 2015b) similar to
what would happen in a face-to-face interaction (Cooper, Bui, & Riker, 2003).
This practice allows for use of the 4-step intervention process (Hewett, 2010,
2011, 2015b), for example, and hopefully leads to greater student engagement.
With this strategy--useful for global, content-level issues as well--students are
alerted of a persistent problem throughout their paper, and they are tasked with
identifying similar errors and revising them on their own. Depending on their
own time frames and on the OWLs policies, students typically can return to
the OWL for additional help, but if they are under constraints, the response
provides them with a starting point for analyzing their own writing and learning
how to improve it.

    By using a variety of tools and strategies, asynchronous conferences can be
personalized and they can be an effective means of helping students improve
their writing. Distance does not always equate to a cold, sterile communication
despite educators' expressed fears. OWL technology affords many opportunities
to create meaningful and helpful relationships in educational settings.

Synchronous Tutoring

    In their research study on synchronous conferencing, Wolfe and Griffin
(2012) found that "87% of student writers who participated in an online ses-
sion either preferred the online environment or had no environment preference"
(p. 81). The most common reasons cited for preferring online conferences were
convenience and real-time editing--meaning students liked not having to be in
a specific geographic place at a certain time--and being able to make changes
to their papers during the session. Student criticisms of online tutoring in this
same study were mostly about problems with technology, such as audio difficul-
ties, but others noted that they had a hard time communicating their ideas in
an electronic medium (Wolfe & Griffin, 2012). To add to that, Hewett (2006)
noted that students who do not perform well when writing in instructional set-
tings also may experience challenges with online conferences because they have
to respond in real time and many times the writing they produce is immediately
visible. Despite these challenges, synchronous online conferencing software is
advancing in ways that will only increase how tutors and students can interact.

    Some programs allow students and tutors to share a common virtual space
where a student's paper can be viewed by both parties, a whiteboard that both
student and tutor have access to, as well as audio and voice components to
the platform. The conference, therefore, does not have to be entirely text-based
when synchronous. Providing that they are accessible to students, these pro-

202
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

grams enable students to experience tutoring in a group situation where a tutor
can work with one student, but other students who are waiting "in line" can
see and potentially benefit from this instruction because they can hear the con-
versation taking place and all participants in the virtual conference "room" can
see the whiteboard or student paper.1 Conferences also can occur in a separate
virtual room where the student and tutor have a one-on-one interaction away
from other students' view and hearing. While these platforms are designed to
replicate face-to-face interactions as closely as possible, Hewett (2006) cautioned
that some instructors may "oversimplify the pedagogical transfer between tra-
ditional and synchronous writing instruction" (p. 6). She also emphasized that
OWI "requires highly developed verbal teaching skills and vocabulary about
writing along with strategies for encouraging students to commit to writing out
their thinking as part of the conference" (p. 6). In other words, the OWL tutor
not only needs to understand writing theoretically and pedagogically but also
should have the vocabulary at hand for explaining the writing concerns at the
student's level and in ways that encourage students to enact writing development
or change while in the tutorial itself.

Recommendations for Synchronous Tutoring

    One of the best things about the wide array of technologies today is just
that--there is usually more than one way to do something. For instance, syn-
chronous conferencing can take place using a variety of LMS or conferencing
technologies, but also through IM or other chat programs. Chat-based tech-
nologies resemble the Burkean Parlor ideal, which is supposed to foster a more
interactive conversation that is persistent; such technologies enable students to
save and archive chats for later review. Other synchronous technologies available
for online consultations include the telephone, audio and screen capture pro-
grams, and real-time screen sharing software. For students who do not do well
in text-based synchronous environments, tutors can meet with students through
free video programs, again, keeping access in mind regarding cameras and/or
microphones (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013; Hewett, 2010, 2015a, 2015b).

    As with any type of conference, setting goals for a tutoring session gives
student and tutor direction and helps both use their time efficiently. Thus, tu-
tors need to learn how to "assist their students in setting their own agendas for
conferences and in making informed choices about how to apply the instruc-
tion" (Hewett, 2010, p. 50). Asynchronous online conferencing and text-based
synchronous conferencing offer unique opportunities for students to use writing
to talk about their writing, but they may not quite know how to do that. A good
way to begin that conversation is to have students talk about the assignment and
their process in completing the assignment followed by questions from the tutor

                                                                                                 203
Online Writing Labs

about what the student liked best and least about his or her writing (Hewett,
2010). Again, this work requires practice, and as suggested in OWI Principle
14, tutors should practice this kind of scenario and dialogue using various types
of technology from both the student and tutor perspectives (see also Hewett &
Ehmann, 2004).

Tutor Selection, Training, and Professional Development

    OWI is still a fairly new endeavor and requires new skills. While it may be
partly true that anyone who teaches in a classroom can teach online, there are
some qualifiers. According to OWI Principle 7 (pp. 17-19):

    · Teachers should be carefully selected and then trained in OWI before
        they teach an online course.

    · Experienced writing teachers--who want to teach in a digital environ-
        ment--should be the first considered for teaching online.

    This principle applies to OWL tutors as much as OWI teachers. Tutors who
are unfamiliar with tutoring onsite may not understand the nuances of tutoring
online; furthermore, if they do not want to tutor online, their dissatisfaction
may rub off onto the students with whom they interact. Online instruction
does not fit every instructor's personality, and it is important that instructors
understand the differences between classroom instruction and OWI and then
decide where they would be better suited. Some educators may be comfortable
and effective doing both online and face-to-face instruction, which should be
encouraged, and these same principles apply to OWL tutors as well.

    OWI Principle 14 emphasized the necessity for OWL tutor training and pro-
fessional development that matches the environment in which tutors instruct
writing (p. 28). As Chapter 1 discussed and Beth L. Hewett and Christa Eh-
mann (2004) argued, immersion into the environment in which one will teach
or tutor is crucial to being prepared to assist students with and through that
setting. Hence, tutor training--and this includes WPAs or OWL administrators
who supervise or evaluate online tutors--needs to be scheduled and practiced
in the technological modality and medium that enables tutors to experience
what their students will experience and to practice helping their peers in that
environment as well.

Tutor Selection

    Tutor selection naturally is an important consideration. Neaderhiser and
Wolfe (2009) reported that some schools use graduate students or tutors with
only one year of experience to conduct online consultations, while other schools
carefully selected qualified and experienced faculty as staff who were familiar

204
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

with online tutoring. And other schools may use relatively inexperienced un-
dergraduate peer tutors for OWL tutoring. This split in tutor selection policies
suggests that some OWI administrators see online tutoring as a regular duty that
any writing center tutor can do and others see it as an area of expertise. Novice
or untrained tutors cause problems for both OWLs and onsite writing centers
(Hewett, 2015a, 2010; Moberg, 2010). However, as Moberg (2010) stated, "one
key to the success of an online tutoring program is not the distance between
tutor and student, but the training each receives" (p. 3).

    According to OWI Principle 14, administrators should select online tu-
tors based on their (1) tutoring potential and/or experience with writing; (2)
strengths in expressing writing instruction in writing; and (3) comfort level with
online technologies, which can be developed further in training (p. 28; Hewett,
2010, 2015b; Hewett & Ehmann, 2004). Furthermore, to assess their tutors
well, OWL administrators should receive the same training. Effective practices
for OWI Principle 14 indicated that:

    · OWL supervisors should have "equal or superior" training and experi-
        ences in writing instruction and OWI than the tutors.

    · OWI assessment should "occur in the setting and modalities that the
        teacher uses in the online writing course" (p. 19).

    · OWI assessment should not be any more or less rigorous than traditional
        classroom assessment.

    Each of these assessment recommendations is important to consider because
instruction in an online environment has unique characteristics that are not part
of the traditional classroom experience or at least do not match in any exact
manner. A well-trained and experienced OWL supervisor will understand the
complexities of online instruction, such as the challenges of engaging students
at a distance in a primarily text-based venue and of providing effective feedback
that encourages dialogue in this environment. Such administrators will be able
to better assess the quality of instruction taking place in synchronous and asyn-
chronous settings due to their experiences in the settings as both "student" and
"tutor."

Training Tutors

    According to OWI Principle 14, before tutors assist students in online con-
ferences, they should have training appropriate to online tutoring (p. 28). The
nature of the online conference, whether asynchronous or synchronous, presents
challenges to tutors trained solely to do onsite, face-to-face writing center tutor-
ing. According to Leslie Olsen (2002), "tutors accustomed to speaking directly
with students when providing feedback must diagnose written work, establish
conference priorities, and provide feedback--without the student" (p. 2). Lee-

                                                                                                 205
Online Writing Labs

Ann Kastman Breuch and Sam J. Racine (2000) contended that tutors typically
had to accomplish this feat without much training directly related to OWI or
negotiating online spaces. Training online tutors using online technology and
strategies developed or adapted for OWI is essential because "training used in
f2f centers does not translate easily to online writing centers" (Breuch & Racine,
2000, p. 246; see also Hewett, 2010, 2015b; Hewett & Ehmann, 2004).

    OWL training should focus on three specific areas. Tutors must "learn to (1)
teach writing, (2) teach writing in an online environment, and (3) teach writ-
ing in a primarily text-based environment" (p. 17). Because OWI is fairly new
and unexplored in many ways, and because technology constantly evolves and
changes the way we read and write, OWI training for the course or a tutorial is
not a one-time event, and it should be treated as ongoing professional develop-
ment for tutors. For this reason, tutors should be trained to tolerate error with
technology, as well as with student writing. Additionally, this training should
be formal training developed by experts in OWI, and it is recommended that
experienced online instructors mentor novice OWL tutors, as well.

    As Hewett (2006) stated, there is still much to research on the subject of
effective OWI (see Chapter 17); however, Wolfe and Griffin (2012), Hewett
(2010, 2015b), and Hewett and Ehmann (2004) made strong cases for the need
to train tutors with the technology they will be using. More importantly, tutors
need to be trained to teach about writing in online environments because simply
asking questions of students is insufficient (Hewett, 2006). Hewett and Ehmann
(2004) outlined five common educational principles that are fundamental to
training online writing tutors as well as OWI teachers: investigation, individual-
ization, immersion, association, and reflection. Thus, as addressed through OWI
Principles 7 and 14, there are several layers of necessary tutor training: technol-
ogy, teaching, teaching writing, and teaching in an online environment (p. 17,
28). The point remains that tutoring online requires specialized skills, some of
which were addressed by Hewett (2006) and Hewett and Ehmann (2004):

    · Online tutors need to be able to recognize, name, and teach writing
        problems using appropriate writing-focused vocabulary written and spo-
        ken at levels students can comprehend.

    · Online tutors need to understand the affordances and constraints of dif-
        ferent technologies in learning environments, such as how and when to
        use a chat box, a whiteboard or shared space, and audio functions to
        encourage student participation.

    · Students have varying levels of competence with technology, and a great
        deal of interaction between tutor and student can be spent on explaining
        the technology or instruction itself. It appears that both types of conver-
        sation are inevitable, and instructors need to be trained to incorporate

206
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

        this functional dialogue into conversations about student writing and
        idea development. Likewise, tutors would benefit from knowing how to
        use various functions within a program for different types of dialogue,
        such as audio for instructional purposes and the chat box for more func-
        tional directions, such as how to use the whiteboard or other program
        features during a session.
    · Time and space constraints can affect the quality of an online confer-
        ence; thus, it would be advantageous for tutors to practice how to teach
        writing through writing within the typical online conference time set by
        the OWL administrator. For instance, tutors should know how to teach
        effective thesis development using a variety of media, such as audio, the
        whiteboard, and chat, and ensure students are part of that process and
        participate in the session.

    Additional training considerations for tutors include learning how to address
multiple issues within the same conversation. For instance, Hewett's (2006) em-
pirical research study on using whiteboard technology for text-based, synchro-
nous OWI indicated that "these whiteboard interactions were highly writing
task-oriented ... and focused particularly on developing student writing and/or
ideas" (p. 5). The interactions that took place demonstrated that students and
tutors were having conversations about the writing under review and the writ-
ing process. About half of the conversations, however, also included dialogue
"toward interpersonal connections, facilitating the tutorial process, and commu-
nicating about using the whiteboard" (Hewett, 2006, p. 5); thus, this study has
implications for learning more about how to handle meta-conversations during
a tutoring session as well as for understanding that a great deal of synchronous
tutoring time may be focused interpersonally rather than on the writing itself.

    Students come to online conferences with various levels of competency with
technology; thus, tutors have to be prepared to address some technology con-
cerns during a tutoring session. They also have to find ways to help students
understand the type of instruction they are receiving especially when various
types of technology are used, such as the combination of audio, text, and white-
board in some conferencing programs. Hewett (2006) recommended that tutor
training should include helping tutors find value and balance in these various
types of necessary dialogue during tutoring sessions. While it may appear over-
whelming to find balance between writing instruction and fielding questions
about technology, there are training strategies where tutors can learn effective
and efficient ways to do that. Role-playing that reflects scenarios that tutors will
typically encounter is an effective training strategy (CCCC OWI Committee,
2013; Hewett & Ehmann, 2004). This is an important aspect of training be-
cause as Hewett (2006) explained, particularly "in a synchronous setting, online

                                                                                                 207
Online Writing Labs

instructors must be able to think quickly about students' expressed needs and
to flexibly adjust both their vocabulary and strategies while teaching students
accurately" (pp. 6-7). Similar issues need to be addressed in asynchronous tutor
training (Hewett, 2004-2005, 2011, 2015b).

    Tutors need to practice how to ask students to write or talk about their
writing using various forms of technology, and they must be able to discern
what students want or need through their responses. Because some conferencing
programs may include audio components, there is opportunity for this dialogue
to take place orally; however, as mentioned earlier in this chapter, those who
create the OWL should not assume that all students will have a microphone
or speakers, so tutors need to be prepared to initiate the purpose of the con-
ference using only writing in the text chat. This, too, requires practice because
tutors have to learn how to engage the student immediately with appropriate,
correct, and inviting language with which students are familiar and comfortable
(Hewett, 2010, 2015b). According to Hewett (2010, 2015b), tutors also need
practice with how to instruct students on their writing using only writing, which
should use language that is straightforward and easy to understand on the stu-
dent's end--language with semantic integrity. Ways to accomplish this include
using common guidelines for online writing, such as chunking text into shorter
paragraphs; using formatting tools when possible, such as bullets, numbering,
and highlighting or word processing revision marks (strikethroughs to substi-
tute words) on a whiteboard; and using graphics when appropriate and possible
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013; Hewett, 2011, 2015b).

    Equally important is the idea that tutors need training in using pedagogical-
ly sound practices that teach writing according to the institution's philosophy.
One way to accomplish this is to allow veteran online instructors who have a
solid understanding of composition theory to mentor novice OWL tutors. Ad-
ditionally, tutors need to understand the affordances and constraints of various
technologies and how to use them in pedagogically sound ways. For instance,
Hewett (2006) outlined the distinctions between a text-chat box and a white-
board. Both are text-based tools; however, each one has unique instructional
benefits that should be explained and understood by tutors. For instance, a
whiteboard affords the opportunity for tutors and students to both view a paper
and make immediate changes, whereas comments in a textbox may be more
explanatory about a specific writing issue.

    A challenge regarding OWL training and professional development is that
many training programs focus primarily on the features of the institution's LMS
or on functional training on the various programs used for tutoring, such as how
to use track changes and comments features in the word processing program,
how to use IM-chat, or how to use the whiteboard and shared Web spaces. Fa-

208
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

miliarity and comfort with technology is important; indeed, Wolfe and Griffin
(2012) found functional literacy to be a key component in student satisfac-
tion with online tutoring. However, technology should not be the singular focal
point of OWL preparation, as one can extrapolate from OWI Principle 2 (p.
11). Tutors and OWI teachers should have a working knowledge of, and think
critically about, various learning theories and how they apply to their work in
the OWL, which necessitates some rhetorical understanding of the technology.
The tools of technology allow tutors to connect with students at a distance and
it is crucial to the job, but the writing instruction itself should be considered of
greater importance and should be stressed differently from technology in OWL
training.

Preparing Faculty and Students

    Once an OWL is established, faculty need training on the support services
available to students because they are the ones on the front line who can per-
suade students to seek support. In The State of the Art of OWI (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2011c), some faculty reported not knowing whether their institu-
tion had a writing center or OWL. Other respondents reported knowing there
was an OWL, but they did not know how tutoring took place, who the tutors
were, or how they were selected. This vacuum of awareness can happen when the
writing center is a separate entity from an English or composition department,
but it also can be a consequence of not providing appropriate training. Subse-
quently, when faculty are unaware of the resources at their own institutions,
students often are left without support; some faculty even may refer students to
OWLs outside of their own institution in the belief that their own institution is
not capable or set up to help their students.

    Formal training programs in OWI should not be restricted to faculty only;
students need adequate preparation to thrive in online environments, as well.
Student preparation is linked to accessibility, and one way to ensure that all
students succeed in an online learning environment is to provide training for
them, most often accomplished through orientation. Students have perceptions
about OWI, such as unfamiliarity with the time requirements, how to use the
technology, and the necessary interactions that need to take place. These com-
mon misconceptions about online courses justify student training, even for an
OWL. When using an OWL, students have to be made aware of the various
resources and services, but, more importantly, they need to know how to use
them effectively.

    Findings from the CCCC OWI Committee surveys (2011a, 2011b) indi-
cated that even when online tutoring was available, "as many as 30% (fully
online) and 47% (hybrid) reported that students did not receive any instruction

                                                                                                 209
Online Writing Labs

for using those tutoring services" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 9). Fur-
thermore, when faculty were asked how students were prepared for using online
tutoring services, some disturbing comments included:

    · "Linked in courses"
    · "I don't know"
    · "No online tutoring is offered"
    · "Again, not sure"
    · "Again, it's a case-by-case basis: a bit more than nothing, but not much

        since we do not have the resources for this." (CCCC OWI Committee,
        2011a & 2011b, Q29).

    This lack of faculty knowledge about the institution's OWL--if it indeed
existed--mirrors a lack of student preparation for using the OWL, and it sug-
gests an assumption that online students are familiar and comfortable with tech-
nology or with using technology in educational settings, which may not be the
case at all (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c). Student orientation should cover
more than the features of the LMS in use or the conferencing software of the
OWL because students may not know how to use technology to learn to write.
In other words, students may not know that asynchronous discussion, for ex-
ample, affords them the opportunity to think through their responses and refine
their writing before posting it to the board. Likewise, students should be given
direction on how to use OWL handouts, such as how to study a particular
sentence-level issue and then follow up with practice in a live tutoring session.
When going into synchronous tutoring sessions, students should be prepared for
the typical time online conferences take, how they are facilitated, what kinds of
technology are used, how to use that technology, and what to do after they have
completed an online conference (Hewett, 2010, 2015b).

    During tutoring sessions, some students may not know how to ask for help
or what to ask for, which is another reason that tutor training is so important.
It takes skill to get students to talk about their writing and to articulate where
they need help. Furthermore, once a tutoring session is over or a paper has been
returned with comments, some students do not know what to do with the feed-
back. It is important, therefore, that tutors help students make sense of what
they received in the various media used during the session. Lynn Anderson-In-
man (1997) stated that OWLs that appear to work well are those that attempt
to help students understand how to use the technology to improve their writing
skills. In other words, tutors and instructors need to teach students "how to read
and interpret any textual feedback or advice, and how to make decisions about
the uses of that feedback in their writing" (p. 26). This kind of student prepara-
tion will help students understand that an OWL is not a drop-off center; rather

210
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

it is a place where they can get help with their writing, which they own from
beginning to end.

    Student training and the ownership of writing that it should support also may
help to assuage criticism that OWLs emphasize "drill and practice," where gram-
mar is stressed over other aspects of writing (Dailey, 2004). Drill-and-practice
certainly can become a focus for an OWL when only one or two less interactive
technologies are used, such as providing handouts as only PDFs or hyperlinked
pages. And if these handouts or Web pages cover only grammatical issues, then
such a reputation probably has been earned. However, Claire Charlton (2006)
said that more effective OWLs "go beyond grammar to offer brainstorming and
editing self-help" (para. 5), and Muriel Harris and Michael Pemberton (1995)
argued for a combination of asynchronous and synchronous technologies to be
used for tutoring. These preferences return us to the definition of an OWL and
the services it may offer.

    While some institutions do offer student orientation, the CCCC OWI
Committee noted problems with orientation that affect student preparation for
OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c). For instance, almost half of all orien-
tations offered were in a face-to-face environment instead of online. Providing
face-to-face orientation for online learning is counter to the benefits students
would receive from being immersed in the very environment in which they are
expected to learn. This immersion would offer students a better sense of whether
they are suited for online learning, or at least alert them to the type of experi-
ences they can expect, a point explained in detail in OWI Principle 10. Such
immersion, however, needs to occur at the institutional level so that students are
familiar with the policies and procedures of a distance-based program at their
school, as well as to teach them how to use the institutional LMS and deal with
challenges or problems they may encounter with it. Students need LMS orienta-
tion because each course is set up somewhat differently, and they have to know
where to find assignments and course materials, how to submit assignments, and
how to access other portals used in instructor-specific preferences (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2013). OWL administrators also should be aware of any institu-
tional and classroom orientations so that their own orientation can complement
and expand on what students already have been provided. Once students know
what to expect and how to use the resources and services of the OWL, they may
be more likely to use the OWL.

Technology

    Online courses suggest an open learning environment where students can
access the classroom 24/7; therefore, IT support systems should be in place to al-

                                                                                                 211
Online Writing Labs

low students to complete their work at any time as well. This issue, as addressed
in OWI Principle 13 (p. 26), is one of access and inclusivity per OWI Principle
1 (p. 7), but it also is one of "enabling students to use the digital educational
environment more fully" per OWI Principle 10 (p. 26). Since students are work-
ing in an online environment, support should be provided in that same manner.
Such support includes an OWL for reading and writing instruction, online li-
braries, technical support, and even "distance-based student counseling" (p. 25).
Results from the two OWI national surveys, however, indicated that fewer than
half of the respondents in all institution-type categories reported the existence
of an OWL or any asynchronous or synchronous tutoring available for online
students at their institutions (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a & 2011b).

    When online tutoring was available, it was mostly asynchronous tutoring,
which Wolfe and Griffin (2012) found in their study as well. In The State of the
Art of OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c) it also was noted that "quite a few
respondents in both settings indicated either no access to online writing center
assistance or a need for students to come in to a traditional brick-and-mortar
writing center if one was available" (p. 9). Once again, access was at the forefront
of this disturbing statistic. Many students who take online courses are physical-
ly unable to come to campus for a wide variety of reasons. If institutions offer
online courses, then distance students should get the support they need using
distance technology as indicated in OWI Principle 13 (p. 26).

    The versatility of various technologies is an added benefit when developing
OWL resources. It can be helpful to use both the asynchronous and synchro-
nous modalities along with a variety of accessible media, as discussed in this
chapter. For instance, when creating materials about a particular writing issue,
such as how to write a thesis statement, many instructors will create a handout
usually in the form of a word-processed document or an accessible PDF. But
there are other ways to reach students who have particular disabilities or learning
styles. For instance, podcasts, screen-capture programs with audio, and videos
are useful complements to text-based handouts, and they address students who
have different learning preferences or strengths. Transcripts for audio-based tu-
torials (including pre-developed tutorial materials designed for a broader stu-
dent audience) are a must, and such alternatives as Braille and large print should
be offered as reasonable accommodations (p. 7).

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    The development of an OWL is essential to academic success for online writ-
ing students, and any institution that offers online courses should provide such
support for students. In short, online students should have adequate support for

212
                                                                                         Martinez and Olsen

the unique issues they must deal with when writing and learning in an online
environment (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013). Expecting online students--
particularly those in fully online OWCs, but also those in hybrid OWCs--to
use onsite resources is detrimental to their learning since they are not given the
opportunity to take full advantage of the very technology that they are expected
to use for their learning. This problem also is a crucial issue of accessibility since
many online students are physically, logistically, or geographically unable to ac-
cess onsite resources. If an institution does not provide online support by way of
an OWL, online students who write for any course and at any level simply are not
being served in an equitable fashion. To this end, we recommend the following:

    · Issues associated with inclusivity and accessibility should be at the fore-
        front of the design of any OWL.

    · Faculty and tutors who conduct online conferences should be selected
        carefully to ensure they are comfortable working in an online setting and
        teaching writing through writing.

    · All writing center administrators and tutors should attend formal train-
        ing on how to teach writing in online writing environments and how
        to address different learning styles in online settings. Furthermore, they
        should also be trained to work with students with disabilities, varies
        learning styles, and multilingual learners.

    · Writing center administrators and tutors should be trained to conduct syn-
        chronous and asynchronous tutoring conferences for a variety of learners.

    · Students should be trained to use an OWL properly and in ways that best
        fit their learning styles.

    · Writing center administrators and tutors should be trained to proper-
        ly and skillfully use the hardware and software programs they will use
        during tutoring sessions. They should also be familiar enough with the
        technology to help students through basic maneuvers when first getting
        an online consultation started.

ADMINISTRATIVE DECISIONS FOR
OWI

      Deborah Minter
      University of Nebraska-Lincoln

        Moving writing instruction online returns WPAs to many of the same
        questions they have faced historically, such as class size, appropriate sup-
        port for teaching and learning, and equitable compensation. This chapter
        proposes that students and teachers are best served by informed WPAs
        who have developed an awareness of the challenges and opportunities
        unique to OWI. A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective
        Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) and its OWI princi-
        ples and example effective practices can help WPAs to conceptualize the
        work and resources required to mount effective online writing courses.

        Keywords: budget, class size, compensation, literacy load, material condi-
        tions of teaching, resources, student preparation, writing program admin-
        istration/administrator (WPA)

    For WPAs, A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices
for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) will feel familiar in its call for atten-
tion to class size, equitable compensation, support for teacher development, and
the availability of services that support developing writers such as OWLs and
on-call reference librarians. These are not new concerns. Neither are attending
to and advocating for writing teacher development, equitable compensation, fair
and meaningful assessments of teaching effectiveness, and attending to and ad-
vocating for the kinds of broader institutional resources necessary for students'
development as writers and learners, especially those resources that support con-
tingent faculty (see Chapter 7). Still, as writing programs choose (or, in some
cases, feel pressure) to move writing instruction online, A Position Statement of
Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI can help WPAs to conceptu-
alize the work and resources required to mount the kind of OWCs that support
teachers and students in doing their best work.

    Arguably, the responsibility to make OWI an accessible and inclusive expe-
rience for both faculty and students rests with the institutions' WPAs, as OWI

Administrative Decisions for OWI

Principle 1 advocated (p. 7). Although WPAs often have little direct access to
necessary purse strings, they are positioned to make arguments to upper admin-
istrators (e.g., deans, division heads, and provosts) for resources that can increase
access points of access for students and faculty. With these resources, WPAs
have the power to engage in such activities as buying hardware and software
for faculty to use to teach OWCs from their campus offices and potentially for
teaching from remote locations, hiring Work Study students to compose doc-
umentation specific to OWI courses, and conducting research about the issues
that faculty and students--especially because of disability, learning, linguistic,
or socio-economic issues--have accessing OWI equipment. Similarly, WPAs or
those administrators in charge of distance education need to conduct assessment
of the program's writing courses; this assessment should help the administrator
understand who is being well served by the program, which populations want
to participate in OWCs but struggle to access them, and what issues prevent
student access. Then, WPAs need to work with those involved with online ed-
ucation at their respective institutions to determine how best to address these
issues. WPAs, as this chapter details, can proactively respond to OWI Principle
1 by addressing other principles in A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013).

THE CRITICAL CONCERN OF CLASS SIZE

    Among the 15 OWI principles for OWI, class size--maintaining an enroll-
ment cap of 15-20--is identified as "the most effective practice the Committee
can imagine." With OWI Principle 9 (pp. 20-21), this effective practices docu-
ment takes its place among a number of position statements from professional
organizations affiliated with the teaching of college-level English, all of which
call for writing course caps in this range (see, for example, the CCCC's Principles
for the Postsecondary Teaching of Writing, originally issued in 1966, updated in
1989, & revised in 2013; also see the Association of Departments of English's
"ADE Guidelines for Class Size and Workload," first issued in 1974 and updated
in 1992).

    Alice Horning's (2007) "The Definitive Article on Class Size" is particularly
useful for its overview of extant research to support the value of low student-fac-
ulty ratios in writing classes. Horning cited, for example, Richard Light's (2001)
finding that the amount of writing required for a course is the best predictor of
students' level of engagement with the course and argues that extensive writ-
ing "cannot reasonably be assigned, read, and responded to in large sections"
(p. 12). She juxtaposed Light's study with Alexander W. Astin's (1993) What
Matters in College, which reported that a low student-faculty ratio positively

218
                                                                                                         Minter

impacts student satisfaction and degree completion (p. 12). In addition to this
sweeping look at contemporary qualitative accounts of practices that contribute
to college student success, Horning (2007) provided a review of research focused
specifically on class size in college writing courses. Perhaps the most provocative
piece of evidence she provided was a brief overview of an institutional study
conducted at Arizona State University (ASU), where they analyzed the impact of
a reduced writing course cap of 19. In short, lowered class-sizes correlated with
improved pass rates for ASU's FYW courses (i.e., English 101 and English 102),
improved retention, reduced numbers of student withdrawals or failures from
the courses, and "improved student evaluations for all ranks of faculty teaching
ASU's 100-level courses" (Glau as cited in Horning, 2007). Thus, synthesizing
extant research that demonstrates relationships among smaller class-size, college
student success, and teaching effectiveness, Horning provided several lines of
argument for the benefits of smaller class-sizes.

    At a recent meeting of the CCCC, June Griffin and I (2012; see also 2013)
offered an additional argument for the benefit of lower course caps in OWCs
particularly. Reporting on our study of the sheer quantity of reading and writ-
ing required in a set of comparable FYW courses, we compared the quantity
required in fully online versions of the course with the amount required in face-
to-face versions of the course. We called this aspect of the writing course the
"literacy load"--suggesting its relationship to other kinds of loads associated
with the intellectual and material work of learning and teaching, such as "cog-
nitive load" and "work load." Comparing the amount of reading required of
students in four FYW courses--all governed by the same course guidelines with
the same enrollments (although with different instructors and syllabi), we found
that the reading load of the fully online classes was nearly triple that of the on-
site, face-to-face classes. This finding is all the more remarkable considering that
enrollment in the two OWCs averaged only 15 students while enrollment in the
onsite courses averaged 21.

    Although preliminary, this research underscores the need for careful atten-
tion not only to the amount of assigned reading (and writing, to the degree that
it, too, must be read and addressed) in an OWC, but also to the amount of read-
ing required to participate in class activities and embedded in the way the course
is conducted online. Indeed, Scott Warnock (2009) estimated that he routinely
writes more than 30,000 words per class (p. 6); he and the students are respon-
sible for reading these words and many more. As we (Griffin & Minter, 2013)
have written elsewhere: "These initial findings lead us to worry that the literacy
load of online classes as they are often configured can overtax students, particu-
larly academically underserved and ELL students" (p. 153). More specific to the
concerns raised in this chapter, each additional student in an OWC functions

                                                                                                 219
Administrative Decisions for OWI

like a multiplier in terms of other students' reading loads; and, when a majority
of the course is conducted via text, an increase of only a few students can mean
substantially more reading for both students and teachers. WPAs charged with
overseeing OWCs as well as teachers interested in designing effective OWCs
will want to attend to the literacy demands inherent in OWC design. As Beth
L. Hewett (2015a) suggested in Reading to Learn and Writing to Teach: Literacy
Strategies for Online Writing Instruction, strategic ways to address such litera-
cy demands are through writing assignments that also address reading-to-learn
skills, careful teacher-writing practices that attend to semantic integrity, and
thoughtfully considered overall reading loads. Hence, OWI Principle 9 is worth
serious discussion at any institution where OWI is used for teaching writing (pp.
20-21).

NEGOTIATING STUDENT PREPARATION

    Reporting on the results of the Babson group's tenth annual survey of on-
line learning for Inside Higher Ed, Doug Lederman (2013) noted that while
enrollment in college-level online courses seemed to be slowing, growth in that
segment of postsecondary education still outpaced growth in higher education
more generally across the same period of time. In fact, the survey suggested
that more than 6.7 million students (or nearly a third of all students enrolled in
postsecondary education) in fall 2011 were enrolled in at least one online course
for college credit. All of this comes as welcome news to those who see promise
in online learning's potential to improve educational access for groups who have
been traditionally underrepresented in college classrooms (see Chapter 10, for
example).

    If online instruction can alleviate a few of the practical challenges (e.g., lack
of childcare and unreliable transportation) that interfere with some students'
completion of face-to-face college courses, recent research suggests that online
courses do not yet serve all populations of students equally well. Researchers Di
Xu and Shanna Smith Jaggars (Community College Research Center, 2013)
recently mined a dataset of more than 40,000 community and technical college
students enrolled across 500,000 courses in the state of Washington. Analyzing
correlations between student attributes such as gender, age, ethnicity, previous
academic performance and students' ability to adapt to online classes, the re-
searchers found that while students generally struggle in their efforts to adapt to
online classes, "males, younger students, students with lower levels of academic
skill, and Black students were likely to perform particularly poorly in online
courses relative to their performance in face-to-face courses" (p. 19). In addition,
analysis of student adaptability by discipline revealed the greatest negative effect

220

for persistence and course grade in English classes (p. 20), the area in which
OWI seeks to excel. The stakes of failing to deliver on the apparent promise of
online learning only increase as post-secondary institutions come under increas-
ing public scrutiny for disappointing retention and graduation rates.

    Although poor retention and graduation rates can be trailing indicators--an
aggregate after-the-fact indication that students were struggling academically--
my own institution (University of Nebraska-Lincoln) along with many others
attend to "D, F, W rates," a term that refers to the percentage of students who
withdraw from a course or earn grades below a C in a given semester (see Lang &
Baehr, 2012, whose essay detailed an administratively-mandated study of D, F,
W rates in writing courses at their institution). A survey of online writing teach-
ers conducted by the CCCC OWI Committee (2011a & 2011b) found 40 of
156 respondents reporting drop-out rates in their OWCs of between 21% and
40%--a finding that should concern any WPA or higher level-administrator
poised to begin or expand offerings of OWCs. The percentages reported in these
surveys were anecdotal and may have been made off the cuff, thus not reflecting
the actual percentages, which easily could be higher for some institutions and
student populations. Clearly, then, administrators need to give serious attention
to the support required to ensure that teachers and learners are empowered to
build successful OWCs to which students can commit and in which they can
thrive.

    OWI Principles 10 and 11 (pp. 21-24) addressed two important and of-
ten overlooked elements of support that are necessary as institutions press to
capitalize on the prevalence and potential of online learning. Specifically, OWI
Principle 10 advocates that Institutions (and the English or writing programs
housed within them) should prepare students and teachers for the technological
and pedagogical components that are unique to OWI (pp. 21-23). For example,
while time management is a skill that many students have not yet mastered
by the time they enter college, the particular challenges of time-management
in online courses might surprise and disadvantage some students. As Warnock
(2009) observed: "The lack of f2f time in an online class can be a danger for
some students. They don't have to go to class several times a week, so they may
allow course work to slide away ... and then find themselves in trouble" (p. 143).
Careful course design can address this kind of challenge. Yet, if instructors--es-
pecially the ubiquitous contingent faculty (see Chapter 7) often charged with
teaching FYW--are not included in professionalization opportunities, this care-
ful design may not always occur. For example, teachers can learn how to space
their major and minor assignments in ways that maintain a scaffold while en-
gaging students with interesting, connected weekly or ongoing assignments (see
Chapter 2). They also can build redundancy into the OWC that helps to keep

                                                                                                 221
Administrative Decisions for OWI

students on track and teaches them ways of managing their time (see Chapter 4).
    Many course developers opt for a general orientation to online learning,

typically with the institution's LMS in mind. Online instructional design con-
sultants at my own institution have developed an orientation to online learn-
ing that easily is customized at the program, course, or instructor levels. Such
an orientation is designed to prepare students for online learning and to show
them how to succeed with routine aspects of the course (e.g., accessing course
assignments on the LMS, submitting formal writing to the instructor for re-
sponse, communicating publicly with the class and privately with the instructor
or individual class-members, and accessing technical support); this preparation
acclimates students to the particular online environment they will be using. It
clearly is important to have this orientation available in advance of the start of
the semester because it can function to alert students who may have under-con-
ceptualized the work of learning online or misunderstood the challenges of ac-
cessing the course through the computers or mobile devices available to them.
It provides students with some information about potential access challenges,
as detailed in OWI Principle 1 (p. 7; see also Chapters 1, 8, 9, 10, & 16), and
(hopefully) it offers them hands-on education-based practice with the needed
digital tools. With such an orientation, students can seek help, adjust schedules
to give themselves sufficient time to do their online course work, or withdraw
before such challenges negatively impact their finances or academic record.

    Certainly, the orientation as a means of supporting students' success in
OWCs is not the only available mechanism, but it provides a compelling exam-
ple of how one practice--rarely a significant aspect of onsite, face-to-face writ-
ing classrooms--can have important implications as the course moves online.
Second, it suggests how a WPA might leverage support for something the pro-
gram needs by demonstrating its importance to student success and (depending
on design) its capacity to be customized for other units across campus. Third,
preparedness for full participation--and an opportunity for follow-up prior to
the start of the course if a student identifies a barrier--is crucial to developing an
online learning environment in which all students can participate fully. In that
way, a general orientation to online learning also can support the development
of a vibrant and participatory online community, as argued with OWI Principle
10 (pp. 21-23). To take an example from my own teaching, I prepared an online
graduate course in the university's LMS, a central feature of which was going to
be threaded discussion. Because the number of students was relatively small and
I had worked with all of them in earlier onsite courses or professional develop-
ment offerings, I did not think to include an orientation to the course. Early in
the first week of the semester, one student with a visual impairment alerted me
to the fact that her screen-reader was unable to accurately translate the threaded

222
                                                                                                         Minter

discussion as housed in the LMS. Working with the Services for Students with
Disabilities Office on solving this problem was going to take some time--now,
almost a week into the semester--and more time would impact her ability to
join and shape the class' online community. We were able, as a class, to switch
quickly to a social media tool that was accessible for this student and would
allow most of the same work, but I could have eliminated what was a stressful
experience for the student--a fundamental concern represented in OWI Princi-
ple 1-- simply by adapting the online orientation and posting it in advance of
the course (p. 7).

    OWI Principle 10 asked for more than a general introduction to online
learning for students however. It stated that OWI students should receive ad-
equate preparation by both the institution and their teachers for the "unique
technological and pedagogical components of OWI" (p. 21). To this end, it
is the responsibility of WPAs to assist teachers in developing assignments or
other orientation methods that help students see how to use the LMS, for ex-
ample, in the OWC as opposed to in an online math or history course. The
OWC often makes use of designated sites for placing course content, as would
other disciplinary courses. It goes beyond posting content, however, by asking
students to create content through their writing. Hence, the OWC might use
such LMS sites as whole-class discussion areas that are public to the class and
the teacher, private student-to-teacher writing spaces for such writing as journals
or questions about an assignment or writing strategy, private/public spaces for
peer response where both teacher and a small group might write and read, email
for redundancy or class reminders, synchronous chat for time-sensitive consul-
tations, and the like. Indeed, an OWC likely will more fully and possibly more
creatively use the LMS than other disciplinary courses. With attention to access
and inclusivity per OWI Principle 1 (p. 7), OWI teachers may even engage other
software, as Chapter 14 argues, if the LMS simply cannot respond to a pedagog-
ical/rhetorical need. For these reasons, students need to understand the online
components of the OWC as writing course spaces and communicative venues
beyond general online learning and time management strategies.

    Outside of inadequate student preparation, an impediment to developing
robust online classroom community that nourishes students' growth as writers
is lack of access to the resources frequently available to on-campus students.
According to the same CCCC OWI Committee surveys (2011a & 2011b), only
45% of the respondents indicated that online students at their institution had
access to online, asynchronous appointments with a writing center or OWL
tutor. The figure dropped to 20% for respondents whose institutions offered
students the opportunity for an OWL appointment in real-time. OWLs provide
support on multiple levels, as Chapter 5 discusses, and their presence is crucial

                                                                                                 223
Administrative Decisions for OWI

to students in OWCs, particularly those in fully online settings.
    In the same CCCC OWI Committee surveys, availability of librarians for

students in OWCs was somewhat better but still troubling: 57% of respondents
reported that online writing students at their institutions had access to asyn-
chronous exchanges with a librarian--a figure that dropped to 38% for those
offering access to libraries for real-time appointments. As OWI Principle 13 sug-
gested, online writing students should have access to the same support resources
as onsite students in the same program; and, they should have access to those
resources through online/digital media as consistent with the online learning
environment of the class (pp. 26-28). This means that WPAs need to allocate
funds and other resources toward helping their online students achieve parity
with their onsite peers. Certainly, as OWI Principle 13 stated, online students
also should be eligible to use any of the on-campus or face-to-face support (just
as onsite students should be allowed to access online support)--but resources
that are only accessible for those who can physically walk into an onsite center
disadvantages students who chose an online course precisely because of the chal-
lenges posed by a requirement to be physically present onsite.

ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT FOR OWI

    Concerns for access to the kinds of resources that support developing writers
and for the structures that sponsor productive writing communities and literacy
education--these are not simply abstract questions for WPAs. Indeed, WPAs
routinely map new developments in research on writing and literacy learning
onto the specific features of their individual writing programs as housed within
the specific institutional contexts of their colleges and universities. In consider-
ing a move to (or expansion of ) OWI, WPAs might pose the following questions
for programmatic or departmental discussion and resolution:

    · What do we want to accomplish by moving writing courses from onsite
        to online settings? Would hybrid or fully online OWCs--or both--work
        best to meet such goals?

    · What goals are specific to the writing curriculum at this institution and
        how might we move that work online effectively?

    · What opportunities become available for students and teachers if the
        courses move online?

    · What access and inclusivity concerns do our particular student popula-
        tions bring to learning to write using digital technologies?

    · What abilities and prior knowledge do students at this institution typi-
        cally bring to the writing classroom? Conversely, what will they need to
        learn in order to succeed and thrive in online settings for writing instruc-

        tion?
    · What pedagogical challenges do teachers face as the writing course moves

        online? How will the WPAs learn what these specific challenges are?
    · What support for online learning is this institution already prepared (or

        willing to commit) to offer students and teachers?

    These questions connect intimately to the questions of OWI program devel-
opment and faculty professionalization discussed in Chapter 12. As such, before
moving to OWI or as a mid-course assessment or corrective, these two chapters
can be read together.

    While WPAs engage the kinds of questions posed above, focused predom-
inantly on student learning, they necessarily are concerned with the material
conditions of teaching--with the extent to which the institution supports and
rewards teaching, writing teacher development, the issues of full-time versus
part-time instructors, and the kind of sustainable and meaningful assessment
practices that ensure quality instruction. This focus drives such related questions
as:

    · Does this institution provide reasonable compensation for the teaching
        of writing such that it is likely to provide reasonable compensation to
        teachers as they build-out online offerings for the institution?

    · What challenges might teachers face as the writing classroom moves on-
        line?

    · What support for online teaching does this institution offer? How would
        that support need to be modified to develop a strong OWI program?

    · What is the ratio of full-time to part-time writing teachers, and how
        would that ratio be represented in a movement to OWI?

    · What strategies are best suited to helping this program collect data on
        how readily students are reaching the learning goals of our program and/
        or campus as instruction moves online?

    · What assessment focus can provide meaningful insight on students'
        learning experience, bring the teachers in this program together and be
        cycled back on OWI in ways that will improve the experience and/or
        render visible the kinds of pedagogical support that would advance the
        goals of the program?

    A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) called for equitable compensation spelled out
by OWI Principle 8 (pp. 19-20), as well as appropriate professional develop-
ment to grow pedagogies best suited for the online environment and teaching
evaluation practices for the purposes of determining and rewarding high quality
teaching as explained by OWI Principle 7 (pp. 17-19). To these ends, A Position

                                                                                                 225
Administrative Decisions for OWI

Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI took its place
among a number of professional statements that have sought to articulate the
intellectual and ethical principles at stake in compensating writing teachers for
their labor, even as shifting technological landscapes have brought new possibil-
ities and demands.

    For WPAs, initiating or expanding OWI likely means revisiting and poten-
tially re-evaluating the matter of workload and compensation. OWI Principle
8 urged that teachers should be compensated for time spent developing courses
and for recognition that teaching writing online is initially time-consuming (pp.
19-20). One example of an effective practice, then, is to compensate first-time
teachers with some form of additional pay or reduced teaching load. Equally im-
portant in minimizing the overload associated with starting up an online course
is to be certain, as an administrator, that policies and support networks are in
place to minimize additional and unhelpful pressures. For example, policies and
practices that ensure the timely assignment of online courses to instructors and
a clear articulation of how online courses count in the instructor's overall teach-
ing load are critical to teachers' professional well-being. It is important to en-
sure that a network of support structures exists: IT, library, and OWL support
should be available 24/7 for students and teachers while the class is underway.
Such a network should be established in advance--versus identified on-the-fly
using the code-and-fix approach identified and problematized in Chapter 12--
allowing teachers to focus on conducting the course. In addition, writing pro-
grams should have clearly understood intellectual property policies governing
ownership of the course site and teaching materials that individual instructors
develop. Such consideration is especially important for part-time faculty, many
of whom teach multiple online courses while seeking to establish themselves as
marketable scholars (see Chapter 7). Although not always possible practically, a
program's intellectual property policy ideally will have the collective agreement
of the program's teachers.

    Online writing teachers also should have opportunities for formative and
summative assessment comparable to what onsite classroom teachers enjoy. So,
for example, if onsite teachers can assume that their course materials are being
read and assessed by experienced onsite classroom teachers, then online teachers
also should have the opportunity to have their teaching materials and OWI
interactions reviewed by experienced online writing teachers. However, while
the archival nature of OWI interactions may make it seem like a good idea
to review an OWC several times during a full semester, in reality such intense
scrutiny--unless applied also to onsite writing courses or codified as the most
effective strategy for assessing OWCs--can be intimidating to OWI teachers
and onerous for the few people in the writing program considered experienced

226

enough to do the evaluations (also see Chapter 4). The goal is to provide support
for OWI teachers fully, equitably, but not punitively. To this end, course evalu-
ations should be reviewed, if necessary, to ensure that the questions posed there
provide insight into crucial elements of the OWC (e.g., disabled-accessible and
effective course site design) as well as broader questions about pedagogical ef-
fectiveness. Processes for collecting student evaluations should not disadvantage
online teachers. So, for example, if a WPA discovers differential rates of response
in students' evaluations of onsite and online courses, efforts should be made to
mitigate that difference as much as possible.

ADVOCATING FOR RESOURCES

    One of the vexing truths of online courses at my own institution and others
is that developing and offering them is incentivized financially. Thus, in addi-
tion to pedagogical or philosophical motivations to develop online courses, my
institution has created a small financial incentive to do so. While course devel-
opment grants (paid to faculty who are willing to develop and teach an online
course) are no longer centrally funded, a small portion of the tuition generated
by the course each time it is taught is returned to both the unit providing in-
struction and the college in which that unit is housed. Reporting on a study
conducted by the Council of Colleges of Arts & Sciences (CCAS), Paul McCord
(2013) suggested that some form of revenue-sharing on distance courses is fairly
common. With 100 of its more than 700 member institutions responding to a
survey on "Distributed Education: Status, Concerns and Consequences," rough-
ly 40% reported a significant or critical concern with units' growing reliance on
the money earned through distance course revenue (McCord, 2013, p. 19). This
example of revenue-sharing illustrates, again, the ways in which issues that have
historically concerned WPAs can take new forms as writing instruction moves
online. In my home department, while onsite writing courses are budget-neu-
tral, online courses generate revenue for the department. Moreover, at many
institutions, revenue-sharing is only profitable if contingent faculty teach the
course and/or it enrolls at least several dozen students. These ideal conditions
can be difficult to achieve when most writing programs try to follow best prac-
tices and keep their class caps on their writing courses below 30 students, or ide-
ally closer to 20 students, and when the most qualified faculty to teach OWCs
are full-time and tenure-track faculty.

    Questions of compensation, stipend-bound professional development, or
paid programmatic assessment work quickly lead to questions of budget. How
might WPAs, as a practical matter, prepare to seek additional funds from up-
per administration to support the cost of initiating or expanding online course

                                                                                                 227

offerings? The following are questions that I have used in preparing additional
budget requests:

    · What aspect of the college's mission is served by this work? How highly
        valued--in this moment--is this part of the mission?

    · What strategic priorities are addressed by this work? Are those priorities
        of primary or secondary importance at this institutional moment?

    · If successful, what noticeable impact will this work have?
    · What is the potential for success? (Is there evidence of buy-in from those

        who are immediately involved in the work? Is there evidence of a sound,
        executable plan? Is there evidence of broad support from those inside and
        outside the program?)
    · What will this initiative cost? What kind of money (i.e., one-time, short-
        term, or--the most difficult to commit--permanent money)? What is
        getting leveraged?
    · What is the return on investment and what form will that return take
        (e.g., increased revenue, increased research opportunity, increased visi-
        bility within the institution, public recognition for progress toward its
        mission, and the like)? How long will it take to see that return?
    · How is this responsibility substantially new--for teachers or for the pro-
        gram--not already accounted for in the unit's current budget?
    · If this is a new responsibility, then given the budget model at this institu-
        tion, how does one find money for new initiatives?

    A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) carefully articulated with OWI Principle 3
the ways in which OWI represents substantially new work for writing programs,
requiring developing some new pedagogies and theories and with OWI Princi-
ple 4 how to migrate and adapt existing pedagogies in significant ways to the
OWC (pp. 12-15). It also addressed new forms of attention to learning in on-
line environments and awareness of potential barriers to participation in online
educational settings.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    Larry Johnson, Samantha Adams Becker, V. N. Estrada Cummins, A. Free-
man, and Holly Ludgate (2013), in The NMC Horizon Report: 2013 Higher Ed-
ucation Edition, identified six emerging technologies or practices with the great-
est potential for impact and uptake in the contexts of higher education. This
report is the result of research jointly conducted by the New Media Consortium
(NMC) and the EDUCAUSE Learning Initiative (ELI). The "six technologies

to watch" are massive open online courses (MOOCs), tablet computing, games
and gamification, learning analytics, and--on what the report terms "the far-
term horizon ... four to five years away from widespread adoption"--3D print-
ing and wearable technology (Johnson et al., 2013, pp. 4-5). Among the key
trends identified in the report is the rise of "openness" (i.e., open content, open
resources; easy access) as a value: "As authoritative sources lose their importance,
there is need for more curation and other forms of validation to generate mean-
ing in information and media" (p. 7). Additional key trends included increasing
interest in "new sources of data for personalizing the learning experience and for
performance measurement"; and, it included the authors' observation that "the
role of educators continues to change": "Educators are providing mentorship
and connecting students with the most effective forums and tools to navigate
their areas of study" (p. 8). When these new and experimental forms of online
instruction are extended directly to OWI, they require a WPA's attention. OWI
Principle 6 addressed to this issue by placing them within the guidance of A Po-
sition Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI regardless of
their newness and lack of familiarity as writing pedagogies (pp. 16-17).

    The NMC Horizon Report: 2013 Higher Education Edition (Johnson et al.,
2013) report with its rhetoric of radical transformation returns us to the ques-
tion at the opening of this chapter: Tasked with responsibility for developing
effective and sustainable writing programs that are responsive to the needs of
particular student-writers who are seeking educational opportunities from par-
ticular institutions, how might WPAs negotiate the needs of the program and
the institution while navigating some of the heightened rhetoric surrounding
online learning and the technologies that make it possible? Certainly A Position
Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2013) has been developed with a view toward supporting WPAs in
this work. The following list of recommendations, summarized from this chap-
ter, is provided to offer additional support for WPAs as they work to build and
advocate for OWCs that are accessible and effective:

    · Class-size remains a critical concern for OWI (as it has been for onsite,
        face-to-face classes). If instructors choose to move routine elements of
        a writing course such as explanations of assignments, class discussions
        and informal "in-class" activities online as text, the sheer quantity of
        required reading increases dramatically. And the workload for students
        (not just teachers) increases with each additional student. Navigating
        large amounts of text in a course-site can undermine students' chances
        of success, and some populations of students (those with less fluency
        in academic English; students with particular disabilities) are likely at

                                                                                                 229

        higher risk.
    · Student-writers need more than effective writing pedagogy to be success-

        ful in an online course. They require support for writing and research in
        the form of access to OWL tutors and librarians. They require support for
        navigating the technologies of writing and learning. They require guid-
        ance--in advance of the start of the course--regarding what technolo-
        gies, capacities and time the course will demand.
    · Student-writers have the greatest opportunity for success in online classes
        when teachers are well-supported--well trained, fairly compensated, and
        secure in the value of their intellectual work to the institution as demon-
        strated through fair and reasonable policies.
    · In considering the move to OWI, WPAs should assess the educational
        and pedagogical value--for their specific population of students and teach-
        ers--of moving writing courses online. WPAs also should frankly assess
        the current level of support for online instruction on their campus and
        how that might need to be adjusted to address OWI on any scale.
    · In advocating for the value of moving writing instruction online and for
        the resources necessary to do that work effectively, WPAs are well-served
        by the ability to explain how effective OWI contributes significantly to
        their institution's particular mission.

CONTINGENT FACULTY AND OWI

      Mahli Mechenbier
      Kent State University: Geauga

        At a time when university budgets are being cut and faculty appointments
        increasingly are contingent (i.e., off the tenure track), WPAs must find
        ways to provide OWI-centered training, professional development oppor-
        tunities, and mentoring to prepare contingent faculty to teach effectively
        online. Contingent faculty have limited contact with the university and
        often are classified as a money-saving solution to staffing online cours-
        es, especially writing courses in which contingent faculty are ubiquitous.
        As off-the-tenure-track faculty struggle to earn fair compensation, retain
        reasonable control over course content, and gain access to institutional
        technology, collaboration between WPAs and instructors regarding OWI
        concerns is essential.

        Keywords: access, adjunct, contingent labor, evaluation, intellectual prop-
        erty, ownership, part-time faculty, preparedness, retention, salary disparity

    "Just get one of the adjuncts to teach it." How many times has an instructor
heard an administrator casually solve a scheduling problem with these words
and a wave of the hand? Contemporary adjuncts--the contingent faculty who
teach on semester-to-semester contracts--often are used as "fillers" for undesir-
able courses such as FYW. They are the faceless many who teach (often) full-time
loads for part-time pay, commuter professors who juggle course loads among
multiple campuses,1 and the default faculty to which the administration goes at
the eleventh hour to complete department schedules.

    According to the American Association of University Professors (AAUP)
(2013), "by 2009--the latest year for which national data are available--75.6
percent of US faculty appointments were off the tenure track and 60.5 per-
cent of US faculty appointments were part-time appointments off the tenure
track, including graduate-student-employee appointments" (p. 1). The reality is
that the majority of higher education faculty are contingent, and writing studies
professionals are among these. "Adjunct"--once colloquially defined as "part-
time"--has become an antiquated designation. In modern academia, distinc-
tions have developed among the stratifications of contingent faculty:

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2015.0650.2.07  233
Contingent Faculty and OWI

   1. Full-time, non-tenure-track lecturers (FTNTT) with renewable contracts
   2. Visiting assistant professors (VAP), who have a one-year, full-time,

       non-continuing contract
   3. Graduate teaching assistants (TA), who are on annual contracts presum-

       ably until they achieve their graduate degrees
   4. Part-time faculty/adjuncts, who are term faculty with one-semester con-

       tracts
   5. Post-doctoral fellows, who typically are limited to two-to-three years on

       contract

    To further confound the contingent ranks, adjuncts can be (1) terminal
(Ph.D. or MFA) or non-terminal (MA) regarding degrees, (2) legacy adjuncts
(adjuncts who earned the BA and/or MA from the institution at which they cur-
rently teach), (3) retired teachers or professors who want to remain in education
but have no desire to re-enter the full-time workforce, and/or (4) instructors
who are seeking a full-time position and who teach part-time as a place-holder.

    Contingent faculty often are the first line of defense at a university or college
in that they are the faculty members who teach the introductory courses and the
teachers new students meet first or most often. The majority of students take
some form of FYW during their first or second year of postsecondary studies,
and they are likely to be taking these courses from contingent faculty. The expe-
riences and interactions these new students have with faculty often determine
their success, dropout rates, and transfer decisions. Marina Micari and Pilar Pa-
zos posit that "the relationship between college students and their teachers has
been shown repeatedly to have an impact on the quality of students' experiences
and learning" (2012, p. 41). However, despite their importance to new students,
contingent faculty often are marginalized as lesser--not worth the resources of
an already stretched departmental budget, the time of the tenure-line faculty,
or professional development opportunities afforded to tenure-line faculty who
instruct the same courses.

CONTINGENT FACULTY AND THE OWI COURSES

    The contingent faculty pool at the typical higher education institution is
open continually to new applicants; institutions add new adjunct faculty every
semester as they experience attrition from previous adjuncts or dissatisfaction
with those who are somehow underprepared or judged as low performing. The
level of teaching preparedness among adjuncts varies significantly. There is an
old joke, which is more real than funny, that at the beginning of a semester,
anyone who meets minimal requirements and has a pulse will be hired to teach
a writing class. Providing preparation for those newly hired faculty may not be

234

a priority. Even when institutions hold an adjunct faculty orientation in the
fall, those that are hired for spring semester often are left to fend for themselves.
Knowing the name of the Administrative Assistant who processes payroll, learn-
ing how and where to make copies, gaining access to a university email address
and LMS, figuring out where to park, and finding a desk and/or a phone onsite
all are important for the new hire. An adjunct not familiar with institutional
policies and procedures easily can be overwhelmed with must-do administra-
tive checklists: The teaching becomes secondary. Indeed, a faculty orientation--
however necessary--does not begin to meet the needs for a writing program
orientation or a workshop on teaching writing for that particular institution.
Adjuncts' needs are multi-faceted; meeting and creating professional relation-
ships with colleagues, learning how to use the institution's LMS, determining
grading polices, discovering where to send students for tutoring, and writing
syllabi are competencies which are developed continually and not simply in a
one-day faculty orientation.

    OWI is one of the instructional areas for which contingent faculty are used
in English and Writing departments. Although training contingent faculty both
as the institution's writing teacher and as an online writing instructor is necessary
to meet the needs of OWI students, one might wonder why an English or Writ-
ing Department--stamped by the institution as being a non-income generating
member of the Humanities--would spend money on OWI-centered training
and professional development for a group of contingent faculty who may or
may not be teaching at the institution the following semester. Placing an adjunct
into an OWC a few days before the semester begins is more common than the
academy would care to admit; additional research might help to identify more
precisely the frequency and resulting challenges for online writing students. For
example, in discussions with the CCCC OWI Committee, OWI Expert/stake-
holder panelists pointed to the number of adjuncts their institutions used for
OWI as, in one case, a way to keep full-time faculty available for onsite courses
(CCCC OWI Committee Stakeholders' Meeting 3, 2012b).

    The majority of this chapter will illustrate that how writing programs often
interact with contingent faculty raises concerns about inclusivity and accessi-
bility, as addressed in OWI Principle 1 of A Position Statement of Principles and
Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013). Anecdot-
ally speaking, contingent faculty rarely are included in departments' and writing
programs' culture; as a result, many are systematically disempowered. Moreover,
for many reasons--ranging from poor pay to an absence of office space to limit-
ed time on a single campus--adjuncts rarely have access to institutional resourc-
es necessary both for teaching and for their ongoing employment. The working
conditions obviously hamstring the ways that contingent OWI instructors teach

their courses. Their limited inclusion and access also affect how they work with
their students. Assuming that a campus has resources to prepare instructors to
work effectively with writers with physical and learning challenges, multilingual
writers, or students affected socioeconomically by the "digital divide," contin-
gent faculty rarely have the opportunities to access these resources and, therefore,
often do not know what to do when confronted by these issues in their classes.

    One of the issues connected to this limited access is contingent faculty's gen-
erally abysmal pay. Contingent faculty often are paid on a per-course/per-semes-
ter basis. According to the OWI Expert/stakeholders' panel, such pay tends to
range from a low of about $1,200 to a high of $3,500 per course (CCCC OWI
Committee Stakeholders' Meeting 3, 2012b). The Adjunct Project stated, "Ad-
juncts who teach English ... reported earning an average of $2,727 per course"
(June & Newman, 2013, para. 14). Such low compensation for adjuncts results
in an economic need for many to seek out and to teach more writing courses,
many of which also have exceptionally high literacy loads. Logistically, teaching
online is attractive to an adjunct who financially may need to teach at three
different institutions yet cannot physically commute to three schools in a single
work day. Even so-called "beltway fliers" have their limits, and online courses
are a feasible solution to the location problem but not to the workload prob-
lem that accompanies most writing courses. Indeed, because OWCs particularly
have high literacy loads, as discussed in Chapter 6, the adjunct's heavy teach-
ing burden creates an untenable teaching situation and may lead to suboptimal
learning conditions.

    As this book has posited, while we still are teaching rhetoric and composi-
tion, OWI necessitates specialized knowledge of, and strategies for, using digital
technology in writing instruction. To this end, the CCCC OWI Committee's
research indicated that the level of training and mentoring that contingent fac-
ulty members receive often is insufficient to prepare them for teaching in an
OWC. OWI Principle 7 stated, "Writing Program Administrators (WPAs) for
OWI programs and their online writing teachers should receive appropriate
OWI-focused training, professional development, and assessment for evaluation
and promotion purposes" (p. 17). This principle was written to indicate the
importance of such preparation for OWI--preparation that contingent faculty
especially need. In the rationale for OWI Principle 7, the CCCC OWI Com-
mittee recommended that "teachers--especially novice teachers (e.g., graduate
student teachers) and contingent faculty--should not be placed into OWCs
until they have received appropriate training by their WPAs and institution" (p.
17; italics added). Training was listed as including peer-mentoring, assistance in
syllabus development, tips regarding electronic asynchronous communication,
and workshops to teach an instructor the technical aspects of the LMS or online

classroom environment.
    In Thomas J. Kramer's (2010) "The Impact of Economics and Technolo-

gy on Changing Faculty Roles," the author analyzed the economic necessity of
hiring contingent faculty for online courses for both financial and competitive
reasons. As more and more tenure-track positions are replaced by instructors
with non-tenure-track contracts, faculty responsibilities are shifting:

         One way to develop and staff online programs is to use
         contract and/or part time faculty, both to create the online
         courses and then deliver them. This also presents the oppor-
         tunity to hire contract or part-time faculty who have partic-
         ular content and technical expertise for such courses. At the
         same time, having full-time tenure-track faculty develop and
         deliver such courses and programs is also effective. However,
         it requires the willingness, motivation, and professional devel-
         opment support to do this effectively. If universities are not
         willing to provide incentives and professional development
         support, they will be more likely to turn to contract and part-
         time faculty. (p. 255)

Tenure-line faculty--concerned with research and publication requirements for
tenure, promotion, and merit--may not be willing to learn such teaching tricks
as developing an online course. Hence, ensuring that adjuncts have access to
university resources and software for the OWCs they may be offered is impera-
tive to the writing program's functioning and reputation. Too often, contingent
faculty "tend to get compensated the least for their work, wield the least amount
of institutional power, and can sometimes be the least prepared for their online
work" (DePew, Fishman, Romberger, & Ruetenik, 2006, p. 59). OWI Expert/
stakeholder panelists expressed similar experiences (CCCC OWI Committee
Stakeholders' Meeting 3, 2012). Because of the important contact that contin-
gent faculty have with writing students and for their own professional devel-
opment, WPAs need to accept responsibility for the training and professional
development of OWI teachers.

    To this end, A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practic-
es for OWI's (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) Effective Practice 7.6 suggested
that prospective OWI teachers should receive OWI-specific training including
assistance in mastering both asynchronous and synchronous technological ele-
ments of the course, advice regarding accessibility, and training with media (pp.
18-19). Effective Practice 7.8 recommended that WPAs "should help teachers to
progress into fully online teaching" through mentors and with initial experience
in hybrid courses (p. 19). These suggested practices indicate that instructors

                                                                                                 237
Contingent Faculty and OWI

cannot merely be shoehorned into OWCs with little or no training; as Chapters
1 and 4 reveal, there are new theories and skills necessary for OWI, and while it
can work well to migrate and adapt some theories originally developed for face-
to-face instruction, others are particular to OWI and its attendant environments
(see OWI Principles 3 and 4). Just because instructors can teach an onsite course
successfully does not mean they possess the skills to translate the course to an
online venue. Technological skills aside, teachers of OWCs require knowledge
of written communication skills and tone given the primarily text-based on-
line teaching environment currently used in higher education. They require, as
well, knowledge of how to engage the student in a Web-based classroom--as
described in Chapter 4 particularly. As Deborah Minter indicates in Chapter
6, WPAs should argue for the necessary financial support to develop and field
this specific kind of training, which goes beyond training for onsite instruction.
It is unlikely that most adjunct instructors have had access to OWI training or
professional development--of any kind--as a part-time faculty member; in-
deed, many full-time faculty anecdotally report having little-to-no OWI-spe-
cific training and professional development (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c).
Even with prior OWI training, contingent faculty members will benefit from
additional access to professional development particular to each institution for
which they work.

    For the best results, the institution should ensure that all OWI faculty receive
technical training and hands-on practice with both course content (in other
words, with teaching writing online using the institution's preferred approaches)
and the LMS itself at least one semester prior to teaching a writing course online.
Kaye Shelton and George Saltsman (2006) stated that, "The level and quality of
the training faculty receive to enrich technical and instructional skills are also
directly tied to the success of the faculty members' efforts in teaching online."
To this end, faculty training for OWI should include both technical computer
skills and classroom instructional skills. If a WPA asks a new adjunct, "Can you
teach online?" the adjunct may answer, "Sure ... I have a laptop" without real-
izing that teaching online requires (among many other things) familiarity with
the institution's LMS. (In fact, some contingent faculty may be so economical-
ly disadvantaged from low pay that they do not own sufficiently sophisticated
technology to teach the course fluidly, potentially disenfranchising them from
this professional teaching environment [CCCC OWI Committee Stakeholders'
Meeting 3, 2012b]).

    Funding these professional development opportunities is challenging in a
climate of budget cuts, hiring freezes, and course cap increases. However, the
importance of OWI-focused training strengthens a writing program in the long
term. To have trained, competent, and experienced online faculty presupposes

238
                                                                                                   Mechenbier

that they will become better instructors over time, thus improving the learning
experience for students, increasing job satisfaction for the teacher, and solidify-
ing a quality teaching pool for the writing program.

    OWI-focused professional development does not always mean providing
travel to a national conference with paid lodging and food although that certain-
ly is a valid professional development opportunity. Rather, professional devel-
opment can be a local opportunity with a mentoring program where a group of
adjuncts observe a more experienced faculty member upload a course to a blank
LMS or observe another online instructor teaching an asynchronous class. As
Effective Practice 7.7 noted, mentorship and ongoing observation are important
strategies for assisting teachers with a transition to OWI. They are useful, as well,
for scalable training that develops an association among teachers, giving OWI
teachers colleagues to whom they can turn for help. The WPA also can create
opportunities for interaction through asynchronous discussions about the peda-
gogy of online teaching. The LMS is a perfect venue for this type of interaction
as it facilitates the kinds of discussion that teachers will then expect of students
in most OWCs. They can learn from each other and experience the valuable
immersion that comes from being in the environment for real communicative
purposes.

    Adjuncts, especially those who teach FYW online, change--and purposefully
can change--the dynamic of the writing program. However, they often are ig-
nored by tenure-track faculty. Anecdotally, a sense that contingent faculty are
a bother rather than a help can prevail. The fully employed faculty may think
there are too many adjuncts to keep track of; tenure-line faculty often object to
tenure-track lines being replaced with contingent lines; tenure-line faculty can
resent having to mentor or perform classroom observations for adjuncts; and
since adjuncts earn such a small amount, administering them may seem to be a
waste of resources. In a way, contingent faculty who teach online courses are like
commuter students while the tenure-line faculty are like on-campus, dormito-
ry-residing students; institutions spend more time, resources, and attention in
focusing on resident students (tenure-tracks) than it does on commuter students
(adjuncts). Tenure-line faculty are positioned to secure a more valuable status
at research universities because most are required to possess advanced terminal
degrees, which often grants them access to resources that aid their ability to
publish. On the other hand, contingent faculty who teach online, even those
with terminal degrees, are "off-campus" in their relative geographical position
even more so than the face-to-face adjunct--further marginalizing the online
adjunct.

    Adjunct faculty who teach hybrid OWCs spend at least partial time on cam-
pus while those who teach fully online OWCs have limited contact with the uni-

                                                                                                 239
Contingent Faculty and OWI

versity because the physical need to be on campus is lessened by the nature of the
online teaching venue. In some cases, contingent OWC instructors do not even
reside in or near the states of the institutions for which they are teaching fully
online courses. Holding writing courses online--particularly asynchronously--
naturally means greater flexibility for both student and instructor. Similarly, on-
line training, while not only recommended by OWI Principle 7, provides that
appropriate connective forum for OWI teachers, contingent or full-time. While
synchronous online training sessions certainly can be developed and should be
used in cases where immediacy of communication is necessary (see Chapter 3),
it is challenging to schedule synchronous workshops that can be well attended
by busy contingent faculty. Synchronizing the availability of adjuncts who teach
at multiple institutions is almost impossible. WPAs must be inclusive and cre-
ative when extending mentoring and professional development opportunities
to contingent faculty, making asynchronous training an especially useful venue.

    Although their time on campus may be limited, OWI teachers need to know
their supervisors. WPAs--and other administrators who hire faculty--should
want to meet faculty who teach OWCs. WPAs should know and be able to speak
to the teaching skills and personalities of their online faculty. Regina L. Garza
Mitchell (2009) stated, "To avoid online education's being relegated to a lower
tier, trust must be established regarding the quality and importance of this type
of education. A lack of trust places faculty members who teach online at a disad-
vantage and may also affect teaching and learning in this setting." Undoubtedly,
adjunct faculty who teach online should not be faceless members of the depart-
ment, yet it is likely that they are in most cases. While meeting them may be a
logistical challenge, it seems reasonable that unless the adjunct is geographically
distributed in another area of the country, a one-time per semester meeting for
all OWI teachers should be organized. My experience has been that contingent
faculty members are hungry for face time with their WPAs and peers, even if
that face time occurs synchronously online.

Assigning the Right Teachers to OWI

    Having the right match of teacher to teaching environment is a key to ef-
fective OWI. In terms of hiring contingent faculty, especially last-minute hires,
it may be difficult to see evidence of effective OWI teachers who are new to the
institution; yet, finding such evidence is crucial particularly when appropriate
orientation or training has not been or will not be provided. Evidence of ability
to teach writing online helps to determine whether the online environment is a
good fit for a prospective writing teacher. Adjunct teachers are judged swiftly on
their course effectiveness and may lose their jobs from poor student evaluations

240
                                                                                                   Mechenbier

while full-time tenured or tenure-line teachers may be given both more support
and time to become fluent in online instruction. Effective Practice 7.4 stated
that teachers "who would do better in traditional settings should be identified
and assigned to such settings." Further, if "personality ... indicates a poor match
for OWI," then other classroom arrangements can be made to maximize the
success of the course and the learning experience of the students (p. 18). With
little time to spare, it benefits both teachers and WPAs to understand the nature
of good fit for OWI.

    Determining effectiveness and fit prior to hiring a new adjunct for the OWI
portion of the writing program may involve asking key questions about one's
comfort level with online technology and digital teaching, in addition to ques-
tions about the instructor's philosophies and practices for the teaching of writ-
ing. Such questions can help both the adjunct teaching applicant and the WPA
to discuss an apt fit with concrete terms:

    · Have you taught writing online before? Where? How often? Which
        courses?

    · What types of formal preparation have you received for OWI in the past?
        What types of ongoing professional development have you received from
        an institution or provided for yourself through other opportunities?

    · What experience do you have teaching students with disabilities and
        multilingual speakers?

    · Do you prefer teaching asynchronously or synchronously? Why?
    · What LMSs have you used in the past? Which ones have worked best for

        you? Why?
    · If you are given a pre-developed course to teach, what challenges do you

        anticipate? What kinds of help would you like from the WPA to this end?
    · What is your favorite theory, book, or article regarding OWI?
    · What do you like best about teaching writing online? How does this

        preference differ for you regarding teaching writing in a traditional, on-
        site setting?
    · If you have not taught writing online before, what draws you to this
        choice now?
    · What kinds of assistance to you anticipate needing as you move into an
        OWC for this institution?

    Evaluating adjunct faculty once a year is central to the long-term success of
a healthy writing program. Jill M. Langen, in her study on evaluation of faculty,
maintained:

         With the dramatic increase in the use of adjunct faculty in
         higher education classrooms, it is critical that we understand

                                                                                                 241
Contingent Faculty and OWI

         how these faculty are being evaluated, and how these evalua-
         tion results are utili[z]ed. Without a clear and consistent pro-
         cess available to measure performance, it becomes increasingly
         difficult for administrators to ensure that quality learning
         opportunities are available in the classroom. (p. 185)

    Assessment in online settings is both challenging and crucial. First, as Chap-
ters 4 and 6 indicate, evaluation of any OWI teacher has not yet been standard-
ized in any manner. Assessment for adjuncts is especially tenuous as it affects
these teachers in significant financial ways; yet these effects are no more crucial
than how contingent OWI faculty's teaching influences students and the writing
program overall. Second, only through regular evaluation--but not more or less
rigorous assessment than is conducted for onsite writing teachers, according to
OWI Principle 7--can the WPA understand the potential for student writing
development, particular teachers' ongoing professional development, and the
writing program's health. To this end, on the most basic level, if department
administrators and tenure-line faculty do not know their adjuncts, then how do
contingent faculty establish professional contacts for their ongoing development
as OWI teachers in the workplace?

    Effective Practice 7.11 recommended that the evaluation of online writing
teachers should be done by a "peer or supervisor who has similar training and
equal or superior ... experience in ... OWI" (p. 19). WPAs should ensure that
the mentors/evaluators of contingent online faculty possess experience in on-
line pedagogy and are familiar with OWI principles. Many senior faculty who
are respected for their teaching may have never taught online, let alone writing
online. The CCCC OWI Committee believes that an instructor who has never
taught online should not evaluate how another instructor teaches an OWC.
That reasonable stance can be problematic for the adjunct who is seeking a full-
time position, however. For contingent faculty, having a letter in their files that
was written by a tenure-line faculty member--or even better, the WPA or de-
partment chair--may indeed assist them in a full-time job search. Yet, given
that many online faculty are contingent, a letter written by a contingent faculty
member for a contingent faculty member can be perceived as insignificant or
inconsequential. Such recommendations can be dismissed by questions: Were
the instructors friends? Couldn't the instructor get a tenure-line professor to
observe the class? Is the part-timer not liked by the WPA? WPAs need to create
standards for evaluating online adjunct faculty to ensure that knowledgeable
peer-observers are applying online pedagogical principles to these courses and
to the instructors. Assigning a tenure-line professor of Shakespeare to observe
and evaluate an online FYW course is similar to asking an expert on Schubert to

242
                                                                                                   Mechenbier

attend and evaluate a Lady Gaga concert. Indeed, tenure-line faculty may resent
losing time they are asked to give to mentor or evaluate part-time faculty. Pro-
viding reasonable standards for assessment and adequate compensation--such
as course releases--to those who do the evaluation may be helpful.

    Engaging adjunct instructors on the campus and within the university
community is focal to retaining quality contingent faculty. Kinga N. Jacobson
(2013) stated, "Inviting adjunct faculty to instructional team meetings and col-
lege wide committees can build strong inter- and intradepartmental networks.
These meetings develop mutually beneficial, peer-working relationships that
lead to long-term retention of adjunct instructors." University service becomes
problematic for many adjuncts due to their multiple-institution teaching sched-
ules. Even if adjunct faculty are invited to serve, the tenure-line faculty have to
be prepared to take the opinions of the adjuncts seriously despite their limited
stake in the institution's mission. Even when "service" is not connected to the
institution, however, it can be challenging for contingent faculty members to
experience themselves as having a voice. One example emerged from the CCCC
OWI Committee Fully-Online and Hybrid surveys (CCCC OWI Committee,
2011a & 2011b). As described in The State of the Art of OWI, (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2011c), only 18% of the fully-online participants (p. 71) and 12%
of the hybrid participants (p. 94) self-identified as adjunct faculty. This dearth
of contingent voices in these two surveys indicates that the deeper understand-
ing that adjuncts--who indeed may comprise the vast majority of OWI teach-
ers--could provide is missing. While finding a universal solution that solves all
contingent faculty needs may not be feasible due to the diversity of instructors
in the adjunct pool, something must be done.

    WPAs can begin by educating themselves about the adjuncts who teach in
their programs. Such actions as maintaining open lines of communication and
welcoming questions and conversations with contingent faculty address Effec-
tive Practice 12.3: "Individuals teachers should have adequate opportunity to
discuss with the WPA how any changes relative to OWI may affect their careers"
(p. 25). Online adjunct faculty should have the ability to speak to a reliable
"go-to" regarding teaching-related concerns, and they should be able to do so
without undue concern for their job security.

LOCATION, NEED, AND EXPERTISE

    Part-time faculty often have different needs from full-time faculty, and it is
the responsibility of WPAs to understand those needs. Some contingent faculty
are part of a two-parent family, while others are single parents; some can only
teach at night, while others can only teach on weekends; some have full-time

                                                                                                 243
Contingent Faculty and OWI

employment elsewhere and are teaching to supplement income, and others cob-
ble together part-time teaching positions as a "full-time" job, struggling to earn
a living wage among several institutions. The culture of the campus is central in
understanding--and working--the politics of a department: Are students pre-
dominantly commuters? Do they live in an on-campus dorm? Is the institution
a community college? Is the institution a regional campus of a four-year univer-
sity? Are the faculty subject to a collective bargaining agreement?

    WPAs should recognize the special needs of managing contingent online fac-
ulty, especially regarding support and training for their futures as online writing
teachers. The classification of contingent faculty member plus the type of insti-
tution combine to form the dynamic of how the instructor and university inter-
act. For example, there are instructors who may teach more than six courses at
multiple institutions to earn what-comes-close-to a living wage. Personal funds
to attend conferences are non-existent; time to read current pedagogical journal
articles is limited. Do adjuncts have time to send out applications for full-time
positions? Do they have access and a password to the MLA's Job Information List?

    Failure to provide online adjunct faculty with office space is an oversight
that, while possibly understandable given the online nature of the teaching as-
signment, is significant for the faculty involved. The prevailing belief may be
that the instructor is not on campus for class although this assumption would
be wrong for hybrid course instructors. Therefore, some might believe that the
adjunct would have no other reason to be present on campus. Yet, lack of an
office is indicative of the bigger problem--a lack of resources that falls to the
adjunct to replace. For example, without office space, the adjunct does not have
an office phone; all phone calls to students will be placed on a personally owned
device for which the adjunct pays the bill or uses personal, counted minutes. An
absent-from-campus online adjunct will not have regular contact with fellow
faculty and will not establish relationships with administrators. With provided
office space, some OWC adjuncts may come to campus to make use of these
resources and connect with others.

    Indeed, online contingent faculty are fragmented. They exist on the periph-
ery of the campus community, they often do not know each other personally,
and they are competing with each other for courses (and income). Developing a
community--even a virtual community--will promote collegiality and a sense
of being part of the department. OWI Principle 11 speaks to the importance of
student motivation which is driven by a "sense of interpersonal connectedness
to others within a course" (p. 23). Contingent online faculty also will benefit
from this sense of community and connection with other instructors; teacher
satisfaction improves when faculty have a sense of contributing to the depart-
ment. WPAs should want to protect the integrity of the adjunct pool while

244
                                                                                                   Mechenbier

simultaneously promoting each instructor within the adjunct setting. Doing so
can only be good for the students they teach. Furthermore, it is well known that
part-time faculty make less money. They are the nomads of faculty--traveling to
where they can make a living. They vary in skill and experience. However, WPAs
should devote time and resources to the ethics of treating adjunct instructors
appropriately, particularly in OWI, which is a new project for many institutions
and for which fewer resources may be allotted.

    To what degree do WPAs become involved with adjunct faculty? Do admin-
istrators ask an adjunct upon hiring or even in casual conversation, "Where else
are you teaching?" or "How many courses total will you be teaching this term?"
WPAs may not ask such questions because they do not want to know. Adjuncts'
answers ("I teach nine online courses at three different institutions") may cause
WPAs to question the quality of instruction within that university's online pro-
gram, and not asking adjuncts direct questions regarding teaching load is pro-
moting a culture of not knowing, thereby keeping the unattractive truths of the
adjunct online writing instructor's professional life a secret. As one respondent
to an OWI survey stated, "Often times, adjunct faculty teach the online courses,
and while I am sure they are qualified and dedicated teachers, I know they have
had the most minimal of training and many are teaching sections for a variety of
campuses, so they have to keep things as simple as possible to manage the awful
workload they carry" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 64). Such an "awful
workload" may be difficult to minimize because of the sheer economics of many
adjuncts' lives. As the section below on compensation reveals, low pay necessi-
tates teaching multiple courses to survive. Even if an institution adopts OWI
Principle 9's recommendation that "OWCs ... should be capped responsibly at
20 students per course," adjunct instructors who are teaching multiple online
courses at multiple institutions--meaning multiple preparations, as indicated in
Chapter 2--will not have a manageable literacy load.

    The institutional structure has shifted with the addition of online courses.
These have materialized rapidly as a way to balance the budget, to offer greater
accessibility to college education, and to solve classroom space concerns. Now,
departments are faced with the questions: How do we administrate these cours-
es? How do we train and develop qualified faculty to teach them? How do we en-
gage online faculty as part of the university community? Online education is the
victim of its own success; it is the situation where a municipality builds a huge
shopping mall, and then after the grand opening, the city sends in a construction
crew to widen the road that leads to the mall. Online courses are here; now how
do we ensure their success? It is crucial to prepare adjunct faculty to instruct
FYW and other writing-intensive courses they may teach by adopting OWI
Principle 7 and offering "OWI-focused training, professional development, and

                                                                                                 245

assessment" (p. 17). Additionally, adjunct faculty deserve active support from
instructional designers and WPAs to make their courses accessible to students
with disabilities. Building accessibility into online courses requires significant
time and labor, and instructors should be appropriately compensated for fulfill-
ing this legal and ethical obligation on behalf of the institution. When WPAs
are familiar with OWI and its strategies, they are in the leadership position
necessary to share--and encourage--effective practices with their community
of instructors.

COMPENSATION

    "Contingent faculty are underpaid" has become a mantra for the adjunct.
According to The Coalition on the Academic Workforce (2012), "Looking at all
courses part-time faculty respondents reported on, the median pay per course,
standardized to a three-credit course, is $2,700." More disheartening is that "re-
spondents teaching on-site courses reported median pay per course of $2,850,
those teaching courses online reported $2,250" (Coalition, 2012, p. 12). Al-
though these comparisons may not have been generated by examining the same
types of institutions, the numbers are revealing. Members of the university ad-
ministration may justify this disparity with the rationale that online adjuncts
do not "have" to come to campus to teach, and therefore, they "save" on gas,
parking costs, and even clothing. Yet, do students pay fewer tuition dollars for
an online course than they do for a face-to-face class at the same university? No,
they do not. Ethically, we know that the instructor should not be paid a reduced
salary for an online course that appears on the student's academic transcript as
"credit"--identical to the way a face-to-face class with the same course number
would appear--just because the course was taught online. The salary disparity
signifies that in some cases higher education does downgrade online adjunct
instructors to an even more greatly reduced faculty status.

    OWI Principle 8 stated, "Online writing teachers should receive fair and
equitable compensation for their work." WPAs should uphold the value of
OWCs--and those faculty who teach them--to the English or Writing Depart-
ment as a whole. Once those adjunct faculty have been appropriately trained for
their OWCs, it is only reasonable to want to keep them working. Fair compensa-
tion will help to ensure retention of capable, skilled, and trained online adjuncts
who are committed to student success.

    WPAs must understand the complexity of online instruction and argue for
fair compensation. According to A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI, "Altering course materials [to meet online students'
needs] ... requires time and energy as well as thoughtful literacy approaches" (p.

19). Indeed, according to OWI expert/stakeholders, even pre-developed courses
take additional time for adjunct faculty to manage. In one meeting, Jason Snart
stated:

         I would like to see a dedicated paid-time offer for adjuncts
         who need to spend considerable time prepping what should
         be a pre-made course, in terms of fixing mistakes, changing
         names where their name has to be theirs instead of someone
         else's. Making sure page numbers are correct, just sort of an
         upkeep prior to a semester starting. So like a 2 hour paid--
         you can even call it a prep workshop time--something to
         that effect, because I think there is a lot of prep time that
         really goes uncompensated for adjuncts that are teaching these
         ready-made or pre made courses. (CCCC OWI Committee
         Stakeholders' Meeting 3, 2012b)

Compensation may include "pay adjustments, course load modifications, and
technology purchases" (p. 20). To adjuncts being paid $2,250 a course, any
compensation would be welcomed in recognition of their efforts.

    The data tell a sad story, and in the never-enough university-budget-speak, it
is unlikely that raising contingent faculty salaries is a priority. However, "fair and
equitable compensation" goes beyond payment-per-course. Adjuncts often have
to provide their own computers, laptops, and software when they teach OWCs.
Even if a department is unwilling or unable to give adjuncts laptops, WPAs
should implement a system where online adjuncts can sign-out laptops--with
the necessary software installed--on a semester-long basis. Software is expen-
sive for adjuncts who are teaching for $2,250 per course with no access to IT
support. Such a measure speaks to issues of access and inclusivity as indicated
in OWI Principle 1 (p. 7), and it addresses the concerns of OWI Expert/stake-
holder Steven Corbett, who pointed out the inequities of impoverished adjunct
faculty who do not own state-of-the-art computer technologies that would en-
able them to teach writing well online (CCCC OWI Committee Stakeholders'
Meeting 3, 2012b).

    Finally, compensation may include other "luxuries," as well. In the third
meeting of the OWI Expert/stakeholders, Heidi Harris said:

         I know a lot of instructors who are teaching online are ad-
         juncts and they get into that loop of not being able to really
         get really any publications because the traditional publishing
         cycle is really intensive. They might have real expertise that
         they would like to share and that we can get quickly, through

                                                                                                 247
Contingent Faculty and OWI

         yes like an online journal for implementing processes like
         OWI that really talks about pedagogy, theory, research, con-
         necting those points. I think we come up with a lot of best
         practices, but I don't see a lot of publications that can keep up
         with publishing current ideas that show how those practices
         are implemented. (CCCC OWI Committee Stakeholders'
         Meeting 3, 2012b)

    In response to this suggestion, the CCCC OWI Committee has developed
a peer-reviewed Online Resource (http://www.ncte.org/cccc/committees/owi)
that enables the actual OWI practitioners--adjuncts in particular--to pub-
lish their OWI effective strategies. Adjunct faculty often teach with a great deal
of passion and thoughtfulness; they, too, need publication opportunities that
match their desire to communicate what they know to the disciplinary field.

CONTENT AND TEACHING STYLE

    A first-time onsite writing instructor certainly will spend time developing
a syllabus, selecting relevant texts, and writing exams and essay assignments.
However, when that instructor walks into a classroom, little knowledge of tech-
nology is required in order to stand in front of a group of students and teach--
even when the classroom is equipped with a computer-based projector.

    Diametric to the traditional classroom approach, in order to successfully cre-
ate a new online course, a collective effort is required. Rosemary Talab (2007)
indicated that:

         Distance learning courses very often require teamwork, which
         "muddies" traditional definitions of intellectual property and
         course ownership. A faculty member developing a distance
         course might use a graphic artist, instructional designer, and
         a technical specialist for Web support, as well as institution-
         al online course management tools. These are considerable
         expenses for an institution. Faculty control of content is of
         paramount importance. (p. 11)

As a result of such collaborative teamwork, the components of an online course
are "divided and distributed to different administrative bodies--each with its
own perception of what will be best for the students ... and what will be best for
the university" (DePew et al., 2006).

    Using Educational Technologists (ETs) and Instructional Designers (IDs)
often denotes that the university has a proprietary interest in the online course.
ETs and IDs are salaried employees of the institution, and tapping into univer-

248
                                                                                                   Mechenbier

sity resources means the university has rights to the class. Full-time teachers may
find themselves in a similar situation, which potentially makes sense--but re-
mains debatable--given their fuller admission into the institutional community.
However, adjunct faculty also may need to develop materials for their OWCs,
materials that they cannot create collaboratively given their singularly migrant
status. In such cases, if contingent faculty cannot transport an online class--
or even small pieces of one developed to support an established or pre-made
OWC--to another institution because of the originating institution's propri-
etary interests, why would these instructors want to expend time and energy in
developing or improving an OWC?

    OWI Principle 5 stated, "Online writing teachers should retain reasonable
control over their own content and/or techniques for conveying, teaching, and
assessing their students' writing in their OWCs" (p. 15). However, ownership
of online course materials depends upon the policies at the institution. Most
online adjuncts are accustomed to being independent workers; they may prefer
to create their own materials and handouts for the course and to design the
course themselves. The reality is that an online course may require IT depart-
ment technological assistance. Even though the adjunct may be the content ex-
pert for the subject matter, the technology team may "tell [the instructor] what
academic content will be. They tell you how your courses will operate, and so
it becomes more of an execution" (Kelly, 2005). Online courses--unlike most
traditional onsite classes--require the collegial collaboration of the instructor
with out-of-department specialists.

    Adjunct faculty need to be aware of both their rights and of the proprietary
rights of the online course's home institution. If an adjunct teaches at more than
one university, online course materials should be kept separate methodically.
According to Douglas A. Kranch (2008), "Even with a contract that allots copy-
right to the faculty who produce a course, it may not be at all certain that those
faculty also have the rights to ... transport it to another institution" (p. 354).
Moreover, once the course or materials are in the LMS, practically speaking,
they are archived and available to the institution for review, revision, or contin-
ued use.

    It is the contingent faculty members' responsibility to familiarize themselves
with institutional policies at every university where they are employed. It is the
responsibility of administrators to direct adjuncts to policies related to intel-
lectual property rights and copyright of online course materials. In a study of
public and private Carnegie Doctoral Research-Extensive Universities (2007),
"half of the universities gave control of syllabi, tests, and notes to faculty, only
31% of these institutions also included materials posted to the Web, and 36%
of the universities claimed ownership of courseware and distance learning mate-

                                                                                                 249
Contingent Faculty and OWI

rials" (Loggie, et al.). Awareness and knowledge of institutional policies is fun-
damental to online adjunct faculty: Instructors must understand how to protect
themselves and to identify what is theirs and what is owned by the university.

    Shell (pre-fabricated or pre-made) courses are--and should be--troubling
to contingent faculty. These courses have been pre-designed and, depending on
institutional policy, may or may not be adapted to suit the instructor's individual
teaching strengths. Adjuncts who teach writing online should be concerned with
being able to engage their own teaching styles and the manners in which online
course material is distributed. Helena Worthen (2013) posited, "Whether [an
instructor] ... is allowed to change the class" is crucial regarding instructor au-
tonomy (p. 30). The rationale for OWI Principle 5 explained:

         the pressures of ... large programs lead to unified (and often
         restrictive) course templates and core syllabi and sometimes
         even more restrictive course shells. These features often are
         the result of programs that rely heavily on contingent faculty;
         indeed, institutions may turn to uniformity of method and
         materials in lieu of hiring, training, and retaining expert, full-
         time writing teachers. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013, p. 15)

WPAs who employ large numbers of adjuncts may find it easier to administrate
and validate the program if online shell courses are standardized. However, this
system of teaching removes control of content and style from instructors and
forces them to "fit" into a microwaveable writing course which the instructor
did not design. Instead of teaching, Bob Barber (2011) argued, "full-time faculty
members are becoming managers in the framework of designing curriculum and
then [are] handing [the course] off to part-timers to teach." Under this model of
course design and dissemination, university models of education are transform-
ing into corporate models of business industry where managers (i.e., tenured or
tenure-track instructors) are delegating tasks to assembly line workers (adjuncts)
to balance the need for administrative oversight.

JOB MARKET AND PROFESSIONAL IMPLICATIONS

    There are job market implications associated with part-time education em-
ployment. If an instructor is an adjunct for too many years, then the items in
one's vita start to blend together, giving the appearance of sameness with too
many other contingent applicants; for example, it would seem that all writing
adjuncts teach some version of FYW, and they do so in a repeated cycle. Ad-
juncts should strive to distinguish themselves so that they do not become "just
one of the adjuncts" at an institution, and volunteering to teach OWCs can

250
                                                                                                   Mechenbier

make an instructor stand out to writing programs that are establishing OWCs
and are looking for full-time instructors to head the design or implementation
of this new initiative. However, as indicated earlier, it may be challenging to find
OWI-qualified and willing tenure-line faculty to observe the teaching of, or to
mentor, an adjunct. Certainly, being recognized as a good teacher is positive.
Being known as punctual and responsible is favorable to an adjunct's reputation.
Having letters of reference from members of the profession who have observed
one's teaching is crucial to the success of an application for a full-time position.
Yet, how do adjuncts procure such helpful letters from tenure-line faculty?

    Gaining one-on-one time with the WPA so that the adjunct is known not
only will provide the opportunity to communicate about one's students and
courses, but also will add a contact to one's professional references on the vita.
Meeting colleagues and establishing face-to-face contacts is an issue of timing.
Onsite or hybrid-based adjunct faculty may be forced to leave campus imme-
diately after one class ends in order to drive to a second institution to teach
another class. The multiple-location problem additionally affects service to the
institution: Standing committees meet at certain times, and an adjunct teaching
three courses at Institution #1 and two courses at Institution #2 may not be on
the appropriate campus at the appropriate time to serve on the appropriate (high
profile) committee in order to meet and to establish working relationships with
tenure-line colleagues who may sit on future departmental hiring committees.

    A common myth is that most adjuncts do not want a full-time position.
Citing the 2004 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, sponsored by the De-
partment of Education and its National Center for Education Statistics, James
Monks reported, "When part-time faculty were asked whether they would have
preferred a full-time position at their current institution ... 35 percent report-
ed that they would have preferred such a position" (2009, para. 9). Although,
according to these data, most adjuncts are not seeking full-time employment,
one-third of adjunct instructors--not a negligible number--desire to be hired
full time. Additionally, since "many universities are averse to promoting their
own adjunct faculty into tenure-track positions," internal adjunct faculty may
have limited opportunities at the institutions most familiar with their teaching
abilities (Fruscione, 2014, para. 2). A second myth is that most adjuncts do
not possess the terminal degree. Again, the Coalition on the Academic Work-
force offered an explanation: "At four-year institutions ... slightly more than half
(54.2%) of respondents hold a doctoral or other terminal degree that would be
considered the common qualification for tenure-track positions" (p. 8). Many
adjuncts do possess the requisite educational pedigrees to be considered for ten-
ure-line positions; however, due to inadequate mentoring or lack of resources,
adjunct faculty may become discouraged or overwhelmed by the considerable

                                                                                                 251
Contingent Faculty and OWI

effort and intricate process--letters of recommendation, teaching evaluations,
publications, the ability to access and use the MLA Job Information List--re-
quired to apply for full-time lines.

    There are rules. Larger economic forces are at work. Online courses are mon-
ey-saving, paperless and classroom-less environments, and adjuncts are inexpen-
sive labor. Adopting the mentality that "if I work here long enough, they will
hire me" is not the way a part-time instructor can become qualified for a full-
time position. Instead, learning more about one's writing program itself and
meeting and conversing with the WPA may be the best places to start. Howev-
er, while the academy is changing, moving into digital settings for instruction,
teaching evaluations, service commitments, and research publications still count
for full-time faculty hires. To this end, contingent faculty may find themselves
in a never-ending adjunct loop unless they can develop full-time qualifications
in these areas on a part-time salary and course overload scenario.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    Typically, adjuncts teach because they enjoy teaching. Many would like ad-
mission to the full-time ranks of their (otherwise) peers; many will try and most
will not succeed. In class, an instructor may be thinking, "my job is great"--
what is not to like about interacting with students, sustaining conversations
about readings, and engaging eager minds in college-level topics? It is fulfilling
work. However, out of class, an instructor may ask, "What happens next? How
many classes will I get next semester? Can I make it another semester without
health insurance? Will I get hired the next time there is a full-time position?" On
the one hand, the teaching that contingent faculty do is satisfying, rewarding,
and impacts the next generation. This mindset--albeit noble--diverts attention
from the economic downside of the adjunct lifestyle. In the OWI setting, con-
tingent faculty may be even more at a disadvantage. The following recommen-
dations may help:

    Online contingent faculty should:

    · Implement Effective Practice 7.6 by knowing the WPA and finding time
        to communicate with the administration.

    · Adopt OWI Principle 5 by becoming familiar with institutional policies
        regarding ownership of course materials.

    · Stand for election and serve on committees.
    · Use all technical support available to faculty and participate in training

        specific to online teaching as described in Effective Practice 7.5.
    · Diversify the vita by gaining online teaching experience at two- and four-

252
                                                                                                   Mechenbier

        year institutions.
    · Research and publish in appropriate venues--collaboratively or individ-

        ually--about OWI practices and principles.
    Administrators of OWI courses should:
    · Be responsible and conscientious in providing online contingent facul-

        ty training and access to professional development as recommended by
        OWI Principle 7.
    · Understand the various stratifications among contingent faculty in order
        to be prepared to advise adjuncts based upon their individual needs as
        online instructors.
    · Follow Effective Practice 7.7 by assigning appropriate OWI mentors to
        adjunct faculty.
    · Advocate for "fair and equitable compensation" for OWI teachers as de-
        fined in OWI Principle 8.
    · Support the individual teaching styles of online adjunct faculty by en-
        couraging flexibility in OWCs as endorsed by OWI Principle 5.
    Both WPAs and contingent faculty are accountable for teaching writing in
an online setting. WPAs have a special responsibility to adjuncts because of the
unique circumstances--in rank, departmental economics, university politics,
and intellectual property rights--associated with this group of instructors. Us-
ing the OWI principles as a guide will assist both administrators and contingent
faculty in teaching writing online effectively.

NOTES

1. With some states' (e.g., Alabama, Virginia, New Hampshire, Maryland) in-
terpretation of the Affordable Care Act (aka "Obamacare"), adjunct faculty are
limited to 29 hours (i.e., the maximum to remain part-time labor) at all state
public institutions; this rule allows the state to avoid the responsibility of paying
them benefits. Additionally, these hours must be at a single institution. As a re-
sult, many adjunct instructors in these states cannot be "commuter professors";
consequently, however, neither can they make a living teaching as an adjunct for
just one institution.

PHYSICAL AND LEARNING
DISABILITIES IN OWI

Sushil K. Oswal
University of Washington, Tacoma

OWCs are not fully accessible to students with physical disabilities and
learning challenges at this time. A Position Statement of Principles and Ex-
ample Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) ad-
dresses these accessibility issues. This chapter interprets OWI Principle
1 while providing a rationale for the need for accessibility. Drawing on
research in the fields of disability studies, writing studies, and technical
communication for a rationale for disabled access, the author outlines the
main points of the Universal Design for Learning Guidelines 2.0, discuss-
es the key accessibility barriers for disabled students in OWI, proposes
a disability and accessibility agenda for writing programs and illustrates
how educators can employ the OWI effective practices to move toward an
inclusive and accessible pedagogy. The chapter ends with suggestions for
conducting further research in OWI and accessibility.

Keywords: access, Braille Display, Disability Services, Universal Design
for Learning

    In this digital era with promises of seamless, ubiquitous, and virtual technol-
ogies, more often than not we teach online courses that do not reach our students
who have visual, hearing, physical, learning, and dozens of other disabilities. Ed-
ucational institutions spend millions of dollars to purchase computer equipment
that cannot be used by all students, and we publish research that does not even
give a nod to this group although they are already a sizeable minority in our
colleges. In 2008, for example, 11% of US college students reported having a
disability (US Department of Education, 2012). Examples of failure to address
disability in otherwise excellent publications on OWI include those by Kellie
Cargile Cook and Keith Grant-Davie (2005; 2013); Beth L. Hewett (2010),
and Scott Warnock (2009). Researchers in OWI have overlooked disability in
their discussions even when they are considering the questions of access (see, for
example, Gibson & Martinez, 2013) although Hewett has made considerable
additions regarding access in her updated version of The Online Writing Con-

ference (2015b). While it may seem unnecessarily strident to call out scholars
who are on the CCCC OWI Committee, their self-admitted previous failures
in addressing inclusion and access for OWI and their determined goals of doing
so in this book are hopeful for future OWC students and for OWI to become a
morally, ethically, and legally just discipline.

    The design of most online courses lags behind the innovative mainstream
technologies and remains less than desirable for disabled students due to the
inaccessibility of delivery tools or the content itself (Treviranus, n.d.) although
many accommodations for students with print impairments or other disabilities
can be accomplished with digital technology. We also cannot lose sight of the
fact that "access to education provided by distance education is a necessity for all
kinds of learners who are place-bound due to factors such as scarcity of public
transportation, restricted employment possibilities, child-care demands, another
family member's disability-related needs, or sheer remoteness of their domicile"
(Rintala, 1998), issues addressed in more detail in Chapter 10.

    College education can help disabled people become intellectually mature,
acquire literacy skills to speak for themselves, and advocate for an equal place
to live in the world. From a socioeconomic perspective, when a person with a
disability or from any other underprivileged group is employed, the person's
individual advantage also translates into benefits for the society in several sec-
tors (Erisman & McSwain, 2006; Institute of Higher Education Policy, 1998).
It takes them off the Disability Income rolls for financial support; improves
the country's economic base through contributions to Social Security and other
taxes, and offers greater opportunities to the disabled individuals to participate
in the community's civic life. The benefits of the link between literacy and tech-
nology have been established in writing studies literature (for example, see Selfe,
1999). No doubt, with the added income, these meaningfully employed dis-
abled college graduates also will have a higher consumption level and thus grow
the national economy.

    I am not making an essentialist argument about what online technology can
do for the disabled and other place-bound students; rather, my arguments for
accessible technologies regard the need to provide equitable educational tools to
these populations so that they can have learning opportunities comparable to
their non-disabled peers. Laura Brady (2001) cautioned about the dangers of
essentializing contemporary digital tools, as well as OWI because access is not
simply a matter of an up-to-date personal computer, an Internet connection,
and enough funds to pay the college tuition. Exploring the questions of social
and economic class in "Fault Lines in the Terrain of Distance Education," she
mapped out three surface irregularities: access, students' perceptions of teachers'
roles, and retention patterns in OWCs. She explained what she meant by these

260
                                                                                                         Oswal

"irregularities" or "fault lines" by asserting that:

         distance education holds out the same hope as education in
         general (equal opportunity for all) and combines it with a
         popular belief in the transformative power of technology: it
         emphasizes the ideal of anyone learning anytime, anywhere.
         The result is a powerful ideology that explains and perpetuates
         existing social relationships and that makes an individual's
         place within that order seem natural. (2001, p. 353)

    As I reflect on these facts of disparity in online teaching that Brady record-
ed more than a decade ago, I am reminded of a recent email exchange on the
Discussions in the Field of Disability Studies and Rhetoric and Composition
ListServ by a number of writing studies scholars about an online instruction
study. A team of researchers from Columbia University had released the results
of a longitudinal study of online instruction in community colleges they con-
ducted in my state, Washington, in February 2013 (Xu and Jaggers, 2013). As
expected, scholars invested in disability research and online instruction on this
list had picked up the report to see whether this time disability had been in-
cluded in a high-visibility study. In its results, the study reported that "males,
younger students, Black students, and students with lower levels of prior aca-
demic performance had more difficulty adapting to online courses" (p. 6). These
researchers expanded on these findings in the discussion and conclusion sec-
tions by extrapolating that "these patterns also suggest that performance gaps
between key demographic groups already observed in face-to-face classrooms
(e.g., gaps between male and female students, and gaps between White and eth-
nic minority students) are exacerbated in online courses" (p. 23). Xu and Jaggars
stressed that these findings were troubling to them from an equity perspective
and they worried that "online learning could strengthen, rather than ameliorate,
educational inequity" (p. 23). What troubled the disability and rhetoric Listserv
readers most from another angle of equity was that these researchers had studied
Washington State's online instruction for years but the disabled students never
appeared on their investigative radar. What has happened yet again is that the
category of "disability" failed to make it into these researchers' population charts.
The omission probably felt more irksome to some of us who teach writing be-
cause "English and social science" were on the top of the authors' list where a
high proportion of even nondisabled students had more difficulty adapting to
the online environment (p. 24).

    Several members of this national discussion list inquired about this omission
to understand whether this was reflective of the overall state of "things disabled"
in Washington. The group also wanted someone from CCCC OWI Committee

                                                                                                 261
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

to voice this concern. I wrote back to say that:

         My suggestion is that any comments you send to CCCC
         should go both to all the members of the Executive Commit-
         tee of the organization and the Committee on Online Writing
         Instruction (COWI). Ultimately, it is the [Executive Com-
         mittee] EC that has the power to act and enact. I'm copying
         Beth Hewett on this message but a message from Brenda [Jo
         Brueggemann] to EC will be very helpful.

    I further wrote:

         I'm on this committee and I'm pleased to note that Beth
         [Hewett, the Chair of the original CCCC Committee on On-
         line Writing Instruction and present Co-Chair] has listened
         to my constant harangues about accessibility very patiently.
         Based on the field research we have conducted on the state of
         Online Writing Instruction over the past six years, we as re-
         searchers and as a committee have a sense that writing faculty
         across the country are interested in accessibility, want to offer
         accessible online courses but they also sorely lack technical,
         training, and pedagogical support from administrators. (Feb-
         ruary 24, 2013)

    In our national survey in 2011, I had formulated a set of disability-focused
questions to capture the accessibility dimension of online teaching, and what we
learned did not shock me as a person with some experience with disability and
accessibility. We heard that people did not know whether they were teaching
disabled students; if they knew they were doing so, then they did not know
what they could do to support them and they did not know where they could
themselves get training to help these students beyond giving them the phone
number for the Disability Services Office on campus. Some respondents blatant-
ly admitted that they did not believe they were obliged to help disabled students
in any way at all.

    In contextualizing the survey, I further reported to my peers on this Listserv
that:

         Consequent to this survey, our committee has embraced the
         concept of accessibility at the interface level and endorsed the
         concepts of Universal Design for Learning with emphasis on
         both accessibility and usability for the disabled students and
         faculty. You will see that the long expected Effective Practices

         for Online Writing Instruction document composed by our
         committee after six years of detailed academic research, in-
         cluding a nation-wide survey, interviews, focus groups, and of
         course, a thorough literature review, will reflect this disability
         and access focus. (February 24, 2013)

    This is the baggage with which I enter into this conversation about OWI
in this book, and, of course, in the CCCC OWI Committee, I wear the hat of
so-called accessibility specialist. My goal in this chapter is to promote, explain,
and exemplify OWI Principle 1: "Online writing instruction should be univer-
sally inclusive and accessible" and, whenever relevant in this meta-discussion of
accessibility, wrap my fingers around some of the OWI issues in other chapters
to provide further gloss on accessibility (p. 7). My point in providing the above
anecdote about the Washington State report is to remind ourselves that disabil-
ity and accessibility challenges are everywhere in America and, simultaneously,
nowhere. We see disability as a fact of nature, but we do not recognize it as a
fact of life, particularly of our academic work life, and even more crucially, our
teaching life. Disability--and the concomitant need for access--still resides in
that corner of the university, the college, and school where the Disability Ser-
vices office is or where the disabled students' Resource Room is.

    The purpose of this chapter is to interpret the OWI Principle 1 more com-
pletely to pull disability from the margins toward the center. Since this first
principle is an overarching one, this chapter also should serve as a rationale for
inclusivity and accessibility while enhancing our general understanding of acces-
sibility issues. This chapter amply describes where we stand with the accessibility
of OWI courses, but it aims at promoting accessibility practices and strategies
for teaching writing online from various principles (See for example, Principles
1, 9, and 15). Other chapters in this collection contextually address other prac-
tices as a matter of designing inclusive pedagogy (particularly, see Chapter 11
by Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch.) I employ several programmatic and classroom
scenarios throughout the chapter to substantiate the situations and problems I
discuss so that WPAs and OWI instructors may consider how they can integrate
disability inclusive thinking in their local settings. The chapter takes its bear-
ings from research in the fields of disability studies, writing studies, and techni-
cal communication. In the remainder of this chapter, I explicate the first OWI
principle in some detail, summarize the key points of the Universal Design for
Learning (UDL) Guidelines 2.0 that further elucidate OWI Principle 1, discuss
the key accessibility barriers for disabled students in OWI, and then explain how
we can employ the OWI effective practices to move toward an inclusive and ac-
cessible pedagogy. In the concluding section, I speculate on some possible paths

                                                                                                 263

for accessibility and disability research in OWI.

A POSITION STATEMENT OF PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTIVE
PRACTICES FOR OWI

    The CCCC OWI Committee initially considered access in terms of the var-
ious constituencies: students faced with problems of technical and economic
access to Internet technology, students who are developing linguistic proficiency
in English, students living in remote rural areas confronted with an Internet
connectivity gap, disabled students lacking access due to personal, technical,
and institutional accessibility problems with technology, students lacking ac-
cess to online writing pedagogy due to learning disabilities, and so on. As we
mulled over these multifarious access issues and as we analyzed survey data from
disability-related questions, we realized that many of the issues affecting dis-
abled students also affected other constituencies. Our study of the fast-growing
literature in the fields of disability and accessibility repeatedly informed us that
the affordances provided by the flexibility and diversity of the disability-cen-
tered accessible pedagogy are equally beneficial for nondisabled students given
various learning styles and approaches. We also realized that unless we moved
these issues from the periphery to the center of OWI pedagogy, we could not
address questions of access at the institutional and discipline level meaningfully.
Some of this thinking also was based on our understanding of other findings of
disability and accessibility research that repeatedly has proven that addressing
these questions of accessibility after the fact (or from the periphery) results in
temporary and generally poor fixes that provide only limited access and further
marginalizes these constituencies.

    While I do not subscribe to all the claims about accessibility made by the
proponents of Universal Design, UDL, and interface-level design--numerous
other social, market, institutional and other factors are equally responsible for
the neglect of accessibility issues for these marginalized users--I believe that
the frameworks afforded by these design and pedagogical perspectives offer a
reasonable starting point to begin our systematic search for accessibility in OWI.
For example, the principles of Universal Design, which originally were con-
ceptualized in architecture for designing accessible edifices, are not adequate
in educational settings because teaching and learning are dynamic interactions
orchestrated by diverse actors. The contexts within which OWI pedagogical and
learning acts occur are always fluid and they cannot be compared to building
wheelchair ramps and placing Braille signs. Whereas the advocates of Principles
for Universal Design might have some ground to claim that Universal Design
is "the design of products and environments to be usable by all people, to the

264
                                                                                                         Oswal

greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design,"
OWI pedagogy, or any other pedagogy for this purpose, cannot find a stable
ground to make such a wide-ranging assertion (The Center for Universal De-
sign, 1997). Likewise, the UDL goal of serving all students with a general frame-
work for accessibility is simply unachievable because student disabilities can be
so varied and the individual accessibility needs of each disability are so different
(CAST, 2011).

    Returning to A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices
for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) and its OWI principles and example
effective practices for accessible pedagogy, I also want to emphasize that mere-
ly following the document will not make our OWCs accessible. Instead, we
need a fundamental attitudinal shift in our field. While OWI Principle 1 rec-
ommended "using multiple teaching and learning formats; welcoming students
with disabilities in course syllabi; and including disability issues or perspectives
in course content and faculty development workshops" (p. 7), these practices are
merely places to begin thinking about disability and accessibility. Our education-
al institutions and our pedagogies have thus far been conceptualized only for
able-bodied students and those with typical learning abilities and preferences. As
a result, this conceptualization of the purposes and practices of the academy has
rendered disability invisible. To make room for these additional and different
bodies, we will need to overhaul every aspect of our academic infrastructure.
OWI is in an advantageous space to integrate this population because the online
media are still in developing stages and the OWI field has yet not fully defined
its philosophies and practices. The CCCC OWI Committee's commitment to
an accessible online pedagogy is the first concrete evidence of the CCCC's de-
livering its earlier promises of inclusivity and accessibility as stated in its "Policy
on Disability in CCCC" (2006, reaffirmed 2011). While the members of the
CCCC Committee on Disability Issues in College Composition have promoted
access in their activities, the CCCC OWI Committee's position statement is the
first major, organization-wide initiative. Another important aspect of the CCCC
OWI Committee's recommendations is in the recognition of the intersections
of disability, multilingual learning, and basic writing in face-to-face, hybrid and
fully online OWI.1

    The twelve example effective practices written for OWI Principle 1 are an
effort to draw the OWI community's attention to certain focal points for begin-
ning to consider disability and accessibility inclusively, conceptually, and peda-
gogically. For example, in OWI Effective Practices 1.1, 1.4, 1.6, and 1.10 (pp.
9-10), when attention shifts from pedagogy to audience/students in choosing
a modality, the CCCC OWI Committee urged educators to stop conceptual-
izing OWI pedagogy for the erstwhile stock audiences who were assumed to

                                                                                                 265
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

be able-bodied and enjoying all the access to technology that an institution of
higher education offers. Likewise, OWI Effective Practices 1.2 1.3, 1.8, 1.9, and
1.11 draw attention to the reality that a sizeable segment of the student popula-
tion (pp. 9-11), including disabled students, might not have had an opportunity
to use the learning technologies and other resources educators might take for
granted. These recommendations also draw attention to the institutional infra-
structure that may or may not have any specialized technology available. Even if
an institution has acquired this technology, it may not have a training program
to assist students and faculty with such technology. The guidance about text-
books in OWI Effective Practice 1.3 pertains to the responsibility of instructors
to choose only accessible textbooks (p. 9). While students cannot sue a publisher
for offering inaccessible textbooks, they can take a college to court for assigning
textbooks in inaccessible media. The textbook selection is one area where facul-
ty have the power to choose accessible or inaccessible curricular materials. The
Department of Justice's 2013 decision about the complaint against Louisiana
Tech University has established that universities cannot pass on the responsibil-
ity of providing accessible curriculum materials to publishers (US Department
of Justice, 2013).

OWI PRINCIPLE 1 AND THE UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR
LEARNING GUIDELINES 2.0

    UDL Guidelines 1.0 were developed over time in the 1990s by David H.
Rose and Jenna Wasson under the sponsorship of the Education Department at
the Center for Applied Technology (CAST) and the National Center on Access-
ing the General Curriculum (NCAC) for secondary school settings; the guide-
lines began to be expanded to include higher education immediately (CAST
2008; Rose & Meyer, 2002; Rose & Meyer, 2006; Rose, Meyer, & Hitchcock,
2005). The UDL Guidelines 2.0 updated the earlier versions, particularly in the
use of multi-modal means of representation and expression, and they have been
applied broadly at all levels of education (CAST 2011). The UDL Guidelines
1.0 define Universal Design for Learning as "a process by which a curriculum
(i.e., goals, methods, materials, and assessments) is intentionally and systemat-
ically designed from the beginning to address individual differences" (CAST,
2008). The Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 placed UDL in the
legal domain by defining it inside the language of the act. According to this Act:

         the term Universal Design for Learning means a scientifically
         valid framework for guiding educational practice that: (A)
         provides flexibility in the ways information is presented, in

266
                                                                                                         Oswal

         the ways students respond or demonstrate knowledge and
         skills, and in the ways students are engaged; and (B) reduces
         barriers in instruction, provides appropriate accommodations,
         supports, and challenges, and maintains high achievement ex-
         pectations for all students, including students with disabilities
         and students who are limited English proficient. (122 STAT.
         3088)

    The UDL framework aims at short-circuiting the need for retrofits by em-
ploying contemporary technologies to provide access to diverse learners with
varying skills, abilities, and aptitudes. The framework provides guidelines for
accessible curricula under three categories: (1) "provide multiple means of rep-
resentation" or the what of learning, (2) "provide multiple means of action and
expression" or the how of learning, and (3) "provide multiple means of engage-
ment" or the why of learning (CAST, 2011).

    Although the twelve specific guidelines that UDL 2.0 presented are targeted
at a whole array of disciplines ranging from mathematics to music, from the
perspective of teaching writing online, many of the guidelines in each of the
three categories are relevant. As it has been extrapolated to the OWI Principle
1, under the first category, OWI instructors should include options for "the
display of information"; provide alternative representations of auditory and vi-
sual information for students with visual, hearing, and learning disabilities; use
straightforward language to state ideas; and make underlying structural features
of abstract ideas explicit using concrete examples in different modalities. Un-
der action and expression, OWI instructors should assure full access to learning
technologies to students with disabilities and make navigation of tools acces-
sible, make physical action possible through multiple options for interacting
with technology (e.g., mouse, keyboard, headpointers, and the like), employ a
variety of media for communication, give students options to compose in mul-
tiple media, and provide sufficient technical support to execute the aforesaid. In
terms of engagement, OWI instructors should give students enough autonomy
to make our curriculum their own, applying diverse techniques and methods
of knowledge acquisition and interaction. UDL Guidelines are in sync with
the current goal-oriented, self-motivating, collaborative, and interactive writing
studies pedagogy.

BARRIERS TO DISABLED ACCESS IN OWI AND HIGHER
EDUCATION

Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

are created by several internal and external factors. Academia's attitudes towards
disability, non-inclusive institutional infrastructures, indifference of technology
developers towards the accessibility of educational technologies, the stronghold
of ableist pedagogy, and the relative small number of disabled students and fac-
ulty can be held primarily responsible for the current state of affairs.

Institutional and Disciplinary Barriers to Disabled Access in
Writing Programs

    In 1995, disability theorist Lennard Davis declared, "Disability is an un-
avoidable outcome of living" (p. 8); in other words, all of us will be disabled
in one way or another at some time of our lives. Yet, the academy continues
to ignore that fact. Considering that the severely disabled still are woefully un-
der-represented in the student body and faculty from this group remain few and
far between, it is difficult to report meaningful progress in this arena. While
writing studies and technical communication programs have registered great
progress in preparing future professionals and college teachers, we still know
little about disability, Disability Studies, and how to teach those students in our
courses who happen to be disabled. Likewise, academic knowledge of teaching
technical communication and composition to disabled students online has so far
come from our own experiences, class observations shared at conferences, and
a small body of published research for online settings--a great deal of which is
also based on personal teaching experiences rather than empirical research (Lew-
iecki-Wilson & Brueggemann, 2008; Meloncon, 2013). Put together--OWI
and the variegated disabilities of students (and teachers)--we know even less
because we do not understand how we could make our knowledge and pedagogy
accessible to all of them; nonetheless, these students keep arriving in our portals.
In an online setting, this lacuna also might exist partially because we may not
even know that we have disabled students in our courses unless they self-identify
and partially because our discipline has hardly started to think of paying atten-
tion to disabled students in its conceptualization of pedagogical inclusivity and
access (Oswal & Meloncon, 2014).

    Why, so many years after the legislation of the ADA, is there not yet a long-
term vision for accessible and usable OWI in this otherwise burgeoning field of
education? We have not yet seen an LMS that offers multiple interfaces for inter-
action to users with diverse characteristics, learning styles, and adaptive devices
(e.g., screen readers, headpointers, zoom software, and the like). We do not yet
have a delivery tool that has truly adaptable parts and offers a range of features
to cater to people who use digital technology differently. We do not think twice
that a software package that can function perfectly only with a mouse might

                                                                                                         Oswal

be a useless string of code to a high percentage of users who have not been
considered by its designer (to a degree this problem is one of the rhetoricity
that Kevin DePew speaks of in Chapter 14). We do not know what is entailed
in the design and development of a digital learning environment system that
would permit gainful interactions by people of different abilities employing di-
verse adaptive technologies. We know that digital technology in itself is plastic
enough, the World Wide Web is open enough to render its interfaces accessible
to each student in a writing course, and HTML, the language of the Web, is
versatile enough to accommodate the needs of a variety of users, but we do not
know how we could persuade the developers of these interfaces to implement
this flexibility in their online learning tools (Cooper & Heath, 2009).

Negative Attitudes towards Disability and Difference

    Interesting parallels can be drawn between the view that cultural and racial
differences are responsible for the English language "deficit" among multilingual
students and the views about disability and the reasons for the success or failure
of students with disabilities. Just as many times we fail to see that the English
language reading and writing disciplines exclude anything that is not linguisti-
cally Anglo-Saxon, as able-bodied, highly intellectual professors, we also learn to
design and teach courses for students who resemble our bodies and minds. We
expect our students to perform the same functions with the same ease that we
ourselves can exercise. Our convictions might have been validated in the past be-
cause a majority of our students succeeded in obtaining such competence. With
the student demographics changing vastly because of the market demand for
degreed workers, changing immigrant populations, the influx of disabled stu-
dents, and the emerging historical research about the teaching of English during
the past century, we are now learning that there always have been others who
either are left to their own devices to fit themselves into the ableist mold or drop
out of the higher education system. We should strengthen our own knowledge
of linguistic differences, shed outdated teaching practices that were designed for
an exclusionary era (Matsuda, 2006), and reinvent pedagogies and curricula to
meet this different population. For example, efforts at educating deaf students
so far have been concentrated on bridging the speech barrier between the hear-
ing instructor and the ably-designed multimodal curricula through captioning,
sound track transcripts, and interpreters. Very little research has been published
in our field that proposes innovative pedagogies accounting for the linguistic
differences between deaf and hearing learners. This research gap is particularly
noticeable when it is a common knowledge that English is, at best, a second
language for the deaf users of sign languages. Even the deaf-focused current

                                                                                                 269
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

research has not yet addressed this linguistic difference at the pedagogical level
(Babcock, 2012).

    To buck this historic trend in the American university, English Studies schol-
ar Brenda Jo Brueggemann (2002) and Technical Communication researcher
Jason Palmeri (2006) have made a call to resuscitate disability as an "enabling
and transformative insight" in our discipline. They question the precarious lo-
cation that disability presently occupies in higher education. The disabled stu-
dents and faculty on most campuses remain emblematic of their wheelchairs,
white canes, guide dogs, and hearing aids rather than as dues-paying, permanent
members of the academic community. The argument I want to extend in step
with Brueggemann (2002) and Palmeri's (2006) call is that we need to devise
means to understand how to culturally deconstruct and reconstruct disability in
order to move away from the outdated notions of disability as a stigmatized, de-
cayed body requiring help or healing; it should be placed next to other accepted,
strategically situated, and celebrated categories so that our disabled students and
faculty/staff colleagues can enjoy the same privileges that we take for granted as
a matter of our presence in the academy.

Barriers Created by the Difficulty in Enforcing Disability Laws

    Neither the ADA nor the other disability laws regulating education tech-
nologies restrict LMS manufacturers from introducing learning systems in the
market without ascertaining their accessibility and usability for the disabled.
Only the academic institutions have the power to enforce certain accessibility
standards in their purchasing contracts; however, few colleges have yet taken
this step to assure accessibility for their students, faculty, and staff. Most of the
after-the-fact fixes provided by these developers fall way short of what a nondis-
abled user would find satisfactory from an ableist perspective. These retrofitted
solutions rarely enable disabled students and faculty to perform at par with their
peers and when it happens, it is only in selective pockets of the technology and
lasts for only so long until the next system upgrade is implemented to undo the
previous fix.

    Even the proponents of adaptive system approach in the LMS industry, who
draw upon the user data to design intelligent systems for driving the LMS, focus
on the primary goal of efficiency rather than "to create an instructionally sound
and flexible environment that supports learning for students with a range of
abilities, disabilities, interests, backgrounds, and other characteristics" (Shute
& Zapata, 2007). The problem with this last machine-centered approach of
adapting LMS for individual users is that the users in this scenario are passive
producers of data that gets scooped by the developers to figure out what the user

270

want. The users otherwise have no direct say in defining what they need; rather,
it is the developer who tells them what they need on the basis of the intelligent
system's analyses of the user interactions with the LMS. Moreover, these intel-
ligent systems flatten all user data to fit it into pre-defined categories and the
possibilities of custom designed access go out of the window even before it has
been conceptualized.

Learning Management Systems and Their Inherent Accessibility
Barriers

    The next section expands on the chronic accessibility problems built into the
design of latter-day content or LMSs, and it speculates on some of the classic
causes for these problems to linger.

The History of Accessibility Problems in Early Online Delivery Tools

    LMSs have had accessibility problems right from the beginning when they
appeared on the academic market as bundles of tools built on diverse platforms
lacking a foundational vision for interface-level access for a variety of users. As-
sembled from diverse sources, these commercially branded LMSs were targeted
primarily at lecture classes, and their most attractive features for the instructors
of these relatively large classes were the automated tools for quizzes. These LMSs
eventually were to replace the faculty designed websites and hypertexts because
of their greater interactivity. The university-based initiatives of this nature also
started as an assemblage of tools and technologies suffering from the same ac-
cessibility gaps (see, for example, the University of Washington's home-grown
assemblage of tools, Catalyst, which has otherwise been popular among faculty
at a number of schools). We know through user experiences over the life history
of these LMSs that the accessibility profile of these systems has not noticeably
altered from that of their predecessors although they have many more contem-
porary tools available. Their developers have so far unrolled no master plans to
amend the accessibility of these new tools (Oswal, 2013). Almost every one of
the key players in the LMS market has implemented accessibility fixes from time
to time under pressure from courts and organizations of the disabled, but an
accessibility stalemate has so far lasted between what users need to learn or teach
online and the commitment these developers are willing to make for this level
of access. Their attention has remained on quickly adapting little-tested technol-
ogies and designs to compete in a trendy market rather than their pedagogical
relevance.

    From the perspective of Technical Communication and Composition Stud-
ies, even the innovative efficiency tools, such as Canvas SpeedGrader, do not

                                                                                                 271

exactly meld into the process or post-process pedagogy due to its focus on evalu-
ating student work quantitatively. What I want to underscore here is the impact
of such innovations on the already restricted access available to the disabled.
Designing a new academic tool almost a quarter century after George H. W.
Bush signed the ADA into a law, the Canvas developers paid little attention
to its accessibility for the disabled and it remains only partially accessible to
screen readers after applying sporadic fixes. I do not have to belabor the point
that presently a major gap exists between what LMS designers conceptualize as
accessible systems and what their users' needs are. Designed with visual interface
as the primary mode of interaction, these LMSs sorely fall short of what is usable
through other modalities. Their designers also conceptualize accessibility as a
crude, one-on-one correspondence of everything visual into speech device-read-
able text with little accompanying contextual information. Since these environ-
ments have been designed for the human eye, they do not lend themselves well
to other senses. All other senses do not respond to surroundings as quickly as
the human eye does and they require more contextual support for making us-
erly decisions. They also lack the instinctive interfaces for use that otherwise
have become available in mass-marketed consumer technologies employing iOS
interfaces developed for the day-to-day applications by users with a variety of
abilities and preferences.

    Speaking in the context of instructor and student agency, Jane Seale and
Martyn Cooper (2010) pointed to another contextual lacuna in these LMS tools
from the perspective of instructor-student learning relationship:

         It is highly probable that teachers will need to use their teach-
         ing experience and knowledge of learner needs to judge how
         exactly to respond to advice or conclusions derived from the
         application of [LMS] tools. This might be because the advice
         privileges certain aspects above others or because it does not
         take into account the varied and complex contexts in which
         e-learning must demonstrate accessibility. These contexts
         might relate to the relationship that the learner has with the
         teacher (e.g. types of conversations and interactions) or the
         relationship that the learner has with the educational institu-
         tion (e.g. types of systems that an institution puts in place to
         facilitate personalization of the learning experience by learn-
         ers). (p. 1115)

Hence, OWI teachers themselves need to become aware of their students' needs as
learners to begin to address the access problems of an LMS that fails the students.

LMSs and Non-Inclusive Learning Models

    What Seale and Cooper (2010) underlined is true even for exclusive learning
contexts where instructors are forced to co-opt into specific structures imposed
upon by particular tools while potentially compromising the integrity of their
curriculum and pedagogy. In the context of inclusive learning, these restrictive
structures can be doubly damaging to the distribution of even the most in-
clusively designed curriculum and pedagogy unless they have been well tested
both for their technical accessibility and human usability by mostly novice dis-
abled student users. The interactivity tools--the chat programs and discussion
boards-- have serious accessibility flaws because they have been designed only
for ocular efficiency and ease requiring significantly greater effort and time in-
vestment on part of the keyboard users. Not only do they lack instinctive in-
terfaces, but they also fail to provide any meaningful ecological information to
non-visual users. This information is readily available to the sighted.

LMS Industry's Unwillingness to Adopt Inclusive Design

    Working within a content-oriented approach to accessibility, Martyn
Cooper and Andy Heath (2009) addressed this problem of missing user-cen-
tered ecological access through a new model for designing access that moves
the authority to determine what type of access a user needs from the producer,
supplier, or author of an E-learning system to the individual user and the tech-
nological and human agents supporting this user. In this model, instead of an
LMS telling the users what they can have, the users tell the system what they
need. These researchers believe that such a system is possible through an upfront
collection of metadata from users that could then be employed to drive the sys-
tem interface design and content development process so that the users can have
what they need upon demand. If implemented, such a system could stand for
an extreme example of participatory design where users truly contribute to the
design based on what they really want or need rather than what the designers
think they want. Their model overcomes some of the weaknesses of the current
participatory process where designers bring in users after they have already nar-
rowed down the options and want user participants to mainly validate one or
other of their choices. Under this current design regime, even when developers
invite participants to brainstorm the design concept, user ideas rarely get the
same consideration as the expert perspectives do and the participants seldom see
through the complete product development process. Thus far, no one has come
forth to implement this participant-driven model, which would not only help
with access issues generally but with OWI specifically given that most LMSs
have not been designed with writing instruction in mind.

                                                                                                 273
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

The Role of Higher Education in Perpetuating Inaccessible LMS Designs

    On the other hand, imagining that our universities do not have a major role
in determining the design of these academic tools of the trade is simply mind
boggling. How could our institutions be both the power houses for educating
top-notch computer scientists and also be silent witnesses to these LMS designs
with at best a less-than-desirable accessibility and usability record for users with
visual, physical, and learning disabilities? Irrespective of who has what certifica-
tion from which disability organization, not a single LMS during the past de-
cade has been fully accessible to all disabled students (Petri, Rangin, Richwine,
& Thompson, 2012). The instructor-side accessibility record of these manage-
ment systems is even worse because totally blind instructors, for example, are
a rarity and universities have not expended any significant efforts to make the
LMS developers aware of these problems. Nevertheless, these accessibility prob-
lems are a major barrier for blind faculty in providing their students the same
technology-rich learning experience as their sighted colleagues do. This access
gap is not only an issue for students to receive an equitable learning experience
in a blind instructor's course, it also affects that instructor in how the students
evaluate them in comparison with their able-bodied counterparts.

Other Accessibility Barriers

    Listed below are some of the other factors responsible for this accessibility-re-
lated techno stalemate in the United States:

    · Lack of institutional policies for ensuring accessibility for the disabled
    · Lack of implementation of disability policies when such policies exist
    · Unwillingness of administrative departments--IT, libraries, student staff

        and faculty training, capital projects management, and purchasing and
        contracts--to view accessibility as their department's responsibility
    · Leadership's own social attitudes towards disabled students, staff, and
        faculty
    · Marginalization of disability and accessibility in almost every academic
        discipline in higher education

THE PROPOSED DISABILITY AND ACCESSIBILITY AGEN-
DA FOR WRITING PROGRAMS

    My practical purpose in composing this chapter has been to move educa-
tors--particularly OWI instructors--further along together so that those of us
who are already committed to providing accessibility do not have to go on alone.

274
                                                                                                         Oswal

Speaking more directly, I would like WPAs--a hat I have worn--to know that
full-time OWI teachers need your support in addressing this disability and ac-
cessibility agenda because nothing is more annoying than to hear on the disabled
student discussion lists that they want to take online courses but these courses
are simply not accessible to them if they are blind, deaf, or have hand-motor is-
sues (see, for example, the archive of NABS-L, the Listserv of blind and visually
impaired students run by the National Association of Blind Students). With-
in the local context, my appeal to WPA colleagues is that we should take the
leadership role. We should act before online instruction gets set in a mold and
becomes the new version of inaccessible face-to-face education. We should cry
foul when our campus' IT czars adopt inaccessible LMSs. We should seek a seat
at the table where these million-dollar decisions take place. We should argue for
adequate training about adaptive technologies for our faculty so that they know
what their students are using. We should invest resources in accessible content
development from the start, and we should recruit disabled students actively. We
also should hire disabled faculty so that we can cultivate a participatory atmo-
sphere of accessibility for the disabled. OWI Principle 1 stated that we should
adopt these measures as a matter of everyday academic life, not as a matter of
legal expediency or an on-the-spot solution for providing "accommodations"
because the disabled students are waiting at our campus gates (pp. 7-11).

Need for WPAs to Engage in the Technological Acquisitions by
Universities

    Because technological and pedagogical barriers are intrinsically interlinked
in online instruction from the standpoint of catering to students with disabili-
ties, one cannot teach without a delivery tool that is inaccessible to this or any
other population. We should insist on our institutions adopting well-considered
accessibility guidelines for acquiring and deploying new technologies for deliv-
ering online instruction both to meet their legal obligations and provide equal
learning opportunities to all students. Student complaints about the accessibility
of LMSs and other online educational tools are common now. Most recently,
University of Montana and Louisiana Tech University have been in the news
for failing to provide access to these resources (Szpaller, 2012; Department of
Justice, 2013).

Technology and Pedagogy Are Intertwined in OWI

    If we do not provide our faculty with accessible online interfaces to deliver
curricula, whether it is our college's LMS, the online tutoring software, or just

                                                                                                 275
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

the websites, we cannot expect to fulfill disabled students' needs. Angela Owu-
su-Ansah, Patti Neill, and Michele K. Haralson (2011) reported that, in general,
"faculty are not in favor of the acquisition of distance education technology be-
fore the identification of programs and appropriate pedagogy." Since the prima-
ry purposes of universities from faculty's perspective are teaching and knowledge
production, the high-level administrators' "tendency to invest in technology first
and pedagogy or content second causes problems" (para. 26). These researchers'
diagnoses are on the mark because a technical tool-driven curriculum and peda-
gogy serves technology first and our students last, something that Hewett (2013)
argued against. It begins to control the learning process from the start and lets
the curricular and personal goals fall to the wayside.

    In the current social and legal milieu, writing programs will be served better
by moving to an inclusive approach to technology adoption at the IT planning
stages. WPAs should press for accessible technology options from university lead-
ers just as we ask for up-to-date and pedagogy-appropriate technologies because
inclusive pedagogy cannot be separated from accessibility. Douglas Levin and
Sousan Arafeh (2002) claimed that their research indicates that many admin-
istrators interested in integrating new technologies throughout their campuses
also have invested in resources for implementing distance learning appropriate
pedagogy. With consistent effort and legal reasoning, such administrators also
can be convinced to invest in accessible technologies.

Writing Programs Building Campus Coalitions for Promoting the
Accessibility Goals

    To achieve the goal of building an inclusive writing program that provides an
accessible online learning experience for all students, designing an accessible in-
stitutional infrastructure is an imperative. To accomplish this task, the program
leaders should work with administrative leaders across the campus to advocate
for accessible technologies, library systems, tutoring services, and other academ-
ic infrastructure used by online students (see Chapters 5 & 6). Those WPA lead-
ers who cannot develop such partnerships may have to opt for adopting simpler
Web options for delivering online curriculum. The California State University
system has tried to move in this direction by establishing university-wide acces-
sibility standards for purchasing technology.

Need for Close Interactive Relationship between
Writing Programs and Disability Services

    WPAs with a disability-inclusive vision of their programs need to work with

276
                                                                                                         Oswal

the student services administration to have their staff develop disabled students'
orientation programs that will benefit not only OWCs but also all other online
and onsite writing curricula as well as teacher training (see Chapters 11 & 12).
Such programs will help Disability Services staff understand student needs, plan
essential services, and assist these students to plan for themselves. Students with
severe disabilities, such as blindness and deafness, require better-than-average
skills to succeed at college. They do not only need to learn how to navigate
the eclectic learning environments of American postsecondary institutions but
also to learn to mix and match accessible and inaccessible technologies to get
the school work done. Our nondisabled students acquire all this through reg-
ularly offered technology workshops, well-organized learning tutorials by most
campus libraries, and of course, working with technologies that have been cus-
tom-designed for their psycho-physical profile, tested with users similar to them,
employing ably conceptualized methodologies, and made fully accessible and
usable.

    While we should incorporate disabled audiences as we design skills work-
shops on our campuses, the Disability Services staff also can point students to
other available learning resources outside the institution that would enable them
to function effectively in a technology-pervasive college, and afterwards work,
environment--online and off.

Need for Developing Faculty Training in the Area of Accessibility
and Disability

    WPAs also will find that as the pressure from the enforcement agencies grows
on colleges to become compliant with online course content, on-campus Dis-
ability Services will pass on these tasks to faculty for making the content of their
courses accessible (see Ingeno, 2013). As the case law in the area of disability
builds, institutions will have a difficult time avoiding the questions of adequate
accommodations for disabled students at curricular and pedagogical levels. A
vast body of UDL-based research has shown that the faculty fears about the
loss of academic freedom also have so far not proven true (see Konur, 2007
for an excellent summary of the relationship between providing access to the
disabled and its effect on academic freedom and standards). In our own field of
writing studies, Sharon Crowley (1998) explained that whenever a new popula-
tion group is first admitted to the university, an academic crisis always is imag-
ined or created in response to the threat posed by the newcomer to the existing
structure. Providing accessibility to the disabled often results in greater access
to the curriculum for all students. While reconceptualizing and redesigning ac-
cessibility-focused curricula and pedagogy require a major effort and involve

                                                                                                 277
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

a significant investment of time, in the long run the resulting improvements
help WPAs and instructors meet their curricular goals much more effectively,
increase student satisfaction, and raise retention levels. The Communication
Access Realtime Translation system for the deaf (CART), for example, is for
supporting deaf students, but it also can provide professionally finished class
notes to all students when instructors deem it to be appropriate to share this
information for later review.

Options for Addressing Ethical and Institutional Exigencies

    I am arguing not only that it is our ethical responsibility to be inclusive of the
disabled students but I also want to stress that accessibility is no longer optional.
Being prepared for this group of students is an exigency because our interperson-
al interactions with our students in online settings are mediated by technology
that neither favors, nor prejudices against, disability but certainly makes these
students' differences invisible. On the student end, unless adopted with due care
by institutions of higher education, this very technology might raise additional
barriers in the path of learning for our students in onsite, hybrid, and fully on-
line settings. While in onsite, face-to-face settings, faculty might accommodate
a student's needs upon arrival or even mid-semester, in an OWI course, by the
time a student comes forth to report the problem with a course component or
requests for a special arrangement, it might be too late to work in the required
changes without upsetting the overall design of the course. The definition of
being "access ready" in legal terms is not to make "just-in-time" alterations; it is
to be access ready even if we do not expect a single disabled student to enroll in
the course.

    The following heuristic, based on the earlier discussed UDL Guidelines 2.0,
can assist WPAs and OWI instructors in their own planning tasks and shift the
curricular focus to include accessibility at every level of the course design:

   1. Do the course goals address students with disabilities?
   2. Has the curriculum been developed to address these goals, serving the

       needs of all students including students with disabilities?
   3. Has the course content been selected with prior consideration of disabled

       students? Are there other, more accessible content choices that could
       meet curriculum needs while serving this group a bit better?
   4. Have the technology choices for delivering this curriculum been tested
       with actual disabled students? If the campus LMS is not fully-accessi-
       ble, what other delivery choices have been considered? Can the writing
       instructors do more with less technology in order to make these courses

278
                                                                                                         Oswal

       accessible to all the students?
   5. Are the pedagogical methods and techniques differentiated enough

       through "multiple means of representation," "expression and action," and
       "engagement" as described by Universal Design for Learning?
   6. Do these techniques match and support the learning goals of a range of
       abilities and skills, the selected delivery tools, and the chosen curriculum?

    Here is a WPA scenario with one of many possible physical disabilities: To-
morrow is the first day of classes and one of your faculty just realized that the online
multimodal module they are using for the first unit of the five sections of their in-
troductory OWC has no captions. Only this morning, the Disability Services have
given them a heads up about a student with hearing disabilities being enrolled in
one of these sections. If you post a message for captioning services help on one of the
Disability Services discussion lists, the chances are that in response you will receive a
link of this sort, www.automaticsync.com, with the warning that quick fixes are ex-
pensive. It is likely that your OWI instructor will not have the captioned module for
the student for more than a week because many other instructors across the country
have made similar discoveries at the same time.

    In writing studies, we have tried to confront the core issues underlying most
of the problems we have addressed during the past three decades as a disciplinary
community with an identity: basic writers, multilingual writers, gender, and
more recently, plagiarism. Hence, I would argue that we take a more compre-
hensive approach to respond to this contingency as WPAs. After we have con-
vinced the academic technologies boss to pay the enormous bill for this quick-fix
captioning job described above so that the institution meets its legal obligations,
we still will need to get to the core of the real problem. Writing program faculty
seem to be unaware of the implications of the disability laws to their curricula
and pedagogy. They do not seem to understand that "readiness" for disabled
students means "being always ready" and not running around for fixes after
the student's accommodations letter is in their Inbox. It is also possible that the
textbook adoption policy in this program has not been revised since the passage
of the ADA.

    To be inclusive and persuasive to faculty in such a situation, the WPA can set
up a conference call or Web conference with the entire writing studies faculty--
not only those who currently teach with OWI--for the purpose of starting the
formulation process to achieve a functional policy document spelling out a sum-
mary of the institution's and writing program's disability accommodations pol-
icy and how to implement it. Also, the WPA can set a deadline for submitting
requests for such accommodations by instructors irrespective of whether they
expect a disabled student in their courses, and the WPA can provide details on
how the overall process works. Working with a smaller group of instructors on

                                                                                                 279
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

this all-inclusive outline of the document to produce a final draft, the WPA can
produce a collaborative plan for responding to such contingencies in the future.
Consulting the Disability Services and Special Education faculty for additional
suggestions and verifications during this second phase can be helpful. Posting
the document online and making time in the ensuing program meeting to walk
everyone through the document for Q&A is an important step in getting the
faculty to buy in. During this policy inaugural meeting, inviting the Disability
Services and library accessibility staff to make quick presentations relating their
accessibility services can get the faculty started with the process of updating their
courses. Finally, producing a checklist from the program's newly minted policy
implementation document for everyone to have in their teaching folders or to
pin on the office wall can further reinforce the importance of accessibility.

    To prevent this particular contingency in the future, it is crucial to write the
textbook adoption policy to reflect the important curricular changes resulting
from the influx of multimodal content in these writing courses. It also is nec-
essary to describe the accessibility considerations that instructors should make
before adopting any materials for their courses, including contacting the pub-
lishers and the college library for the status of captioning for hearing impaired
on audio-visual items, audio description for the visually impaired on video con-
tent, availability of electronic text and/or recorded versions of your textbooks for
students with learning and visual disabilities. On some campuses, these steps are
performed by the Disability Services personnel as a routine function; so, faculty
should first inquire if such help is there.

    Faculty using complicated print textbooks with many visuals and graphs
should check with the Disability Services about how to make such inaccessible
book content accessible to disabled students (for a discussion of accessibility in
technical communication textbooks, see Wilferth & Hart, 2005). Multimodal-
ity can be used constructively to solve such problems. Complicated graphs can
be drawn tactilely employing a low-cost drawing kit from the American Printing
House for the Blind, and the instructor can produce a transcript to describe each
of the elaborate visuals and post them online for everyone's use. In a study of stu-
dents receiving a mixture of asynchronous audio and text-based feedback, Philip
Ice, Curtis Reagan, Perry Phillips, and John Wells (2007) recorded "extremely
high student satisfaction with embedded asynchronous audio feedback as com-
pared to asynchronous text only feedback" (p. 3). The authors suggested that
what might be suitable for students with visual or learning disabilities might also
serve others well, as is the contention in OWI Principle 1 as Hewett describes in
Chapter 1 (see also Hewett, 2015a). Their interview data analyses revealed that
the audio feedback was perceived to be more effective than text-based feedback
for conveying nuanced comments. The students associated audio feedback with

280

feelings of increased involvement, enhanced learning community interactions,
increased retention of content, and with instructor being caring. How often do
our students miss an important detail simply because their eyes have yet not
become trained enough to pick those minutia? Christine Neuwirth, Chand-
hok Ravinder, Davida Charney, Patricia Wojahn, and Loel Kim's (1994) study
of voice and written annotations in reviews also provided interesting findings
about these modalities. Instructors of multimodal composition and technical
communication also can develop full-fledged assignments around such inacces-
sible course materials where the combined abilities of the whole class can be put
to work, including the disabled students.

    We also need to understand who is responsible for the accessibility of
third-party content. Suppose the campus is increasing the number of online
classes and expanding the use of technology in the on-campus classes. Specifi-
cally, faculty are increasingly linking their course pages to third-party websites,
video clips, old radio programs, and podcasts that they did not create. Offices
of Distance Education often assist with access for only the course materials that
they help faculty create. The issues arising out of the faculty-created course con-
tent often fall outside the purview of these instructional design departments. For
example, often there is a streaming video with no captioning, or transcript of the
sound track. What can WPAs do to educate faculty regarding their responsibili-
ties? Simply speaking, we should make faculty responsible for generating acces-
sible content through enforceable policies. Faculty interested in experimenting
with multimodal composing of course content also must learn how to make this
content accessible. Likewise, faculty who use wide-ranging third-party content
are responsible for making it accessible to all students.

    Here is another scenario designed to convey the ethical and legal obligations
in the OWI classroom: An OWI .instructor has a student who is blind in a hybrid
OWC where multimodal composing is taught and expected. Six problems are pre-
sented with the appropriate actions for addressing the problems directly following
each one.

    1. The instructor posts the homework on Canvas, but the student states that Can-
vas is not very accessible with JAWS screen reader.

    The institution is responsible for adopting an accessible LMS, and it is the
instructor's job to report the problem to the department chair. The student has
the right to file a complaint with the Justice Department if the institution does
nothing.

    2. In the onsite, synchronous sessions of this course, the instructor gives in-class
short writing assignments to inspire students with the assigned reading or writing
tasks. The prompts for these short assignments are placed in front of the class on a
PowerPoint slide, but the student's screen reader cannot read these slides.

                                                                                                 281
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

    The instructor can learn to make accessible slides that can be read by a screen
reader. Another option is to email this prompt to the student at the same time
or before the class. (See this inexpensive resource for learning to design accessible
documents by TechVision at http://www.yourtechvision.com/).

    3. The instructor writes on the electronic whiteboard during class discussions and
brief lectures in these synchronous sessions so that visual learners can stay connected,
but the blind student cannot read from this electronic board.

    Most technical communication textbooks explain that visual presentation of
information is not enough. Reading displayed information aloud assists all stu-
dents in comprehension and assimilation (Johnson-Sheehan, 2012). Informa-
tion Design research also explains that a combination of text and images serves
all readers best and enables greater comprehension (Kahn, Tan, & Beaton, 1990;
Sadoski & Paibio, 2001; Schriver, 2013).

    4. The major multimodal assignments for this course require the use of audio-vi-
sual tools, particularly Flash, and the blind student doesn't know how to use it with
the screen reader. The instructor also realizes that these assignments will require visu-
al composing and the question is how the student will handle it.

    In any of the situations described above, it is important to mind Gail Hawish-
er and Cynthia Selfe's (1991) repeated advice to critically appraise technologies
before allowing them into our pedagogy. A simple answer is that OWI teachers
cannot choose tools that are not accessible to certain learner groups. Flash is
extremely difficult to use without sight although it now does have some accessi-
bility features built into it. Students with other disabilities or health conditions
also can react negatively to Flash; therefore, researching technology choices for
their accessibility to the disabled before adopting them should be included in
course planning. Students should have a few alternatives when multimodal tools
are central to the curriculum. After the signing of the 2008 ADA Amendments
Act, the Department of Justice has pursued universities when students com-
plained about the choice of inaccessible technologies by their schools. (See, for
example, the 2010 joint "Dear Colleagues" letter to all US college presidents
about Amazon's Kindle ebook reader from Education and Justice Departments.
Most recently, in February 2015, the National Association of the Deaf and other
disability rights groups have sought class-action status in a lawsuit against MIT
and Harvard, claiming that their failure to include closed captioning in their
otherwise freely available online course offerings constitutes discrimination and
violation of the ADA (Lewin, 2015).) In case students are expected to learn
these multimedia tools on their own, OWI teachers should check beforehand
that the learning resource's particular tools also are accessible for students with
disabilities. If teaching these tools is part of the course content, pedagogical
techniques should be tailored for disabled students even though OWI Principle

282
                                                                                                         Oswal

2 stated that educators are not responsible for teaching technology. In this case,
the exigency is that teaching the technology to the disabled student is crucial to
the student learning to write in the course. The legal concept of "equal opportu-
nity" kicks in automatically in this situation because as instructors we chose to
include this learning unit in our writing classes. The distinction holds up even
in curricular terms because these multimedia tools then become a segment of
the course content.

    5. The blind student is a fluent Braille reader, but the college Disability Services
has only provided him with an audio-recorded version of the assigned text. The stu-
dent claims that recorded books put him to sleep and he learns more by reading to
himself in Braille. The instructor also believes that reading some of the sections closely
in Braille is important, but the Disability Services states that Braille books are ex-
pensive to produce. After much cajoling on the instructor's part, they have found a
tagged version of the E-text the other students use for the student to read on a Braille
Display. Unfortunately, this student neither owns a Braille Display, nor does he have
a Braille printer; so, he still cannot read this E-text in Braille.

    In the Argenyi v. Creighton University (2013) case appeal, the Eighth Cir-
cuit stated that both the ADA (1990) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act
(1973) require the provision of necessary auxiliary aids and services to individ-
uals with disabilities. Turning to the case law, the Eighth Circuit further noted
that a person is required to receive meaningful access to a University's program
and activities. Although this "meaningful" access standard means that aids and
services are not required to produce the identical result or level of achievement
for persons with disabilities and those without disabilities, these aids and services
still need to provide equal opportunity to the person with a disability in order to
gain the same benefit. OWI instructors also should note that whatever services
are available to on-campus students at an institution of higher education, the
distance students also should have access to those resources.

    Returning to the textbook issue, tagged E-text files, if done correctly, can
facilitate reading with a screen reader. They also can be optimized for Braille
Displays, but without a device to display or print Braille, a Braille copy is not
possible. Since other students have an accessible E-text that does not require the
purchase of a separate device, the college has the minimal obligation to lend a
Braille Display to the student. Preferably, it should provide a hard copy of the
book, which can be printed on a Braille printer in the Disability Services Office.
Most Braille Displays offer only one line of text at time, so they do not allow a
close study of a complete sentence or paragraph. Blind readers with the knowl-
edge of the code often prefer to read the materials requiring close attention in
hard copy Braille rather than listening with a screen reader. The claims about
the cost of producing Braille copies often are exaggerated. Unless the institu-

                                                                                                 283
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

tion's Disability Services has no one who can learn to operate a Braille printer,
paper copies can be produced at a reasonable cost from the publisher-provided
electronic text. The Braille production of books certainly does not cost any more
than many other electronic software resources available to other students. The
need for Braille is comparable to deaf students' need for interpreters and CART
services, and on many campuses, deaf students also have to fight for these ser-
vices.

    6. The student owns a Perkins Brailler for taking notes, but he complains that
the instructor explains concepts rather visually and he loses track of what is going on.

    Multimodality is the forte of all twenty-first century writing professors; so,
reaching OWI students using a variety of explanatory modes--visual, auditory,
kinesthetic, and the like--is appropriate for this context.

    In sum, the accessibility-related responsibilities in OWI can be divided into
three categories:

   1. Course delivery and student support infrastructure
   2. Course curriculum and content development
   3. Student-instructor interaction for content delivery and further content

       generation in the form of participative learning

    While the WPA and the student service/technology personnel are obviously
the point persons for arranging an accessible delivery and support infrastructure,
the OWI instructor is in charge of both producing and delivering content that
is accessible to everyone enrolled. If instructors have to work with an existing
course template, they should work with the WPA on modifying this template
to construct accessibility in the course without being inhibited by the idiosyn-
crasies of the template. If the institution provides pre-made courses to OWI
instructors, then instructors should underscore the limitations of these canned
courses to the WPA and play the role of an advocate for disabled students. In
curricular matters, these disabled students, who might otherwise have gone
through the struggle for access and accommodations with their parents during
their earlier schooling, may not have the academic knowledge or intellectual ma-
turity to represent their own problems as an instructor can do by advocating for
them. We also can support students by teaching them how to advocate on one's
own behalf through course content--readings, assignments, and class activities,
pedagogical methods, and approaches that involve advocacy techniques, and by
foregrounding the lessons of the aforesaid in other online spaces of courses.

    Mary Lee Vance (2007) drew attention to the most challenging problem
disabled students confront in the academy through a simple, generalized claim:
"First-generation disabled individuals are forced into living in a world where
able-bodied people have had generations of role models to assist them, and where

284
                                                                                                         Oswal

the world is designed to address their needs" (p. 13). She continued, "Because
society reinforces ableism, the first-generation disabled must carve out alternate
paths to reach the same destinations, and on occasions the alternate paths may
take longer to build, much less traverse" (p. 14). The point I want to emphasize
is that contemporary disabled students have no reason to carve their paths all
alone. The disability laws demand that education be inclusive and that pedagogy
should reflect this inclusiveness in every aspect of the institution's functioning.
We should not need reminders that this type of advocacy is not new to our col-
leges because we have gone through this process during the past five decades for
accommodating women; racial minorities; lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered,
and queer (LGBTQ); and various other minority students groups. Certainly, we
should not forget that these dissatisfied disabled students are not good for the
publicity of OWI programs.

    Irrespective of what type of control WPAs and OWI instructors have over
curriculum and content, they are in the driver's seat for making the student-in-
structor interaction accessible for content delivery and further content genera-
tion in the form of participative learning. Our task is not only to deliver this
curriculum in an accessible manner but also to make sure that students have
an amply accessible scaffold to interact with teachers and their peers, with the
texts they generate in any of the modalities prescribed or elected, and with the
overall delivery system--the ePortfolio software, the basic LMS tools, and those
ubiquitous portable documents. It is an area of online learning where writing
instructors can shine and literally make a huge contribution to online learning.
The general research literature in distance education has not looked at the sig-
nificance of such interactions in student knowledge-making processes as close-
ly as the process theorists in face-to-face writing studies have done during the
past four decades (Bazerman, 1988; Emig, 1970; Myers, 1985; Selzer, 1983).
Again, OWI instructors can carve new paths for ourselves and disabled students
by collaboratively devising innovative interactional techniques that would work
both for disabled and nondisabled students for comprehending, analyzing, and
synthesizing others' ideas. We can build accessible scaffolds for composing with
our students and have them test these with one another and on themselves as
they practice participatory learning and produce texts and iTexts for OWI-based
writing assignments.

Extending Access to Students with Learning Disabilities

    While students with sensory disabilities face major challenges in accessing
the current curriculum, we do not yet know the extent of challenges faced by
students with learning disabilities and those who have different learning styles.

                                                                                                 285
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

These students are entering postsecondary institutions in large numbers but we
know very little about the different types of learning disabilities and how to
address the needs of this highly diverse group. In addition to following UDL
Guidelines 2.0, OWI instructors can benefit from knowing Web Content Au-
thoring Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG 2.0) for curriculum content and interaction
design, which provide useful information for addressing the needs of diverse
learners. Beginning with the first three guidelines and eventually constructing a
full repertoire of accessibility techniques, instructors can learn to integrate acces-
sibility in their Web design, create accessible Web and PowerPoint presentations,
and receive abundant guidance for making both dynamic and static content
accessible even though the latter is not the purpose or focus of these guidelines.

    Anne Meyer and David Rose (2005) stated that "more differentiated use
of media for instruction reveals that individuals who are defined as learning
disabled within print-based learning environments are not the same individuals
who are defined as learning disabled within video- or audio-based learning envi-
ronments" (24). Indeed, the range of learning challenges consists of difficulties
with text (reading or writing), visual comprehension (reading or using images),
hearing (auditory processing and comprehension), and the need for tactile/kin-
esthetic approaches to content and skills. There is much that this chapter cannot
detail regarding learning disabilities, but OWI teachers, as Hewett pointed out
in Chapter 1 (see also Hewett, 2015a) need to learn more about how their stu-
dents learn and appeal to those styles through a variety of modalities and media.
Those students who are classified as "disabled" may have more significant chal-
lenges than the average student, but most students have preferred learning styles
to which OWI should provide inclusion and access.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    A need exists for a calculated effort at building institutional and program-
matic research on disability, disabled students, and writing pedagogy. Kenneth
Leithwood and Robert Aitken (1995) explained that a learning organization is
"a group of people pursuing common purposes (individual purposes as well)
with a collective commitment to regularly weighing the value of those purposes,
modifying them when that makes sense, and continuously developing more ef-
fective and efficient ways of accomplishing those purposes" (p. 63). While WPAs
and OWI instructors can learn from external research, local data about students'
performance can be even more influential in evaluating mutual successes and
failures (Peterson, 2001; Sullivan & Porter, 1997; see also Chapter 17). For this
purpose, as OWI Principle 15 indicated, data gathering should be an ongoing
process for all OWI administrators and instructors in the near future until a

286
                                                                                                         Oswal

threshold of understanding about inclusive pedagogies for OWI is found. De-
veloping pre- and post-semester surveys both for students and instructors can
help to create a profile of the students' preparation for online learning as they
enter OWI courses and the post surveys can indicate how efforts at inclusive
learning are succeeding. These surveys should be geared to register details about
students' abilities, technology use, technology proficiencies, learning styles, ex-
periences with the inclusive course design and pedagogy, and the interactions
with instructors and peers. OWI teachers also can begin their courses by asking
students to compose a literacy narrative where they cover all the basic categories
listed on their pre-course survey. Such a narrative can educate instructors about
their students' learning preferences, skills, and needs while engaging them in a
purposeful writing activity that naturally reveals writing strengths and weakness-
es. These front-end information gathering activities can be followed by more
intense feedback-gathering activities during the semester. Modified Small Group
intake by a third-party instructor or administrator in online settings can be done
without an interruption in the course schedule. Such a mid-semester evaluation
can provide the instructor with feedback about their efforts at designing an in-
clusive course and give a chance to make changes with the same student group.

    Underscoring the significance of Web accessibility for college students in
face-to-face settings, Susanne Bruyere (2008) expressed that:

         Web-based technology can open or close doors to students
         with disabilities; admissions applications, financial aid in-
         formation, schedules, class assignments, bursar bills, and the
         like are typically posted on the Web. Inaccessible websites can
         pose significant barriers to people who are visually impaired
         or deaf or have learning disabilities. (p. 37)

    WPAs and OWI teachers should be primary in removing--not in creating--
barriers.

    WPAs and writing faculty research writing, teach writing, tutor writing, and
compose their own writing. As a group, we challenge the manufacturing model
of instruction by arguing for small size classes for our students, as articulated in
OWI Principle 9 (pp. 20-21), and we do so while remaining one of the lowest
paid workforces in the academy. When our arguments lose in the face of ad-
ministrative imperatives, we serve students anyway and always at the cost of
our own economic, professional, and personal well-being. Our battles are not
limited to confronting the administrative powers; we also regularly fight those
unending battles on our campuses with colleagues in other disciplines about
how to best improve students' writing. Likewise, in this age of New Media and
multimodality, we should put up a stiff fight about which technologies to adopt

                                                                                                 287
Physical and Learning Disabilities in OWI

and which ones to shun in favor of humane and student-centered pedagogies.
We should engage ourselves in the campus-wide conversations on technology
choices and technology services before the die is cast for the coming decades of
online instruction and hard to reverse decisions are made on the behalf of our
disabled students and faculty. We should not lose sight of the realities of the
front of the room blackboards morphing into PowerPoint presentations with
the instructor-centered pedagogies of the pre-1980s era returning to our face-to-
face, hybrid, and fully online courses with a vengeance.

    To establish a new model of college education for all, we should bring to-
gether OWI and UDL with the aim of designing an inclusive curriculum in the
hands of ambitious instructors backed by an adequately accessible infrastructure
to deliver OWI. If we employ these digital tools of distance learning with the
awareness that they can be judged as better only if they can reach those who have
previously been overlooked, ignored, or under-served, then we can move quickly
beyond the novelty factor and become savvy adopters who concentrate on these
tools' relevance to the task of teaching writing inclusively. We also may realize
that rethinking our pedagogy through these accessibility-centered principles will
initially demand additional work for preparing ourselves for such teaching, but,
in the long run, our reconceptualized courses might offer much more in terms
of content, pedagogy, and comprehensibility for all students.

    The following are recommendations for WPAs and OWI teachers:

    · WPAs should advocate to university administration for accessibility read-
        iness for disabled students.

    · Understand the legal and ethical obligations to provide equal access to
        our courses for all students, including students with disabilities.

    · Keep in mind that accessibility does not stop with technology; it must
        become a part of all curricular and pedagogical thinking.

    · Do not lose sight of the fact that reading and writing are even more im-
        portant for disabled students because these literacy skills can help them
        become financially independent, prepare them to speak for themselves,
        and equip them to claim an equal place to live in the world.

    · Do not forget that disabled students also have diverse needs and skill
        levels, and educators need to address their problems individually.

    · Always place accessibility at the beginning of all planning; it should re-
        main an integral part of all subsequent course design and delivery pro-
        cesses.

    · Reach out to disabled students before or at the very beginning of the ac-
        ademic term so that all necessary arrangements for providing access can
        be made in time.

    · Expand our repertoire of accessible teaching tools beyond the limits of

288
                                                                                                         Oswal

        the UDL framework, even though it is a reasonable starting point for
        accessible course design and pedagogy.

NOTES

1. Regarding the text of A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Prac-
tices for OWI, this document leans heavily for its terminology on Sheryl Burgstahler
and Rebecca C. Cory's (2008) research because our national surveys on OWI failed
to locate a shared terminology among OWI instructors for discussing disability-re-
lated accessibility practices. Our own knowledge of the recommended practices has

                                                                                                 289

been drawn from the cumulative disability literature in Education and Pedagogy,
Accessible Computing, Human-Centered Design, and Disability Studies. As the
discipline dedicates its pedagogical energies on these accessibility challenges across
the country, I am confident that it will develop a set of writing-centered effective
practices, as well as, a shared language to elucidate them.

MULTILINGUAL WRITERS
AND OWI

Susan K. Miller-Cochran
North Carolina State University

Writing programs in higher education are enrolling increasing numbers
of multilingual writers, introducing a unique set of considerations for in-
clusivity to the design and delivery of OWCs. Because so much commu-
nication in an OWC occurs through written English, and written English
is exactly what a multilingual student is working to master, OWI teachers
consistently face an inherent paradox of instructional design. This chap-
ter places the OWI principles in conversation with other scholarship on
multilingual writers, specifically the CCCC Statement on Second Language
Writing and Writers, to provide recommendations for design and instruc-
tion in OWI environments that is inclusive of their needs.

Keywords: diversity, ESL, inclusive OWI design, inclusivity, language,
multilingual student, second-language learner, second-language writer,
universal user

    Many of the guidelines that support effective OWI and provide universal
access for all students (see especially Chapters 8 & 10) apply equally well to stu-
dents who are multilingual writers, sometimes referred to as ESL or second-lan-
guage writers. The specific linguistic challenges that multilingual writers face
warrant additional attention, though, when considering how to interpret the
OWI principles and to design effective approaches to OWI.

THE NEED FOR LINGUISTIC INCLUSIVITY

    In this chapter, I use the term multilingual to refer to students who might
speak a language other than English as their first language, speak multiple lan-
guages fluently, or perhaps speak multiple dialects of English. These students
might be proficient in academic writing in their first languages or perhaps in
multiple languages but probably not in English. By contrast, some students
might not have developed written literacy in their first languages, of which En-
glish may be one.

Multilingual Writers and OWI

    Because of these vast differences in linguistic backgrounds and writing expe-
riences, identifying students who might benefit from a pedagogical approach de-
signed for language diversity can be incredibly difficult. Complicating this task
are the many methods we use in higher education to admit and track students
who come from a linguistically diverse background. Administrators and teachers
in higher education often immediately think of international students when they
hear the terms multilingual, ESL, or second-language learners, but multilingual
writers also can be resident ESL students who are either citizens of the United
States or permanent residents. Patricia Friedrich (2006) explained the impor-
tance of understanding these distinctions when she described the unique chal-
lenges faced by international ESL, resident ESL, and monolingual basic writers.
Depending on how multilingual writers self-identify, they might not recognize
the services an institution provides for students who come from linguistically
diverse backgrounds as pertaining to them. Christina Ortmeier-Hooper's (2008)
case study of three ESL writers complicated the field's understanding of how
multilingual writers from varying backgrounds self-identify with or against these
labels, and Todd Ruecker (2011) explored this complication further by report-
ing on multilingual writers' response to such labels in the placement process. A
multilingual writer cannot solely be identified by a visa status, Test of English
as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) score, skin color, or a spoken accent. Lan-
guage diversity is present consistently in university writing classes and on college
enrollment rosters, and teachers should design writing environments with this
diversity in mind.

    Paul Matsuda (2006) challenged the assumptions prevalent in writing pro-
grams and rhetoric and composition studies scholarship that privilege a linguis-
tically homogenous audience, asking the field to rethink those assumptions and
understand that language diversity in writing classes, and on college campuses as
a whole, is increasing. Writing programs consistently have ignored these differ-
ences, however, by designing courses that assume a threshold of common com-
petency in written academic English (Matsuda, 2006) and hiring faculty who
may have expertise in teaching writing but not in working with a linguistically
diverse student population. This assumption of "linguistic homogeneity" (Mat-
suda, 2006) has led teachers (both online and in the classroom) to outsource lan-
guage-specific help that students need in writing classes to other places such as
Intensive English Programs, remedial courses, and writing centers. While such
additional help certainly can aid student success in academic writing, especially
when the class is taught as a hybrid or fully online OWC, it does not free the
instructor of responsibility for designing and facilitating the class in a way that
is inclusive of the needs of multilingual writers. Rather, instructors must know
their students and understand the language diversity present in the class. The

contextual cues that instructors might rely on to detect specific linguistic needs
in an onsite classroom are sometimes absent in an online environment, although
other cues might be present. For example, a multilingual writer in an onsite
classroom might have a spoken accent or visibly struggle to complete an in-class
writing activity on time. Likewise, the student might speak in another language
with a classmate to ask for clarification on an assignment or use a translation
dictionary to understand instructions or a reading assignment. In an online en-
vironment, these cues might be absent, but others might be present, such as
transfer-related language issues in the student's writing or challenges with under-
standing organization and citation expectations in American academic writing.
In all contexts, courses should be designed with the assumption that language
variety will be present in the class. A linguistically-inclusive approach to OWI
from the beginning of the design process can help students navigate a course
effectively and prevent students from stumbling over elements of the course not
essential to meeting the course objectives.

    This chapter aims to bring some common educational principles related to
multilingual writing instruction, specifically CCCC's A Statement on Second
Language Writing and Writers (2009), into conversation with the CCCC Position
Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for Online Writing Instruc-
tion (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013). Explicitly, this chapter outlines strategies
to help writing programs and individual instructors design courses that uphold
OWI Principle 1, that "Online writing instruction should be universally inclu-
sive and accessible" (p. 7). Further, this chapter assumes, as Matsuda (2006) ar-
gued and others have reiterated (Miller-Cochran, 2010), that all college writing
environments, even those online (Sánchez, 2013), include multilingual writers
and must be designed to be inclusive and accessible to a linguistically diverse
audience.

UNDERSTANDING THE NEEDS OF
MULTILINGUAL WRITERS

    If online writing specialists take cues from the scholarship on UDL (see
Chapter 8), then OWI should be designed with the assumption that diversi-
ty is always present and that effective online courses take into consideration
many elements of diversity in their design. Part of the challenge of implement-
ing UDL principles into course design, however, is that the instructor/designer
often thinks of a "universal user," essentializing the needs of a diverse group of
users into a set of common traits. Jennifer Bowie (2009) encouraged teachers
and course designers to think instead of a "universe of users," which allows for a
multitude of diversity. This chapter argues that language diversity, especially in

                                                                                                 299
Multilingual Writers and OWI

the context of writing classes, is an important element of that context, especially
if we consider that individual students, such as the multilingual students with
hearing impairment studied by Gary Long and his colleagues (2007), might
need multiple accommodations in a class.

    Because so much communication in an OWC occurs through written En-
glish, and written English is exactly what the multilingual student is working
to master, OWI teachers consistently face an inherent paradox of instructional
design. What must be acknowledged if a writing program or writing teacher
seeks to design a course for a "universe of users" (Bowie, 2009) that takes into
consideration the language variety present in American higher education writing
classes? What needs do multilingual writers have that the teacher/designer must
consider to design an effective OWC?

    Understanding how multilingual writers use writing technologies provides an
important piece to the puzzle if the field aims to respond to these questions. Sev-
eral scholars in second language writing studies have explored how multilingual
writers use a variety of technologies in their personal writing, in their academic
writing, and in social media environments (e.g., Boas, 2011; DePew, 2011; De-
Pew & Miller-Cochran, 2009; Shih, 2011). Developing a deep understanding of
how multilingual writers use and navigate specific writing technologies can help
teachers design and facilitate more effective writing classes generally and stron-
ger OWCs specifically. This type of exploration and knowledge-building often
is left to second language writing specialists, the "ESL Person" that Gail Shuck
(2006) described, yet all teachers and writing program administrators (WPAs)
need to develop awareness of the unique challenges and needs of multilingual
writers (Miller-Cochran, 2010).

    The CCCC Position Statement on Second Language Writing and Writers (2009)
described the benefits to writing teachers of understanding the ways their mul-
tilingual students are using technology:

         For example, teaching writing with technology can give second
         language writing students an opportunity to build upon the
         literacy practices with which they are already familiar and
         comfortable. Those students who have access to technology
         can be relatively proficient with multiple applications, especial-
         ly second language students who use the technology to keep in
         touch with home and reach out to people around the world.
         These students often demonstrate savvy rhetorical strategies,
         including the ability to communicate with others who write
         in other varieties of English. With the help of an instructor,
         second language writers can learn to bridge the strategies they

300

         use to communicate socially through digital media to the ex-
         pectations of the academy. Therefore, instructors need to learn
         how to proficiently work with the writing tools and within the
         writing contexts that will help second language writers create
         these bridges ... instructors need to be trained to work with
         various writing media (e.g., computer programs) so that they
         can take advantage of these pedagogical opportunities. (Part
         Four: Building on Students' Competencies)

    Writing teachers have an opportunity during the design process to consider
the kinds of technologies their students might already be familiar with, or they
can leave open the technologies students can use to accomplish various writing
tasks (if appropriate) to draw upon students' current literacy practices. Likewise,
if a teacher believes it is important for students to master a specific technology,
explicit instruction in the use of the technology should be a part of the course
design for students who might not already be familiar with it. This need cor-
relates with OWI Principles 2 and 10 (pp. 11, 21-23).

    In addition to understanding how multilingual writers use writing technol-
ogies, teachers and course designers must understand the nature of the language
learning process, realizing that "the process of acquiring syntactic and lexical
competence" in a language does not happen in a semester or in a year (CCCC
SLW Committee, 2009). Rather, it takes a significant amount of time to reach
such competence, so a multilingual student may be mastering various aspects
of written English throughout his or her college career. Multilingual writers
also might struggle with other expectations in American academic writing con-
texts. As the CCCC Statement on Second Language Writing and Writers (2009)
explained, "Some students may have difficulty adapting to or adopting North
American discursive strategies because the nature and functions of discourse,
audience, and rhetorical appeals often differ across cultural, national, linguistic,
and educational contexts." For example, some multilingual students in online
environments may struggle with unspoken expectations about participation in
online discussions or the type of critiques they should offer classmates during
peer review. For them--and to meet the needs of all students, frankly--OWI
teachers should provide explicit expectations and instructions for how to par-
ticipate in particular parts of the OWC. At the same time, other multilingual
students already have had considerable exposure to written academic English
and to American academic culture, and labels such as ESL, multilingual, or in-
ternational student might inadvertently cause an instructor to make assumptions
about the needs of multilingual students in the class that are not necessarily true.
The bottom line is that OWI teachers should design the class to accommodate

                                                                                                 301
Multilingual Writers and OWI

a variety of linguistic needs from the beginning--avoiding the need to retrofit
the OWC--and make the expectations for course requirements clear, but they
also should take the time to get to know individual students to be sure that their
questions and needs are met.

    To help meet the need for OWI teachers to understand the ways their mul-
tilingual writers might work best in an online, technology-rich environment,
this chapter provides specific suggestions, drawn from the scholarship on OWI
and on second language writing, to help with effective course design, especially
in writing programs that enroll a significant number of multilingual writers. A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013) provided a starting point from specific OWI principles
by helping to raise questions particular to multilingual writers:

    · What balance should an OWC strike between focusing on writing and
        providing support for technologies that might be unfamiliar to multilin-
        gual writers (OWI Principle 2, p. 11)?

    · What unique strategies should be developed to help multilingual writers
        in an online writing environment (OWI Principle 3, pp. 12-14)?

    · What theories of teaching writing should guide the design of a course
        that enrolls multilingual writers (OWI Principle 4, pp. 14-15)?

    · How should faculty be prepared to work with multilingual writers in
        OWI environments (OWI Principle 7, pp. 17-19)?

    · How many students should be allowed to enroll in a single section of an
        OWC (OWI Principle 9, pp. 20-21) when the course is entirely com-
        prised of multilingual writers? When the course has both multilingual
        writers and those typically considered native writers?

    · For what unique aspects of the technological and pedagogical compo-
        nents of OWI should multilingual writers be prepared (OWI Principle
        10, pp. 21-23)?

    · How should online communities be developed to foster student success
        for multilingual writers (OWI Principle 11, pp. 23-24)?

    · What additional support--OWL, library, counseling, and the like--
        should be available for multilingual writers that might be essential to
        their success in an OWC (OWI Principle 13, pp. 26-28)?

    · What selection, training, and ongoing professional development practic-
        es for OWL administrators and tutors would support multilingual writ-
        ers' success (OWI Principle 14, pp. 28-30)?

    · What ongoing research should the field pursue to understand the unique
        needs of multilingual writers in OWI environments (OWI Principle 15,
        pp. 31-32)?

    The remainder of this chapter will respond to these questions by discussing
the recommendations of the OWI principles in detail and relating them specifi-
cally to a multilingual writing context.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR INCLUSIVE OWI DESIGN

    The principles for OWI in A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) are equally applica-
ble for classes enrolling multilingual writers, but a contextualized interpretation
of some of the effective practices, paying specific attention to the needs of a
linguistically diverse audience, helps guide effective course design. The follow-
ing sections provide suggestions for effective practices tailored to a multilingual
audience that draw on the instructional, faculty, institutional, and research prin-
ciples provided in the statement.

Instructional Principles

Presenting Content and Choosing Technologies

    What balance should an OWC strike between focusing on writing and pro-
viding support for technologies that might be unfamiliar to multilingual writers?
As OWI Principle 2 reminded teachers, the focus of an OWC needs to remain
on writing and not on teaching students to use technology unless a rhetorical
knowledge of that technology is an integral part of the course outcomes (see
Chapters 1 & 14).

         OWI Principle 2: An online writing course should focus on
         writing and not on technology orientation or teaching stu-
         dents how to use learning and other technologies (p. 11).

    When working with multilingual writers, however, a teacher also must con-
sider that some technologies may be unfamiliar to students, or they may be used
to using similar but different technologies that are more popular in other social
or cultural contexts than the technology the instructor assumes students would
use. In such a case, the instructor has as least two options:

    · Insist that the students use a specific technology because it achieves an
        important learning goal in the course.

    · Provide students with the option of using a technology the instructor
        recommends or using a technology with which they are already familiar.

    If the first option is chosen--such as the LMS--the instructor should pro-
vide information to help students learn to use the aspects of the technology

                                                                                                 303

that are most important for student success. This instruction could be provid-
ed in the form of links to videos or online help guides, access to IT support
at the institution, or help from the instructor (in the form of instructions or
guides created for the course). I recommend searching for resources already
available online first before creating new help guides for students; many re-
sources already are available online, but instructors might need to teach stu-
dents how to find them.

    Additionally, instructors should think broadly about the kinds of technolo-
gies they might allow students to use in an OWC, so they are using a familiar
tool while mastering writing in a new language. For example, Debra Hoven
and Agnieszka Palalas (2011) conducted a longitudinal study that investigated
the use of mobile technology for language learning with multilingual students.
Mobile technologies might provide a familiar anchor for multilingual students
for some kinds of tasks, but the instructor must weigh the affordances of specific
technologies with the goals of the course and assignment.

Facilitating the Course

    What unique strategies should be developed to help multilingual writers in
an online writing environment, and what theories of teaching writing should
guide the design of a course that enrolls multilingual writers? OWI Principle 3
provided guidance in responding to these questions by reminding teachers that
some strategies for OWI are unique to the instructional environment.

         OWI Principle 3: Appropriate composition teaching/learn-
         ing strategies should be developed for the unique features of
         the online instructional environment (p. 12).

    A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) suggested that instruction in writing should
be clear, and that oral and/or video supplements also should be provided. When
designing an OWC for multilingual writers, providing instruction in multiple
modalities is all the more important. As studies by such scholars as Joy Reid
(1987) have shown, the learning preferences of multilingual writers can differ
significantly from monolingual students and from each other. Providing mul-
tiple avenues for understanding instruction, especially when the language of
instruction is not the students' first language, makes sense pedagogically. If a
student has difficulty understanding written instructions, oral and/or video in-
struction might provide more clarity.

    Furthermore, OWI Principle 4 reminded instructors that established effec-
tive pedagogical strategies, while they might need to be adapted for online in-
struction, are applicable in OWI environments.

304

         OWI Principle 4: Appropriate onsite composition theories,
         pedagogies, and strategies should be migrated and adapted
         to the online instructional environment (p. 14).

    In addition to considering the theories of teaching writing and teaching in
online instructional environments mentioned in A Position Statement of Princi-
ples and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013),
instructors must consider established effective practices in second language writ-
ing studies. The CCCC Position Statement on Second Language Writing and Writ-
ers (2009) provided several principles for facilitating effective writing courses
for multilingual writers. For example, course assignments should avoid relying
on specific cultural knowledge to complete the assignment. When possible, an
alternative assignment should be given for multilingual writers. When courses
meet entirely or partially online, following such principles of course design are
even more essential because important face-to-face contextual cues are absent
that might indicate to an instructor when more information or an alternate
assignment is needed. Multilingual students may not be comfortable from a
cultural standpoint in signaling their confusion through direct questions.

Faculty Principles

Preparing Faculty to Work with Multilingual Writers

    How should faculty be prepared to work with multilingual writers in OWI
environments? OWI Principle 7 explained that instructors in online writing
environments must have adequate preparation and professional development
opportunities for teaching in online environments:

         OWI Principle 7: Writing Program Administrators (WPAs)
         for OWI programs and their online writing teachers should
         receive appropriate OWI-focused training, professional
         development, and assessment for evaluation and promotion
         purposes (p. 17).

    Just as teachers must be prepared to teach in an OWI environment, they also
should be prepared to work with multilingual writers in an online setting. WPAs
and writing teachers need to have adequate preparation for working with multi-
lingual writers in all instructional environments (Miller-Cochran, 2010; Shuck,
2006). Gail Shuck (2006) described several strategies she used on her campus
to strengthen awareness of the needs of multilingual writers across the curricu-
lum. Two of her strategies included publishing multilingual student writing and
conducting faculty development workshops for writing instructors across the
curriculum (Shuck, 2006). The CCCC Position Statement on Second Language

                                                                                                 305
Multilingual Writers and OWI

Writing and Writers (2009) suggested the following topics for such faculty devel-
opment workshops: cultural beliefs about writing, developing effective writing
assignments, building on students' competence, and responding to multilingual
writing. Workshops addressing these issues and incorporating effective practices
for the online writing environment as well would help instructors design courses
that are inclusive and accessible.

Course Caps

    How many students should be allowed to enroll in a single section of an
OWC? OWI Principle 9 provides a clear guideline for course caps in OWCs:

         OWI Principle 9: OWCs should be capped responsibly at 20
         students per course with 15 being a preferable number (p.
         20).

    The guideline provided for the OWCs in OWI Principle 9 matches the rec-
ommendation of the CCCC Position Statement on Second Language Writing and
Writers for classes that enroll some multilingual writers in a course that also
enrolls students who identify English as their first language (see Chapter 1).
The recommendation for courses comprised only of multilingual writers, how-
ever, is a maximum enrollment of fifteen. Therefore, in a writing program that
offers online courses designated only for multilingual writers, the maximum
enrollment should be fifteen students. Additionally, institutions that enroll a
significant number of multilingual writers in OWCs should consider setting a
maximum enrollment of fifteen for all classes, given the preferred recommenda-
tion of OWI Principle 9 and the suggestion of the CCCC Position Statement on
Second Language Writing and Writers (2009).

Fostering Student Success in the Course

    For what unique aspects of the technological and pedagogical components
of OWI should multilingual writers be prepared? OWI Principle 10 provided
guidance for considering what preparation to offer all students who enroll in
OWCs:

         OWI Principle 10: Students should be prepared by the in-
         stitution and their teachers for the unique technological and
         pedagogical components of OWI (p. 21).

    In addition to the kinds of preparation described in the effective practices
for OWI Principle 10 (see also Chapter 1), multilingual writers might need sup-
port to become familiar with technological and pedagogical expectations that
are culturally specific. For example, an instructor might need to provide direct

306
                                                                                              Miller-Cochran

instruction with ample examples to students in an OWC about how to address
correspondence to the instructor and to other students, what technology should
be used to communicate, and what kinds of questions might be asked (and how
frequently). Similarly, multilingual students may have different cultural con-
ventions governing their understanding of such issues as plagiarism. While this
is not an OWI-specific issue, it is certainly common in online settings where
students do much of their research through the Internet. In such cases, explic-
it instruction that recognizes the cultural differences in notions of plagiarism
would be appropriate pedagogy.

    Teachers also should use care to construct online communities in a way that
helps to foster success for multilingual writers. OWI Principle 11 underscored
the value of online communities for student success:

         OWI Principle 11: Online writing teachers and their institu-
         tions should develop personalized and interpersonal online
         communities to foster student success (p. 23).

    When following the suggestions for effective practices for OWI Principle
11, however, OWI teachers should keep in mind the unique situation of multi-
lingual writers. For example, Effective Practice 11.2 suggested using icebreakers
and other writing activities to familiarize the students with the LMS and with
each other (p. 23). While icebreakers can be quite effective, many such activities
ask students to reveal personal information or be more familiar with colleagues
in a class than some multilingual writers are used to or comfortable with. While
it is certainly desirable to help acclimate students to expectations in an Ameri-
can academic setting, sensitivity to the students' familiarity with such activities,
especially early in the semester, might help instructors choose activities that will
not draw on expected common cultural knowledge or put students in an unnec-
essarily uncomfortable situation. Explaining the purpose of the activities and the
importance of building a strong community in a writing course can also help
foster multilingual student success.

    Similarly, Effective Practice 11.7, which suggested providing informal spaces
where students can discuss course content with or without teacher involvement,
should be considered differently in a multilingual writing context (p. 24). De-
pending on the language backgrounds of the students in the course, instructors
might consider whether or not they want to offer a space where students may
converse in languages other than English to seek clarification or additional help.
While scholars have written about the strategic and effective use of first languag-
es in ESL classrooms (Yough & Fang, 2010), little has been written about the
use of first languages in multilingual OWCs. This is a specific area of research
that would be of use to the field (see Chapter 17).

                                                                                                 307

Institutional Principles

Linking to Outside Help

    The institution also bears responsibility to help foster online student success
by providing appropriate resources to support their writing. What additional
help should be available for multilingual writers that might be essential to their
success in an OWI course? OWI Principle 13 provided a starting point for re-
sponding to this question:

         OWI Principle 13: OWI students should be provided sup-
         port components through online/digital media as a primary
         resource; they should have access to onsite support compo-
         nents as a secondary set of resources (p. 26).

    Because of the unique challenges that multilingual writers face in OWCs
(that is, working to master written English in a course where nearly all of the
instruction and communication is in written English), providing online/digital
support for these students is all the more important. OWLs with appropriately
trained tutors are especially important. As the CCCC Position Statement on Sec-
ond Language Writing and Writers (2009) stated, multilingual writers use writing
centers for a variety of reasons. They:

         often visit the writing center seeking support in understand-
         ing writing assignments, developing a piece of writing, and
         to gauge reader response to their writing. They may also seek
         input on interpreting teacher feedback or assessment and
         learning more about nuances of the English language. (para.
         18)

    Making such support available to students in the primary medium of in-
struction is essential to their success. Additionally, teachers should provide clear
explanation to students about what to expect from writing centers/labs in Amer-
ican educational settings. As Shanti Bruce (2004) described, multilingual writers
may experience anxiety about using the writing center because they do not know
what their expectations should be. Multilingual writers may misunderstand the
nature of what writing tutors will do to assist them because of differing cultural
expectations, and preparing them for what to expect from a writing tutor can
help facilitate a more useful session. Multilingual writers in OWCs should also
have access to support in other modalities, especially if the challenge of commu-
nicating in written English about their learning of written English is proving
difficult.

Preparing OWL Staff to Work with Multilingual Writers

    Because the OWL can be so essential to multilingual writers' success, what
selection, training, and ongoing professional development practices for OWL
administrators and tutors will support these students' success? OWI Principle
14 outlined suggestions for the preparation of OWL administrators and tutors:

         OWI Principle 14: Online writing lab administrators and
         tutors should undergo selection, training, and ongoing pro-
         fessional development activities that match the environment
         in which they will work (p. 28).

    In addition to receiving training for working in an online environment,
OWL administrators and tutors should have access to training for working with
multilingual writers. Because the OWL environment may involve both asyn-
chronous and synchronous modalities (see Chapter 5) and because the needs of
multilingual learners often differ from those of other students, various types of
advice can be combined to develop a thorough training program. The CCCC Po-
sition Statement on Second Language Writing and Writers (2009) suggested hiring
tutors with specific preparation in working with multilingual writers. Specific
suggestions for tutors from the Statement included:

    · Model and discuss effective approaches for working with second lan-
        guage writers in tutor training.

    · Make available reference materials specific to language learners such as
        dictionaries on idiomatic English.

    · Hire tutors with specialized knowledge in second language writing.
    · Hire multilingual tutors who can provide second language writing stu-

        dents with first-hand writing strategies as well as empathy.

    Beth L. Hewett and Robert Lynn (2007) offered context-focused recom-
mendations for OWL tutors who would be meeting with multilingual students.
Knowing that the meetings might occur in a text-based medium either asyn-
chronously or synchronously, they recommended first that tutors should be im-
mersed in the medium and modality as trainees because that would give them
practice talking through text and in expressing their advice with precise lan-
guage. Their first rule of thumb was to be correct in one's advice because being
wrong or fuzzy about standard English practices would confuse the multilingual
writer especially and might cause a lack of trust. The other ten recommendations
were:

    1. Know how to "give face"

    2. Sell yourself as a tutor

                                                                                                 309
Multilingual Writers and OWI

    3. Make an art of "clock watching"
    4. Find out what the student wants
    5. Learn how to talk to a particular student
    6. Know what you're talking about
    7. Proofread (your advice)
    8. Contextualize the conference
    9. Use clear language
    10. Teach by doing
    OWL websites also should be designed with consideration for the needs of
multilingual writers. Fernando Sánchez (2013) examined the OWL websites of
eight different institutions to determine how well they considered multilingual
students' needs. His criteria provided a concise set of guidelines for OWL websites:

    · Intercultural Needs: clear policies on what is expected of students as well
        as a description of their role in the tutoring session.

    · Writing Resource Needs: exercises and handouts that deal with the com-
        posing process and which are addressed to ESL students.

    · Plagiarism Resource Needs: a discussion of the cultural differences regard-
        ing the borrowing of other people's work and ideas.

    · Readability: an average word count of 17 words per sentence. (Sanchez,
        2013, p. 171)

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    OWI Principle 15 asked the writing studies field to consider what kinds of
ongoing research to pursue related to OWI:

         OWI Principle 15: OWI/OWL administrators and teachers/
         tutors should be committed to ongoing research into their
         programs and courses as well as the very principles in this
         document (p. 31).

    The suggestions in this chapter are derived from a combination of effective
practices in OWI and in multilingual writing instruction, but very little system-
atic research has examined the unique environment of the multilingual OWC or
OWL. Much work remains to be done. The field needs to discover what happens
when teachers follow recommendations that combine the research in these areas.
Who is included, and who has been left out? What remains to be considered?

    To that end, this chapter recommends the following approaches for working
effectively with multilingual writers in an OWC:

310
                                                                                              Miller-Cochran

    · Design the course to foster multilingual student success by suggesting
        additional resources already available online, providing instruction in
        multiple modalities, and avoiding course assignments that rely on specif-
        ic cultural knowledge to complete the assignment.

    · Provide support for students for technological and pedagogical expec-
        tations that are culturally specific; for example, explain the purpose of
        interpersonal activities to help foster multilingual student success.

    · Prepare WPAs, teachers, OWL administrators, and OWL tutors both
        for teaching in an OWI environment and for working with multilingual
        writers.

    · Set maximum course caps of fifteen students for OWCs composed only
        of multilingual writers.

    · Consider whether or not to offer a space in the course (e.g., a designated
        discussion forum) where students may converse in languages other than
        English to seek clarification or additional help.

    · Provide online/digital support for students through avenues such as
        OWLs, and give students a clear explanation about what to expect from
        writing centers/labs in American educational settings.

    · Design and conduct systematic research examining the unique environ-
        ment of the multilingual OWC to add to the field's knowledge base.

    Michael Moore and Greg Kearsley (2004) have used the theory of transac-
tional distance to describe the unique challenge in online teaching and learning
of connecting students to the course, teacher, each other, and the content of the
class. In an OWC with multilingual writers, language is an additional element
that can create distance in the course because teachers often use language to
build bridges intended to span the other gaps in transactional distance. Teachers
cannot assume a homogenous level of competence in written or spoken English,
so they must consider design elements, uses of technology, and pedagogical prin-
ciples that can facilitate course objectives without further distancing multilin-
gual writers. Ultimately, the effective practices I have described in this chapter
are suggestions that could help facilitate the success of a variety of students, not
just multilingual writers. This is the heart of UDL and designing for a universe
of users; if teachers design for and teach to the possible needs of a variety of stu-
dents, OWCs (and OWLs) will be more inclusive and accessible for all.

NONTRADITIONAL STUDENT
ACCESS TO OWI

      Michael W. Gos
      Lee College

        This chapter examines difficulties faced by nontraditional students when
        negotiating online learning in general and OWCs as a particular example
        of their access challenges. It begins with an identification of populations
        considered nontraditional and underserved in the realm of online, as op-
        posed to onsite, education. It then examines many of the issues that stand
        in the way of success for members of these groups as they attempt online
        learning and OWI particularly. Specific recommendations for OWI are
        included in the conclusion.

        Keywords: African-American, incarcerated, military, older adults, pris-
        ons, remotely rural, social class, urban, working class

    The CCCC OWI Committee's OWI principles began with what the com-
mittee has argued is the overarching principle for effective OWI. OWI Principle
1 reads: "Online writing instruction should be universally inclusive and acces-
sible" (2013, p. 7). This recommendation should be considered at every step of
WPA and OWI course planning and implementation processes, as indicated in
Chapters 1 and 8.

    Access for OWI is not universal today and, even in cases where OWCs are
more or less accessible to students, there are factors that affect students' abilities
to negotiate them. This lack of inclusiveness tends to be acutely experienced by
nontraditional students. This chapter examines several student cohorts generally
considered nontraditional and underserved--in that they are not the typical, age
24 and younger, residential students--and it examines the issues they face when
negotiating online learning generally and an OWC particularly.

    In July, 1995, the National Telecommunications & Information Administra-
tion (a division of the Department of Commerce) began a series of reports about
what they called the "Have-Nots" with respect to technology access in America.
A later report in that series introduced the term "digital divide" (US Department
of Commerce, 1998). The term refers to the differences in digital tools and

Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

Internet access among various groups in American society. These reports exam-
ined racial, economic, geographic, and educational cohorts and considered their
access to technology with respect to each other and to their own earlier status as
presented in the previous reports (US Department of Commerce, 1995, 1998,
1999, 2004). The reports noted that young, affluent, white, educated, and espe-
cially urban and suburban students were more likely to have access to Internet
technology than older, black, Hispanic, Asian, and rural students. Carolyn Hay-
thornthwaite (2007) also found young, urban, suburban, Asian and white users
with higher education and income levels to be more likely to be online than
black, Hispanic, rural, low-education, or low-income students.

    OWI would seem to be a particularly promising venue for serving some
difficult-to-reach audiences. Students located so far away from a college center
that commuting is impossible would appear to be a perfect fit for a fully online
class. Active-duty military and their families often have schedules and sudden
deployments that make an onsite writing course impossible. Prison inmates also
seem to be a promising audience for OWCs because of the cost and difficulties
of setting up onsite programs within the prison itself. Yet, for a variety of rea-
sons, these and other groups like them tend to be underserved by online college
and university writing programs.

    This chapter first considers where students can access computers, digital
technologies, and the Internet generally. Then, it examines the digital divide
issue as faced by several nontraditional student groups as they attempt to nego-
tiate OWCs. It concentrates on the following groups:

    · Working-class students
    · Older adult students
    · Remotely rural students
    · Urban students
    · Military learners: Veteran and active-duty students
    · Incarcerated students

    While some of the issues faced by students in any one of the above groups
tend to be common for all, a few are unique to one cohort. As such, this chapter
examines each of the groups separately.

ACCESS AND THE PLIGHT OF THE UNDERSERVED

    Access to computers, digital technologies, and the Internet for OWI normal-
ly is achieved through one or more of three sources: the home, school, or one's
workplace. If none of those sources is available, students often are left to use the
local public library as their only resort for finding the tools necessary for access

316
                                                                                                            Gos

to OWCs.
    The first source of computer use--the home--is one that many WPAs and

OWI teachers take for granted. Family income is a factor in computer owner-
ship; the US Department of Commerce found that in 2003 just under 50%
of the families in the $25,000 to $35,000 income range were Internet users
as opposed to nearly 83 percent of those earning $75,000 and above. For very
low-income people (under $15,000 a year), just over 31% had access to the
Internet at home (Lamb, 2005). For the more desirable high-speed broadband
use that is almost a necessity with LMS software, the numbers are 13.4% for the
lower income group versus 45.4% for the over $75,000 group (US Department
of Commerce, 2004).

    In recent years, the situation has not changed significantly. In 2013, children
from families with incomes over $75,000 were projected to be twice as likely to
have computer access in the home as very low-income families. The numbers for
Internet access are even more striking. Ninety three percent of upper-income
families were projected to have Internet access versus only 29% for very low-in-
come families. For half of the low and very low-income families, then, access
to the Internet typically can only be had at school, the public library, or work
(Lamb, 2005).

    But even the ability to access the Internet at home is not necessarily sufficient
for access to online courses. Of the 50% of people earning under $35,000 a year
who do have computer access in the home, many cannot afford to purchase the
newer computers needed to remain compatible with current technology and
learning strategies (Haythornthwaite, 2007). As educational institutions update
their technology, many of the students in online classes are left behind. For
example, students with computers without speakers are unable to hear lectures
and other audio tools such as Vokis, the small avatars that show on screen and
lip-sync messages recorded by the professor. Such students are not able to access
any audio-based or audio/video-based asynchronous or synchronous OWI (El-
liot, Haggerty, Foster, & Spak, 2008), as outlined in Chapters 2, 3, and 4. For
all practical purposes, then, many students with computers and Internet access
at home still lack the ability to fully use the Internet or their digital technologies
for writing class purposes.

    A second source for computer technology that students may access is in the
school environment. For many students, their first exposure to computers comes
in the classroom. Let us begin with an examination of elementary and secondary
schools. A Department of Education study (2010) completed in 2009 found
that 97% of teachers had one or more computers located in their classroom
every day. Of those, Internet access was available for 93%. This high percentage
would suggest that most young students do, indeed, have at least limited access

                                                                                                 317
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

to computers and the Internet as a part of their lower school education pro-
cess. A limiting factor might be the student-to-computer ratio. The same report
identified that ratio as 5.3 students per computer. This ratio indicates that while
there is availability, there must be some sharing if all students are to have access.
That sharing decreases the likelihood that on any given day all students who
need computer and Internet access will have it.

    But computers are only helpful if they actually are used. In the same Depart-
ment of Education study (2010), teachers reported that they or their students
used computers in the classroom during instructional time "often" (40%) or
"sometimes" (29%). That leaves 31% of students with little access for whatever
reasons. In addition to the computers actually located in the classroom, some
teachers reported that they or their students used computers in other locations
in the school during instructional time "often" (29%) or "sometimes" (43%).
Therefore, in the elementary and secondary school environments, most students
appear to have computers and the Internet in their classroom environment. Ac-
cess to the machines, however, is limited by the frequency of teacher use and the
ratio of students to computers. And access to the technology is only part of the
equation. To have full access to online work, students need to have a degree of
experience with and preparation in the use of such tools.

    The numbers cited above for current student usage of computers in school
seem hopeful for OWI. However, these students are growing up with greater
access to digital technologies than currently underserved populations of nontra-
ditional students in postsecondary OWCs. The college situation and (hopeful-
ly) access to common technologies of today's average fifth or tenth graders will
differ from a contemporary 34-year old worker who returns to college to get a
degree that may help her to keep a job, become promoted, or find a new position
in a poor economy. To the end of using computers for higher education and
OWI, it is helpful to understand that students with less preparation for using
computers educationally may have different access challenges once they begin
attending college.1 In some hybrid settings and in most fully online settings,
students will need to complete much of their online writing work somewhere
other than the actual classroom. Asynchronous courses typically require students
to do most or all of their writing on their own. Lack of frequent opportunities
to use the computer educationally in postsecondary work, in addition to the
potential lack of a home computer--or, at least, an up-to-date computer--can
hamper students significantly in feeling comfortable with the levels of work they
need to address online for a writing course. To this end, OWI Principle 10 was
written to promote adequate preparation for students who take OWI and to
prepare them for its unique technological and pedagogical components, thereby
increasing students' opportunities to succeed and thrive in the digital setting

(pp. 21-22). Even if they have computer access at home, hybrid and fully online
writing students will need to seek outside access and assistance.

    Finally, using the computer at work, of course, depends entirely on whether
one's job calls for computer-based writing. For the most part, service-indus-
try jobs require little-to-no composition on the computer, leaning instead on
completing forms and addressing numbers. Positions where written reports and
other such communications tend to be in the industries that pay a higher wage.

    What happens if someone has no computer access at home, school, or work?
Denise Narcisse (2010) reported that nearly 19 million of the US national poor
rely on public library computers as their sole source for online work (2010). But
public library access, even when available, generally is limited. Many libraries
limit screen time, often to 30 minutes particularly when there is a line of poten-
tial users. Postsecondary school libraries and computer labs also have time and
other use limits; however, the nontraditional student who takes an OWC often
does so for geographical and time reasons, which in and of themselves limit
students' abilities to use their school's libraries and labs. These time limitations
alone create an insufficient scenario for any serious work in an OWC, but they
are especially problematic in the writing class where prewriting assignments and
drafts must be written, submitted, and revised in response to professors' com-
ments. And they are particularly problematic when students have to rely on ac-
cess to these technologies to synchronously participate in a class. Some libraries
censor Internet sites that might be considered unacceptable for public viewing
(Narcisse, 2010), which can limit certain types of research. In addition, most
libraries impose printing restrictions or charge for hardcopy printing. Many stu-
dents still prefer to revise on printed copy, which is a recommended strategy for
students with a variety of reading and learning styles (Hewett, 2015a). When
printing is banned for any reason, these students are disadvantaged. For students
dependent on a library for their computer access, although some access exists, it
is limited and may contribute to student frustration, attrition, and failure.

    These situations have long-term effects. Samantha Blackmon (2003) found
that some underserved students developed attitude issues, thinking there was
some kind of a conspiracy that keeps them marginalized by denying them full
access to technology. In addition to feeling disadvantaged because of their socio-
economic status, they had little or no educational interaction with the technolo-
gy that would be critical to success in OWCs. Certainly, with lots of time, effort,
and practice, once they are able to gain full access to digital technologies (e.g.,
through work or college computers), low-end users and late adopters might be
able to catch up with other, more privileged students regarding experience and
educational uses of the technologies. Nonetheless, Haythornthwaite (2007)
found that even if late adopters do catch up, the effort to do so causes unequal

                                                                                                 319

participation because these students continue to lag behind at the introduction
of each new innovation. This difficulty is likely to be the case for working-class
students and for less educated and rural people as well.

WORKING-CLASS STUDENTS

    Working-class students, for the purposes of this chapter, are defined as those
with lower than middle-level incomes, working primarily in service industries,
receiving hourly wages, having potentially floating hours, and/or those who
work more than one job to stay afloat. Other scenarios that keep these students
from economic fluidity or that have not required consistent uses of writing in
their work may apply. For these students, some experts have suggested that an
OWC--particularly a fully online OWC--may not be their best choice for col-
lege writing courses.

    Andrew Cavanaugh2 is Director of Writing for the University of Maryland
University College (UMUC), the largest public university in the country, with
over 92,000 students worldwide. UMUC also is one of the largest providers of
online education in the world with students in 50 states and 22 countries; it has
long had a relationship with military organizations. According to Cavenaugh,
students who lack a solid background in Internet and computer use have a special
need for feedback from the professor in order to be successful. The asynchronous
online environment used in many OWI programs makes immediate or regular
individualized response to students more difficult than in an onsite or hybrid
setting. Often, there are no set office hours during which a distance-based stu-
dent can meet with the professor through synchronous chat or over a voice me-
dium. End-of-class discussions do not occur in such settings, although hybrid
courses make meeting onsite with teachers possible in some configurations (see
Chapter 3). In essence, students who may need the most help with technological
and educational issues are taking a class in the modality and medium least con-
ducive to receiving the needed help (A. Cavanaugh, personal communication,
December 7, 2012). Mark Parker, also from UMUC, noted that working-class
students largely are unfamiliar with student life in general, right down to simple
details such as the definition of plagiarism (M. Parker, personal communication,
December 7, 2012). They may never have been on a college campus, are not
as involved with the campus activities, and often have families who need their
attention when they are not working or taking college courses (Hewett, 2015a).
Added to such pressures, the geographic separation from the professor caused
by the online environment makes it more difficult for these students to even be
aware of the things they do not know about negotiating college. To alleviate this
kind of difficulty, Parker recommended that such students should take a "How

to be a College Student" type of course (M. Parker, personal communication,
December 7, 2012).

    Additionally, among other challenges for working-class students, financial
viability remains an issue as it connects closely to their success. Allison Butler,
also of UMUC, noted that students often are surprised at how difficult college
classes are after coming out of high school or working for years, and it takes a
while to realize that they are in trouble. Often, they withdraw late from a course
and, as a result, find that they owe money to the financial aid program (A. But-
ler, personal communication, December 7, 2012). As difficult as deciding to
return to school may have been to make, events such as failure, fear of failure,
or a need to repay a grant because of failure easily can kill a student's desire to
continue in school and obtain a college degree.

Providing Accessible OWI for Working-Class Students

    The main issues facing working-class students regard Internet access, having
current and advanced digital technology, and having sufficient experience to
perform at a level where the technology does not become a large part of the
learning required for a class. One of the benefits of teaching writing online is
the ability to interact with students multiple times a day, seven days a week--
provided the students also connect with the teacher and the teacher is willing to
make such frequent connections. In my own classes, I receive drafts of planning
assignments or sections of large reports often two and occasionally three times a
day. A student lacking the access or ability for this frequency of communication
with the professor is marginalized from the beginning. In order to participate
fully in OWCs, students need to have access to a computer with an Internet
connection, the software necessary to open downloaded files, and the expertise
to accomplish the necessary tasks of using the LMS and the required software.
With these capabilities, they can devote their efforts to the subject matter and
not the technology. Without them, educational time is wasted by the technolog-
ical learning curve, and students become frustrated.

    When students work fully online from a geographic distance, the issue of ac-
cess to the Internet is beyond the control of the professor, the course developer,
or the institution itself. UMUC, for example, does not seek to attract students
without Internet access for their online courses, offering instead some onsite
courses (A. Cavanaugh, personal communication, December 7, 2012). They
believe any change in Internet accessibility as a basic requisite for the course will
have to be initiated by the government; at the time that students sign up for the
course, they should have the necessary connection to do the work. This is an
issue of basic access that seems to be particular to students who take fully online

                                                                                                 321
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

courses (as opposed to hybrid courses), where they choose not to (or cannot)
use the institution's computer labs and library offerings. This issue is different
from access problems discussed in Chapter 8 because fully online students who
choose to take a distance-based course would seem to be acknowledging that
they can provide their own initial Internet connection to the course if geograph-
ically unable to make use of the institution's affordances.

    For those who do have Internet access but at a reduced level (e.g., bandwidth
limitations or outdated or missing software), other problems arise. Lower band-
width means that every download takes longer and some files cannot be trans-
ferred. Students with limited bandwidth tend to have more challenges when
downloading images and audio/video files. Additionally, when students lack a
particular piece of software needed to view the downloaded file (e.g., Power-
Point), they also have access issues to the course. Recall that these additional
files sometimes are necessary for learning style accessibility per Chapters 1 and
8 even while their use can create access problems for students with particular
disabilities. These tend to be problems of socioeconomic access, to which OWI
Principle 1 also speaks (pp. 7-11). Per the access guidance suggested in Chapters
1 and 8, OWI teachers can alleviate some of this problem by careful consider-
ation of materials that students genuinely need to download, read, and use for
the course.

    There are ways to accommodate these students to some degree. In OWCs at
my institution (Lee College in Baytown, Texas), for example, module lessons are
built in PowerPoint. Upon discovering that many students lacked the Microsoft
Office Suite for their home computers, the writing faculty began the practice of
routinely converting PowerPoint files to PDF files that open easily in the LMS
window. This accommodation accomplishes two things. First, no downloading
of files is needed, and all parts of the course stay on the institution's server. Stu-
dents with reduced bandwidth do not have to wait a long time. Second, students
have access to the lesson whether or not they have the software of origination on
their computers. By making such simple changes and avoiding the use of more
"exotic" bells and whistles such as audio files and Vokis, educators can guaran-
tee that students are not missing integral parts of a class because they lack the
technology necessary to access the course material. Relatively speaking, such low
band-width documents also tend to be accessible to the users of assistive and
adaptive technologies.

    Even moderate accommodations of this type are not without drawbacks,
however. Once converted to PDF files, slideware files lose the ability to carry
voice, external links, and information entry in segments (e.g., line-by-line text
entry and pop-up arrows). Not only are some of the flashy attention-grabbers
gone, but the pedagogy of the presentation itself is weakened by the necessity of

322

revealing an entire screen's material at once instead of allowing the presentation
of a line-by-line explanation or argument.

    Accommodating the low-end user also works against some of the key ben-
efits associated with online learning such as interactivity with peers, real-time
exchanges, and sophisticated training presentations (Haythornthwaite, 2007).
Group discussions through synchronous text-based chats are difficult to follow
when a narrow bandwidth shows the student a conversation ten lines behind
where it is in real time (and where it is seen by classmates). Any entries posted
will appear as non-sequiturs because they refer to sections of the discussion that
took place a minute or more before the comment appears on the screen. Teach-
ers may want their students to develop the ability to communicate in real time,
but all too often, the technology available to students does not permit that, and
real-time communication requires thoughtful decisions about when to use the
synchronous and asynchronous modalities. Unfortunately, as those educators
advance in technology uses, the lower-income students who lack that technol-
ogy fall further behind. Every upgrade in equipment, requirements, or technol-
ogy made at the college end is an added barrier to economically disadvantaged
students (Haythornthwaite, 2007).

    Finally, there is the issue of limited experience. In every aspect of college life,
working-class students begin with far less experience than their managerial-pro-
fessional class colleagues (Gos, 1996), and the types of experiences they may
have (e.g., skills and drills exercises versus lengthy writing opportunities), do
not prepare them for the kinds of writing and communicating online (Kynard,
2007) that contemporary rhetoric and composition courses attempt to provide
through OWI. The fact that students struggle when facing an OWC is to be ex-
pected given the common access issues and potentially insufficient lower school
training discussed above.

    A problem is created when a working-class student without the ability and
experience to operate the technology at a basic level matriculates into an OWC.
Either the student is marginalized from the beginning, or the professor must
devote learning time to technology education. OWI Principle 2 stated, "An on-
line writing course should focus on writing and not on technology orientation
or teaching students how to use learning and other technologies" (p. 11) It is
important to understand that this guideline was written (1) to keep the focus
on writing over technology in a writing-based course and (2) to free teachers
from the belief that their job is to teach new technologies in lieu of writing,
as discussed in Chapter 1. Students should receive technology and writing-fo-
cused training regarding using that technology, however. OWI Principle 10
stated, "Students should be prepared by the institution and their teachers for
the unique technological and pedagogical components of OWI" (p. 21). What

                                                                                                 323

this means is that even underprepared and previously underserved students with
limited economic resources should be given appropriate orientation to OWI and
the LMS used in such courses.

    For both hybrid and fully online students, such preparation might include
an institutionally developed video that demonstrates the affordances of and how
to use the LMS as well as that details some of the responsibilities of an on-
line teacher and successful online student. Courses that provide basic computer
training and LMS orientation are commonly available from colleges that offer
online programs. In many cases, the course will be available both onsite and on-
line. For online orientation courses, students must have enough ability to access
an online training package before they can begin learning how to negotiate an
online class, which can become the first problem that some students find in their
attempts to take an online course. Another option used by many institutions is
to require an onsite, initial class session where students meet with the professor
to learn about the course and about how to negotiate the LMS. While this type
of orientation can be helpful for those who can attend, some of the groups dis-
cussed in this chapter--particularly the remotely rural, the deployed military,
and prisoners--would find these sessions onerous or impossible to attend.

    From the pedagogical perspective, OWI teachers should include some orien-
tation exercises that acquaint students with the basics of the LMS features they
will use in support of the course, what writing online means, what successful dis-
cussion posts look like (see Chapter 4), as well as how to find and use the OWL
(see Chapter 5). In addition to such orientating exercises, there are things of a
"first-aid" nature that can be implemented to help students when they reach an
obstacle or to assist in preparing themselves for the experience of an OWC. In a
discussion about writing centers, Muriel Harris and Michael Pemberton (1995)
described student needs for success in accessing and using online writing labs.
Each of the items they identify also would help working-class students negotiate
OWCs. They list the following student needs that remain important to address:

    · Easy access to computer labs
    · Training or short courses
    · College-provided student computer accounts

    · A computer center aggressive in assisting students to become computer
        literate

    To this end, while fully online students may not have access to the campus
computer labs, institutions should minimally provide training, online student
accounts for accessing the OWL, libraries, and counseling resources (as indi-
cated in OWI Principle 13), and 24/7 computing assistance to enable online
students to be independent and efficient in their OWCs.

    For a less abrupt transition to OWCs, working-class students might consider
taking hybrid classes first. Cavanaugh indicated that some students like this op-
tion because they still receive the face-to-face contact with which they are com-
fortable. Parker, however, noted that any abrupt jumps between communication
and learning styles in the two environments of onsite and online meetings may
make the hybrid option less attractive (A. Cavanaugh & M. Parker, personal
communication, December 7, 2012). I see both things happening in my hybrid
courses. In a first-year-level technical writing course that I teach as a hybrid, we
meet strictly in the classroom for the first four weeks, an option discussed in
Chapter 3. We then meet in the classroom about once a week for the next five
or six weeks and do the remainder of the work online. Around the tenth week, I
give students the option of finishing the course exclusively online or continuing
to meet once a week. The course meets at night and virtually all of the stu-
dents come to class after a full-days' work in the local oil refineries and chemical
plants. One would think they would be vehement about finishing the semester
online, but that has never been the case. The vote is always close and on one
occasion, they voted to continue the onsite sessions throughout the remainder
of the semester. This experience reminds educators of students' differing learning
styles and preferences as well as the needs that some students have for familiar
interaction (i.e., face-to-face) with instructors.

    As faculty, we have little control over student accessibility in terms of their
socioeconomic means. However, we should take into consideration and make
accommodations for those with reduced computing and Internet capabilities.
While faculty cannot provide students with initial Internet access, we can ad-
dress their limited accessibilities with reasonable accommodations. For students
with limited accessibility, software, and experience, WPAs and OWI course de-
signers should avoid requiring downloads of lengthy files, images, and sound
and video files when possible. Providing these on the LMS sometimes addresses
this problem. Such accommodations can make it easier for students to access
the course.

OLDER ADULT STUDENTS

    While having a more general meaning today, the term "nontraditional stu-
dent" was first used as a reference to students over the age of 24 years. This
section addresses access needs of students who fall into the above 24-years range
and sometimes are much older. These adult learners now account for nearly 40%
of the student body at US colleges and universities (American Council on Edu-
cation, 2013). A factor that separates some members of this group from others
is whether or not they are in the work force.

                                                                                                 325
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

    A Department of Commerce (2004) study found that employed adults had
a much greater likelihood of having computer technology and Internet access
than those who were unemployed. Table 10.1 presents statistics for persons not
having access to Internet use:

Table 10.1. Percent lacking Internet access (by age cohort)

In 2011, there remained such a disparity: "People with low incomes, disabilities,
seniors, minorities, the less-educated, non-family households, and the non-em-
ployed tend to lag behind other groups in home broadband use" (Fact Sheet,
2011).

    A lack of Internet access generally translates to a lack of Internet skills. Even
when contemporary students are using mobile devices to access the Internet, this
access, as explained in Chapter 16, is often different. When access is not there,
the basic skills of using the Internet are not developed. If at some later date the
adult learner gains access, he begins at a lower skill level than his colleagues. As
a result, like the working-class students discussed above, those without access
prior to enrolling in college courses may lag behind their classmates long after
they have gained full Internet access. As time goes on and new technologies are
introduced, those students tend to remain behind (Haythornthwaite, 2007).
Students who are trying to do well in an OWC will face serious difficulties if the
bulk of study time is spent negotiating the technology.

    While employment is a great divider in terms of Internet access and expe-
rience, there are difficulties beyond access that seem to be ubiquitous across
the older student cohort. One of those, for students who are in middle age,
is sensory decline. Aging students often face deteriorating visual and auditory
sensitivity as well as the ability to make fine motor movements (Morgan &
Morgan, 2007). Some cognitive shifts in memory and determining priorities
also may occur. Such decline may result in slower typing and computing, as
well as a possible need for reminders about how to access particular parts of the
LMS, for example. Building redundancy into the course (per Chapter 4 & 8's
recommendations) becomes especially important with these kinds of concerns.

    Another issue regarding an older student cohort--outside of technology--is
that OWI teachers may need to address the affect connected with the lives stu-
dents have led prior to coming to our classes. While writing instructors tend to

326
                                                                                                            Gos

assume that copious life experience is a positive thing for a student in a writing
course, it is not always the case that such life experiences have been positive for
the students. It is true that traditionally aged students are younger with limited
life experience beyond the family to bring to the writing course and that adult
learners have been out in the world, in work, in society, and bring with them
a richness of experience. Yet, some of that experience can be rather unpleasant,
even detrimental to their lives, leading them to see themselves negatively in
ways that affect their self-image as student writers. Kristen Welch of Southern
Christian University, a small university in central Oklahoma, talked about a few
of her older students:

         Some are just out of prison, others have small kids at home,
         others work full time, some are elderly or disabled. One was
         a recovering alcoholic. One main challenge is to conquer the
         negative self-talk that a life of very real failures has brought.
         One woman wrote her essay about her kids being taken by
         CPS, for example. (K. Welch, personal communication, No-
         vember 15, 2012)

    While not particular to OWI but an issue that certainly affects students who
take hybrid and fully online courses, another effect of being a student over the
age of 24 is a time gap between formal writing course experiences. As a result of
being years away from their most recent formal English class, many older stu-
dents find themselves playing catch-up, not only in the areas of critical thinking
and idea development, but even in the areas of grammar and syntax. Welch also
reported:

         Our biggest challenge has been providing a mix of develop-
         mental writing (review of capitalization, using suffixes for
         words, subject-verb agreement, etc.) and regular English
         101 writing assignments. Many of our students come in and
         don't know the rules for writing a sentence with appropriate
         punctuation. (K. Welch, personal communication. November
         15, 2012)

As a result, she and her colleagues are required to spend a good deal of course
time reviewing basic writing skills before beginning the business of a first-year
writing (FYW) class (K. Welch, personal communication. November 15, 2012).

    Pertinent to OWI and learning through online settings, older adult students
may face challenges in terms of their time available for class work. Even though
traditional, residential students may work only part-time if at all, many commuter
students--which includes some younger ones as well as most older students--are

                                                                                                 327
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

far more likely to work full-time and have other external issues such as family and
social activities that make significant claims on their time. These external influenc-
es often cause delays in completing assignments, both major (i.e., essay drafts and
final papers) and minor (i.e., participation in online discussions). Indeed, online
discussions--while asynchronous and often completed over the course of a week
or more--require that students log into the system frequently to monitor the dis-
cussion and add their comments. Tardiness in posting assignments starts a chain
of late activities that often lead to disaster in terms of the student's writing progress
and eventual grades. In a writing course, where a series of planning exercises often
occur before a draft is attempted, delays in turning in assignments build cumu-
latively to hinder the students' chances for success and, thus, they deplete the
learners' motivation (Blair & Hoy, 2006). Such loss of motivation can lead to the
dropping of classes, failure, and/or leaving school altogether.

    However, countering all of these negative external factors is the fact that old-
er students tend to adapt more readily to online courses than their younger class-
mates even though they may do less well than traditional students in face-to-face
classes (Community College Research Center, 2013). They also are more likely
to be highly motivated, in part because they understand the importance of what
they are learning and are making deliberate choices to be in higher education
classes. Anecdotal experience suggests that older adult students are ready to learn
to write well because they see that life circumstances require that skill. They are
especially motivated when the subject matter they are attempting to master will
help them solve life problems. Adult learners tend to prefer a problem-solving
approach to learning and learn best when materials are presented in a real-life
context (Knowles, Holton, & Swanson, 1998) although they also may demon-
strate some more adolescent-like needs. These needs would include seeking full
independence in choosing research areas while expressing dependence on teach-
ers for showing them step-by-step how to initiate such research, or claiming that
the teacher's (sometimes negative) opinion of their writing is not meaningful
while also desiring high grades that validate their efforts (Hewett, 2015a). In
addition, older adult students tend to prefer learner-centered instruction (Mc-
Donald & Gibson, 1998). When the instructor tries teamwork or collaborative
learning, these students may demonstrate discomfort. Nonetheless, OWI in-
structors often are emotionally committed to group work and experience diffi-
culty taking into account these individual learning preferences (Western, 1999).

Providing Accessible OWI for Older Adult Students

    Like working-class students who are new to the college environment, older
adults also often come to higher education with a lack of knowledge on how

328
                                                                                                            Gos

to take online classes. They sometimes are surprised at how fast things happen.
As a result, they may choose several especially time-consuming courses for one
semester or may schedule more classes overall than they can handle with their
other life responsibilities (A. Cavanaugh, personal communication, December
7, 2012). One helpful policy to help such students online is to require students
to contact the professor of an OWC before enrolling. Each time I receive a
student request for information or permission to enroll, I send out a copy of
a welcome memo that tells them about the course, the textbooks needed, and
most important, the time requirements. I find that students may be shocked to
learn that the college has an expectation of two minimum hours of outside work
for every class hour they take. For OWI students, I make this clearer by convert-
ing that formula to the number of hours they are expected to put into the class
each week and the ways they might be expected to use this time (e.g., discussion
posts, content reading, research, draft writing, and the like). This information
is especially helpful in short--in our case, five-week--summer sessions where
students need to plan up to 30 hours' work per week for a three-semester credit
hour writing course. While having this truth up front sometimes discourages en-
rollment, it is better for students to make an informed decision about how they
will need to function in an OWC than to overcommit, become discouraged, and
drop the course--or worse--end their college aspirations entirely because of a
sense of inability or failure.

    Ideas that professors are emotionally attached to often turn out to be less-
than-ideal for student learning in OWI. With older adults, the most important
of these may be collaborative work. While faculty have a litany of reasons why
collaboration is problematic (e.g., good students carry the poor or dropouts
leave groups shorthanded), writing professors still favor collaboration as a key
means of teaching. The arguments for group work range from the idea that col-
laboration often is required at work to a desire to establish a sense of community
in the class. There have also been studies that show positive learning results from
the practice. Indeed, the online environment would seem to be created perfectly
for such collaboration as peer group work and feedback, as well as for collab-
oratively written projects. But there also are studies that indicate collaboration
may be a poor learning tool for older adult learners. One such study was done
by Kristine Blair and Cheryl Hoy (2006). They found that adult learners bring
a mass of experience, but with it comes a diversity of external influences (e.g.,
work, family, other courses) that make any kind of scheduled work times prob-
lematic. They argued that such exigencies create a need for teaching and learning
in private, rather than community spaces (see also Hewett, 2015a). While Blair
and Hoy (2006) claimed that adults learn better in more individualized spaces,
they indicated that, at the very least, adult students thrive as well in private spac-

                                                                                                 329
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

es as in public or community environments. Instead of requiring collaborative
activities and group work, they recommended that teachers extend their more
public concept of community to a one-to-one relationship (i.e., student-to-stu-
dent and student-to-teacher) to better acknowledge the students' need for per-
sonal, private interaction. In fact, Blair and Hoy found that traditional email
between the student and professor and among students themselves to be among
the most powerful tools in learning.

    One place where group work might prove to be useful for adult learners
in OWI is in dealing with the negative life experiences they sometimes carry.
Returning to Welch's (2013) description of older adult students as having had
difficult life challenges in terms of disability, age, addictions, and even prior
incarceration, she found that such issues can be addressed through the use of
online discussion boards as a "vent" for frustrations as well as a means to practice
writing and responding to others who write. Of course, it is crucial to model dif-
ferent ways for students to disclose their past challenges and to encourage them
to think specifically about what they want to disclose in public online spaces
and why. One reason that writing teachers may encourage thoughtful self-dis-
closure involves the powerful writing that can emerge when students take such
work begun in the public online space and revise it into more formal writing
assignments.

    In addition to life experiences, the amount of time since their last writing
course is often an issue for adult learners. This issue generally shows itself in
sentence-level problems that normally are addressed in developmental English
courses. Most courses at the FYW level and above are not geared to teach gram-
mar and punctuation, which especially can be an issue when students opt to take
a short online course in a summer or mini-session. To address this issue, South-
ern Christian University has changed their shorter five-week course to a ten-
week course, enabling faculty to incorporate aspects of developmental English
into the curriculum and to better accommodate the learning styles of adults (K.
Welch, personal communication, November 28, 2012). Also these students may
not acknowledge the types of multimodal writing assignments (see Chapter 15)
taught in some OWCs as "writing" (see also Hewett, 2015a).

    Finally, there is the issue of sensory decline. It is easy to make light of an is-
sue like this, but it needs to be taken as seriously as any other learning challenge
or physical disability. The difference with many disabilities is that such sensory
decline happens, or will happen, to all of us. For example, before I can read a
student draft, I need to use Microsoft Word's zoom feature to increase the view-
ing size to 150%. While I often can read the body text at the normal size, the
labels on the axes of student graphs and the fine print on tables often make those
parts of students' technical reports just a blur at the normal viewing level. When

330
                                                                                                            Gos

developing courses, it is important to take eyesight and hearing difficulties into
consideration. Konrad Morgan and Madeline Morgan (2007) recommended
making provisions for adult students like using larger typefaces, easy-to-read
fonts, and larger interaction spaces (e.g., comments boxes). Volume on audio
files should be at the maximum level when recording or the student should be
able to increase the volume as needed. The question becomes: When is sensory
decline the responsibility of the instructor and when does it lie elsewhere? As
Chapters 1 and 8 clearly indicate, the needs of students with disabilities regard-
ing sight and sound should be addressed as part of the institution's responsibility
to meet ADA guidelines. But when the circumstance is a decline, and not a
full-fledged disability, the course designer/instructor can do much to alleviate
students' problems and facilitate access because the disability laws in general
expect all institutions of higher education to be ready to accommodate students
with a variety of abilities and disabilities. Meeting these elderly students' needs
will only move colleges closer to such readiness.

REMOTELY RURAL STUDENTS

    If there is any student cohort that seems perfectly suited to online learning, it
is the remotely rural. For students living far away from a college campus, the vast
physical distance required for a commute is an obstacle in the best of weather.
Add ice, snow, whiteout conditions, or heavy rain, and the trip can become im-
possible. In some parts of the United States, it can be well over 100 miles to the
nearest college or university. Online learning appears to be the logical remedy for
this situation; yet, in reality, remotely rural students may be just the group that
is most disadvantaged when it comes to OWC access.

    The study by A Nation Online (2004) considered the entire nation and found
that, while dial-up still accounted for the majority of Internet connections, in
urban areas the higher speed connections were beginning to take over. Not so
in rural areas. Table 10.2 presents the contrast in Internet connections between
rural and urban areas.

Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

    It is important to understand that the category is "rural," not "remotely ru-
ral" in this study. If the well-served rural areas were removed from this sample,
we would see an even more uneven distribution of Internet access, which does
not begin to account for types or age of computers or digital technology through
which online students would access their OWCs.

    In the same study, 22.1% of rural households that only had dial-up connec-
tions reported the lack of high-speed availability from their Internet providers as
their reason for having the slower connectivity. Only 4.7% of urban households
gave the same response (A Nation Online, 2004). Clearly, students living in these
remote areas may find their connection options severely constrained. While be-
ing limited to dial-up alone is in itself a disadvantage for the user because of low
download speeds, even dial-up connections are extremely limited in terms of
availability in some rural areas. According to Thomas Davis and Mark Trebian
(2001), in 2000, only 8.9% of Native American families on reservations had
Internet access. The same year, the national average was 26.2%. Of 185 Bureau
of Indian Affairs schools, only 76 had Internet connections. On the Navajo res-
ervation co-located in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, 80% of the homes--in
2001--still lacked even the most basic phone service (Davis & Trebian, 2001).
In 2013, only 53% on the Navajo reservation had wireless broadband service
available while the 2013 national average was 98% (Landry, 2013).

    These patterns are not limited to Native American reservations but appear
to be fairly universal across the rural parts of the United States. In south Texas,
for example, colleges like Southwest Texas Junior College in Uvalde have seri-
ous limitations when designing online writing programs. With a 16,000 square
mile service area, a large portion of the college's district is in areas where home
Internet service simply is not available, yet students cannot get to the campus for
onsite or hybrid classes given such a broad geographic service area. In many of
these places, students are forced to go to local schools or public libraries to gain
Internet access. In fact, in some places, even the schools and libraries do not have
reliable service (J. Coe, personal communication, November 16, 2012).

    While geographic remoteness certainly is one cause of this lack of Internet
connectivity, Davis and Trebian (2001) identified additional factors that lead to
a lack of access in rural areas, including the following:

    · Weak economic base
    · Lack of private investment
    · Poor targeting of government policies for improving technology infra-

        structure
    · Distrust of new technologies

    The situation is so ubiquitous in remotely rural areas that, according to Hay-

332
                                                                                                            Gos

thornthwaite (2007), across the country, usable telecommunications infrastruc-
ture privileges urban over all rural users. And most rural users are far better
served than the remotely rural.

    In addition to issues of accessibility, once remotely rural students enroll
into an OWC, they also may face issues of "urban bias." This bias suggests that
students from rural schools were not properly taught in high school; in other
words, their teachers failed to "teach them right." Indeed, both students and
their college teachers may believe that the students come to the college writing
class already behind their classmates from urban and suburban areas (Done-
hower, Hogg, & Schell, 2007). Government policies, educational practices, and
even the attitudes of professors and course designers reflect this bias. Kim Do-
nehower, Charlotte Hogg, and Eileen Schell (2007) noted the "rural illiteracy
stereotype" as something perpetrated not just by the popular media but also
especially by academics. Much like the working class student, rural students
may feel marginalized and experience being the "other" in the class. Since a large
portion of these students also comes from the working classes, the sense of being
an outsider is even more acutely felt. These students often have internalized this
stereotype.

Providing Accessible OWI for Remotely Rural Students

    As indicated earlier, many of UMUC's students are located in areas where
they cannot get to a college. To offer their courses as widely as possible, UMUC
articulates programs with community colleges (M. Parker, personal communica-
tion, December 7, 2012). Yet, even an operation of this magnitude cannot reach
the truly remote student, who, without Internet connections, cannot access such
a broadly reaching institution.

    Students in many rural areas can only access OWCs if they can get to a
school or library that offers Internet capabilities. When they do find one, there
often are limitations in bandwidth and download speed as well as use time lim-
itations, as noted previously. Many libraries also insist the sound be turned off
on speakers, so unless the students own and bring their own headphones, they
may not have access to sound files. To address this problem, some institutions
offer a very "thin" architecture in their courses. For example, UMUC requires
minimal downloading to be done by students because files stay on the LMS
server. The college's library services also are available online (M. Parker, personal
communication, December 7, 2012), a practice supported by OWI Principle
13.

    In my own OWCs, which enroll students from across the large state of Texas,
I ask one of the college librarians to join the course with full instructor rights

                                                                                                 333
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

in the LMS. Students are encouraged to mail or send discussion notes to her
regarding the library research they are doing. In this way, students are enabled
to stay within the LMS (also a thin architecture), giving students with limited
bandwidth and access to time on the computer as close as possible to full access
to the course as their classmates.

    Therefore, as with working-class students, postsecondary institutions that
cater to students in remotely rural locations have no control over student access
and cannot necessarily help those with no Internet access to use their facilities.
They should, however, take into consideration and make accommodations for
those with reduced computer technology and Internet capabilities wherever pos-
sible. As with the working-class student with limited accessibility, software, and
experience, access-focused recommendations for remotely rural students include
avoiding situations where they need to download large files and audio/video
files.

URBAN STUDENTS

    As with OWI and multilingual students (see Chapter 9), research is sparse
regarding OWI and urban populations, which includes Hispanic students and
especially African-Americans. The same can be said regarding general studies
about distance education and urban populations although urban households,
according to Table 10.2, generally had greater access to most Internet connec-
tions types. Yet, even though the urban household tends to fare better than rural
households, the numbers demonstrated a dearth of online technologies among
the inhabitants of these regions. In addition to this limited access to the capa-
bility to participate in online education from one's urban household, serious
exigencies that can affect these populations' lives can challenge urban students'
access to online education.

    As with other populations discussed in this chapter, urban students who
want to participate in online education likely are affected by the digital divide;
indeed, many may not have computer and Internet access in their household or
even in a nearby location that will enable them to participate in online courses.
An early focus group conducted by Kelly Ervin and Geoff Gilmore (1999) found
that African-American college students had as much access to computer tech-
nologies as non-African Americans. However, these results contradicted the US
Department of Commerce's (1999) study Falling Through the Net: Defining the
Digital Culture, which reported that the 23.2% of households with computers
among African-Americans trailed all racial and ethnic populations in the United
States (p. 18). The number of African-American households using the Internet

by the US Department of Commerce (2004) in A Nation Online showed that
Internet access had significantly increased for African-Americans to 45.6%, and
broadband use was at 14.2%. Both of these data points were higher than Hispan-
ic populations, an ethnic group that also populates many urban areas. Despite
the significantly greater Internet access experienced by African-Americans, they
still trailed Caucasian and Asian-Americans by approximately 20% for Internet
usage and approximately 10 to 20% for Broadband access. The significant gaps
reported in these government reports about computer, Internet, and broadband
use among the different racial and ethnic populations raises doubts about Ervin
and Gilmore's (1999) findings.

    But some researchers have questioned whether simply having access to a
computer or various types of Internet access is really the primary access issue for
various urban populations, especially African-Americans. Instead, they raised
questions about what one might call cultural access, or a feeling that computer
technologies were designed to accommodate the needs of primarily hegemonic
populations. Blackmon (2003) described how African-American students in her
class did not see themselves on the Internet; instead, they were "being asked to
see themselves as either rappers and sports stars or as part of the raceless, white
majority represented on the Web without ever having the ability to become one
of the majority" (p. 93). Similarly, Barbara Monroe (2004) explained that those
African-Americans who do not have Internet access are not all "have-nots"; some
of these individuals are "don't-wants" who bristle at the marketing strategies
technology companies use to target African-Americans. A study conducted by
Okwumabua, Walker, Hu, and Watson (2011) regarding online learning and
math showed that this cultural access understandably influences how Afri-
can-American students perceive online education. Almost 65% of their student
participants who were between the ages of 7 and 16 "indicated that they did not
enjoy using computers to complete school work" (p. 246). While most of the
students did not respond that the computer technology made them feel anxious,
67% reported that they did not feel comfortable with the technology (p. 246).
Thus, more than a majority of the students had negative impressions about their
ability to learn from online tutorials. Overall only 38% of the student respon-
dents believed that online learning and tutoring had any value (p. 246).

Providing Accessible OWI for Urban Students

    Many of the issues faced by urban students echo those faced by working class
students (discussed above). As noted there, the issue of access to the Internet
is beyond the control of the professor or even of the college or university. Any
change in Internet accessibility will have to be initiated by the student's family or

                                                                                                 335
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

the government; we must assume students who choose to take an online course
are acknowledging that they can provide their own initial Internet connection.

    A more addressable issue is what to do about students who have access but at
a reduced level due to bandwidth limitations or inadequate software. Symptoms
of this issue include slow downloads and the inability to open and manipu-
late files once downloaded. While urban areas generally have high-bandwidth
availability, some families choose slower, less expensive options. Again, as is the
case with working class students, teachers can alleviate some of this problem by
careful consideration of required course materials. What do students really need
to download, read, and use in the course? By making some simple changes and
avoiding the use of more exotic bells and whistles such as audio files and Vokis,
we can reduce these problems. Audios of lectures can be recorded on such slide-
ware as PowerPoint, a software to which even low end users are likely to have
access. Low bandwidth documents like PDF files also tend to be accessible to the
users with limited software availability. In most LMSs, a PDF file will open in
the LMS window, making it available without any additional software.

    Then, there is the issue of limited experience. As noted above, African-Amer-
ican students often begin with far less experience than their classmates, and
the types of experiences they may have (e.g., skills and drills exercises versus
lengthy writing opportunities) do not prepare them for the kinds of writing and
communicating that contemporary rhetoric and composition courses attempt to
provide through OWI online (Kynard, 2007, MacGillis, 2004; McAdoo, 1994;
Sheingold, Martin, & Endreweit, 1987).

    The only cure for a lack of experience is more experience. Yet, while students
flounder through technology issues, they are using valuable time and energy
that could have been spent learning to write. The professor or course designer
can simplify the technological challenges by keeping the number of presentation
and participation modes to a minimum. The reductions made to alleviate soft-
ware access problems (as indicated above), when coupled with using a limited
number of options presentation and activity options available in the LMS, will
allow the student to negotiate the class with a reduced amount of pressure from
technology issues.

    Finally, there is the problem of cultural access. It is here where the problems
may be the most daunting. Blackmon (2003) pointed out that African-Amer-
ican students do not see themselves as a part of the world that is involved with
the Internet. Monroe (2004) claimed that a substantial number of these students
don't want to be involved in the online world. It is not easy to make a dramatic
change in a student's view of the world and his place in it. There are some who
may argue that it might be unethical to attempt to make such a change. Just as
there are those who believe in students' right to their own language, there are

336
                                                                                                            Gos

also those that believe the same right should extend to the students' worldview.
Changes of this type must come from within the family, the community, or
the student herself. While the professor can certainly help and encourage those
wanting to become online savvy, Monroe's "don't want" students (2004) may be
beyond our reach.

    Based upon the limited research on urban populations, especially Afri-
can-Americans, OWI administrators and instructors must understand that they
need to help students navigate their way to the technologies that mediate the
course. These technologies may not always be in the home; sometimes they are
in labs and sometimes they are the mobile devices that these students carry (see
Chapter 16). Likewise, WPAs and instructors must consider that not all popula-
tions value the technologies that mediate OWI equally, and they need to consid-
er how a distrust of these technologies impacts students' learning. Certainly, the
limited research available regarding this population indicates that more studies
need to be conducted.

MILITARY LEARNERS

    With the increased number of military personnel due to the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan and the availability of new GI bill funds, the numbers of ac-
tive-duty military and veterans who also are college students have swelled. In the
2007-2008 academic year, 660,000 then-current and former members of the
military accounted for 3% of all undergraduate college students in the United
States. These students were divided evenly between two- and four-year colleges.
Of those students, 215,000 were active-duty military personnel. In that time,
329,000, or 38% of these students, used veteran education benefits.

Veteran Students

    With the passage of the Montgomery GI Bill, an education tuition program
initiated in 2009, that number increased substantially. By January, 2013, more
than one million attended American colleges and universities (APSCU, 2013).
By then, most of the FYW classes for veterans were taken either online or from
two-year colleges. D. Alexis Hart and Roger Thompson (2013) attributed this
choice for online and two-year college courses to veterans' desire to quickly and
inexpensively fulfill their general education requirements. Under the new GI
bill, in 2009 veterans attending school full-time received $1,321 per month for
36 months (Radfors & Wun, 2009); in 2014, the benefit was $1,648 monthly
(Military.com, 2014). By 2012, there were two million veterans eligible for $11
billion in federal benefits for education. After four years in existence, the GI

                                                                                                 337
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

bill paid for 800,000 veterans' education (Fain, 2012). This explosion in en-
rollments has resulted in the founding of veterans' centers and organizations at
colleges across the country.

    Many students within the class of military veterans, like many nonmilitary
adult learners, often bring desirable traits to their college courses. Common
attributes include maturity, richness of experience, and an exposure to a well-de-
fined organizational culture. Many also bring strong experience in leadership
and possess sound decision-making abilities (Starr-Glasse, 2011). Perhaps most
important for success, veterans also possess a high level of motivation. Not only
have they come from a culture that values perseverance, tenacity, and positive
outcomes, but the Department of Defense reimburses them only for courses
that are completed successfully (Starr-Glasse, 2011). This requirement motivates
veterans to stay with a course and to do well in it.

    Like anyone else, however, veterans also may have traits that are less helpful
in academic work. One commonly discussed issue is that military students often
face a problem with the flexibility of college, especially the online class. They
come from an environment that values, and teaches within, rigid structures. The
element of self-pacing that may be comfortable for some other adults often is
not appealing for them because it is counter to the culture in which they have
operated for years in the military. In dealing with marines, Steven M. Jones,
Wanda Mally, Larry A. Blevins, and James E. Munroe (2003) found that to be
successful as students, military members must first overcome their resistance to
change. A less-structured environment is one of the first changes they encounter.
Others agree. Dave Jarrat of Inside Track, a company that works with colleges
on student coaching services, indicated that students with military backgrounds
sometimes struggle with the relatively flexible schedule of college (Fain, 2012).
In a group discussion on a Sloan-C course, Phillip McNair (2013), the Vice-Pres-
ident for Strategic Initiatives at the American Public University System, pointed
out that a structured environment is the norm for these students, right down to
the position of their socks in a drawer, and they are comfortable with that. Very
few OWCs have this kind of rigid structure despite there being a distinct begin-
ning, middle, and end of the course and typically solid assignment due dates.
Indeed, asynchronous OWI particularly asks students to develop their own work
schedules to meet the course due dates for essays and class participation.

    Another difficulty some military veterans (as well as other military students
overall) face is a potential lack of acceptance by other students in classes. They
may be targets of stereotyping, both political and cultural. In some college envi-
ronments, military personnel are viewed as suspect and representative of a gov-
ernment whose actions many do not condone. For other classmates, the military
is seen as a job of last resort for those unable to find employment in mainstream

America. In either case, military students may be marginalized and seen as dis-
tanced from contemporary society (Starr-Glasse, 2011). This distancing often
makes their experience in a regular classroom--let alone an online class where
students make more peripheral contact through how they describe themselves
or appear in their posts--more difficult. Writing studies and OWI typically
ask students to make connections through group discussions, peer workshops,
and other community building activities. When an OWC begins with students
introducing themselves via a photograph and biography, as Warnock (2009)
recommended, veterans inadvertently may set themselves up for being margin-
alized by students with biases against the military.

    Finally, there is what Hart and Thompson (2013) called the "deficit model."
In this perspective, military veterans may be viewed from the standpoint of the
deficits and disabilities they bring with them. These include possible Traumatic
Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In an associa-
tion of Higher Education and Disabilities study, Mary Lee Vance and Wayne K.
Miller (2009) found that these disorders affect 34% of the male and more than
10% of female veterans. Of all students--military and non-military--identified
as having emotional disturbances twenty years ago, 63% attended community
colleges (Directory of Disability, 1992), making working with disabled veterans
potentially of greater concern at the two-year college level. In her CCCC's Chair's
Address, Marilyn Valentino (2010) posed the question of whether faculty would
be ready for the anticipated growing influx of such students. Long concerned
with emotionally disturbed students, she provided strategies for dealing with
these students when they indicate emotional difficulties in their writing (Val-
entino, 1996); OWI teachers most likely will see any indication of TBI, PTSD,
or emotional disturbance in their writing. However, Hart & Thompson (2013)
have argued that this "deficit" approach to military students can be harmful. It is
important to note that since many veteran students have not served in combat,
viewing military students from this perspective can inhibit student success.

Active-Duty Military

    While veterans may be generally more able to matriculate on a brick-and-
mortar campus, or onsite, for their courses, active-duty military personnel often
do not have that luxury. Their deployments to remote settings make them like
the remotely rural students who cannot access the campus itself. Active-duty
military, therefore, often use online courses to continue their education--even
from locations as far away as Afghanistan or Japan. Their college experiences are
different in other ways as well. For the active-duty or reserve military student,
scheduling is a huge issue. Temporary duty work or an unexpected deployment

                                                                                                 339
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

decreases a student's chance for success in a course or, in the worst-case scenario,
can end it--requiring a withdrawal or simply leading to the student no lon-
ger attending. While the military does encourage education, the culture of "the
mission comes first" necessarily dominates (Starr-Glasse, 2011). In many cases,
students cannot plan ahead for such occurrences, and they have no choice in
needing to stop education temporarily to wait for a new beginning later.

    Another issue is Internet accessibility. Active-duty military students often
find their access to the Internet sporadic or even unavailable on deployment.
When it is available, connection speed and bandwidth are variable and may be
problematic. In 1997, fewer than 30% of enlisted men had access to Internet.
The situation has improved tremendously since then; according to ArmyMom-
Strong.com (2014), deployed soldiers can access the Internet through local In-
ternet cafes, the Morale-Welfare-Recreation Centers, and in their personal living
quarters. Personal Internet access, however, can cost upwards of $100.00 per
month--costly for low-ranking enlisted soldiers--but this expense can be re-
duced when shared among roommates. Yet, there still are issues of accessibility
and bandwidth. Even simple asynchronous connections and synchronous pre-
sentations done in an LMS may be inaccessible depending on the day, time, and
deployment. Restrictions on access may be for several days or longer. As more
military students in remote locations matriculate to college, this problem of hav-
ing sufficiently reliable and consistent connectivity to complete an online course
is likely to get worse rather than better (Starr-Glasse, 2011).

    One Navy veteran (who asked to remain anonymous) expressed that he took a
technical writing class online while he was on active duty. He ran into serious prob-
lems when he was deployed. He had no Internet access on the ship and was unable
to complete the course work. He could not receive an "incomplete" grade because
he had not yet completed the required percentage of the course work to qualify
for it. His only choices were to withdraw or take a grade of F. He could not get a
refund on his tuition and fees because his situation occurred past the deadline. He
could not get a reimbursement from GI Bill funds because he had not completed
the course (Personal communication, November 26, 2012). Such a situation in an
OWI setting can leave the instructor frustrated and the student more so.

    Even when deployment is not an issue and students are able to finish a course
unimpeded, there is yet another obstacle to be faced. The continuous and some-
times rapid rotation of military personnel makes staying in one duty station for
four or more years highly unlikely. In peace time, rotations typically happen on
three-year cycles with occasional two- or four-year duties. During wartime, de-
ployments and rotation cycles can be much shorter, causing more disruption in
one's school opportunities. Moving and being deployed to war zones can prevent
military students from being able to complete a degree program at a single school

unless all of the courses are available for online study. Because courses, especially
at the upper class level, do not always transfer, military students often find they
need to take more courses than their classmates (thus, costing them more money)
in order to achieve a degree--if they can finish at all (The Sloan Consortium).

    There are other issues faced by military personnel that seldom are considered
by colleges. One of those regards textbooks. With class members spread around
the world in many cases, the time required to mail textbooks to students can be
prohibitive. Printed textbooks must be mailed, and that means student registra-
tion must close weeks before classes begin. Even under normal circumstances,
receiving a book through the mail could take a week or more, but it often can
take considerably more time than that because of the remote location and sporad-
ic mail service to some deployment sites. The use of ebooks might seem to be a
reasonable solution. In practice, however, ebooks also can prove to be an unwork-
able and unreliable option given that deployed military often do not have consis-
tent Internet access and when they do, the bandwidth availability often is poor,
making downloading slow and cumbersome. At UMUC, for example, although
neither method is completely satisfactory, both print and ebooks have been used
with many online courses to at least provide more flexibility (M. Parker, personal
communication, December 7, 2012). Some publishers are beginning to provide
the electronic text of academic titles if the student pays the full cost of the print
textbook. These electronic files can be read on various portable ebook readers.

    Another issue that colleges face with military students is the handling of
learning or physical disabilities. In the military, disability percentages are linked
to the individual's ability to participate in a job. In colleges, the process is more
complicated. First, the student must self-identify to an office that handles such
issues. A costly series of tests and a process of diagnosis sometimes follow that
identification. In a culture of self-sufficiency and personal strength, the ac-
tive-duty military student may see this process as declaring a shortcoming and
may consider asking for help as presenting a negative image of himself or getting
an advantage other students do not have. As a result, there may be a tendency
to resist taking that step, thus leaving the military student without the assistance
that a non-military student in the same position would enjoy (A. Butler, person-
al communication, December 7, 2012).

Providing Accessible OWI for Military Learners

    Hart and Thompson (2013) argued that many of the transition issues faced
by veterans are the same faced by other older adult students when moving from
earlier careers back to college. As such, many of the recommendations presented
in that section apply here as well. Others argue, however, that issues unique to

                                                                                                 341
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

veterans are more critical and need special attention.
    David Starr-Glasse (2011) identified several traits of the military student

that are important to consider when developing an OWC that will be effective
for the students' learning styles. First, military students tend to be self-directed.
While some students wait to be told what the next move is and when to make it,
members of the military have been trained to read available guidance and work
with it autonomously, and they may prefer to be treated as autonomous learners.
But, in an apparent contradiction that matches adult students who exhibit ado-
lescent traits (Hewett, 2015a), military learners also are used to an environment
that is extremely structured (Jones, Mally, Blevins, & Munroe, 2003; McNair,
2013). This dissonance shows up repeatedly in the research literature, and it
reveals why military learners may become fixated on the requirements of a syl-
labus or a particular writing assignment while, perhaps, wanting to accomplish
the assignment in their own timeframes. In addition to this learning tendency,
military students' issues of deployment require flexibility in assignments, par-
ticipation requirements, and schedules (Starr-Glasse, 2011) just where they also
might crave fixed structure.

    In answer to this dilemma, McNair (2013) noted that while a firmly struc-
tured course is preferable, there are times when flexibility is important (e.g.,
times of increased workload or deployment). When it comes to the work re-
quirements and deadlines, the professor's flexibility should not take away from
OWC's structure in general. The student's prior experience can be used effective-
ly here. While military life is normally very structured, sudden changes in duty
and location have prepared them to some degree, for these abrupt, last-minute
changes. Sharing this analogy in an online discussion post or an announcement
can help military students make the necessary adjustments more easily.

    As noted previously, military students often see themselves as outsiders in
the college writing classroom. Attitudes of other students toward members of
the military may reinforce that feeling. Indeed, they need to be encouraged to
see themselves as legitimate participants in the class community (Starr-Glasse,
2011), and one way to accomplish this is to connect the kinds of work that mil-
itary learners do with the writing of the class. Discussion threads or early writing
assignments that enable such personal revelation may be useful for encourag-
ing the OWC's students to view each other more equitably and from a mutu-
al position of respect. However, because military learners are comfortable with
collaborative efforts from their occupational experiences, community-building
activities in online courses, when they do not require group projects with group
grades, are not only comfortable for military learners but may increase student
motivation and reduce attrition (Sadera, Robertson, Song, & Midon, 2009).
That said, the fact that they sometimes are forced to disappear from the class at a

342
                                                                                                            Gos

moment's notice--temporarily or even permanently--and without the ability to
explain their absence to classmates, collaborative work can become impractical
and military students may once again experience themselves as different. It is a
serious "Catch-22" that the OWI teacher must consider when military learners
are part of the course. The military is not a "regular" job, yet these learners want
a regular education.

    Finally, there is the issue of what to do when an otherwise successful student
is forced to leave class for a time or permanently due to duty requirements or de-
ployment. Clearly this is an opportunity for flexibility in rules. At UMUC, de-
ployments in mid-semester are handled in one of two ways. If student can return
to class by end of the semester, he can complete the course through one-on-one
work with the professor. If not, then the student is granted an "administrative
withdrawal" for a grade. At many colleges, the grade of incomplete is another
option available when the student cannot get back to class before the end of the
term. However, rules governing incomplete grades often require the student to
have finished a certain percentage of the coursework before becoming eligible
for an incomplete, which may not be within the military student's control. At
Lee College, the requirement for an incomplete is 70% of the coursework. Col-
leges that are enrolling active duty members should re-examine such rules to
build in flexibility that accommodates the students' needs.

    It would appear that online teaching gives the portability and flexibility that
military learners so desperately need. An OWC is an ideal venue for these stu-
dents in many cases. In online programs, students often can finish their degrees
at the school they started even if they are re-assigned elsewhere (The Sloan Con-
sortium). With a few minor adjustments, OWI teachers and their institutions
can provide a workable way for these learners to earn degrees while still engaged
in active duty.

INCARCERATED STUDENTS

    If there ever seemed to be a match made in heaven, it is online learning
and students in prisons. Somewhat more than two million people currently are
incarcerated in prisons and local jails and detention centers (Maeroff, 2003;
Wing, 2013). The United States tops all other countries for incarcerated citizens
(Wing, 2013). For decades, colleges have sent faculty to prisons around the
country to conduct classes within the prison walls. Lee College began sending
faculty to teach individual courses at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice's
Huntsville Center in 1966. Technical course faculty began to be assigned to the
prison the next year, but it was not until 1978 that full-time academic faculty
members were located onsite. Throughout those years, academic faculty mem-

                                                                                                 343
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

bers made the 190-mile round trip to the center twice a week to teach classes
face-to-face. In 1984, the program became a regular branch campus with a full
college faculty and administration onsite, complete with labs, greenhouses, and
other educational facilities (Lee College).

    Prison programs like these are extremely costly, and the students' choice of
subjects to study is limited by the number of faculty assigned to the site. Cur-
rently, the state of Texas spends about $128 million each year on education
programs for inmates. State Senator Florence Shapiro, chair of the Senate Edu-
cation Committee, has argued that online programs could save the state a sub-
stantial amount of money. However, Michelle Lyons with the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice indicated that such online courses are not a viable option
because most inmates are not allowed to go online for various reasons. In Texas,
no inmate has open Internet access although some are allowed to logon in class-
rooms and certain vocational programs ("Plano Senator," 2011).

    Research has revealed that nothing reduces recidivism more than education.
Even a simple GED program reduces recidivism by 29% (Steurer, Smith, &
Tracy, 2001). Most prison units have such programs. But a study done in New
York showed that inmates who complete a college degree while incarcerated are
four times less likely to reoffend (Postsecondary, 2003). Inmates who completed
two years of college in the Lee College program at the Huntsville prisons have
a 10% recidivism rate compared to 60% for those receiving no additional edu-
cation. But college offerings are costly and far less common in America's prisons
than GED programs. What better way to address this population than through
online classes? Students would have a virtually unlimited choice of universities,
programs, and classes to choose from. Colleges would be saved the cost of send-
ing faculty or building branch campuses at prison facilities. And what about the
thousands of prisoners housed in units that do not currently have college pro-
grams to offer? They, too, would have the option of improving their education
and earning a degree.

    Yet, online programs have been resisted by state prison systems across the
country because authorities fear inmates will have Internet contact with persons
and groups on the outside that could lead to negative effects on the prisoner's
rehabilitation or to criminal activity. Nonetheless, 46 state prison systems (all
except Hawaii, Nebraska, Iowa, and Nevada) allow Internet use in supervised
educational settings ("Computer Use," 2009). Typical of the policies in most
states is this one from Ohio:

         No prisoner in a private correctional facility, county correc-
         tional facility, municipal correctional facility, or correctional
         institution under the control of the department of rehabilita-

         tion and correction shall access the Internet through the use
         of a computer, computer network, computer system, com-
         puter services, or information service, unless the prisoner is
         under direct supervision and is participating in an approved
         educational program that requires the use of the Internet for
         training or research purposes, and in accordance with this
         rule. ("Internet Access for Prisoners," 2005)

Nonetheless, while the exception for "approved educational programs" sounds
promising, the problem here is the phrase "under direct supervision." This need
for supervision means that, in order for a prisoner to be able to access the In-
ternet, there must be someone in the room watching at all times. While the
motivation behind such a rule is understandable, it also defeats the purpose of
online education as students can only work when there is a teacher or a guard
overseeing their actions. Colleges again are faced with having to place faculty or
staff onsite. Granted, the college employee does not have to be a qualified pro-
fessor, but there still will be requirements for personnel and restrictions on times
of availability that local prison officials prefer not to deal with. At Lee College's
Huntsville prison campus, for instance, the warden chooses to follow the pol-
icy by not allowing Internet use at all. This is a commonly applied solution to
the problem, and it denies access to an educational institution's Internet-based
LMS as well as to online research options. While there are other options, some
of which will be discussed shortly, prison officials who are skeptical of security
issues in any new plans will have to be persuaded of the invulnerability of any
option under consideration.

Providing Access to OWI for Incarcerated Students

    In one sense, the problems facing students in prisons are the easiest to solve.
The catch is that while the solutions are simple in themselves, prison adminis-
trations must be convinced of their workability, and that is not always possible.

    One easy method for allowing online teaching in prisons is for colleges and
universities to forget about the traditional Internet offerings and rely instead on
a closed-circuit intranet like those common in business and industry. In this way,
students would have access to nothing except materials housed on the college
LMS server. There need be no connections to the Internet whatsoever. From the
standpoint of the student, the course would appear and operate the same as one
conducted via the Internet. For the professor and course designer, there is one
difference. All files students access in the course of the semester must be housed
on the intranet LMS server, which requires significant planning to enable abun-
dant content and research materials--especially for OWCs that require students

                                                                                                 345
Nontraditional Student Access to OWI

to learn researched writing strategies. To meet the prison guidelines, there can
be no external links to Internet sites and no other physical connection to the
Internet.

    On the surface, an intranet connection would seem to be a reasonable solu-
tion and easy to sell, but prison administrators will need to be convinced (guar-
anteed, if you will) that it is impossible for prisoners to contact anyone or reach
any site except those specifically used in the course and housed on that closed
server. Once programs like these are established and tested in a few places, their
acceptance is likely to become more universal very quickly. In the meantime,
most prisoners in the United States are unlikely to have access to OWI in a hy-
brid or fully online setting.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    This discussion began with the overarching OWI Principle 1 regarding
the need for OWI to be inclusive and accessible. It is clear that, at least in
the nontraditional student cohorts discussed in this chapter, higher education
institutions have not reached that goal. Yet, the CCCC OWI Committee ac-
knowledged inclusivity and access as "the key concern" for faculty as colleges
move ahead with OWI (p. 7). There is no question that many of the obstacles
faced by nontraditional students negotiating OWCs are formidable. Some,
like Internet access for the poor or remotely rural, probably are beyond the
scope of colleges and universities given the technology available. Those are
issues that will have to be resolved by such others as government, individual
communities, businesses, and the individual students themselves. But many of
the other obstacles can be addressed and most in a relatively simple way. For
example:

    · Faculty should become aware of the difficulties nontraditional students
        face when enrolling in OWCs. Internet-access difficulties may be the
        most prevalent problem, but underserved students may also be using
        outdated computer technology and may be less familiar with educational
        and social uses of digital technology.

    · As the population ages, WPAs and OWI teachers need to understand how
        diminishing sensory or cognitive faculties may be reflected in students'
        abilities to access OWCs or to respond to writing assignments online.

    · WPAs should consider how to provide content through the LMS, text-
        books, and ebooks such that remote OWI students have access to the
        same degree as onsite or geographically local students.

    · Policies should be developed that take into consideration the special
        time-related needs of individuals in particular types of careers, such as

                                                                                                            Gos

        the military or other work places where travel and temporary duty is
        common.
    · In the case of prisons, WPAs and OWI teachers should develop in-
        tranet-based materials and approaches to OWCs that can reach incarcer-
        ated students while still meeting security requirements.

    Let me be clear here. I am not suggesting that these underserved non-
traditional student populations will have an equal playing field compared to
traditional students with years of high tech experience and a relatively unclut-
tered (or, differently cluttered) private life--students for whom college is their
number one or even only career. Nonetheless, online courses and OWI spe-
cifically can be made more accessible to the nontraditional students discussed
in this chapter, giving them a chance to be successful and to accomplish their
learning goals.

NOTES

1. Some research has suggested that when it comes to computer use, working-class
students' elementary and secondary school experiences are different from that of
the managerial/professional classes (e.g., Anyon, 1980; Bernstein, 1971; Gos, 1995,
1996). One of those differences is in the application of computers in learning. Ol-
sen (1997) and Bowles and Gintis (1976) pointed out long ago that students from
different social classes are rewarded for behaviors appropriate for the occupations
they are expected to one day fill. Others have argued that working-class students are
denied exposure to knowledge and skills--including computer skills--that would
allow them to make a successful border crossing (e.g., Anyon, 1980; Apple, 1979;
Bernstein, 1971; Kynard 2007; MacGillis, 2004). Indeed, research suggests that the
use of computers varies significantly according to class. Schools with higher budgets
or that serve primarily middle and upper class populations tend to use computers for
collaborative projects and communications as preparation for the professional and
managerial roles their students are expected to play as adults. These communication
activities require Internet access and extensive writing. Intercity and predominantly
working class schools, on the other hand, use computers for drilling lessons, which
might have been considered a reasonable preparation for taking orders in the lowest
rungs of the service industry (Aronowitz & Giroux, 1993; Cuban, 2001; Monroe,
2004; Moran & Selfe, 1999). As a result, the students in lower budget schools may
emerge as only low-end users of computers with little or no experience in writing in
the digital environment.

2. Several personal communications are cited in this chapter. A group telephone
interview was done with Andrew Cavanaugh, Mark Parker, and Allison Butler
from the University of Maryland University College. All conversations with Kristen
Welch occurred via emails. The interview with Jill Coe was in-person.

PART 4. FACULTY AND STUDENT
      PREPARATION FOR OWI
CHAPTER 11

FACULTY PREPARATION FOR OWI

Lee-Ann Kastman Breuch
University of Minnesota

This chapter, directed primarily to those who will train OWI teachers,
examines the importance of training in light of the increase of OWC of-
ferings in colleges and universities nationwide. To this end, the chapter
first situates OWI in the larger context of distance learning and identifies
characteristics that distinguish OWI from other online courses. Then, the
chapter identifies four principles of training teachers for OWI, called the
4-M Training Approach. Using these principles, it then addresses issues
specific to helping instructors transition to OWI and offers training sug-
gestions for addressing these issues. Finally, interspersed in the chapter are
suggestions for training that involve OWI course planning documents,
OWI case study, OWI teaching groups, and assessment activities.

Keywords: accessibility, association, immersion, individualization, in-
vestigation, media, migration, modality, model, morale, reflection, social
presence, training, usability

    As A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) noted, the increase in OWCs requires atten-
tion toward OWI teacher training and an understanding of effective practices in
OWI. The fifteen principles articulated in A Position Statement of Principles and
Example Effective Practices for OWI provide an excellent basis for OWI training,
and two of the 15 OWI principles specifically address training:

         OWI Principle 7: "Writing Program Administrators (WPAs)
         for OWI programs and their online writing teachers should
         receive appropriate OWI-focused training, professional
         development, and assessment for evaluation and promotion
         purposes" (p. 17).

         OWI Principle 14: "Online writing lab administrators and
         tutors should undergo selection, training, and ongoing pro-
         fessional development activities that match the environment
         in which they will work (p. 28).

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2015.0650.2.11                              355
Faculty Preparation for OWI

    These principles both articulated effective practices as well as a rationale for
training. Notably, the rationale for OWI Principle 7 mentioned that OWI teach-
ers need proficiency in three areas: (1) writing instruction experience, (2) ability
to teach writing in a digital environment, and (3) ability to teach writing in a
text-based digital environment (p. 18). The accompanying effective practices
further specified that OWI teachers need training in "modalities, logistics, time
management, and career choices" as well as the technological elements of teach-
ing both synchronously and asynchronously (p. 18). As we consider training, we
must add accessibility to this list, for accessibility is the overarching principle in
A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013):

         OWI Principle 1: "Online writing instruction should be
         universally inclusive and accessible" (p. 7).

    While OWI Principle 1 does not address training specifically, accessibility
issues in the development of accessible Web-based content have a critical impli-
cation for training. Keeping OWI Principle 1 regarding the need for inclusiv-
ity and accessibility in mind, as well as OWI Principles 7 and 14, this chapter
addresses OWI training with the goal of helping those who are charged with
developing OWI teacher-training programs. Because issues of accessibility are
an overarching concern, this chapter begins with an introduction to accessibility
relevant to training educators for OWI. Then, this chapter addresses a number
of issues associated with OWI training and provides ideas that can contribute to
an effective OWI training program.

    To ground the training issues provided in this chapter, I use the five educa-
tional principles outlined by Beth L. Hewett and Christa Ehmann (2004) in
Preparing Educators for Online Writing Instruction: Principles and Processes. These
principles are investigation, immersion, individualization, association, and re-
flection. The principle of investigation addresses the need to "rigorously" exam-
ine "teaching and learning processes as they occur in naturalistic settings" such
as the training course (Hewett & Ehmann, 2004, p. 6). Only by investigating
our training and OWI practices, asserted Hewett and Ehmann, can we best un-
derstand what works and what needs to be approached differently. Immersion is
an educational principle that suggests there is no better way to learn something
than to be placed within its milieu; language learners are taught in the target lan-
guage and writers are taught to write by writing. Similarly, learning to teach in
an OWC is best accomplished in the online setting. Individualization is a key to
helping the learner grasp and make use of the new information and skills being
taught. It provides flexibility for the OWI teacher trainee within the structure of
a training course. Just as students in OWCs need personalized and individual-

356

ized attention to their writing, so do new OWI teachers need individual atten-
tion from their trainers and from each other. The online setting can be lonely,
as OWI Principle 11 (p. 23) recognized by insisting that students need oppor-
tunities to develop online communities; similarly, OWI teacher-trainees need
to associate with other new learners and their mentors. Providing association is
about giving OWI teachers the opportunity to talk with each other--preferably
while immersed in the online setting in which they will teach. Finally, learn-
ers need the opportunity for a "critically reflexive process of examining notions
about teaching and learning in light of one's actual experiences" (p. 20). Such a
process is engendered in the principle of reflection, whereby teacher trainees are
offered opportunities to both think and talk about their experiences, encouraged
to assess these experiences and how they will or will not play into future OWI
teaching. Each of these five principles is called upon in the training exercises
provided in this chapter.

ACCESSIBILITY

    Three high-level accessibility issues and concerns are worth noting because
instructors need to learn about them in training: the range of disabilities OWI
teachers might encounter, accessible content, and using an LMS in an accessible
manner. As well, these accessibility issues can and should be applied to OWI
training environments so that instructors have full access to training materials
and experiences.

    The first is the suggestion to consider the range of disabilities that may af-
fect students in OWCs, or even Web-based environments generally. Thinking
about students first helps educators to understand needs students may have and
how to help them. My first introduction to accessibility issues in OWI came
from reading a graduate student's dissertation on autism and online learning
by Christopher Scott Wyatt (2010). Wyatt interviewed 17 autistic adults about
their preferences regarding online course interfaces; all students in the study had
experience taking online courses. One striking finding was the clear preference
among all participants for text-only interfaces, which is to say that uses of col-
or, video, or flashing images were distracting to most of these students and in
some cases physically painful. Wyatt offered recommendations for online course
design including text-only interfaces. In a similar vein, the collective authors of
Web Accessibility: Web Standards and Regulatory Compliance suggested consider-
ing real people with real challenges as a way to begin thinking about accessibility
issues in Web environments. They described people with such challenges as di-
minished motor control, loss of arms or hands, loss of sight, and loss of hearing.
In such cases, individuals may not be able to access a keyboard or mouse, read

                                                                                                 357

the screen, or hear audio (Thatcher et al., 2006, pp. 2-3). These authors strongly
suggested including disabled persons on Web design teams as a means to im-
prove accessibility.

    Web design teams often do not exist for OWI particularly, and instructors
largely are on their own as they develop content. This autonomy leads to con-
cerns about accessible content, a second high-level issue regarding OWI acces-
sibility. Instructors may create a variety of documents and media for OWCs
such as Microsoft Word and PDF documents, slide show presentations, videos,
audio/videos, and podcasts. According to the Web Content Accessibility Guide-
lines (WCAG) (2012), any file delivered via the Web needs to be accessible
in terms of being perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. WCAG
offers extensive details in each of these areas, but generally care must be taken
to accommodate screen readers as "text alternatives" for non-text items (e.g.,
video and images, captions for multimedia, exclusive keyboard functionality
sans mouse, avoidance of flashing images that may cause seizures, and use of
style guides to help structure reading and information flow in documents). The
WCAG guidelines, arising from the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI), a di-
vision of the World Wide Web Consortium (the Web's governing body), have
current authority regarding Web accessibility.

    For OWI teachers not trained in Web design, the list of accommodations
provided by WCAG may feel intimidating, which leads to a third issue to address
concerning accessibility: the use of Web-based courseware or LMS packages. An
important question is whether or not such courseware systems are designed to
address accessibility issues. As Chapter 8 reveals, the answer, unfortunately, is not
completely. LMSs are not developed to control completely for accessibility issues,
in part because they invite content contributions from authors/instructors who
typically are able bodied. Instructors ultimately are responsible for making their
content accessible, which means that every attachment shared on an LMS must
be designed to be accessible in terms of the accommodations listed above. How
is this work possible for OWI teachers, given all of the other demands of the job?

    If instructors want to make their materials universally acceptable, they must
learn to create/author them with accessibility in mind. Using the word pro-
cessor's "styles" for headings is one example. WCAG advised that information
should appear in predictable ways, and consistent headings are one way to struc-
ture text-heavy documents. However, this information must be coded into the
document so that screen readers can share the information; simply bolding or
centering text on its own does not code the text. If authors use the "styles"
function in Microsoft Word, for example, headings are coded automatically into
documents with consistent font and style structure, enabling screen readers to
share that information. Making this simple shift in authoring documents and

358

attachments is one way to create accessible documents. Similarly, Web pages cre-
ated via LMSs should make use of the "styles" function and "ALT-text" functions
available in that courseware package.

    Fortunately, those who design LMSs and higher education institutions are
beginning to provide specific help and suggestions for accessible and universal
design. At my own institution, I examined Moodle (our institution's LMS) for
any sign of accessibility suggestions. I could not find it on my own; however,
when I contacted the help line, I got an answer in less than 30 minutes with
links to suggestions for making content more accessible (Regents, 2014). The
suggestions generally followed the WCAG guidelines in terms of adding codes
to attachments that would enable screen readers to share descriptions of non-
text items and document structures.

    With accessibility and OWI Principle 1 in mind, this chapter now addresses
specific issues related to OWI training.

FOCAL POINTS FOR OWI TRAINING

    Having taught writing online in course settings, tutoring centers, and aca-
demic programs for over ten years, and having conducted several training ses-
sions for OWI teachers, I have learned that OWI training must enable instruc-
tors to air their concerns and take ownership of their online teaching experience
from the very beginning. Instructors rarely come to online instruction training
enthusiastically, and they often bring a healthy dose of resistance. An essential
part of training involves allowing instructors to articulate their issues and con-
cerns and then to develop suggestions that directly address those concerns. I
also have learned that writing instructors--whether tutors, writing faculty, or
discipline-specific faculty teaching writing--share many of the same issues and
concerns about working with OWI. These issues regard four specific areas for
training, a 4-M Training Approach:

   1. Migration, or decisions about sameness and difference with onsite in-
       struction, is an issue of course design;

   2. Model, or the conceptual model or mental framework the online course is
       designed to convey, also is an issue of course design;

   3. Modality and media, or modality as the form of communication in the
       course--whether synchronous or asynchronous--and such media as text,
       visual, audio, or video, are issues of technology choice; and

   4. Morale, or the sense of community and "social presence" conveyed in the
       course, is an issue of student engagement in the OWC.

    In the remainder of this chapter, I identify and address these recurring issues,

                                                                                                 359
Faculty Preparation for OWI

and I outline proactive training suggestions to address them. Combined, these
training steps allow OWI teachers to develop a design concept for OWI that
they can own and tweak as they gain experience with OWI.

Migration

    As I use the term in this chapter, migration refers to the design elements
of OWCs, which is one choice that OWI teacher trainees need to consider as
they move to the online setting. One of the interesting things about OWI is
that, while it has clear distinctions from other kinds of online courses, it fre-
quently is depicted as having equally clear distinctions from traditional, onsite,
face-to-face writing courses despite many discussions about core pedagogies re-
maining similar. Instructors often ask, "To what extent is OWI different from
onsite writing instruction?" and "Is OWI better or worse than onsite writing
instruction?" These questions about "sameness" and "difference" are so core and
central to discussions about OWI that they demand attention. Scholars address
these questions in various ways, but one word often used to address this issue
is "migration" as a focal point (see both Chapter 4 & Warnock, 2009, for other
perspectives on migration and adaptation of materials, theories, and pedagog-
ical strategies). The issue is whether onsite writing instruction can be migrated
effectively to an online writing setting or whether a writing course needs to be
entirely redesigned for the online space. When thinking about these concerns, it
is useful to recall that hybrid OWCs, while more complex than they may appear
at first, exist in both environments (see Chapter 2) and make use of similar ped-
agogical theories and strategies.

    The word migration is used frequently to describe OWI, but not always in
positive terms. For example, The State of the Art of OWI report (2011c) made this
overall claim about OWI:

         Teachers and administrators, to include those in writing
         centers, typically are simply migrating traditional face-to-face
         writing pedagogies to the online setting--both fully online
         and hybrid. Theory and practice specific to OWI has yet to be
         fully developed and engaged in postsecondary online settings
         across the United States. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p.
         7)

This statement suggests that migration is a negative, or at least neutral, act--
almost as if migration is a first step for instructors moving to the online space.
Furthermore, in A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices
for OWI, OWI Principle 3 stated, "Appropriate composition teaching/learning

360
                                                                                                        Breuch

strategies should be developed for the unique features of the online instructional
environment" (p. 12), which might seem to ignore the benefits of migration of
onsite to online pedagogies. Yet, the duality of migration--considering whether
it is a positive or negative strategy for OWI--can be observed in OWI Princi-
ple 4, which stated, "Appropriate onsite composition theories, pedagogies, and
strategies should be migrated and adapted to the online instructional environ-
ment" (p. 14). The reality is that there is truth to both positions; as Hewett says
in Chapter 1. OWI Principle 3 presents a yin to the yang in that most OWCs
reflect traditional onsite writing pedagogy, but also that OWI training must pre-
pare instructors for the differences of the online teaching space and potentially
lead to new theory for the practice.

    On the one hand, many scholars support the notion that OWI shares much
in common with traditional, face-to-face writing instruction, and that writing
instructors wanting to teach online do not need to start completely from scratch.
Scott Warnock (2009) made this point clearly in Teaching Writing Online, where
he prominently suggested that teachers migrate their face-to-face pedagogies to
online environments. He expressed that he disliked the cautionary tales shared
by some scholars that techniques used in the onsite classroom may not translate
well to online environments. Indeed, Warnock suggested that "these types of
cautions plunge new teachers immediately into a zone of uncertainty, where
they may feel there is too much to overcome to begin teaching online" (2009, p.
xiii). It is true that many instructors freeze at the initial thought of teaching on-
line if it requires rewriting or rethinking every aspect of their teaching. Warnock
suggested that teachers should find their core values and work on manifesting
those into the online space, and that is, indeed, good advice. Nonetheless, Jason
Snart, in Chapter 2, further advised that OWI teachers carefully adapt their
writing instructional theories and strategies when migrating them online.

    On the other hand, there are unique elements of online spaces, such as the
text-only environment most often found in asynchronous settings (see Chapter
3). A text-heavy environment is a drastically different environment from the
visual and auditory environment that exists in onsite settings. Hewett (2010,
2015b) acknowledged the challenges of text-based settings in The Online Writ-
ing Conference: A Guide for Teachers and Tutors. She demonstrated ways that
conferencing by text can challenge students' reading skills and teachers' writing
practices, and she theorized that semantic integrity (i.e., fidelity between the
intended message and the inferred meaning) not only is possible but necessary
to strive for in OWI. In Reading to Learn and Writing to Teach: Literacy Strategies
for Online Writing Instruction (2015a), Hewett further theorized that students
need to review and strengthen their reading skills for the cognitive challenges
that OWI presents, requiring teachers to rethink their writing strategies for this

                                                                                                 361
Faculty Preparation for OWI

audience. Warnock (2009) and Hewett's (2010, 2015a, 2015b) positions appear
to represent the yin and the yang of OWI Principles 3 and 4.

    Hence, concerning migration and OWI, the answer is "both/and." Instruc-
tors both can borrow strategies from onsite, face-to-face pedagogy and continue
to adapt and tweak them uniquely for the online environment. Accepting this
reality is a bit like straddling a line between sameness and difference: One foot
needs to be firmly grounded in writing pedagogy and theory; the other needs
to be grounded in online pedagogy. Similar arguments have been made about
computers and writing, in which scholars both doubted and celebrated the pos-
sibilities of computer technology as they intersect with writing pedagogy. I am
fond of citing Cynthia Selfe's (1989) mantra that "pedagogy must drive technol-
ogy," which is a major theme in Creating a Computer-Supported Writing Facility:
A Blueprint for Action. In this book, Selfe urged instructors to plan their peda-
gogy first and integrate technology later, and she adamantly stated that learning
objectives need to lead and guide any technological use of computers in the
classroom. This advice is repeated in countless treatises of computer-support-
ed pedagogy (Barker & Kemp, 1990; Breuch, 2004; Galin & Latchaw, 1998;
Harrington, Rickly, & Day, 2000; Hewett, 2013). This same sentiment is true
for OWI: Our pedagogical principles remain strong and consistent, but our
techniques and methods may be adapted to suit the online digital environment.
In terms of migration, OWI does not operate from a radically different set of
pedagogies or ideologies--although new theories may be needed--for it is firm-
ly rooted in writing and composition studies. Yet, OWI teachers need to be open
to the nuances introduced by the text-heavy nature of the digital environment.

Training Exercise on Migration

    Keeping in mind the five educational principles of investigation, immersion,
individualization, association, and reflection, one training exercise on migration
might involve a teaching philosophy statement oriented toward OWI. Teach-
ing philosophy statements are an excellent starting point for any OWI training
for they ask participants to articulate their pedagogy first and then specify how
they might practice that pedagogy through OWI. They also help instructors
understand that they can and should exercise control over how they approach
OWI. This exercise also is a foundation for professional development in OWI,
as instructors can return to and adjust these statements as they become more
seasoned OWI teachers.

    The example training session, outlined below, engages the training principles
of investigation, reflection, and association. It requires teachers to (1) outline
key principles that guide one's teaching philosophy and (2) consider how uses of
technology might influence or enhance that teaching philosophy.

                                                                                                        Breuch

    In completing this activity, it is important to allow people time to hear how
others are reconsidering writing instruction in light of OWI so that they may
model for and teach each other about their concerns, anxieties, and positive
anticipation of this move to the online environment. In the spirit of immersion,
trainers can cement the value of this exercise by conducting it in either the
asynchronous or synchronous online modality depending on the institution's
selected LMS. Trainees can use text in the LMS online discussion board to get
a feel for being in the "student" seat or they could create a short video of them-
selves talking about their statements and guiding principles; these, too, could be
posted online to the LMS.

    Training Activity

   1. Write a brief, 200-word statement to articulate guiding principles that
       are critical to your writing pedagogy in onsite, face-to-face classrooms.
       Examples might include such principles as "student-centered writing
       pedagogy is critical to the success of a writing class" or "writing process is
       foregrounded in every assignment."

   2. Then, write another 200-word statement to articulate how teaching on-
       line writing can enhance or mesh with your principles. For example, in
       terms of student-centered writing pedagogy, you might consider ways
       online technologies could help foster the goal, such as "students can easily
       share their writing with one another through electronic means on discus-
       sion boards or shared websites." In terms of writing process, you might
       discuss the use of technologies that allow for visualization of writing pro-
       cess, such as the integration of "comments" and "track changes" tools
       common to many word processing programs.

   3. Discuss in small groups what you are learning about your onsite writing
       instruction principles and how you imagine they do or do not work in
       the online setting.

Model

    Model is the second focal point for training, and it also is an element of
design with which OWI teacher trainees should become familiar; they need to
understand issues of model in order to make appropriate choices in developing
their OWCs. Although there are similarities between online and onsite writing
instruction, the text-heavy, digital environment of most asynchronous OWCs
requires a different set of expectations regarding the "classroom," as the discus-
sion of hybrid settings in Chapter 2 clearly demonstrates. When synchronous
interactions are not available and audio/video rarely is used, what does a text-

                                                                                                 363
Faculty Preparation for OWI

heavy class look like? How does it function? What are the key activities? How
does grading happen? These questions all address issues of conceptual or mental
models of the OWC, and interestingly, these questions are very similar to ques-
tions that address usability, an interdisciplinary study of how people interact
with designs and technology.

    Usability studies address how people interact with Web interfaces--often for
the first time--and OWI training deals with a similar phenomenon of teacher
adaptation to a Web space. In fact, much work in usability studies arose from
computer science, specifically interface and software design (Nielsen, 1993). To-
day, the field of usability studies has grown to include intersections of several dis-
ciplines such as psychology, computer science, ergonomics, technical commu-
nication, design, and anthropology (Redish, 2004; Quesenbery, n.d.). Usability
studies involves the examination of user perspectives to inform design processes,
and it is especially concerned with ease-of-use and the ways in which technology
helps users achieve their goals (Rubin & Chisnell, 2008, p. 4; Barnum, 2011).
Many scholars have further defined usability by articulating attributes such as
learnability, satisfaction, effectiveness, efficiency, engagement, and error toler-
ance (Nielsen, 1993; Rubin & Chisnell, 2008; Quesenbery, n.d.). At its heart,
usability is concerned with how people interact with technology.

    This concern intersects nicely with OWI in that instructors often worry
about how technology affects their instructional goals. Usability studies also in-
tersect with OWI training in that it directly addresses--and values--the anxiety
that users may experience in digital environments. One might argue that when
taking a course online, both instructors and students experience a degree of anx-
iety. Much of this anxiety can be attributed to unclear expectations both about
how the course will function and student and instructor responsibilities.

    It is here that the idea of a conceptual model or mental model can be extremely
helpful in training for OWI. By conceptual model, I mean an understanding of
the expectations of how something works. As Donald Norman (1988) explained
in The Design of Everyday Things, good design has to do with how we understand
what to do with objects (p. 12). Key to his theory of design is the idea of a con-
ceptual or mental model, which he defines as "the models people have of them-
selves, others, the environment, and the things with which they interact" (p. 17).
Using examples of everyday objects, Norman explained how designs can simplify
or complicate our actions, resulting in various degrees of satisfaction. One of
my favorite examples is his examination of doors in public places. He wondered
"how do we know to open the door?" and explained that cues about the design
help us understand whether to push or pull a door open (p. 10). For example, I
have often observed doors in public buildings that have a large metal plate in the
center of the door with a curved handle at the bottom of the plate. The curve,

364
                                                                                                        Breuch

according to Norman, is a visible and physical cue that suggests that users must
pull the door open. Without it, users might see the plate and think they must
push the door to open it. The point is that design elements can communicate a
model of use or intended action. In short, Norman said that conceptual models
"allow[s] us to predict the effects of our actions" (13). Jeff Rubin (1996) further
explained that conceptual models often are described in terms of metaphors that
help users interact with a product or interface (for example, the activity of delet-
ing a document on a computer desktop is symbolized by a trash can icon). Rubin
pointed out that conceptual models are always operating, although they are not
always explicit. If we can tap into our conceptual models, we have a much better
chance of understanding a design and interacting with it successfully. Troubles
arise when developer and user conceptual models do not match.

    Conceptual models of OWI are always operating, much like Rubin suggest-
ed. Unfortunately, time and time again, I have observed that instructors and
students bring different conceptual models to the OWI experience, and these
clashes often result in attrition and/or student failure in the course. One of the
most common clashes I have seen occurs when instructors create an OWC that
models a face-to-face class, but students come to the OWC expecting it to be
a self-paced, independent study. That is to say, students might expect an OWI
to be flexible, negotiable, with a deadline for work at the end of the semester,
rather than a large class experience that happens on a weekly schedule online.
When this clash happens, students may disappear for weeks at a time and sur-
face when they are ready to complete the work. By the time students realize the
consequences of these actions, their only choices might be to drop or fail the
course. Keeping this possibility in mind, instructors need to learn to communi-
cate clearly about the overall structure and model of the course before the course
even begins. This kind of communication will help ensure that students' and in-
structor's conceptual models agree and will guide the student's work. As Norman
(1988) and Rubin (1996) revealed, successful use is achieved when user and de-
signer conceptual models match one another. The same goal is true for the OWI
experience: Student and instructor understandings of OWC model must match.

    When this idea of conceptual model is applied further to OWI, it is useful to
think about different ways OWC models could be structured in terms of schedules
and interactions. To illustrate, three popular models for OWI that I have encoun-
tered include an independent study model, a workshop model, or face-to-face class
model. Each model structures course schedules and interactions differently.

Independent Study Model

    An independent study model suggests that individual students take the online
course essentially as a one-to-one interaction with the instructor, with no inter-

                                                                                                 365
Faculty Preparation for OWI

action with other students or larger group. The course might be set up with a
reading list, specific writing assignments, and deadlines for specific assignments.
It might have a great deal of flexibility depending on the schedule constraints
of the instructor and student involved; in fact, the instructor and student could
refine timelines for work continually and as needed. The conceptual model of
an independent study reflects a great deal of flexibility and an expectation that
the student will have direct and frequent interaction with the instructor. This
model essentially is similar to the correspondence course model that characterized
distance education courses for decades. While it seems archaic, I mention this
model because it is often the dominant conceptual model that students bring with
them to online courses. Many students sign up for OWCs because of the flexibility
an asynchronous course offers (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c). They might
come with the expectation that they can complete the course on their own time.

    Registration systems are an important factor in providing information to
students about the models used for OWCs. It is helpful to provide detailed in-
formation about the course wherever possible. For example, at our institution,
we have a Course Guide that allows instructors to provide detailed information
about the courses they teach. If the course is online, information about that
format can be included. It also is helpful if a syllabus or note from instructor can
be shared or accessed on the registration site.

Workshop Model

    A second model, the workshop model, might create a structure for on-going
interactions to occur with instructors and between/among students. A workshop
model might be structured around key events that help students practice writ-
ing, work in peer review groups to receive feedback on their writing, and revise
their work. There are many ways that workshops could be organized; my favorite
example of an online writing workshop is from Gotham Writers' Workshop, an
organization in New York City that offers hundreds of OWCs for a variety of
purposes and contexts. Gotham structures all of their OWCs around sharing in-
dividual writers' work, much like a creative writing workshop. They use a strong
metaphor to communicate their workshop model, which they call "the booth,"
which describes the activity of peer review. They visualize the OWC as authors
and readers "sitting down" to talk with each other about their work. As it plays
out in their online courses, the booth is an interface in which writers copy and
paste their work into a split screen. The top of the screen is the author's work,
and the bottom of the screen is a space for multiple reviewers to comment. Time
in the booth is scheduled carefully through a calendar in which authors meet
with reviewers on certain times and dates. Activity in the booth is made visible
to the entire class, very much like a creative writing class might handle turn-tak-

ing of authors on the hot seat getting review feedback from the rest of the class.
In this conceptual model, the booth--workshopped writing--is the primary
activity of the course. A similar concept, but different resulting interface, would
be the Colorado State University "Writing Studio," which provides students and
instructors with the ability to create "rooms" in which they can organize whatev-
er writing activities they wish (Writing@CSU). Like "the booth," the "Writing
Studio" carries with it a workshop metaphor in which writing would be re-
viewed and revised. The studio offers even more robust opportunities for flexible
learning environments for instructors and students.

Face-to-Face Writing Class Model

    A third model might be simply a face-to-face writing class. That is to say, an
instructor might say "I want to teach my online class exactly the same way I
teach my face-to-face class." This kind of model fully embraces the idea of migra-
tion"of face-to-face pedagogies to the online space, which often means that pri-
mary activities of the online course involve discussion-based activities organized
around assigned readings, peer review workshops, or other course activities. This
model implies that online discussions and forums will be key and central to the
course, affirming the idea that online experience will be text-intensive. Often,
this model requires that all students participate in all discussions, thus creating
a heavy reading load for the instructor and students alike (Griffin & Minter,
2013). An important element of the face-to-face model for OWI is the expecta-
tion that the course works on a shared schedule involving all students. That is, it
is not an independent study in which students can take the course at their own
pace. Instructors using this model must consider how the course structure and
activities, although migrated, need to be adapted (see Chapters 2 & 4) such that
the affordances of the online setting are used fully. OWI teachers should set clear
expectation that students will complete assignments and activities as an entire
class using the same timeline, and appropriate technologies must be available
at the right times to support these activities (e.g., assignment drop box, online
discussion forums, synchronous chats, posted reading materials, and the like).

Training for Conceptual Models

    In terms of training, integrating different conceptual models into OWI
training is a surprisingly fun and innovative exercise. The following exercise is a
case study and discussion exercise that engages the training principles of inves-
tigation, immersion, and association. Specifically, the exercise asks instructors
to identify the possible conceptual models of OWI in the case. The provided
case study presents a clash between a teacher and student's understanding of an
OWC's conceptual model.

                                                                                                 367

    Training Activity

       Read the following case study about clashing conceptual models.

         Two weeks prior to the end of a summer session, a graduat-
         ing senior in a technical and professional OWC received an
         email notice from his instructor that he was failing the course.
         The news was a big surprise to the student. The instructor
         noted that the student was failing the course because he did
         not turn in two major assignments, nor did he participate in
         several required online discussions throughout the course. The
         student's reaction was to ask, rather informally and somewhat
         flippantly, whether the instructor could please cut him a
         break; he was at his family's cabin for summer vacation, but
         he needed the course to graduate. He asked the instructor if
         he could turn in the necessary assignments in one bundle, and
         would the instructor accept the work? The student suggested
         he would be happy to do whatever was required to finish the
         course. In receiving this request, the instructor's initial reac-
         tion was to fail the student anyway because the student did
         not abide by the syllabus requirements. In fact, the student
         totally disregarded the syllabus requirements by failing to par-
         ticipate in weekly activities and assignments, clearly commu-
         nicating that he was making up his own rules.

       Discuss the following questions with your peers in your online dis-
   cussion board:

         1. How did the conceptual models of this OWC vary between
             instructor and student?

         2. Was the student's disregard for the rules of this online course
             a reason to fail him and delay his college graduation? Why
             or why not?

         3. In what ways, if at all, do issues of inclusivity and access
             come into play with this case?

         4. What would you decide as an instructor in this situation?
         5. What would you do to prevent this situation in future

             OWCs?

Modality/Media

    A third focal point important for OWI training is combined notions of mo-
dality and media, which address crucial choices of technologies for OWCs. In

OWI, modality and media are defined somewhat narrowly. Connie Mick and
Geoffrey Middlebrook considered the modes of synchronicity (real time) and
asynchronicity (delayed time) in Chapter 3. By media, OWI literature tends to
mean the kind of delivery formats that are used for course content such as text,
audio, video, or other media (see Hewett, 2013, for example). I discuss these
items in the subsections below with the focus of teacher training.

    First, however, it is helpful to note the rich connections that OWI should
share with digital rhetoric and notions of multimodality, particularly given the
exigencies of Chapters 14 and 15. Although mode, modality, and media have
been defined somewhat differently for OWI and digital rhetoric, multimodality
is an important development in writing studies that intersects with OWI and
that should enrich an understanding of teaching writing online. Multimodality
has received attention in composition studies as a way to expand understanding
and definitions of writing. In Remixing Composition: A History of Multimodal
Writing Pedagogy, Jason Palmeri (2012) noted similarities between multimodal
composing and process pedagogy in composition. He asserted that composition
has always been a multimodal endeavor, integrating images, text, and speech in
ways that contribute to the writing process (p. 25), and he traced the history
of composition to demonstrate multimodality. We see even more explicit treat-
ment of multimodality in Writing New Media, in which Anne Wysocki (2004)
asserted that "new media needs to be opened to writing" (p. 5) and that multi-
modal compositions allow us to examine the "range of materialities of text" (p.
15). The Writing New Media collection illustrated how writing instructors can
integrate writing assignments that encourage students to explore and/or create
visual, aural, and digital components of their work to enhance the message they
want to communicate. Similar examples are found in collections such as Mul-
timodal Composition (Selfe, 2007). While these connections illustrate and even
justify the view of writing as multimodal, few of these sources address writing in-
struction as a multimodal endeavor. Instead, these sources are focused on help-
ing students create multimodal documents and expand definitions of writing. We
might take some of the same lessons of multimodality and apply them to OWI
from the teaching perspective.

Synchronous or Asynchronous Modalities

    Deciding between the synchronous and asynchronous modalities is one of
the first choices an OWI teacher must make when offering a hybrid or fully
online OWC, as Chapter 3 describes.

    New OWI teachers need to understand that choosing to use a synchronous
modality for an OWC means that students must be present (via the Web) at the
same time, and the course is scheduled to meet for a regular weekly time and

                                                                                                 369
Faculty Preparation for OWI

day(s). This modal choice supports the idea of a discussion-oriented writing class,
in some ways similar to a traditional face-to-face format. Synchronous courses
would require the use of "real-time" conferencing technologies that afford simul-
taneous audio and text contributions. Webinars are an example of a synchronous
modality in which speakers share information and participants speak or write
comments or questions; if written, they use chat room or text messaging tech-
nology. Images and documents also can be shared during synchronous sessions,
and sometimes they can be edited simultaneously. Small groups could be set up
to have group chats that supplement course material.

    OWI teachers may have a choice in whether to develop a synchronous OWC,
although often the LMS dictates their course modality. In making a choice,
OWI teachers should consider the advantages and disadvantages of synchronous
OWCs. One advantage to a synchronous OWC is the flexibility offered in terms
of place and space; students and instructor can participate from any networked
computer with the appropriate technology. Another advantage is that a synchro-
nous course immediately communicates the idea that regular attendance and
presence are necessary in order to participate, thus removing some of the barriers
regarding expectations associated with independent studies or other asynchro-
nous models discussed earlier. A third advantage is the ability to have live ques-
tion and answer sessions with students, thus providing an opportunity to clear
up any confusion about material, assignments, or activities in the class. As well,
the synchronous modality has the potential to reinforce the sense and presence
of a learning community (rather than individual, asynchronous contributions).
One disadvantage of choosing a synchronous OWC regards access. Technologi-
cal capabilities of synchronous sessions may not always be consistent; sometimes
synchronous technologies cannot support a large number of participants at one
time. Students may also have a variety of network connections, as Chapter 10
discusses, that may not be sufficient for the synchronous technologies even those
that are mobile (see Chapter 16).

    In contrast, OWI teachers need to understand that an asynchronous OWC
would be offered in a "delayed time" format using non-real time technologies
that allow students to participate at any time, around the clock. An asynchro-
nous OWC might provide materials on a course website for review such as pre-
sentations, readings, discussion questions, videos, or podcasts. After reviewing
material, students might be expected to participate in weekly (or more frequent)
online discussions, quizzes, or group work to reinforce what they have learned.
Writing assignments might be turned in via a drop box, and instructors would
review the material and provide comments individually to students online.
Asynchronous comments might be text-based, audio-based, audio/visual, or
both. In sum, the asynchronous modal choice reinforces the idea of individual

370

responsibility and drive to participate in an online learning community.
    Asynchronous OWCs offer many advantages that OWI teachers need to

think about, some of them similar to synchronous courses. Like synchronous
courses, flexibility is an advantage for asynchronous courses in that students can
participate via distance. However, in asynchronous courses, students participate
in their own time rather than a regularly scheduled time. Another advantage of
asynchronous courses is that the delayed-time format allows students to think
through their contributions, and often students use that opportunity to review
and even edit their responses before posting. Some disadvantages of the asyn-
chronous modality are that the sheer volume of textual contributions might
be overwhelming and even disengaging for students (as well as their teachers;
training should therefore address time management for both). Care needs to
be taken to contain reading loads, and one way to address that concern is to
make more use of online student group contributions rather than whole-class
contributions and to not grade every interaction, as Warnock notes in Chapter
4. Another disadvantage of the asynchronous format is that students need to be
highly disciplined to follow deadlines. The absence of a regularly scheduled class
may be difficult for some students, and the asynchronous modality for an OWC
may convey a stronger sense of flexibility than actually exists.

    Whatever choice of modality an instructor makes, there no doubt will be a
transition to thinking about "making meaning" in that modality. An important
concept in further understanding both modality and shifts in modality is affor-
dances, or what Gunther Kress (2012) called "the material `stuff' of the modality
(sound, movement, light and tracings on surfaces, etc.)" (p. 80). He suggested
that affordances are "shaped and reshaped in everyday social lives" (p. 80). Affor-
dances are discussed similarly by Norman (1988), where he suggested that affor-
dances manifest in the physical characteristics and capabilities of objects (again,
we might reference the curved handle on a metal plate that forms a door handle;
the curved handle affords users to pull the door open). Continuing this idea of
physical or material characteristics, we also might understand affordances by re-
flecting on Lev Vygotsky's (1986) discussion of tools. In Thought and Language,
Vygotsky explained affordances as a way to understand "tools that mediate the
relationships between students and learning goals" (Castek & Beach, 2013, p.
554). Vygotsky's work often is used to support activity theory, a framework that
addresses ways different tools mediate different kinds of activities and resulting
meanings (Russell, 1999; Spinuzzi, 1999). Taken together, we might see the
synchronous and asynchronous modalities as each having its own "affordances"
that support different kinds of meaning making activities. In the next section,
I address the OWI counterpart to modality--media--and the opportunities
various media present for OWI teachers.

                                                                                                 371

Media: Text, Visuals, Audio, and Video

    In OWI, media are the ways through which the learning occurs, not in terms
of specific software but in terms of alphabetic text, still visuals and images, audio
recordings, and video recordings with and without sound. These media can be
used singly or intertwined; digital rhetoric often calls these New Media and their
use makes for multimodality. One immediately might think of "tools" in refer-
ence to media, or the affordances of material technologies such as online dis-
cussion forums, text-based synchronous chats, audio messages, or video chats.
But before thinking about tools, it is important to think through media choices
more fundamentally in terms of writing pedagogy, which includes teaching goals
and strategies, rhetoricity (as Chapter 14 addresses), and the media themselves.

    In Writing New Media, Anne Wysocki (2004) asserted that "new media needs
to be opened to writing" (p. 5) and that multimedia compositions allow us to
examine the "range of materialities of text" (p. 15). The Writing New Media col-
lection illustrated how writing instructors can integrate writing assignments that
encourage students to explore and/or create visual, aural, and digital compo-
nents of their work to enhance the message they want to communicate. Similar
examples are found in such collections as Multimodal Composition (Selfe, 2007)
and Remixing Composition (Palmeri, 2012). Palmeri (2012) noted in particular
that composition has always integrated a variety of media such as images, text,
and speech, and in ways that contribute to the writing process (p. 25). He advo-
cated the inclusion of various media in composition pedagogy so that students
have a broader understanding of the composing process.

    These connections illustrate important points about the value of media in
writing instruction. For example, including various media can enhance the mes-
sage of communication, and such inclusion also can help students appreciate
and more clearly understand composing processes. In a similar fashion, these
lessons can be applied to OWI, which is to say that instructors also must con-
sider the value of multiple media for OWI. For example, integrating multiple
media allows OWI teachers to enhance instruction and clarify messages or learn-
ing objectives in an online setting; reach students with various learning styles;
and make use of the technologies that mirror uses students experience in social
interactions, game playing, and the work world. These benefits represent "flex-
ibility in use," a point stated in the justification for OWI Principle 1 regarding
inclusion and access and that addresses the variety of preferences and abilities
students bring to an online environment (pp. 7-8). The use of multiple media
additionally may provide alternative perspectives for students to engage with
course material and assignments.

    Certainly, different material aspects afford different kinds of meaning-mak-

ing activities. Applied to OWI, the media choices commonly available provide
OWI teachers with a myriad of options involving textual, visual, audio, and vid-
eo/multimodal tools. The rest of this section details possibilities for OWI in each
of these areas. An overlying assertion I forward is that the field of writing studies
is filled with accounts of innovative, multimodal writing pedagogies; however,
rarely are these accounts placed in the context of OWI. I argue that we can take
these insights and connect them more explicitly to OWI.

Text

    OWI is characterized as being "text heavy" due in part to the discussion-ori-
ented nature of most OWCs. Alphabetic text, a visual medium unless given
shape by Braille or sound by screen readers, is the primary means of communica-
tion between students and teacher and among students in contemporary OWI.
That prevalence may be an issue of cost or of access, as this book discusses, but
often it is not a matter of teacher's choice in that the LMS is developed with
text-focused affordances. This textual focus is not a bad thing as it appropriate-
ly requires reading and writing literacy skills for a writing or writing-intensive
course. Tools that make use of text involve discussion boards, chats, text messag-
ing, email, blogs, Wikis, or course Web pages. OWI teachers need training that
includes a rhetorical understanding of these tools, pedagogical uses of them, and
familiarity with the technology that engages them. When it comes to text as a
medium, it is the writing practice that enhances the writing itself.

    A common example of a text-based activity would be a discussion (or mes-
sage) board, an activity often used in OWCs. Rhetorically, discussion boards
allow students to practice writing arguments as well as examine reader responses
and perspectives. Discussion boards can be used to support large class discus-
sions about required readings, large class discussions about writing exercises,
and small group exercises such as peer review. Typically, an instructor posts a
prompt about course material, and students "reply" to the prompt, resulting in
one individual message per student; discussions become interactive and more
meaningful when students also are expected to respond to each other. The re-
sultant writing practice leads students to produce many more words than they
might have otherwise (Warnock, 2009). Online discussions also can be led by
students or can be limited to student groups. In any of these formats, discussion
prompts are posted, and students respond to the prompt in writing at different
times (delayed time).

    Despite the prevalence of online discussion boards, it is important to un-
derstand that students may not know intuitively how to participate in an on-
line discussion--and instructors may not intuitively know how to mediate (or

                                                                                                 373

evaluate) them. Training new OWI teachers to mediate online discussions is
one issue that Warnock addressed in Chapter 4 and in Teaching Writing Online:
How and Why (2009). One instructor shared with me his strategy for structuring
online discussion forums. First, he outlined expectations for discussion prompts
that included the following elements: (1) the response must directly address the
prompt or query, (2) the response must be completed within a word limit (to
be determined based on the exercise), (3) the response must include at least one
reference to the reading in question, and (4) students must respond to one oth-
er student's contribution. This instructor also included a simple, clear 5-point
grading structure for online discussions based on the four requirements of the
discussion, which clarified for students that these discussions were weighted in
the course and were not meant to be personal responses to the readings. This
structure meant that the instructor graded each and every response from stu-
dents--a tall order in an OWC and one that training should consider and de-
bate given the WAC principle that not all writing needs to be graded or formally
assessed. However, given a structure like this, perhaps online discussions would
be used sparingly, such as once a week rather than two or three times a week.

    Another example of text-based activities occurs in chat rooms, a synchronous
technology that allows participants to contribute to the same, real-time discus-
sion in a textual environment. Text-based chats may be set up for a large group
in a synchronous class setting or in small groups. In either case, the students
basically interact about a topic using real-time text messaging. Students can use
chats for specific purposes such as discussing a reading, or coming to a group
decision, or completing an activity assigned for class. One advantage of textual
chats is the sense of community that often develops as students interact with
one another. In OWCs that otherwise may be asynchronous, students can miss
opportunities to talk with their classmates in real time. Chats sometimes feel
informal and encourage informal discussions that students appreciate. Another
advantage is that chats can be archived; if students completed important work
during a chat, they often can save the archive of the chat for their record (or
teacher's record) towards longer written products (see Chapter 4).

    Blogs (Weblogs) and journals are other venues that use text in OWI. Using
blog technology, instructors can require students to create and maintain their
own blog throughout a writing course. The blog software in an LMS typical-
ly catalogs entries in reverse chronological order; blogs also afford comments
from readers about individual blog entries, in effect creating a "dialogue" among
readers. Blogs also afford Web structures; students can create additional links to
Web pages that afford students the opportunity to create Web pages for different
writing samples. Wikis are another text-based tool designed to create collabo-
rative, living, Web-based documents, but they can be tricky in that often only

374
                                                                                                        Breuch

one writer can work in the Wiki at a time, creating the need for a way to signal
other students that the Wiki is open. Instructors have used Wikis to encourage
small and large group discussion and projects. Another text-based technology is
the OWI Web course page itself--typically located in the LMS--in terms of the
textual instructions and material offered by the writing instructor.

    As discussed earlier, while there are advantages to a heavy-textual orientation
for students, such as increased writing practice, there are also key drawbacks,
such as a sense of being overwhelmed by text and experiencing tedium from
reading and responding to countless prompts. OWI teachers may find them-
selves feeling equally overwhelmed with their efforts, which June Griffin and
Debbie Minter (2013) called the "literacy load" in keeping with the other loads
that teachers carry (see also Chapter 5). Therefore, OWI teachers need training
to determine how they can manage this especially heavy literacy load, their own
reading of student writing in particular.

    Training OWI teachers responsibly would include such recommendations
as necessary to make text-based experiences manageable from a sheer reading
perspective. High volumes of text on a screen lead to low levels of engagement
with text. Research from usability studies provides useful insights on this point,
specifically results from eye-tracking studies on how people read online. Jakob
Nielsen (2006) asserted, for example, that many studies confirm an "F-Pattern"
of reading on the Web in which readers start in the top left-corner, read hori-
zontally, then read down and horizontally at faster increments. Essentially, the
F-Pattern suggests that readers on the Web read less as they go along. Eye-track-
ing research confirms that readers are looking for textual cues, such as headings
and key words, and that readers do not tolerate excessive text on the screen
(Barnum, 2011). When we consider these confirmed reading habits, we see the
importance of making text clear and concise, and as minimal as possible.

    To this end, OWI teachers need training in how to make their text readable
and manageable. OWI teachers also need training in writing for students, how-
ever, as students may struggle themselves with the high literacy load of OWI. A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013) repeatedly mentioned strategies for clear textual com-
munication, many of which align with technical writing and Web-based writing
principles. Some suggestions are found in Effective Practice 3.3, which suggest-
ed the following suggestions for OWI in textual modality:

    · Writing shorter, chunkier paragraphs
    · Using formatting tools wisely to highlight information with adequate

        white space, colors, and readable fonts
    · Providing captioned graphics where useful

                                                                                                 375
Faculty Preparation for OWI

    · Drawing (when tools allow)
    · Striking out words and substituting others to provide clear examples of

        revision strategies
    · Using highlighting strategically (pp. 12-13).

    These useful suggestions for writing to students in text-based online settings
mesh well with other published recommendations for Web-writing and techni-
cal communication (see, for example, Hewett 2015a). For instance, in Letting
Go of the Words, Janice Redish (2007) offered suggestions for Web-based writing
that address typography, color, use of space, and concise writing. One section of
her text is actually called "Cut! Cut! Cut! And Cut again!" (p. 132) to reinforce
the idea that Web-based writing needs to communicate concisely and clearly.
Redish also advised using direct language and thinking strategically about com-
municating a core message on every page, and this advice resonates with stated
effective practices of OWI to use "direct rather than indirect language" (p. 12).

    Keeping manageable text in mind, I strongly support training OWI teachers
to engage the OWI principles regarding clear and linguistically direct language
(part of what Hewett [2015b, 2010] calls semantic integrity). I would add that
clear and consistent heading structures also are important to achieve textual
clarity in any text-based materials provided by instructors. For example, in our
upper-division online course in technical and professional writing, we have
structured the course around eight units; each unit has a consistent structure in-
cluding two main sections: (1) "Read me first" (a section including attachments
with an overview of the unit, required readings, and any supplemental materials)
and (2) "Activities and assignments" (a section including functions and/or links
to discussion forums, assignment drop boxes, Wikis, or blogs). Chunking each
unit into these main sections helps students understand the expectations for
each unit. An important part of the "Read me first" section is the "overview,"
a Web page document that provides an introduction of the unit, its learning
objectives, and instructor comments about what the unit entails. We have found
the "overview" very important as a communication vehicle for students, and
we also find that consistent heading structures are imperative. We include the
following headings in each unit "overview": Introduction (comment on topic,
subject matter, and its importance to the course), learning objectives (specific
to that unit with connections to previous and/or future units), readings (the
instructor's comments about readings and access can be included here), and
assignments and activities (any specific directions can be included here). Figure
11.1 provides an example.

    The information in the overview shown in Figure 11.1 provides students
with a blueprint about the subject matter and rationale for each unit and its
readings, activities, and assignments. Additionally, it aligns with the guidelines

of OWI Principle 1 (p. 7) in its uses of "styles," numbers, and bulleted lists that
are internally coded for screen readers.

Visuals

    Teaching online writing through the Web affords the possibility of including
many visuals that can supplement OWI. Visuals also use eyesight; they can be
still images such as photographs, diagrams, tables, illustrations, drawings, or
other graphics. Training OWI teachers about using visuals well requires some
understanding of their relative advantages and challenges for students. Teachers
need to learn how to employ visuals in their teaching such that students of all
learning styles and abilities can read them; this use typically means providing a
text-based caption and, for complete access, a thorough description of the visual.

    Students, on the other hand, need to learn both how to read visuals provid-
ed by their instructors and to engage and use visuals in their own writing even
when it is text-based essay writing. As discussed, many instructors have consid-
ered how to help students learn to integrate visuals into their writing, enabling
them to explore multimodal aspects of writing (see, for example, Wysocki, John-
son-Eilola, Selfe, & Sirc, 2004). Many online supplemental sites now have a
variety of visual materials including charts, graphs, animations, photos, or other
images related to writing from which students might choose.

    However, an even more immediate use of visuals for purposes of OWI is for
students to learn how to visualize writing. Two specific uses of visuals and for
which OWI teachers may be trained are well suited to OWI: (1) idea maps that
outline writing processes and (2) annotated writing samples.

    Idea maps are an often used technique in traditional face-to-face courses to
help students outline a writing process or to visualize brainstorming ideas. Idea
maps are an assignment that returns this discussion to the straddled line of on-
site and OWI; idea maps can be created easily online using a variety of tools,
for many software programs and Web-based interfaces now include drawing
software that afford idea mapping. Some software programs are especially made
for creating visuals and charts of this sort, but simple drawing functions in Mic-
rosoft Word work as well, are fairly ubiquitous and accessible (although it must
be made clear that not all students use Microsoft Word, and those who do their
composing on a mobile device, as described in Chapter 16, will not find it easy
to accomplish this kind of technology-enhanced visualization work for educa-
tional purposes).

    A second type of visual suited to OWI is an annotated writing sample. An
annotated writing sample is a document that includes callouts (often in color)
with explanations or comments about effective or ineffective features of writing.
Annotated writing samples often are found in textbooks; when included in an

                                                                                                 377
Faculty Preparation for OWI

OWC with real comments from real instructors, annotated samples are excellent
ways to provide personalized expectations about writing for students in a given
class. Such annotations, however, might not be fully accessible to screen readers
and may be unavailable when documents are saved to rich text or other than
Microsoft Word formats.

Audio

    Sound is an under-used medium in OWI that could be integrated easily
and more fully. Sound appeals to a second sense in addition to the heavily used
eyesight sense that both text and visuals engage. When more senses are added,
it is possible that students will learn differently. Some will find sound to be an
appealing and inclusive medium for learning. Therefore, OWI teachers should
learn how and when to use sound in their OWCs. Two simple examples of en-
gaging audio whether live or recorded are (1) using the phone and (2) integrat-
ing voice messages and/or podcasts to students.

    Regarding phone use, I often remind instructors in training sessions that
when a writing class is taught online, there is no reason that instructors and stu-
dents cannot use the phone to communicate. In fact, adding a new medium di-
versifies communication and can benefit the interaction, while helping students
who experience the OWC as distancing to feel more connected (Hewett, 2010,
2015b; Warnock, 2009). Additionally, all instructors and students already know
how to use the phone, and it typically is accessible to all. Instructors might set up
phone office hours and provide students with a phone number that students can
call. Phone office hours provide students the clear benefit of knowing they can
contact their instructor at noted times with any questions. It provides assurance
that instructors will "be there" to help answer any questions. In-person office
visits also are excellent for fully online students who are resident students or for
those who are in hybrid OWCs.

    Aside from using the phone, other audio methods include voice messages
that can be posted asynchronously. Various digital recording devices and soft-
ware enable voice recording and saving to a file. Sometimes, the software is inte-
grated in an LMS. When the technology also translates voice into text, students
can receive a visual text message with their instructor's voice included, increasing
accessibility. If provided as part of an LMS, students also can use the technology
to communicate with other students, thus skipping the text-heavy need to write
for that particular interaction. Podcasts are another audio tool that easily can be
implemented in OWCs. Podcasts are audio recordings that are saved, archived,
and made accessible via the Web. An effective illustration is the Grammar Girl
website by Mignon Fogherty (2009) in which she creates several three-minute
podcasts on topics of grammar, punctuation, and mechanics. Each podcast is ac-

companied by a text script, so listeners can read as they listen. Podcasts could be
used by instructors in a similar way, such as by providing thoughts on an assign-
ment or other class topic; instructors could provide commentary with script. In
fact, audio messages have been used in conjunction with writing commentary,
as well as to accompany presentations or texts. In sum, audio adds an element
of personalization to the OWC in ways that are relatively simple and easy to
implement.
Video

    Audio/video, called simply video here, offers a multimedia option for OWCs
that can combine visual, audio, and text productively. It addresses both the sens-
es of sight and sound. With the evolution of common video and streaming
technologies often used on the Internet and with social media, video has become
a mainstay technology for the Web. As well, video has taken a prominent place
in online learning. Many courses that experiment with a "flipped" instructional
model include video lectures by instructors enabling more active work time in
the class itself; hybrid OWCs can make good use of this model, for example.
Video offers many affordances for teaching online writing. In this section, I
address three possibilities for which OWI teachers might be trained: (1) asyn-
chronous instructor videos, (2) synchronous video chats with students, and (3)
video animations on writing topics (including screen casts).

    Asynchronously provided instructor videos are useful tools for sharing course

                                                                                                 379
Faculty Preparation for OWI

content or simple announcements about the course. Videos offer students a
more personal connection with the instructor in that students can hear and see
the instructor. Instructors can use simple, often free tools for video announce-
ments. Short videos can be archived and then uploaded as Web links that can be
attached to an online course and may even be reused in future OWCs. Instruc-
tors also can videotape lectures, although lectures are not a frequent instruc-
tional method in most writing courses. Some software affords the combination
of visual writing examples or PowerPoint slides, instructor voice, and a picture
if desired. Video also offers a promising method for instructors to return feed-
back to students about their writing. As Elizabeth Vincelette (2013) and Jeff
Sommers (2012, 2013) among others have described, instructors can use video
capture technology to comment on student papers. Video-capture enables in-
structors to make use of text, audio, and video to share comments, questions,
reader response, and suggestions for revision for students to consider. This mul-
timedia format is helpful to students in providing a diversity of communication
that they can replay and integrate at their own speed.

    Synchronous video chats are another tool instructors can use in OWCs.
Synchronous video using easily accessed and common software can afford the
opportunity for instructors to talk with students about their work. Synchronous
video chats create opportunities for real-time, one-to-one student conferences;
instructors can create a sign-up list and meet with the students at their assigned
times. As well, synchronous video chats can be used to foster large or small class
discussions. Large-class synchronous discussions might involve an instructor
who mediates the discussion and reviews course material and/or readings. In
the background, simultaneous written chats enable students present to fuel the
large-class discussion. The instructor may field questions by reviewing student
contributions to the chat. Synchronous meetings of this sort resemble a Webinar
format.

    Training is needed, however, because facilitating this kind of discussion can
be an overwhelming experience, as OWI teachers must rely on their video and
audio while reading simultaneous responses from a variety of students. There
also is the issue of technology access and reliability, as synchronous sessions with
large groups may experience technical difficulties while supporting multimodal
elements such as video, audio, and text simultaneously for 20 people. A vari-
ation of synchronous discussions is to have small-group synchronous sessions
with the instructor, which can make the interactions more manageable because
smaller discussions tend to foster a more close-knit, personal sense of commu-
nity. The instructor might schedule in advance certain times that students can
meet with the instructor to discuss course material. Ideally, an instructor would
share presentation slides or other material to the small group and field any ques-

380
                                                                                                        Breuch

tions. In a smaller synchronous discussion, students have the opportunity to
each ask questions.

    Finally, OWI teachers benefit from knowing about how animated videos
can be used to supplement an OWC. Because OWCs often involve the use of
various tools, instructors could create screen casts that illustrate different tools.
A screen cast might be made to illustrate activities such as peer review (e.g., how
to use the "comments" function of Microsoft Word); or a screen cast might be
used to illustrate the features of the OWC's Web interface. In addition to screen
casts, videos on writing topics might be used. Projects like WRIT VID (2013)
used animations to illustrate aspects of writing activities; likewise, many writing
programs across the country are including videos with interviews of student and
faculty writers. All of these videos can add supplemental material for the writing
course.

Training on Modalities and Media

    Training workshops offer instructors the important opportunity to inves-
tigate different modalities and media, with the goal of becoming more com-
fortable in the OWC environment. As well, gaining experience with different
modalities and media will help instructors better associate with students who
also must immerse themselves in the same space. One effective training exer-
cise that engages the training principles of investigation, immersion, association,
and reflection involves online peer review among teacher trainees. This activity
must be conducted in an online environment, preferably the one teachers will
use for the OWC. Teacher trainees should be grouped in pairs. Using the small
group venue of the LMS, provide a peer review prompt in which you ask each
pair to exchange documents and conduct peer review using a different modality
and media. (A document that works well for exchange is the teaching philoso-
phy statement created for the migration training activity shown in this chapter;
however, any document could be used.) Assign each pair a different modality
and media for their peer review, such as text-only, audio-only, video-only, or
multimodal. This activity may require setting up an assignment or discussion
prompt to enable their participation as students (rather than as teachers) in the
training OWC.

    The key to this assignment is not the actual peer review critique but an even-
tual consideration of the modality and media used. While the textual modality
is essential and important for OWI, OWCs easily can make use of multiple mo-
dalities of communication and representation such as visual, voice, and video.
Using these media from the student position enables immersion into the tech-
nology and a pedagogical strategy that can lead to more introspective reflection
about one's OWI activities, purposes, and perceived optimal outcomes. It also

                                                                                                 381

provides an opportunity for investigating not only different media but also other
teacher trainees' experiences of them.

    Training Activity

    In pairs, engage in online peer review using the teaching philosophy state-
ments from earlier in the training or another suitable text. Each pair should con-
duct the online peer review using different modalities and media. Exchange your
texts and, using the modality and media you've selected, engage in discussion
with your peer by articulating any questions, comments, or suggestions about
his or her text. Complete this peer review exercise within three days. Prior to
the online peer review, you may find it useful to exchange contact information
with your peer review partner(s) to set up a plan for technology and timing; this
is the kind of engagement that students in the OWC also need to do, making
it useful to learn firsthand the challenges of online interactions for assignment
completion purposes.

    · Pair 1: Text-only peer review (asynchronous)
    · Pair 2: Audio-only peer review (asynchronous using voice email or other

        digital recording technology)
    · Pair 3: Audio-only peer review (synchronous using phone)
    · Pair 4: Video-only peer review (synchronous using online audio and vid-

        eo technology)
    · Pair 5: Multimodal (asynchronous using a screen capture technology--

        that is, an uploaded document with comments, and voice annotation)
    · Pair 6: Multimodal (synchronous using online voice technology and an

        uploaded document with written comments)

    When you have completed the online peer review, engage with the entire
training group in an online, text-based discussion about the different peer review
modalities and media.

    · What did each pair like and dislike about their modality and medium of
        peer review?

    · What were the affordances and what were the constraints of their modal-
        ity and medium?

    · What was the rhetorical effect of each variation of peer review?
    · What preparation was needed to set up the peer review?
    · How might instructors facilitate such activities for students?

Morale

    The fourth focal area, morale, has to do with the level of satisfaction that
students and teachers experience regarding a sense of community in an OWC.

382
                                                                                                        Breuch

Issues of morale help new OWI teachers address ways to help students engage
in their OWCs. The questions for OWI teacher trainees that apply here include:

    · Are students excited to be in the OWC? How do I know?
    · If they are not expressing interest in the course, how can I help to change

        that?
    · What sense of learning community do I observe? What do students ex-

        press they are experiencing?
    · Do I have an interpersonal or educational connection with the students

        in my OWC? Do they have one with me as instructor?

    Morale is incredibly important for OWI teachers and students alike for it
can affect attrition rates as well as continued and active student participation in
the course. OWI scholarship has acknowledged negative impressions of online
courses as potentially cold and isolating spaces (Harris, 1998; Russell, 1999).
Ken Gillam and Shannon R. Wooden (2012) referred to OWCs as disembodied,
meaning that students lack the physical presence to engage with course material
and with the learning process involved in writing. Some writing instructors flatly
reject the online space as incapable of fostering warm, inviting, and welcoming
spaces for student writers. In fact, online environments may seem like the last
place that some writing instructors want to work with students.

    This negative sentiment about the apparent impersonal nature of online
learning is not unique to OWI. It is a prominent issue in online education, and it
also has been studied in terms of isolation in Internet communication and social
presence in instructional communication (Aragon, 2003; Turkle, 2012; White-
side, 2007). One also must consider morale with regard to accessibility issues be-
cause if students cannot access online materials or use course technologies, they
certainly will be alienated from the rest of the class. The term social presence is of
particular importance for OWI, as literature has directly addressed it regarding
online learning. In "Creating Social Presence in Online Environments," Steven
Aragon (2003) wrote that "social presence is one of the most significant factors
in improving instructional effectiveness and building a sense of community" (p.
57; see also Hewett & Hewett, 2008). Tracing literature about social presence
in education literature, Aragon (2003) credited John Short, Ederyn Williams,
and Bruce Christie (1976) for originally defining social presence as the "degree
of salience of the other person in the interaction and the consequent salience of
the interpersonal relationships" (p. 65). Aragon (2003) further explained social
presence through the concepts of "intimacy" and "immediacy" (Guanwardena
& Zittle, 1997); the notion of intimacy addresses nonverbal factors whereas
immediacy addresses "psychological distance" (Guanwardena & Zittle, 1997, p.
9). The idea of social presence is to foster a sense of shared community that is

                                                                                                 383
Faculty Preparation for OWI

important to the learning experience. As Aragon (2003) stated, "The overall goal
for creating social presence in any learning environment, whether it be online
or face-to-face, is to create a level of comfort in which people feel at ease around
the instructor and the other participants" (p. 60).

    Although social presence is discussed in the literature as mostly under in-
structor control, Aragon asserted that social presence is the responsibility of all
persons involved in an online course. This is an important point for OWI teach-
ers under training because they may worry that all the affect in the OWC is their
responsibility. To the contrary, students have responsibilities as well. Aragon
therefore offered helpful suggestions for creating social presence among three au-
diences: instructional designers, teachers, and students (p. 61). For instructional
designers, he offered structural suggestions such as limiting class size, incorpo-
rating audio as well as text capabilities, building in welcome messages for the
start of the class, and structuring several collaborative activities (pp. 62-63). For
teachers, he suggested active collaboration from instructors in terms of contrib-
uting to discussion boards, providing prompt feedback on email inquiries, and
providing frequent feedback on assignments (pp. 63-64). He also suggested that
instructors offer personable stories, initiate conversations, address students by
name, and use humor and emoticons (pp. 64-65). His suggestions for students
are nearly identical to teacher suggestions; students should contribute to online
discussions, answer email promptly, and take the initiative to start conversations
(pp. 65-66).

    In addition to these suggestions, building morale can include establishing
social presence by incorporating the "human element" wherever possible by
offering students multiple media channels to contact the instructor, such as
through email, video, phone, and in-person office visits. In the previous section
on modality and media, I shared several suggestions for diversifying commu-
nication channels between instructor and student. This diversity is important
for establishing instructor presence and boosting morale in online courses. In
addition, prompt responsiveness--no matter the modality or media--is critical
for maintaining morale. Responding to student queries promptly is important
as it reinforces instructor presence and attentiveness, and it helps students to
address their own issues on time. If possible, teachers should schedule a regular
time when students can be certain to reach them. For example, announcements
might be sent out every Monday morning by 9:00 AM, and the instructor may
have email, phone, or text-chat office hours Monday-Friday between 3:00 PM
and 4:00 PM. The regularity of such open connection times is important to
developing a reliable sense of presence.

    Building morale also can be achieved through establishing a strong sense of
community, which can extend a sense of social presence through engagement

384
                                                                Breuch

with course material and various roles that students and instructors play in an
OWC. In Engaging the Online Learner, Rita Conrad and J. Ana Donaldson
(2004) suggested that establishing a sense of community is essential to encour-
aging student engagement in online learning. They suggested that one way to
enhance engagement is to structure instructor and student roles in such a way
that students gradually move from "newbie" to "course planner." Table 11.1
summarizes their approach.

Table 11.1. Phase of engagement (Conrad & Donaldson, 2004)

Time period in course      Instructor Role  Student Role
First quadrant of course   Initiator        Newcomer/Recipient
Second quadrant of course  Leader           Participant
Third quadrant of course   Facilitator      Collaborator
Fourth quadrant of course  Participant      Planner/Organizer

    This phase-of-engagement approach essentially endorsed scaffolding, or in-
crementally integrating units to build skill development. It suggested that in-
structors build the course structure toward the beginning and allow students to
participate and take over building the structure toward the end of the course,
essentially empowering students to control their learning environments and fur-
ther engage them. In terms of OWI, the phase-of-engagement approach could
be applied in a variety of ways that trainers can teach to (and model for) OWI
teachers. One approach we have been experimenting with is what I call "pro-
files to portfolios." At the beginning of the course, we encourage students to
introduce themselves to the class by creating a brief profile with images that are
important to them. Students are encouraged to include photos and descriptions
of their interests and hobbies. Throughout the course, students are given a Web
space where they can post their written work. Toward the end of the course,
students create an ePortfolio of their work, gradually increasing the level of re-
sponsibility of student contributions to the online course.

Training on Morale

    Building morale in an OWC often involves the concept of social presence, or
a sense of interactivity and presence of a learning community. One way to build
morale and to strengthen social presence is to establish collaborative activities
that demonstrate individual contributions to the whole, encouraging students
to experience themselves as important to the working of a potentially faceless
OWC. Aragon (2003) suggested incorporating collaborative assignments into
the course whenever possible; to that end, I suggest training OWI teachers in

                                                                385
Faculty Preparation for OWI

whole-class collaboration exercises and activities. One interesting example is the
creation of a collaborative annotated bibliography on a common topic. Using
features of the LMS, a collaborative database could be established to contrib-
ute bibliographic entries with annotations, along with tags that could allow the
database to be searchable (see Figure 11.2; also see Breuch, Reynolds, Miller,
& Gustafson, 2012). Many other technologies could be used for this activity
as well, such as a Wiki or other Web 2.0 technology that allows for multiple
authors.

    The following training activity engages the training principles of immersion,
association, and reflection. It can inform teachers about the experiences students
may have in a whole-class activity. In an OWC, a collaborative annotated bibli-
ography not only helps students and writers learn citation practices, but also to
understand the multiple affordances of online writing tools, which is a type of
rhetorical awareness. For example, using online tools, students can enter citation
information, annotations of the sources, and tags to help identify the sources.
As more students contribute to the collaborative annotated bibliography, they
literally will see the bibliography grow and how their individual citations con-
tribute to a larger bibliographic source. This training exercise also can inform
teachers about the preparations needed to organize whole-class activities, such as
selecting an accessible tool.

    Training Activity

    Within your entire teacher trainee group, create a collaborative annotated
bibliography using your LMS or other accessible tool. There are four steps to
this exercise: (1) establishing parameters for research, (2) selecting a tool, (3)
entering bibliographic content, and (4) discussing the experience as a group.
These steps are outlined below.

    Research Parameters: With your entire group, decide upon the following re-
search parameters:

    · Determine a common topic.
    · Choose a documentation style (MLA or APA) and recommended re-

        sources for consultation.
    · Provide suggestions for acceptable sources (e.g., popular versus scholarly).

    Tool Selection: With your entire group, select a tool--within the LMS if pos-
sible--to facilitate the activity. The following tools outside an LMS are good
options:

    · Del.icio.us is a social bookmarking tool that accommodates a collection
        of online sources with tagging functions. It is Web accessible and can be
        set up for shared access.

    · Google Drive allows for shared documents; each contributor could sim-
        ply add their sources and annotations and use the "comment" function
        to insert their name on their selections.

    · The "database" function of Moodle allows one to set up fields of infor-
        mation. A field could be set up for "bibliographic citation" as well as
        "annotation." The character limit would need to be specified for each
        field. As well, tagging options could be selected in advance, giving op-
        tions for common tags. These may help students search the annotated
        bibliography later.

    Bibliographic entry: As individuals, find and select one source on the com-
mon topic that meets the parameters specified by the group. Then, write one
bibliographic entry that includes an external citation (using the specified style
guide) and a 100-word annotation.

    Group discussion: After completing the exercise, contribute to an online dis-
cussion in your LMS in which you reflect on the selected parameters and tools--
particularly where access is at issue. Possible discussion prompts may include the
following questions:

    · What pedagogical and/or affective benefits resulted from this collabora-
        tive bibliography exercise?

    · What pedagogical and/or affective drawbacks appeared from this collab-
        orative bibliography exercise?

    · What affordances of the online tools did you most appreciate? Why?
        How did they benefit (or not) your sense of community, morale, or im-
        portance to the OWC?

    · What new insights did you learn about bibliographies from this exercise?
        What do you predict your students might say in response to this question?

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    This chapter has discussed the importance of training for OWI and some of
the training considerations that new OWI teachers should experience. It has re-
viewed important characteristics of OWCs, such as the interactive nature of the
course and the limitations of enrollment due to the text-heavy nature of OWCs.
It also has introduced accessibility issues as well as four key issues that new OWI
teachers face: migration, model, modality/media, and morale. Throughout, this
chapter has introduced strategies for addressing these issues. By taking an is-
sue-driven approach, my intention has been to demonstrate training that helps
instructors first make sense of the transition to OWI on a holistic level, which is
a critical first step in more fully embracing the possibilities that OWI offers to
students and teachers alike.

    A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) suggested that OWI training address "modal-
ities, logistics, time management, and career choices" (p. 18), and it also sug-
gested that instructors conduct training in the online modality. The training
exercises in this chapter use five training principles of investigation, immersion,
individualization, association, and reflection (Hewett & Ehmann, 2004) to help
onsite writing instructors transition to hybrid and fully online OWCs.

    I end with the following recommendations:
    · WPAs and other administrators should provide online writing instructor

        and tutor training and ongoing professional development as OWI Prin-
        ciples 7 and 14 suggest.
    · OWI training must address accessibility issues, with specific attention to
        course materials that instructors contribute to the LMS.
    · The 4-M Training Approach outlined in this chapter offers a strategic
        way in to such training. Specifically, the 4-M Training Approach intro-
        duces central focal points for online writing instructor training: migra-
        tion, model, modality/media, and morale.
         Issues of migration and model are central to the design of OWCs.
         Issues of modality/media address choice of tools and technologies for

           OWCs.
         Issues of morale address ways to help students engage in OWCs.
    · OWI training programs can address the 4-M Training Approach using
        the exercises suggested in this chapter, and they can adapt them to their
        local settings.

FACULTY PROFESSIONALIZATION
FOR OWI

      Rich Rice
      Texas Tech University

        WPAs can improve faculty professionalization models for OWI to gener-
        ate dynamic performance support by examining ways in which applica-
        tion frameworks are created for evolving software systems. Design includes
        creating ideas and assignments; coding includes methods of presenting,
        responding, assessing, and supporting. Connecting effective design and
        coding approaches to OWI effective practices, especially faculty profes-
        sional development, can improve OWI programs.

        Keywords: agile design, code-and-fix design, convergence, course rede-
        sign, divergence, performance support, predictive design, principles of
        new media, professional development

    Faculty who teach in OWI programs not only need training, as indicated in
A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013) and in Chapter 11 of this book, but they also need
ongoing support and professional development opportunities. Given the relative
newness of OWI as a disciplinary approach to teaching writing in higher edu-
cation, professionalization models have yet to be adequately developed in struc-
tured ways that may help teachers at a variety of institutional settings, including
those that heavily use contingent faculty (see Chapter 7). Yet, professionalization
is crucial to developing new OWI teacher pedagogies and also in supporting
those who teach in OWCs with fair compensation, including opportunities to
remain current with rapidly changing technologies and chances to participate
in building programs that use new knowledge and theories being developed for
OWI.

    In this chapter, I suggest that WPAs and other program administrators can
improve faculty professionalization models for OWI to generate dynamic per-
formance support by examining and adopting ways in which application frame-
works are created for evolving software systems. The parallel between applica-
tion frameworks and the work of becoming and remaining up-to-date in OWI

suggest a guiding metaphor for professional development. Design in this sense
includes creating ideas and assignments, while coding includes methods of pre-
senting, responding, assessing, and supporting faculty. Connecting effective de-
sign and coding approaches to OWI principles and effective practices, especially
regarding faculty professional development, can improve OWI programs.

CURRENT FACULTY OWI PROFESSIONALIZATION
MODELS

Code-and-Fix Faculty Professionalization Design

    The practice of software design has long followed a code-and-fix methodol-
ogy, building programs or websites on successive, layered, quick decisions. If
the computer and project application is small, the approach works quite well.
Code-and-fix is a way to get or keep moving on a project. But as systems grow,
new features or better approaches invariably become challenging to implement.
Bugs abound until they are fixed in long testing phases, taxing human resources
and frustrating users. If the fix is too time-consuming and the choice regarding
user identity and needs is left to programmers, as Jaron Lanier (2011) suggested
in You Are Not a Gadget, bugs might simply be considered features of the system:
if it is not a bug, it must be a feature.

    Using the code-and-fix method as an analogy, consider the creation of an
OWI faculty development plan. Whether they know it or not, most English
or writing departments have likely used a code-and-fix methodology to get
their OWI programs started. They usually begin by asking faculty to teach a
few courses; then they gather comment cards or end-of-semester evaluations to
see what students think, figure out which outcomes are met readily and which
need more attention, implement strategies to improve those courses, create ad-
ditional courses, and pepper everyone with occasional workshops or one-on-
one support with a tech savvy person in IT or an in-house geek, to spice. The
approach may work well to get started, but it is very problematic if it is the only
way WPAs know to develop the OWI program. Professionalization also often
follows a code-and-fix method: there is a short-term demand to fill OWCs with
teachers, so we hire and train (or not) teachers to construct courses and teach
online, perhaps calling the courses "betas" or "pilots," fixing problems through
implementation. Once courses are going, we copy and paste the original, "fix"
courses into additional sections, and hire more instructors and let them teach
the content.

    This chapter argues that to sustain faculty development in more meaningful
ways, certainly more than a code-and-fix method is needed. WPAs and other ad-

                                                                                                            Rice

ministrators in charge of OWI programs need to be savvy and thoughtful about
faculty development and online instruction.

    OWI programs evolve. As they evolve, some WPAs may survey faculty and
students to prioritize fixing online technology and pedagogical problems, per-
haps even creating knowledge bases of frequently-asked questions (FAQs) and
solutions. They may ask such questions as:

    · How can online teaching enhance pedagogy?
    · How should OWI faculty rethink educational approaches and organiza-

        tion overall to better meet online instructional needs?
    · How can OWI teachers improve student participation in activities and

        exercises and discussion?
    · How can OWI teachers help students to improve their performance on

        papers and exams?
    · How can OWI teachers give students greater access to the course in terms

        of flexibility of time and location?
    · How can all participants improve their records of interactions between

        faculty and students and among students?

    These more sophisticated questions and the concurrent desire for improved
professionalization call for WPAs and OWI teachers alike to move beyond code-
and-fix to something more sustainable. At the root of each of these questions
and the programmatic development they encourage is access, and access is pos-
sible only by conceptualizing accessibility at the level of interface so that our
course goals, curriculum, delivery tools, pedagogy, and professionalization also
fall in line with this overarching goal.

    Chapter 1 shares the rationale for 15 OWI principles for effective OWI
practice. The very first principle of A Position Statement of Principles and Exam-
ple Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) is an overarch-
ing guideline that grounded and supported each of the following 14 principles.
OWI Principle 1 strongly suggested that scholars and educators pay close atten-
tion to access and inclusivity for students and teachers at every step in the plan-
ning and implementing of online classes (pp. 7-11). Code-and-fix approaches
to OWI professionalization inadequately follow this principle because universal
design for (all) learners and facilitators requires more planning than these ap-
proaches allow. Students and teachers should have equal access to content; ac-
cess to course design; and access to technologies used, assignments prescribed,
and assessment measurements planned. It is important to underscore that OWI
Principle 1 referred to the access needs of every teacher beginning to prepare
and teach and assess courses in online environments. The code-and-fix method
most likely does not provide such universal access because, as a methodological

                                                                                                 397
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

approach, many potential problems still can remain hidden or unaddressed
as simple features of the ongoing program. When professional development
includes quick fixes or none at all, there are systemic problems that end up
becoming large, crucial, and potentially damaging to the very education that
OWI proposes to provide.

    Indeed, a few years down the road, important systematic bugs inevitably
will arise. Faculty get squeezed. Who owns the content? OWI Principle 5 sug-
gested that faculty should retain reasonable control over the content they pro-
duce, and doing so can become challenging in this design model (pp. 15-16).
Who is compensated for new course preparation? If the content already is there, is
the instructor of record a teacher or merely a facilitator? Can pay for online teach-
ing even be lower than teaching face-to-face? OWI Principle 8 suggested that fac-
ulty should be fairly compensated for creating online course content (pp. 19-
20). Should class sizes be increased because some instructor workload already has
been provided, even though increased numbers limit the potential for productive
interaction? OWI Principle 9 recommended online writing classes be capped at
20, and preferably 15 (pp. 20-21). Without strategic planning, class sizes like-
ly will be increased. It is difficult to plan and justify and fight class-size creep
in the code-and-fix design method. Should asynchronous exchange be prioritized
over synchronous communication in order to maximize flexible scheduling? Doing
so is code-and-fix professionalization development and support, putting pro-
cesses into play and then fixing infrastructural concerns as a program proceeds
and grows. While there are short-term benefits, the approach causes significant
long-term problems for the professionalization of the field where, again, bugs
are just bugs.

    What are some of the benefits that better, more systematized faculty profes-
sionalization design models could provide, benefits that code-and-fix approach-
es tend to support insufficiently? WPAs need to consider the value of innovative
teaching strategies that are not recognized by those in authority in institutions
as worthy of productive effort in promotion and tenure cases. If teaching online
can create greater time and locational flexibility, consider strategies a department
can use to support or incentivize faculty or to help maximize opportunities like
conference travel, extended research trips, study abroad work, interdisciplinary
or inter-institutional teaching, and the like. These are "integrated scholar" op-
portunities where faculty can develop their own research, teaching, and service
together. Plans for recognizing efforts to design and create effective pedagogy
in new modalities is difficult in code-and-fix approaches. Something more sys-
tematic should be put into place, too, if faculty members are to be encouraged
to package written course content into books or to customize materials in more

agogy and experimenting with new ideas is not encouraged when fixes are too
cumbersome to put into place quickly. Faculty who are not supported in smart
ways will not innovate and take risks because the cost in terms of human and
monetary resources is simply too high.

Predictive Faculty Professionalization Design

    There is another approach to software design that works to schedule fixes in
more timely ways, saving costs and better supporting system-wide approaches.
The goal of this approach is to plan testing and recoding cycles with version
updates that are engineered by teams of designers, programmers, and usability
testers. Implementing an OWC or set of courses, clearly, will require planned
development and growth and support. Predicting the directions that the soft-
ware should take based on evolving user needs also can be limiting, however.
Software, modality, content, access, and other requirements change constant-
ly in effective OWI and not in an easily "scheduled" manner. Design requires
much creativity, and prediction for when changes need to be made is difficult,
as coding or content construction typically follows design. It often is the case
that faculty seek to save time by copying and pasting their course content from
one semester to the next without recognizing that student demographics have
changed, that content must be updated, and that one size does not fit all--par-
ticularly with regard to issues of access and inclusivity. By the time updates or
recoding is complete, including a round of design revision, users are likely to
demand additional or different features. In this design model, teachers often
over-focus on design rather than content, missing the goal of OWI Principle 2,
which suggested that the course should not be overburdened by teaching tools
(p. 11). The semester already may be under way and content updating becomes
superficial. And the move from design to coding to usability often is delayed by
more bugs. This model is predictive design, which affords some flexibility for
constructing long-term, planned development. For example, it seeks to grow a
selection of online courses while planning to upgrade their goals and objectives
alongside those of onsite courses.

    In terms of using this model as a professionalization analogy, though, this
method offers limited recognition for OWI teachers as creative designers and
expert pedagogues in online environments. What are differences in the demands of
fully online, hybrid, and face-to-face course deliveries? OWI Principle 7 called us to
focus on adequate training and professional development for OWI specifically
(pp. 17-19). Should different sorts of professional development and support mech-
anisms be installed and grown based on personnel rather than presumed curricular
evolution? OWI Principles 11, 12, 13, and 14 encouraged us to develop specific

                                                                                                 399
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

support spaces and tools for teachers' and students' online work that may take
significant development, such as media labs or OWLs or other virtual or physical
thirdspaces (pp. 23-30; see Grego & Thompson, 2007; Lee & Carpenter, 2013).
A thirdspace is a commonplace where information senders and receivers can con-
struct and transact ideas: "the study of space offers an answer according to which
the social relations of production have a social existence to the extent that they
have a spatial existence; they project themselves into a space, becoming inscribed
there, and in the process producing the space itself " (LeFevre, 1991, p. 129).
Other questions emerge: Do administrators need to analyze teacher and course
evaluation assessments with the same or different learning outcomes in mind? How
can predictive coding and content creation aid in student and teacher motivation
and retention, getting them literally and figuratively plugged-in (English, 2014)?
Again, OWI Principle 7 addressed the needs for fair and educated assessment of
OWCs and their teachers (pp. 17-19), while OWI Principle 5 supported trained
instructors in autonomous OWC development that might increase both teacher
and student motivation as well as retention (pp. 15-16).

    Both code-and-fix and predictive design methods are used commonly in de-
veloping online courses and teacher-support systems: build and fix as you go,
and schedule fixes in between terms or over the summer or next break for the
latest academic "version" or customized edition. The first method makes some
sense for small programs in order to get started, and the second makes some
sense to continue to improve the quality of faculty professionalization as smaller
programs grow. And it is possible to bring these two approaches in line with the
OWI principles to a certain degree. We should consider, for instance, OWI Prin-
ciple 4, which suggested that "appropriate onsite composition theories, pedago-
gies, and strategies should be migrated and adapted to the online instructional
environment" (pp. 14-15). Follow the move to OWI with a specific analysis of
how the onsite and then the online program measures learning objectives. In-
deed, these important principles and guidelines can fit well within online writ-
ing faculty professionalization.

    While these two software development strategies overlap and can build on
one another to great benefit, one thing is clear: Because creative processes are
difficult to plan and to build into faculty professionalization and because the de-
mand and supply for online teaching and learning fluctuates, fixing is time-con-
suming and predictability is extraordinarily challenging, often limiting, and still
quite time-consuming. It is not enough to transfer existing face-to-face instruc-
tion models to OWC development, delivery, and support. There are many pro-
fessional development design issues, most notably that of access, which require
more significant ongoing review and rethinking.

AGILE FACULTY PROFESSIONALIZATION DESIGN MODEL

    What if the design stage could include the coding? That is, what if in design-
ing and in redesigning courses OWI program leaders would code and construct
content simultaneously, revising and revamping as we use feedback loops to
reflect with teachers, students, and WPAs' assessment measuring requirements?
How would this approach help faculty professionalization in terms of equal pay
for equal work, faculty development, technological support, fair opportunities
for contingent faculty, and evidence to support promotion and tenure cases?
These are the goals of OWI Principle 7 (pp. 17-19); namely, WPAs overseeing
faculty teaching online courses, as well as the faculty themselves, should receive
appropriate training, professional development, and credit through evaluation
of online instructing and administration work. We can think about the design
and construction of courses and professionalization issues synchronously, where-
in the synergies of design and construction and support can improve the system
as it grows, reprioritizing teaching and scholarship (O'Meara, Rice, & Edgerton,
2005). To this end, there is a third design method that offers guidance to a more
effective approach to OWI faculty professionalization: agile faculty profession-
alization design.

    Many software programmers develop code connecting design and construc-
tion using agile software design, a third methodology to which people concerned
with professionalization should pay attention. The approach is more adaptive
than predictive, and more people-oriented than process-oriented. Adaptive
methods of building programs welcome and thrive on change. They offer feed-
back mechanisms at frequent intervals to mitigate the impact of radical change.
Requirements always change; we should be more surprised at the people who
find that surprising. Ultimately, people-oriented methods recognize individual
users more than processes (Fowler, 2005)--just as post-process pedagogies might
recognize ways to teach and learn writing and achieve outcomes more than pro-
cess pedagogies. Metaphorically, people are the drivers--albeit transient--not
the hardware or software. Systems for how to design and professionalize the
teaching of OWCs can generate exigencies for which students and faculty can
create their own effective working spaces and opportunities. They can support
faculty professionalization, as well.

    Let us consider the potential additional benefits of agile faculty OWI pro-
fessionalization. One benefit connects to the fact that agile software design uses
what is called "iterative refactoring," which as a concept also serves as a useful
metaphor for principles of productive professionalization. Refactoring, for in-
stance, can be connected theoretically to labor costs and compensation schedules

                                                                                                 401
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

for OWI teachers. The concept is related to problems inherent in providing con-
tent-complete course shells rather than enabling instructors to develop unique
components that somehow also connect specific learners' needs and teacher ex-
pertise. Specifically, code refactoring is a systematic approach to restructuring
computer code that alters internal structures without changing external behav-
iors in order to improve the code's readability, reducing the code's complexity,
improving the maintainability, and refining the internal architecture to improve
sustainability and future adaptability (Fowler, 2005). Refactoring makes it easier
to fix bugs, and the programmers or authors who follow redesigning and recod-
ing more readily can contextualize and shape the code, which is why reducing
large routines into concise, well-named, single-sourced processes is important.
Although Fowler (2005) does not mention the possibilities of improving access
to the software for disabled developers and users, code refactoring can open
paths for integrating erstwhile nonexistent accessibility features, and if necessary,
can even add interface-level accessibility to the system for users employing adap-
tive and assistive devices. Using agile faculty OWI professionalization can work
to install appropriate online composition teaching and learning strategies (OWI
Principle 3, pp. 12-14) without overly focusing on the tools.

    Let us also consider the relevance to documenting ongoing authorship of
course content that could be used by dozens or hundreds or thousands of stu-
dents. As Anne Burdick, Johanna Drucker, Peter Lunenfeld, Todd Presner, and
Jeffrey Schnapp (2012) pointed out, "The question is no longer `what is an au-
thor?' but what is the author function when reshaped around the plurality of
creative design, open compositional practices, and the reality of versioning" (p.
83). With refactoring, comments in the code that may be misleading are re-
moved, and methods that are ambiguous could be moved to a more appropriate
class of functions. This is important work that defines much of OWI teachers'
processes. It can be likened to single-sourcing, whereby department-critical in-
formation is developed, used, and stored for all to reuse and retool. Such work
should be documented for professionalization purposes in that individual teach-
ers' knowledge bases can contribute to the entire writing program faculty. It is
common lunchroom talk to ask what happens if one person gets hit by a bus and
cannot report on or outline the processes of her work or to speculate where the
department would be if specific institutional knowledge is lost. WPAs and fac-
ulty need to design systems of online courses that capture collective knowledge
yet enable and even require unique and personalized content and delivery: con-
verging divergencies. In this way, the potential capabilities of the application are
made clear more easily if the "code" or professionalization system is flexible and
includes recognizable design patterns that can be replicated or retooled in differ-
ent ways (Fields et al., 2009). The value of course redesign approaches increases

402
                                                                                                            Rice

if what is produced is adaptable and includes scaffolding for others. In effect,
improving professionalization through agile software design-like methodology
involves constantly deconstructing the grammar of what OWI teachers do.

    In The Language of New Media, Lev Manovich (2002) described the prin-
ciples of numerical representation, modularity, automation, variability, and
transcoding. Flexible or agile creation of valuable professionalization policies
embraces these principles. OWI and the teaching of OWCs, for instance, can be
considered data objects (numerical representation) that exist both dependently
and independently (modularity) of the larger curriculum. They can be creat-
ed and modified automatically (automation) once they are developed, but they
must exist in multiple versions (variability) in order to maximize teacher exper-
tise and student need and disciplinary contextualization. The convergence of
layers of media, technology, and culture in OWCs generate new layers of mean-
ing (transcoding). In his more recent work, Software Takes Command, Manovich
(2013) suggested that "software has become our interface to the world, to oth-
ers, to our memory and our imagination--a universal language through which
the world speaks, and a universal engine on which the world runs" (Manovich,
2013). Software and the production of software, according to Manovich, is tak-
ing control over all types of media and organizations. Faculty teaching online are
working in (hybrid/fully online) organizations that rely heavily on software and
online content production, and "new media proliferates `programmed visions,'
which seek to shape and predict ... a future based on past data. The programmed
visions have also made computers, based on metaphor, metaphors for meta-
phor itself, for a general logic of substitutability" (Chun, 2011, cover). And,
as Matt Barton (2008) reasoned in "New Media and the Virtual Workplace"
with reference to transcoding and the role of software in virtual organizations
and in professionalization, productive virtual workplaces afford room for play
and innovation, call attention to space, enable participants to shape identity as
creative performance, stimulate simulation opportunities to gain new abilities,
and afford meaningful collaboration to work together to solve problems (pp.
389-390). These thirdspaces, which connect the virtual and the real, are situated
and contextualized for faculty and students in unique ways, and they require
iterative examinations as these spaces or neighborhoods grow and change de-
mographically and experientially. Such online spaces, given time and support,
can be optimized for using appropriate onsite composition theories (per OWI
Principle 4, pp. 14-15) after experimentation and iterative design (per OWI
Principle 6, pp. 16-17).

    Our understanding of how online writing faculty professionalization can
make effective use of agile design through iterative refactoring becomes clear-
er by using agile design to newly mediate online learning environments in ev-

                                                                                                 403
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

er-changing ways, more dynamically responding to plugged-in students and fac-
ulty, transcoding cultural and computer layers to maximize play, space, identity,
simulation, and collaboration. This new approach is critical and necessary to
improve OWI faculty professionalization. In Because Digital Writing Matters:
Improving Student Writing in Online and Multimedia Environments, Dànielle
DeVoss, Elyse Eidman-Aadahl, and Troy Hicks (2010) cited the National Staff
Development Council's 2009 standards for professional development: "The kind
of high-intensity, job-embedded collaborative learning that is most effective is
not a common feature of professional development across most states, districts,
and schools in the United States (p. 4)" (p. 116). Their statement is apt, of
course. DeVoss et al. related that the "richest conceptions of professional devel-
opment" must value the idea that people transcend tools, that good praxis tran-
scends technologies, and that designs for learning transcend designs for delivery
(p. 118). A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for
OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) embraced this people-over-technology
philosophy. In order to follow OWI Principle 10, students should be prepared
for unique technological and pedagogical components of an online class (pp.
21-23). According to OWI Principle 11, personalized and interpersonal online
communities can be developed to help foster student and teacher success with
online transactional exchange (pp. 23-24). Manipulate the technology to fit the
pedagogy, certainly, and at the level of professionalization see where the agile, it-
erative work and investment behavior of OWI teachers creates value for systems.
As the ever-shifting employment structure of college faculty evolves, taking note
of investment in the faculty and helping them with stable jobs, promotion, and
tenure will be increasingly relevant.

    At the center of refactoring is a series of small behavior-preserving trans-
formations wherein each transformation or refactoring does just a little, but
together produces significant restructuring, reducing the chances that a system
can break during that restructuring (Fowler, 2013). Redesigning classes for hy-
brid or fully online modalities (see Chapter 2), as well as short- and long-term
faculty professionalization and support (see Chapters 7 & 11), should follow
a similar approach of micro-assessments while courses are redesigned. Doing
so follows OWI Principle 10 (offering student preparation), OWI Principle 11
(providing support communities for teachers and students), OWI Principle 12
(fostering teacher satisfaction as well as programmatic success), OWI Principle
13 (delivering onsite as well as online support mechanisms), and OWI Principle
14 (training for online administrators and tutors) (pp. 21-30). Agile faculty pro-
fessionalization must include a recursive performance support system, as well, in
order to document and recognize the value of that work. It is clear that "because
we are in the midst of a transformation in the materiality of information and

404
                                                                                                            Rice

in the media technologies of communication, things that were once consid-
ered `mere' support systems, transmission media, and conveyance devices are
now fundamentally implicated in any meaning-making process" (Burdick et al.,
2012, p. 83). Such faculty work should be documented and rewarded.

    Before applying a set of refactoring tests and prior to refactoring, software
programmers complete unit or smaller module tests to ensure that the behavior
of the module is correct. The process involves iterative and recursive testing, and
the more the better. Programmers define a number of specific techniques using
different amounts of automation, from the abstract to strategies for breaking
code into more logical pieces to improving names and code locations. So, too,
must effective OWI development engage in refactoring tests in order to support
professionalization. What technologies might students see again over multiple
online courses? How might instruction be presented over time to teach student
populations with differing abilities or learning needs? How might course con-
tent be designed in chunks that, together, make a larger picture for students
in terms of communication support strategies to help them succeed? Just as
students might move from the informal to the formal in their writing, or from
one form of expression to another, can they interact in one modality in order to
prepare for interaction in another? And in addition to software code refactoring,
approaches to hardware refactoring have been used to make complex systems
easier to understand in order to increase designer productivity (Fowler, 1999). If
software can be likened to teachers designing and constructing course content,
hardware can be compared to the administration and infrastructure that enable
teachers to work.

    We are now rendering a more practical picture of how to build productive
and sustainable faculty professionalization. Andrew Hunt and David Thomas'
(1999) wisdom in The Pragmatic Programmer regarding building maintainable
code in this way can help WPAs better understand how to create useful profes-
sionalization performance support systems. Here are key approaches that Hunt
and Thomas discussed throughout their book applicable to what administrators
should consider in building support systems for OWI professionalization:

    · avoid knowledge duplication,
    · write flexible and dynamic content,
    · avoid programming by coincidence,
    · bullet-proof code with exceptions,
    · capture real requirements,
    · test ruthlessly and effectively,
    · delight users, build teams of pragmatic programmers, and
    · make developments precise with some planned automation. (Hunt &

        Thomas, 1999)

                                                                                                 405
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

    To this end, effective faculty professionalization practice includes connecting
rhizomically throughout a faculty to:

    · share resources rather than duplicate efforts,
    · create curricula that somehow can be used in successive semesters yet still

        move in the flexible directions students and faculty need,
    · work to meet goals and objectives on the program by design with mul-

        tiple assignment sets for student options that meet the same goals and
        objectives,
    · apply principles of universal design for learners to ensure access and un-
        derstanding throughout curriculum design and process of experiencing
        a course,
    · create spaces for reflective practitioners to interact graciously and pro-
        ductively, and
    · create a climate of critical reflective praxis.

    Effective professionalization, ultimately, is the creation of dynamic electronic
performance support systems (EPSSs), which supports the improvement of per-
formance to avoid duplication, increase quality, connect measurements to goals
and objectives, and create more reflective practices.

VALUING DIVERGENT CONVERGENCES IN THE OWI
PRINCIPLES AND EFFECTIVE PRACTICES

    An EPSS is nothing new. Specifically, it is a support mechanism designed
to reduce complexity in order to provide employees with unique directions to
make effective decisions, thus improving quality and productivity. It is a support
approach in line with agile software design and agile faculty professional devel-
opment design to offer timely and specific (perhaps kairotic) flexibly structured
support. Building a better system of professionalization begins with strengthen-
ing motivation. In Electronic Performance Support Systems: How and Why to Re-
make the Workplace Through the Strategic Application of Technology, Gloria J. Gery
(1991) suggested that productive professionalization embraces the "performance
zone," a kairotic, rhetorical space creating a zone of proximal development be-
tween skills and situations. According to Gery, "Individual employees and entire
organizations can systematically work and achieve in the performance zone" (p.
13). Further, in Performance Management Systems: A Global Perspective, Arup
Varma, Pawan S. Budhwar, and Angelo DeNisi (2008) discussed the importance
of motivation in project management (PM). "The objective of PM," according
to Varma et al., "is to maximize employees' contributions to the organization,
which means changing employees' behaviors so that they produce this maxi-

406
                                                                                                            Rice

mum contribution" (p. 40). They further reasoned that motivation will be high
if and only if people see a strong relationship between the energy they devote to
something and the results produced, between the results and the favorableness
of evaluations, between the level of evaluations and outcomes, and between the
outcomes and anticipated satisfactions (pp. 46-47). This trajectory of motiva-
tion as a process can lead to what they called "action-to-results" connections.
Agile faculty professionalization is about creating just such connections in re-
sponsive, nimble ways.

    With OWI, motivation as a process is accomplished through retooling old
paradigms and re-envisioning how we justify and resist change. An effective,
agile professionalization support system must enable people to perform in a sys-
tem. Every OWI teacher, for instance, has different skills with the content, with
the design provided, with new delivery tools, with managing students in online
spaces, and with motivating learners individually and in groups in ways that do
not overburden the students or the teacher. The ideal performance zone or set
of faculty professionalization practices actualizes situated change just-in-time,
and affords sound praxis refactored on-demand at any time and in every place.
Good professionalization is flexible and dynamic with full faculty buy-in (Light,
Chen, & Ittelson, 2012). In "Employee Performance Management," Dennis
Briscoe and Lisbeth Claus (2008), for instance, defined Performance Manage-
ment as, "[T]he system through which organizations set work goals, determine
performance standards, assign and evaluate work, provide performance feed-
back, determine training and development needs, and distribute rewards" (p.
15). Newly mediated OWI and professionalization requires dynamic action to
results, which is a situated simulation embracing practical theory. As Joel A. En-
glish (2014) opened the Preface to Plugged In: Succeeding as an Online Learner:

         We all know that distance learning has become core to the
         business model of our institutions and the academic model of
         our programs. However, we have failed to acknowledge col-
         lectively that our online students very often require additional
         technological skills, critical thinking and communication
         skills, motivation, scheduling and self-administration tools,
         learning facilities, and financial savvy in order to be successful
         online. (p. xii)

The same can be said of the needs of aculty and WPAs who are working to plug in.
    Indeed, limitations of code-and-fix professionalization, as well as predictive

professionalization, can be mitigated through agile refactoring to promote ef-
fective action, capture and use collective intelligence, create goal-oriented ex-
changes between administrators and teachers and students, create productive

                                                                                                 407
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

cross-functional teams specializing in action to results, make representations of
cultural experience, capture and re-tool the knowledge of first-person experts,
and develop smart tools to deal with ranges of complexity. Professionalization
can be seen as a process of rewriting, reworking, and re-architecting the gram-
mar or code of online courses and online teaching, thus re-assigning what we
value to fix the root of the problem as new contexts and situations arise (Hunt
& Thomas, 1999). And the first step is in recognizing that design and content
creation by multiple authors (i.e., administrators, teachers, students) is an iter-
ative process. Let us consider crowd-sourced professionalization, for instance:

         crowd-sourced evaluations of scholarly arguments, not to
         mention crowd-sourced production models for generating
         and editing scholarly content, are transforming both the
         authorship function and conventional knowledge platforms,
         [creating] a much more dynamic, iterative, and dialogical
         environment that is predicated on versioning, crowd-sourced
         models of engagement and peer review, and open-source
         knowledge and publication platforms. (Burdick et al., 2012,
         p. 85)

As Daren C. Brabham (2013) wrote in Crowdsourcing, "The ability to coordinate
and network with one another is at the heart of collective intelligence" (p. 22),
and we should move toward professionalization models that value these diver-
gent convergences.

    Let us apply some of these ideas about faculty professionalization more di-
rectly to the CCCC OWI Committee's A Position Statement of Principles and
Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) recom-
mendations through the lens of agile design and refactoring. The OWI prin-
ciples are categorized by instruction, faculty, institution, and research, with an
overarching principle of inclusivity and accessibility. Access is the foundation
to each principle, and agile software design that embraces iterative, refactoring
decision-making processes supports universal access in effective OWI faculty
professionalization practice. Each OWI principle, clearly, is relevant to profes-
sionalization as well as to teaching and learning more generally.

OWI Principle 1: The Overarching Principle of Access and Inclu-

sivity

    With OWI Principle 1 as the overarching guideline, just as OWI should be
universally inclusive and accessible (pp. 7-11), faculty working online should
retain all of the rights and support and pay structure privileges as onsite faculty,

408
                                                                                                            Rice

especially if following an integrated scholar approach to connecting teaching,
research, and service in online learning environments. Working with students
online both asynchronously and synchronously is just as intensive as working
with students in a classroom and during office hours (see Chapters 2, 4, & 11).
To understand this intensive work, consider valuing people-oriented adaptive
work rather than process-oriented models, recognizing that every student learns
how to read critically and write in developed ways uniquely. As such, faculty
who support students in a people-oriented paradigm should be rewarded for
the quality of interaction in unique spaces they provide students. And just as
a variety of modalities and tools should be made available to different types of
learners, faculty should be encouraged to teach in onsite, hybrid, and/or fully
online environments to maximize their own teaching skills and integrated schol-
ar needs. Enacting OWI Principle 1, universal access, requires enabling our sen-
sibilities to imagine the real-world audiences as a diverse universe of users with
highly divergent needs through converging practices and systematic goals and
objectives--and that effort must be considered deeply, taught to one another,
researched systematically, written about, and published in scholarly venues. No
doubt, it should be rewarded appropriately.

OWI Principles 2 - 6: Instructional Principles

    OWI Principles 2 through 6 covered instructional guidelines (p. 11-17). They
detailed why OWCs should focus on writing using unique online instructional
tools rather than spending too much time teaching technologies. OWI Principle
2, for instance, suggested that OWCs should focus on the writing and not on
technology, which means that faculty should be trained to manipulate technol-
ogy within their pedagogical philosophies rather than vice-versa. In thinking
about how students interact with faculty, with each other, and with content on-
line, faculty pedagogy can develop in productive ways. OWI Principle 3 suggest-
ed that appropriate teaching and learning strategies should be developed, which
means thinking through such issues as how composition instruction in onsite
settings may need to change in online ones, how new approaches in online set-
tings need to be employed, and how outcomes can be augmented when students
are increasing their technological literacies. OWI Principle 4, similarly, pointed
out that appropriate contemporary composition theories should be integrated
into online environments. In terms of faculty professionalization, this principle
opens new areas of research and training. Faculty should attend campus-wide,
local, and national conferences regarding working with learners online, includ-
ing developing a better understanding of working with adult and nontraditional
and visual learners if the demographics warrant (see Chapters 8, 9, & 10). OWI

                                                                                                 409
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

Principle 5 suggested online teachers should have reasonable control over their
own content and teaching techniques, and OWI Principle 6 noted that unique
and experimental models themselves should, like all OWCs, be required to fol-
low effective practices principles.

    Remember that a primary goal of refactoring is to alter internal structures
without changing external behaviors. If a teaching load is 4:4 at an institution,
that external requirement should be the same even if internal pedagogical shifts
in modality are encouraged. If the number of students per section is capped
at 20, which is recommended in OWI Principle 9, then the equivalent online
course should be similarly capped (although OWI Principle 9 spoke singular-
ly to OWI course caps without considering onsite courses, this recommenda-
tion had its origins in the CCCC's Statement of Principles and Standards for the
Postsecondary Teaching of Writing (1989) and the CCCC's Statement on Second
Language Writing and Writers (2009), which were written primarily for onsite
courses; pp. 20-21). Ultimately, differences between face-to-face, hybrid, and
fully online teaching should be an internal matter of teaching styles that increas-
ingly resemble one another rather than demand or call for different teachers with
incredibly different skill sets (see Chapter 18). Doing so reduces the complexity
of online courses, improves maintainability by enabling teachers to reinforce
effective practices in varied delivery modalities, refines the architecture of writ-
ing programs to improve sustainability, and develops a model where changes in
curriculum or approach or composition theories can be extended readily to all
varied course sections in safe and controlled ways.

    A significant danger in online writing faculty professionalization is in spend-
ing money and time developing a course and then thinking the course is ready
to teach term after term without revision or additional thought. Instead, courses
should be developed with iterative design in mind in order to breathe, synchro-
nously, with the developing skills and interests and needs of the teacher as well
as the increasingly divergent interests of the students. Creating a shared master
course or model syllabus with instructors in a program works well in terms of
the new media principles of variability and modularity. However, as the OWI
instructional principles indicate, writing courses should focus on well-consid-
ered content that can make use of online technologies with teachers who are
making specific decisions on conveying, teaching, and assessing student writing
practices. Adaptable course shells work well if there is teacher ownership, and
that should come from teachers' iteratively refactoring design and content so
that they can (re)present and transcode the course in their own situated contexts.
This room for play and innovation in online learning spaces creates that third-
space unique to every shell that is people-based rather than only process-based,
so as help teachers to avoid defining students as stock users of class content term

after term, year after year.
    In Teaching/Writing in Thirdspaces: The Studio Approach, Rhonda Grego and

Nancy S. Thompson (2008) discussed thirdspaces as being "influenced by in-
stitutional politics, preferences, and power relations" (p. 5)--emphasizing local
needs and how close attention to the everyday lives of students and teachers in
specific locations is important. Researchers need tools to measure the knowl-
edge transfer and benefits of spaces like ePortfolios and online learning systems
(see also Lee & Carpenter, 2013; Whithaus, 2013). Students and teachers then
participate to shape the classroom as a creative text to stimulate ideas and to
work together to solve problems. Refactoring course content and delivery of
that content must be assessed for reliability and validity across sections by teams
of teachers or administrators, which is essential to OWI Principle 6 (p. 16-17).
Embedding appropriate composition theories and core composition teaching
techniques in OWI is critical. Online writing teachers should retain reasonable
control over their own content and teaching techniques, and experimental or
new models of OWI still should be pedagogically sound, entail adequate prepa-
ration, and require valuable oversight.

OWI Principles 7 - 9: Faculty Principles

    OWI Principles 7 through 9 covered faculty guidelines, and these are espe-
cially significant when considering faculty professionalization (p. 17-21). OWI
Principle 7, for instance, suggested that administrators must receive appropriate
OWI-focused training, development, and support for evaluation and promo-
tion. What determines appropriate training varies from place to place and from
person to person. At some institutions, a course release is offered to prepare an
OWC for the first time. This support may be similar to the time provided to a
developer of any course that is taught for the time. At other institutions, such
support entails extra compensation for designing and constructing course con-
tent in terms of a stipend, additional support for traveling to a conference to
present and learn about OWI, opportunities to present development work on
campus for additional pay, incentives in terms of useful tools like a scanner or
digital camera, or moving to the top of the list of faculty who need a new office
computer, and the like. An iterative, agile framework for faculty is needed to
support and then recognize the work that is required to create rigorous thought
spaces online for students, motivating faculty in development, action, and then
action-to-results process. It is vital to encourage faculty to become integrated
scholars, connecting teaching to research and service as well as to a sense of in-
vestment in the thirdspace culture of the program.

    OWI Principle 8 recommended that online writing teachers receive fair and

                                                                                                 411
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

equitable compensation for their work. What is fair is obfuscated sometimes by
administrative drive and pressure to increase profit, certainly (see Chapters 6 &
7, for example). We often do not recognize the value in working with students
at a distance virtually, for instance, in the same ways that we see faculty work
with students physically. There often is less "distance," however, between an on-
line student and faculty member than there is between a faculty lecturer and a
student in a face-to-face setting. That is, technologies afford opportunities for
highly interactive spaces that, if done well to support students, can be intensive
and time-consuming to faculty. And, as the best courses are those that change as
needed through agile design, the notion that teachers should only be facilitators
is problematic in OWCs. Some higher education models include paying high-
ly trained rhetoricians and compositionists, for instance, to design and create
curricula, and then paying less trained and therefore "less expensive" teachers to
facilitate the content without iterative refactoring. Good teaching must consider
design and content synchronously, however, changing dynamically in directions
students take the course in. If teachers in onsite, face-to-face environments are
provided offices and classrooms and tools to use, teachers using other delivery
systems, too, should be provided the resources they need. Resources may include
computers and professional opportunities like holding online office hours, but
may also include partial reimbursement for Internet access, phone "minutes,"
and even more flexible synchronous communication class meeting times.

    OWI Principle 9 suggested that OWCs should be capped at 20 students per
course with an eye toward 15 if possible. Again, in building an agile design sys-
tem that highlights interaction and works toward improving types of teacher::-
student and student::student interaction using available technologies, a system
both can motivate and recognize faculty who excel in building and feeding such
spaces. With OWCs, we want students and teachers to "inhabit" these transac-
tional spaces in order to maximize opportunities for learning. Some programs
cap online courses at 10% lower than face-to-face courses, others work to keep
the same enrollment per class numbers as onsite sections, while still others in-
crease the online course cap, possibly seeing it as less work than onsite courses or
knowing that a number of students likely will drop the course. Another model
is to lift all caps on OWCs but create small peer groups and asking faculty to
manage specific numbers of groups.1 Ultimately, higher course caps begin to
limit adequate motivation to interact to a high degree with one another and with
content, thereby creating insufficient opportunities for students to receive teach-
er and peer feedback. Instructors new to online teaching certainly benefit from
lower caps as they work to manage interaction online. Similar to the tendency to
cut assignments in onsite courses when student numbers increase or when num-
bers of sections a teacher is required to teach, online writing teachers with higher

412
                                                                                                            Rice

course caps may be tempted to cut assignments and to move from synchronous
to asynchronous-only models or otherwise to limit interaction or response.

OWI Principles 10 - 14: Institutional Principles

    OWI Principles 10 through 14 cover institutional guidelines (p. 21-30).
OWI Principle 10 suggested that the institution should ensure that both stu-
dents and teachers are prepared to work using the local tools and approaches
employed, which speaks directly to the need for agile training that is revised and
updated as newly mediated approaches and tools are put into place. OWI Prin-
ciple 11 recommended supporting OWI with personalized and interpersonal
online communities. For many institutions, such support begins minimally with
setting up an FAQ and step-by-step Web page, but this process follows a code-
and-fix or predictive design method that leaves many gaps. To create a more
useful support mechanism requires generating a knowledge base with feedback
offered transactionally by administrators and teachers and students. Institutions
and WPAs should enable students and faculty, especially, to create and connect
their personal and/or professional identities to this information. OWI Principle
12 suggested that institutions should foster teacher satisfaction with as robust
a focus as is given to student satisfaction. To this end, institutions and WPAs
should consider designing an electronic performance support system tied to stu-
dent and programmatic success. OWI Principle 13 suggested that both online
and onsite support tools must be in place for students such that online writing
students could receive their primary support online and in the modalities and
media engaged by their OWCs (see Chapter 5). Creating more media-rich ex-
amples, such as screencasts, in addition to text-based keys to success, is import-
ant in order to engage divergent learners convergently. Finally, OWI Principle
14 extended support to include OWLs and tutors who must also receive pro-
fessional development support matching the environment in which they work,
which enables OWL administrators and tutors to receive professionalization op-
portunities in like method and quality as the WPA and online writing teacher.

OWI Principle 15: Research and Exploration

    The final principle, OWI Principle 15, is a research and exploration guideline
(p. 31-32). It suggested that administrators and teachers and tutors, as they con-
tinue to professionalize their understanding of teaching and learning in online
writing environments, must be committed to ongoing action research. That is,
again, research requires an agile design refactoring process, where small changes
are made and tested in ways that support the larger infrastructure yet make quick,

                                                                                                 413
Faculty Professionalization for OWI

positive improvement. Such an agilely designed refactored research process can
significantly restructure approaches over time without breaking the system. Thus,
professionalization becomes a process of contact rethinking, rewriting, rework-
ing, and retooling content and approaches through transactional and dialectical
exchanges between teachers, tutors, students, content, research in the field, new
technological affordances, new motivation through training, and the like.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    These OWI principles for effective practices will, to some extent, become
more numerous and more nuanced. They will develop as the field of OWI con-
tinues to grow and expand, but they also will grow in our own programs as we
continue to develop reflective praxis as integrated scholars. Thus, this chapter
ends with some general recommendations that WPAs and other administrators
of OWI programs should address for dynamic professional development:

    · Consider software development methods as models for strengthening
        and understanding effective OWI practices in local contexts. Take the
        best of each method and move forward. For instance, get going with
        code-and-fix strategies as necessary, but then build in predictive updat-
        ing and assessment to increase support and meet OWI effective practic-
        es principles. At the same time, work to progress toward characteristics
        of more adaptive and agile, people-oriented professionalization perfor-
        mance support system models and frameworks.

    · Recognize that improving the quality of teaching online takes a great
        deal of time. What seems to be there or what knowledge appears to be
        transferring may not be and the work may require a sort of triangulation
        of understanding that may not be necessary in onsite, face-to-face modal-
        ities. Be sure of equal access to content, course design, technologies, and
        tools used in fulfilling assignments for all students.

    · Work to meet instructional, institutional, and overarching effective OWI
        practices through iterative refactoring in order to develop a more flexi-
        ble allocation of time and talent that can build productive teaching and
        learning spaces.

    · Think though ways to build and sustain a healthy digital economy of
        proactive attention. Our students have diverse needs, a changing level of
        experience and comfort with technologies, and a wide range of access.
        Think kairotically.

    · In addition to working with students in unique ways, recognize that
        teachers have an even greater diversity of experience, skill, motivation,
        and aptitude toward using technology effectively. Our goal should be

        "teach-nology"; that is, we should seek to optimize teaching and learning
        and knowledge transfer with each instructor's individual teaching situa-
        tion in mind. Adaptability and scalability can work against one anoth-
        er--and thus need repeated attention--with professional development
        and principles of numerical representation, modularity, automation,
        variability, and transcoding.

PREPARING STUDENTS FOR OWI

This chapter examines how institutions and instructors can prepare stu-
dents for OWCs. Integrating the latest research across fields with the work
of the CCCC OWI Committee, this chapter provides effective practic-
es and strategies for adequately preparing students for technology-based
courses and for learning to write in such settings.

Keywords: community building, online orientation, online readiness, on-
line teaching strategies, student preparation, student support

    Students, particularly nontraditional ones, increasingly seek online edu-
cational opportunities as they juggle the constraints and demands of families,
part- or full-time jobs, and other social and financial responsibilities (Noel-Lev-
itz, 2013; see also Chapters 9 & 10). With college enrollments declining over-
all (US Census Bureau, 2013), colleges and universities are seeking additional
enrollment in online courses as a part of their long-term strategies (Allen &
Seaman, 2013, p. 4) while state governments increasingly seek evidence not
just of enrollment, but also of retention and graduation when funding colleges
and universities (Harnish, 2011). Retention rates in online classes were noted
as an "important or very important barrier to the growth of online education"
by 73.5% of chief academic officers in the most recent Babson survey of higher
education administrators (Allen & Seaman, 2013, p. 30).

    Students continue to seek online educational opportunities because of flex-
ibility in scheduling, the perception of online courses as "time-saving," and the
ability to attend to family responsibilities while taking courses (Harris & Mar-
tin, 2012; Leh, 2002; Shea, Swan, Fredricksen & Pickett, 2002; Young, 2006).
However, once students select online education, they must then be assisted by
educational institutions to become successful in online courses, particularly in
OWCs, where students must engage much more fully with both reading and

Preparing Students for OWI

producing written texts and navigating the technologies to do so. While stu-
dents taking online courses in content-heavy subjects might watch lectures,
read a textbook, and take multiple-choice or other objective exams, students in
OWCs more frequently might be asked to engage in collaborative activities (i.e.,
discussion boards, small group projects), complete writing tasks (i.e., written
essays), and interact with students and faculty (i.e., peer-writing groups, syn-
chronous conferences with faculty). Any of these activities require successfully
navigating a variety of LMS components as well as uploading digital files, access-
ing and evaluating written feedback, and participating in course activities that
require them to engage and interact with peers and with the instructor (see OWI
Principles 3, 4, 11, & 13).

    Literature reviews across a number of fields (Future of State Universities
2011; Lack, 2013; Warnock, 2013) have illustrated the wide variety of research
about how learning outcomes in online courses compare to onsite or face-to-face
courses. While writing studies has been developing its understanding of instruc-
tor-related issues regarding online teaching (Hewett, 2010, 2015b; Hewett &
Ehmann, 2004; McGrath, 2008; Meloncon, 2007), time it takes to teach online
(Worley & Tesdell, 2009), and general issues related to online learners (Car-
gile-Cook & Grant-Davie, 2005, 2103; special issues of Computers and Com-
position 2001, 18.4 and 2006, 23.1; Technical Communication Quarterly, 1999,
8.1 and 2007, 16.1), research in OWI has not adequately addressed the issue of
student preparation and student success for OWCs.

    In March, 2013, the CCCC OWI Committee published A Position State-
ment of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI, which provided 15
OWI principles. Three of the OWI principles related directly to students and
student preparation:

    · OWI Principle 10: Students should be prepared by the institution and
        their teachers for the unique technological and pedagogical compo-
        nents of OWI (pp. 21-23).

    · OWI Principle 11: Online writing teachers and their institutions
        should develop personalized and interpersonal online communities to
        foster student success (pp. 23-24).

    · OWI Principle 13: OWI students should be provided support compo-
        nents through online/digital media as a primary resource; they should
        have access to face-to-face support components as a secondary set of
        resources (pp. 26-28).

    These three principles dealing most directly with student preparation are in-
cluded within the institutional principles category. One of the reasons for their
inclusion in this category rather than in a category specific to students is that

418
                                                                                       Meloncon and Harris

remarkably little research has been conducted with students on their prepara-
tion for online courses (see Chapter 17). Thus, this chapter highlights what
we know about student preparation for online courses in general and for OWI
in particular, and it offers recommendations and effective practices addressing
student preparation for OWI. This information is drawn from the research work
of the committee, the CCCC OWI Committee Expert/Stakeholder Panel, and
consistent themes in published research, much of which is described in the In-
troduction and Chapter 1.

The Necessity of Student Preparation for OWI

    Ivan L. Harrell's (2008) multi-disciplinary review of the existing literature
on student preparation offered suggestions to increase success involving student
readiness, student orientation, and student support. His study foreshadowed
many of the principles and effective practices of the OWI policy statement,
which demonstrates that the OWI principles are not radical or unknown to
educators working with onsite and online students. However, in writing studies
in general and in rhetoric and composition in particular, little-to-no work has
been done specifically on how students select online classes, how to prepare stu-
dents for OWCs, and what characteristics of online learners help them succeed
in online classes. To help them understand the current state of affairs in OWI,
the CCCC OWI Committee administered two nationwide surveys--one for
fully online courses and the other for hybrid ones (CCCC OWI Committee,
2011a & 2011b, respectively) that resulted in The State of the Art of OWI report
(2011c). This survey was, in part, an attempt to learn about student preparation
and preferences from the instructor's point of view. One issue that emerged from
the CCCC OWI Committee surveys is the need to understand more about stu-
dents' apparent readiness for online education.

    Over the past decade and more, research in online education across the dis-
ciplines, particularly in education and psychology, has considered student read-
iness for online learning. In particular, this research has focused on the use of
student surveys and other diagnostic instruments (McVay, 2000, 2001; Parnell

Leigh, & Triner, 2004) and identifying the characteristics of students who are
successful online learners (Dabbagh, 2007; Tallent-Runnels et al., 2006). In re-
lation to identifying online student characteristics, Nada Dabbagh (2007) pre-
dicted that "the profile of the online learner population is changing from one
that is older, mostly employed, place bound, goal oriented, and intrinsically
motivated, to one that is diverse, dynamic, tentative, younger, and responsive to
rapid technological changes" (p. 224); these traits indicate that online education

                                                                                                 419

appeals not only to so-called nontraditional learners but increasingly to younger
learners as well. Current consensus in online education is that successful student
learners are self-motivated, goal-oriented, and efficient at time management.
However, OWI teachers are likely to find the full range of students in their class-
rooms; mingling in classes with the dynamic, tentative, and younger students are
students who are returning to school with full-time jobs, reconsidering their first
careers for second (or even third) careers, and/or juggling family responsibilities
with school. Some have poor technology skills, others have excellent skills with
social media but no skills with educational technology, and others easily use
technology in any setting (Hewett, 2015a). Additionally, students have a wide
range of access needs--often masked by the online setting--that include phys-
ical disabilities, learning challenges, multilingual language learning traits, and
socioeconomic disadvantages as described in Chapters 1, 8, 9, & 10 & OWI
Principle 1 (pp. 7-11). It is challenging for writing studies educators to ensure
that support is in place for this range of students with varying access needs and
technological, writing, and life skills to complete OWCs successfully.

    Recent research, such as that by Moon-Heum Cho (2012), has shown that
online orientations to the LMS or the course are useful for students and their
success in online courses. However, in the CCCC OWI Committee's surveys,
only 19% of survey respondents agreed or strongly agreed that "students have
completed an instrument, which [sic] has indicated that their learning prefer-
ences are conducive to success in an online environment" (CCCC OWI Com-
mittee, 2011c, p. 82). Thus, even if the research indicated that online orienta-
tions are highly reliable and valid (Dray, Lowenthal, Miszkiewicz, Ruiz-Primo,
& Marczynski, 2011), the majority of students are more than likely enrolling
in online courses regardless of their readiness for online learning. As institutions
seek to boost online enrollments, they are unlikely to require students to partic-
ipate in mandatory institutional readiness assessments prior to enrollment and
to exclude students from enrolling for online courses. Even those students who
do take recommended readiness exams may believe that they will be successful
in online courses despite the results of these surveys.

    Once students enroll in online courses, whether or not they are offered for-
mal preparation for online learning, they face a number of challenges. One of
the CCCC OWI Committee's (2011a, 2011b) survey questions asked, "What
do students report are the most problematic aspects of the [writing] courses?"
Compiled results from the two surveys showed participants indicating that
once students enroll in online classes, regardless of their preparation, the most
common challenges they face are "keeping up with the class" (75%), "technical
problems with the student interface" (58%), "lack of motivation" (50%), and
"getting started in the course" (39%) (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 84).

                                                                                       Meloncon and Harris

Instructors indicated that they most frequently dealt with student issues through
"community building activities early in the semester" (66%), "informal portions
of discussion board" (60%), "communicating a reasonable amount of flexibility
for the larger, more sophisticated projects (acknowledging that things do/can
go wrong)" (54%), and "work[ing] closely with the IT department to correct
technical problems quickly" (52%) (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011c, p. 84).
Overall, the survey results indicated that student issues early in the term might
be linked, at least in part, to unfamiliarity with the course requirements and lack
of understanding of the online interface or problems with the online interface
itself. Faculty responses to problematic aspects of online courses frequently were
communication-based: setting up opportunities for questions in the LMS and
communicating with students and with IT staff in a timely manner.

    How students perceive online courses is a second aspect of student readiness
for OWI that is slightly less tangible than gauging student readiness via a survey
or instrument. Online students in Noel-Levitz. (2013) surveys regarding student
readiness for online instruction indicated that the top five challenges students
face in online courses relate to their perceptions of student/faculty interaction
and the quality of the course. Respondents were asked to rate the following
statements:

    · The quality of instruction is excellent.
    · Student assignments are clearly defined in the syllabus.
    · Faculty are responsive to student needs.
    · Tuition paid is a worthwhile investment.
    · Faculty provide timely feedback about student progress. (Noel-Levitz,

        2013, p. 9)

    These factors are related to student perception because, whether or not the
elements listed above are true objectively (i.e., a faculty member might indeed
be responsive but the students do not consider her to be responsive because they
do not share the same definition for "responsive" in this context), students in the
survey perceived these five factors to be challenges to success in online classes. At
least three of the above-stated factors (i.e., clearly defined assignments, faculty
responsiveness to student needs, and timely feedback about student progress)
relate directly to potentially effective practices in OWI (OWI Principles 3 and 4,
pp. 12-15; also see Chapters 3, 4, 5, & 11). A better understanding of students'
motivation and their reasons for choosing online classes as well as their percep-
tions of whether and how online courses meet their interpersonal and intellec-
tual needs can provide institutions and instructors much needed information
in developing OWI that will help students succeed. Instructor perceptions and
anecdotal data, when combined and triangulated with other data sources such

                                                                                                 421
Preparing Students for OWI

as retention rates (see Chapter 6) and student perception and experience studies
(see Chapter 17), can offer important insights into what institutions and faculty
can do to better prepare students and help them succeed in OWCs.

    The lessons from the CCCC OWI Committee surveys of fully online and
hybrid OWI educators and from other research into student preparation and
success are three fold: (1) student readiness for online courses cannot always be
directly measured, (2) student perception of the online course plays a role in
their success in online courses, and (3) what instructors believe students need
to be successful in an online course has little to do with being successful in an
online writing course. According to the "State-of-the-Art Report" (CCCC OWI
Committee, 2011c):

         The differences between online courses, online writing cours-
         es, between online training and online writing instruction
         training, and online teaching and online writing teaching blur
         throughout this report, indicating that traditional ideas and
         strategies simply have migrated to online setting without suffi-
         cient consideration of what specific media mean for learning
         in a particular disciplinary area like writing. (p. 10)

    In the remainder of this chapter, we recommend strategies at the institutional
and instructor levels that keep in mind the challenges associated with OWI and
highlight the unique qualities of OWI that make student support challenging.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STUDENT PREPARATION

    The OWI principles and accompanying example effective practices provided
a variety of recommendations for institutions and instructors regarding OWI in
general. In this section, we focus on the factors that relate to student preparation
and success first at the institutional level and then the instructor level.

Institutional Level

Orientation Modules/Models

    While an onsite, face-to-face writing class might rely on little more than the
technology of books, chalkboards, pens, and papers--and possibly a comput-
er-powered projector--the online class usually relies on a functioning LMS, an
accessible IT professional or student help desk, a working computer, and reliable
access to the Internet (see Chapter 10). In addition to these external factors,
students need technological capabilities and preparation before beginning an
online class.

    Individual institutions offer a wide range of technology training, support,
development, and mentoring for students (and instructors). Some institutions
or their writing programs make a concerted effort to standardize their online
courses so that students can have similar experiences across courses. Other insti-
tutions provide minimal technology training, support, development and men-
toring, relying on faculty and students to be motivated to troubleshoot their
own problems. OWI Principle 7 called for both technology and pedagogical
preparation for taking an OWC, making such minimal support unacceptable for
preparing students or teachers for success in OWI (p. 17).

    In conjunction with instructors within the disciplines, general orientation
opportunities should be provided to students enrolling in online classes. These
orientations need to include three specific areas:

   1. An overview of required technologies and technological skills necessary to
       complete the course, including an introduction to the LMS;

   2. Self-awareness assessments to help students gauge their own efficacy for
       completing the course; and

   3. Disciplinary-specific information on what particular elements the course
       will include (i.e., small group work, synchronous meeting sessions, and
       the like).

    Technology-related orientations should be twofold. First, they should in-
clude general information regarding the hardware, software, and applications
that will be required in the class. For example, students need to know whether
a netbook computer, tablet, or mobile device like a smart phone is suitable for
the types and kinds of activities they will perform (see Chapter 16) or whether
they need to access more powerful or otherwise different technology. Students
also need to know whether they can access the LMS through the Internet alone
or whether they also need access to such software as Adobe Acrobat or plug-ins
as an updated version of Java to access course content. These technological needs
are issues of access addressed in OWI Principle 1 (pp. 7-11) and discussed in
Chapters 8 and 10. Second, students need an in-depth overview of the LMS that
will be used in the course with respect to how it will be used in an OWC partic-
ularly. Moreover, students with disabilities require additional instruction on how
they will interface their assistive technology--screen readers, Braille Displays,
voice input software, and the like--with the institutional LMS, library, and
other student services websites. OWI Principle 10 encouraged institutions and
instructors to provide OWI preparation that includes familiarization with the
interface and provides explicit instruction on where to find assignments, post
and retrieve writing, and participate in interactive components of the class (i.e.,
discussion board, group work, and the like) (pp. 21-23). OWI Effective Practice

                                                                                                 423
Preparing Students for OWI

10.7 advocated for the OWC use of the institutionally approved software or
LMS (pp. 22-23). One rationale for this effective practice is that instructors and
students will need to have an outside resource for help with technological sup-
port that may arise, taking the onus for technology training and problem-solv-
ing assistance off the OWI teachers' shoulders. Another rationale, discussed in
Chapter 1, is the notion that for some issues of student access, using a common
LMS and foregoing outside software and programs levels the playing field and
avoids requiring OWI teachers to teach technology over writing itself (see also
OWI Principle 2, p. 7, andChapters 4, 8, & 14 regarding this somewhat sticky
issue).

    Joel English (2014) highlighted four fundamentals for students to succeed as
online learners: motivation, self-discipline, communication, and commitment.
English underscored what OWI teachers already know: an online course is not
easier than an onsite, face-to-face course and success requires time and engaged
commitment (p. 85). While these seem obvious to the experienced instructor,
these concepts can often be daunting for college students, especially first and
second-year students. Student self-assessment often is included as part of ori-
entations to online learning to enable them to self-gauge their preparation for
taking an online class. The lack of preparation and readiness for online learning
is one of the primary reasons students drop out of the courses. OWI Effective
Practice 10.2 recommended that information be provided to students to help
with study habits and skills (p. 22). One way to provide this information is
through self-assessments that students can complete to help them understand
their own habits. Students need to be encouraged to perform a self-assessment
to determine whether their motivation and self-discipline are sufficient to keep
them on track while taking an online course.

    Such an intake also can provide the instructor with valuable data about
the special needs of any disabled students enrolled in the course. Numerous
self-assessment orientation modules are available online. One of the most widely
used and adapted instruments is ToOLS (http://faculty.txwes.edu/mskerr/tools.
html), which was created by Marcel Kerr of Texas Wesleyan College. It measures
students' strengths and weaknesses regarding online learning including self-as-
sessment information. (See Kerr, Rynearson & Kerr, 2006, for more informa-
tion). This sort of detailed orientation affords students the opportunity to start
the course better prepared technologically. Thus, they can spend their time and
effort on the content of the course.

    Finally, a key facet of online orientation for OWCs is an overview of the
assignments, activities, and requirements in a class in addition to a list of min-
imal technological skills and personal skills necessary to succeed in OWCs (see
Appendix for a Student Preparation Checklist). In the CCCC OWI Committee

national surveys (2011a, 2011b), only 6% of respondents reported that stu-
dents need to be able to read or write well to succeed in an OWC. That is not
to say that such basic literacy skills are not needed; indeed, according to Beth
L. Hewett (2015a), these are especially crucial skills for learning to writing in
online settings because of the heavy text-based literacy loads (see also Griffin &
Minter, 2013 & Chapter 6). It seems possible that the survey respondents sim-
ply were not thinking in terms of such basic literacies or that the survey worded
the questions poorly regarding this aspect of student preparedness. Since much
of an OWC is mediated through texts, students need to be able to read and to be
able to communicate their questions and concerns. Discipline-specific orienta-
tions may ask questions about how much students are willing to read and other
concerns geared particularly to online writing. For OWI orientation, students
should be asked to identify how they take in information best: aurally through
audio; visually through images and text; and/or aurally and visually through
audio/visual sound, images, and text (see Chapter 11 for teaching strategies en-
gaging these media). OWI carries the capability to use both synchronous and
asynchronous modalities (see Chapter 3) and multiple media; when students
identify their learning preferences, they are better able to voice their learning
needs in an orientation to the OWC, better enabling the teacher to meet those
needs--again, an issue of access.

    One concern of particular importance in OWCs is time commitment. Stu-
dents will need to schedule time to read and write assignments, possibly view
videos, and participate in collaborative activities such as class discussion and peer
feedback, in addition to their other writing tasks. Jane Bozarth, Diane Chap-
man, and Laura LaMonica (2004) asked online students, "If you could have
learned something about online learning prior to beginning an online course,
what would have been helpful?" The most common response was knowledge
of the time commitment required (p. 95). To ensure student success, Effective
Practice 10.2 suggested that specific information be provided to students about
the time needed for drafting, revising, and working with peer group members
(p. 22). While provided time estimates do not need to be exact, anecdotally
students often miscalculate the amount of time needed to read, study, and do
assignments. They may have a misinformed belief that online courses--OWCs
included--take less time than onsite courses. Offering a range of time, such as
suggested in Chapter 10, can help students visualize their time commitment in
real terms instead of something that somehow gets done in cyberspace.

Gather and Leverage Existing Data

    Every postsecondary institution now can collect reams of data about students
from a myriad of internal systems. With the ease of computing technologies that

                                                                                                 425
Preparing Students for OWI

can analyze and make sense of "big data," institutions are beginning to tap their
own data assets to learn more about students and programs. According to Alyse
Hachey, Katherine Conway, and Claire Wladis (2013), "Course and institution-
al management systems today collect a wealth of data on student characteristics,
enrollment patterns and course outcomes that are not being utilized but are
readily available for faculty and administrators to study ... to make thoughtful
program improvement" (para. 1). WPAs and writing program faculty may be
able to take advantage of such data to understand their student population and
its learning needs better. For example, Di Xu & Shanna Smith Jaggers (2013) of
the Community College Research Center compiled a dataset of nearly 500,000
courses take by over 40,000 students in the Washington State Community Col-
lege system. This dataset is a prime example of leveraging existing data to find
important trends and provide empirically based information on which to base
decisions. Xu and Jaggers found that certain students (males, Black students,
and younger students) had lower performance in online courses, and they ex-
trapolated from these data the provocative suggestion that institutions could
"redefine online learning as a student privilege rather than a right" in ways that
would limit the types and kinds of courses a student could take online until the
student proves they are ready (Community College Research Center, 2013, p.
25). In the context of OWI, using existing data (and gathering consistent data)
could provide programs and instructors the leverage to make claims about stu-
dent success and access to online learning, making more realistic decisions about
who takes an OWC possible.

    Most WPAs already are skilled in gathering student-generated data to fa-
cilitate assessment and program review in face-to-face courses, but as Virgin-
ia Tucker (2012) acknowledged, "Assessment in distance education is a topic
of relatively recent study" (para. 2). Tucker explained that a distance writing
program administrator (dWPA) needs a specific assessment strategy for online
courses that is different from face-to-face strategies: "Understanding the partic-
ular assessment needs of a distance writing program allows a dWPA to better
lead a conversation about programmatic assessment strategies" (para. 3; see also
Chapter 6). While the dWPA should be able to gather information about as-
signments, exercises, and other pedagogical information from instructors, she
most likely will need to ask for data about students and their accessing of the on-
line platform from another location on campus. By leveraging institutional data
in meaningful ways, institutions, WPAs, and instructors can provide necessary
support structures that can increase student success in OWCs.

Limit Class Sizes to a Reasonable Number

    OWI Principle 9 recommended that "OWCs should be capped responsibly

426
                                                                                       Meloncon and Harris

at 20 students per course with 15 being a preferable number" (p. 20). Smaller
OWC sizes offer significant benefits to both students and instructors (see Chap-
ter 6 for more detail). Perhaps the greatest benefit is that lower course caps pro-
vide instructors the opportunity to offer more frequent (and possibly more sub-
stantive or more helpful) formative feedback on student writing. Respondents to
the CCCC OWI Committee surveys (2011a, 2011b) indicated that responding
to student writing does not change when moved to an online environment--the
work still is there. The same grading and feedback demands exist. If student
numbers increased, then feedback would decrease, which would undermine the
effectiveness of the course.

    However, respondents overwhelmingly also cited time and grading/respons-
es/feedback as the primary reasons for keeping course caps low. Indeed, many
open-ended responses pointed to the extra written communication that is nec-
essary when teaching online as a quantifiable way to justify smaller class sizes.
However, other than grading- or assessment-related feedback, many respondents
also indicated that interacting to students in other ways also increases their
workload (e.g., commenting on discussion posts, crafting class announcements,
responding to emails and questions). For example, one respondent wrote, "On-
line teaching requires a lot of intense email communication in the evenings--
the more students I have, the longer this takes each night." Quite simply, OWI
is a text-heavy teaching venue with teachers teaching primarily through their
writing and not their oral capabilities (Hewett, 2015a). They are stretched by the
literacy load in ways similar to students.

    While WPAs and administrators initially might balk at what are perceived
as relatively low course caps, they need to consider the importance of online
student retention not only in OWCs but across the university. Just as onsite,
face-to-face writing courses help universities with retention, so, too, can online
courses--but only if students complete them successfully. Appropriate enroll-
ments allow students to succeed long term at the university, thus paying divi-
dends in the future as opposed to simply meeting short-term enrollment goals.

Provide and Fund Training for OWI Teachers

    OWI Principle 8 advocated for OWI teachers to receive fair and equitable
compensation for their work. Compensation needs to match the additional ef-
fort required to develop, teach, and revise online courses, as indicated in Chap-
ters 6, 7, and 12. The literature has suggested that creating a new online course
takes more time and research (Worley & Tesdell, 2009). However, only 44.7%
of chief academic officers in the Babson survey agreed that online courses require
more faculty time and effort (Allen & Seaman, 2013, p. 22). When this time
and effort is not acknowledged and provided for by the institution, student

                                                                                                 427
Preparing Students for OWI

preparation is cheated, potentially leading to attrition and failure.
    A consistent theme in the research that underscored the OWI principles

was the need for instructors to participate in training before teaching online.
Instructors also need ongoing professional development to keep up with new
pedagogies and technology. To attend to these issues involves time and commit-
ment that must come from other areas of faculty lives; thus to encourage facul-
ty to participate in additional training and to compensate them for their time
and efforts, OWI teachers need to be trained and funded for their professional
commitment to teaching online. In Laura McGrath's (2008) national survey of
OWI teachers, one instructor wrote that she could be better supported in her
online teaching if her institution would "make it financially worthwhile to train
to teach online." Hewett and Christa Ehmann (2004) similarly acknowledged
that "precious few dollars are spent on teacher training, particularly on training
that supersedes learning how to navigate a specific electronic platform and that
addresses, instead, the pedagogy of online teaching and learning" (p. xiii). The
trickle-down effect of professional training for OWI to improve student OWC
experiences cannot be overstated. If the teachers are insufficiently prepared for
OWI, the students lose.

Create More Support Structures for Students

    Two particular areas of institutional support can facilitate student success.
First, students need technology support throughout the course. OWI Effective
Practice 10.4 stated that "the institution should provide 24/7, accessible tech-
nical support for any LMS or other approved software or technology used for
meeting with or participating in the OWC. Teachers should not be considered
the primary IT expert for the OWC" (p. 22). For some faculty this practice is,
and will be for the foreseeable future, more dream than reality. Yet, if in essence
the institution takes responsibility for IT orientation and support for all online
courses, including OWCs, and if OWI teachers require students to complete an
institution-driven orientation for the LMS when available, there will be fewer
basic questions about using the LMS. If faculty further determine not to add
unnecessary outside software to the course outside the LMS--and it is up to
them to determine what is necessary or not--then another layer of technology
frustration may be eliminated, thus enhancing inclusivity and accessibility (see
OWI Principles 1, 2 & 10, as well as Chapter 14, to complicate the meaning
of "necessary"). Writing faculty then will be left with a writing program-based
necessity of helping students understand how the technology use changes in
an OWC setting (OWI Principle 10). Of course, faculty should be cognizant
that students might have limited access to and success with IT support systems,
technology can fail, and that their job is to provide "accessible back-up plans for

428
                                                                                       Meloncon and Harris

when technology fails, either on their end or the institution's end," according to
Effective Practice 10.6 (p. 22).

    Second, students need access to online tutoring if they are to succeed, and
ultimately, this provision of tutoring is an institutional consideration (unless the
institution's Writing Center is purely driven and funded by the writing program,
in which case responsibility for this provision belongs to the writing program).
Errin Heyman (2010) noted that a key factor in relation to student retention is
"student support and student connection with the institution" (para. 16). OWI
Principle 13 underscored the need for online writing students to have support
components that include tutoring and other online resources typically found on-
site. It stated, "OWI students should be provided support components through
online/digital media as a primary resource; they should have access to onsite sup-
port components as a secondary set of resources" (p. 26). Moreover, given Xu &
Jaggers' (Community College Research Center, 2013) recent research suggesting
that males, Black students and students who are in basic writing may need more
support services to help them succeed (p. 23), it is incumbent on writing pro-
grams to provide it. Students with disabilities likely require additional support in
all of these matters. Support services include tutoring, writing centers that have
virtual components, and OWLs. Chapter 5 outlines these necessary components
of OWI that helps to enable student success. In preparing A Position Statement of
Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI, the CCCC OWI Committee
believed that online writing students are best supported online writing tutoring;
such tutoring needs to be funded, staffed with trained administrators and tutors
(see OWI Principle 14, pp. 28-30), and advertised to students for their use.

Instructor Level

Accessibility

    In recent research, Sushil Oswal and Lisa Meloncon (2014) discussed the
need for instructors to "pay attention" to accessibility and disability in OWCs.
This need is necessitated by the fact that there are a growing number of stu-
dents with disabilities (Newman Wagner, Cameto, Knokey, & Shaver., 2010;
Snyder & Dillow, 2010). Some estimate students reporting a disability at 11%
of undergraduates and 8% of graduate students (US Department of Education,
2012). Indeed, these numbers likely are low since many students with disabilities
have a desire to forge an identity that is not related to their disability (Lightner,
Kipps-Vaughan, Schulte, & Trice, 2012; Marshak, Van Wieren, Ferrell, Swiss,
& Dugan, 2009). Other research has found that between 60-80% of students
with disabilities choose not to disclose their challenges for any number of rea-
sons (Schelly, Davies, & Spooner, 2011; Wagner, Newman, Cameto, Garza, &

                                                                                                 429
Preparing Students for OWI

Levine, 2005). In terms of the OWI principles, these numbers certainly are
low given that the CCCC OWI Committee included among students needing
inclusivity and access attention not only those who are physically disabled, but
also those with identified learning challenges, those with multilingual language
concerns, and those with socioeconomic disadvantages. To this end, the CCCC
OWI Committee strongly believes that OWI Principle 1 should ground all of
OWI--from the WPA to individual teachers. Oswal and Meloncon (2014) pro-
vided instructors with strategies for creating accessible online courses, including
adequate preparation for instructors, incorporating universal design into the
course structure, selecting an appropriate delivery tool, and building capacity
within writing programs. The authors indicated that "The strategies provided are
ways to get started because for accessibility to be effectively implemented across
programs requires a fundamental shift in ideology; it requires starting with ac-
cessibility as a parallel to learning outcomes" (p. 294).

    Course design and navigation are related intimately with accessibility con-
cerns. Faculty and students are familiar with the materiality of the onsite writing
classes where discussions, meetings, and instructor interaction have, for the most
part, clear and sometimes tacit expectations. In onsite writing classes, students
generally understand that teachers will be speaking from particular places in
the classroom, that teachers take responsibility for beginning and ending class
sessions, that the projector or chalkboard will contain important information,
that students might be working in peer-review groups and how to do so, that
they will be asked to write and hand in papers and how to do so, and what to
expect in terms of teacher comments on those papers (although the content of
comments may vary, they often still will be returned on hardcopy papers). In
the online class, however, navigational structures replace the chairs, chalkboard,
and projector of the classroom, and the structure of each online class has to be
learned and interpreted. Courtney Shivetts (2011), who has written a compre-
hensive literature review on the importance of the learner in online learning,
found that while student motivation is an important factor for student success,
students are also highly dependent on course layout and accessibility. While
these two findings will not surprise many readers--especially those readers who
have taught online--they do afford educators the opportunity to reconsider the
materiality of the online classroom in order to motivate and prepare students for
OWI and make OWCs more accessible.

    Because students encounter each new online class as if they were encounter-
ing a new online classroom, design issues are of paramount concern in OWCs.
Cheng-Yuan Lee, Jeremy Dickerson, and Joe Winslow (2012) offered three or-
ganizational philosophies of online course structure: the fully autonomous ap-
proach, the basic guidelines approach, and the highly specified approach. Online

rubrics, such as the Chico State Rubric for Online Instruction, make general,
research-based recommendations about course design. Whatever the approach
one takes, students may need various levels of assistance from the OWI teacher.
For example, the OWC might be structured much like an onsite course in that
there are a set number of major and minor writing assignments that will be
graded, class discussion is expected about reading and writing strategies (albeit
through text in the common OWC), and some peer work is anticipated. In
this case, students would benefit from an analogy with onsite writing classes
indicating similarities and differences, drawing on their past knowledge. They
also would benefit from understanding where and how to access the syllabus,
whether there is any changeability to the course calendar (and when and they
might find out about changed schedules), where the assignments are provided,
where to post formal assignments, where to post writing to peers, and where
to post personal communications with the teacher, and the like. If the OWC
is differently structured--such as in a fully workshop setting where different
students receive whole-class feedback each week--students would benefit from
a different sort of explanation regarding the class expectations and where and
how to access course materials. Given the hundreds of variations that an OWC
can take, it behooves teachers to keep inclusion and access in mind; students
who do not know what to do may choose to do nothing at all, failing to ask the
questions to which they believe others automatically know the answers. Students
with visual impairments and learning disabilities in general struggle to keep up
with course readings and might need direct communications via email about
schedule revisions and other last minute changes.

    The scholarship of teaching and learning has advocated consistently for
course creation that is transparent. Transparency involves not only providing
clear learning outcomes but also information about how those outcomes will be
achieved and what is required of students. In one pilot study, the most frequent
answer that students gave to the question, "if you could have learned something
about online learning prior to beginning an online courses, what would have
been helpful?" was that they needed to know instructor expectations (Bozarth,
Chapman, & LaMonica, 2004, p. 95). For online classes, students need to have
a clear understanding of instructor expectations, and this can be accomplished
by consistent communication through multiple channels that reminds students
of expectations and course objectives, according to OWI Effective practice 11.3
(p. 23; see also Warnock, 2009 & Chapter 4). These channels should be de-
signed into the structure of the course, regardless the course structure.

    These multiple channels with built-in redundancies are a crucial lifeline for
students with learning disabilities for surviving in online environments. Online
courses not only need to provide students clear navigational pathways, instruc-

                                                                                                 431

tions, and assignments, but online educators also need to be aware that students
must relearn new patterns of navigation and systems for organization for each
online class they encounter, meaning that the writing instruction might, at first,
be slowed down as students learn to navigate a new online class. To this end,
OWI teachers can provide basic, initial assignments designed to help students
navigate the LMS while also beginning a purposeful reading and/or writing as-
signment.

Research the Profiles and Demographics of Students in OWCs

    Closely related to the recommendation that institutions should access and
leverage available data to understand online students better, instructors, too,
should use institutional data to their advantage. These data can provide import-
ant insights to assist in course planning, development, and design. Resources,
pedagogical approaches, and assignments that appeal to the unique character-
istics of the students who gravitate toward online and technology-mediated
course delivery in one's home institution (or in similar institutions regarding
student population and levels offered) can only help those students succeed.
For example, at the University of Cincinnati, the student body is comprised of
31% first-generation college students (University of Cincinnati, 2012, p. 73).
Many online writing students are first generation and these students have par-
ticular issues that have been well documented such as lack of an understanding
of college experience (Thayer, 2000; Vargas 2004) and lack of educational ex-
pectations and encouragement (Choy, 2001; Schmidt, 2003). Characteristics of
such students may include pride in attempting college work and anxiety or fear
of failing the family; when combined, these attributes may cause these students
to take too many classes, not knowing what to expect from any one. In terms of
taking online courses, first-generation students may come from impoverished or
under-supported educational backgrounds, may have minimal Internet connec-
tion, and may be unfamiliar with using technology or with using it for educa-
tional purposes. With institutional data and a little research, OWI teachers can
address the needs of such students when designing courses and throughout the
term, all of which also applies to accessibility.

Building Community

    The lack of a specified time and place to meet physically is one of the biggest
barriers students must overcome when taking online courses. While instructors
cannot control student motivation, they can encourage students to engage in an
online course in a consistent manner. Even an asynchronous course that is built
around an any time/anywhere learning philosophy can be aided by asking stu-
dents to login at particular times each week or informing them that teacher mes-

432
                                                                                       Meloncon and Harris

sages or updates will occur on a regular and predictable schedule. A recent study
by Hilde Patron and Salvador Lopez (2011) has shown that consistency is a key
factor to student success: "Students who log in more frequently and with less
variation of minutes per day tend to get higher grades" (p. 6). One way to help
students develop consistent practices in completing online course work can be
accomplished by applying OWI Principle 11, which advocated for the construc-
tion of an online community to foster student success (pp. 23-24). Research
has shown that online students who feel a sense of community are more likely
to continue with the course (Ludwig-Harman & Dunlap, 2003; McCracken,
2004). Some ways that OWI faculty can inspire online community follow:

    · Create ice breaker exercises that allow students to get comfortable with
        each other as they explore the online environment or new tasks associated
        with the online environment.

    · Incorporate options such as blogging and expanded discussions that al-
        low students to continue conversations begun in discussion boards; do-
        ing so also may give them a more active voice in the course and encourage
        them to take control of their learning.

    · Provide students with an area where they can answer each other's ques-
        tions and/or share information in their own community of practice.

    An integral part of building community is for the instructor to be present,
demonstrate personal desire to interact with students, and model what online
interaction looks like. Unlike an onsite or hybrid class, where the instructor is
clearly present or not present, obviously interacting with students or maintain-
ing a distance from them, instructor presence is not always evident online. In
the OWC, students "see" their instructors through online profiles, participa-
tion in discussion boards, announcements and other general communications,
emails to students, audio/video files, and in synchronous activities (e.g., online
chats, voice and video activities, synchronous lectures, or asynchronous sessions
in the LMS). These activities--plus evaluated writing--are the only ways that
students know the teacher is present and actively working with them; uncertain-
ty about teacher-student connections may create anxiety or discomfort for some
students, which might prompt excessive emails as students seek connection and
instruction.

    Margaret Edwards, Beth Perry, and K. Katherine Janzen (2011) found that
students believed the best online instructors were those that engaged, demon-
strated interaction, and intervened at strategic moments. Embedded in OWI
Principle 11's effective practice examples is the concept of interactivity; teach-
ers should take "full advantage of the flexibility of electronic communications"
in helping students both effectively navigate the course and effectively become

                                                                                                 433
Preparing Students for OWI

writers (p. 13). Effective Practice 10.8 further recommended that "Students
should be apprised of the time teachers will require for formal or informal con-
ferences with teachers" (p. 23). Thus, teachers, as much as possible, should find
ways to be present with students through student teacher conferences and office
hours much as instructors would be in a face-to-face class.

    The difference in "presence" in an online class comes to the forefront here.
Not all OWI teachers are comfortable using the affordances of the LMS and
other online applications that allow synchronous communication with stu-
dents. Faculty who are present through asynchronous, written discussion boards
and comments or feedback on students papers rely on students accessing those
forms. In other words, in the asynchronous OWC, a student will only know if a
professor is present in the class if s/he reads discussion boards, accesses and reads
feedback, and checks his or her email or course messaging system. Changing
this dynamic is not difficult. From an anecdotal perspective, OWI teachers may
not realize how pleasantly surprising it can be to a student to receive even a very
brief chat communication when both happen to be online. Reaching out with
a friendly "hello" and "how is the class going for you?" on a synchronous text
chat can open the student to an interpersonal relationship with the teacher that
can be the difference between just surviving the term and thriving in the OWC.

Prepare Students for the Online Experience and for Academic Writing

    Most of us have heard instructors indicate that students are not prepared for
their online classes or that they believe that online courses will be less time-con-
suming or less difficult than onsite classes. Instructors also have reported that
there is a "misperception among students that online courses would demand
only that they log in once a week to get an assignment or provide a posting;
instructors reported that students often seem surprised at the level of interaction
and frequency of contact demanded by many courses" (Bozarth et al., 2004, p.
91). Often, students conflate online courses with independent study, self-paced,
or correspondence courses (see Chapter 12). Students also might have experi-
ences with introductory courses in other disciplines where assessment was a mul-
tiple-choice exam and courses required little writing or engagement. It is all too
easy for students to extrapolate a similar situation for OWI; indeed, anecdotally
speaking, we know that some teachers do teach their OWCs in just that man-
ner with papers substituting for exams and little-to-no interpersonal connection
developed. OWI Principle 7 was written to help OWI teachers move decidedly
away from such OWC structures (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013).

    Research has shown that students often do not realize the time and effort that
is involved in taking an online writing course. According to Heyman (2010),
while such concerns as student motivation may be outside of the control of

434
                                                                                       Meloncon and Harris

instructors and institutions, factors such as course structure and faculty support
can have positive impacts on student satisfaction and retention (see also Street,
2010). A way to mitigate competing expectations is to employ Effective Practice
10.5, which encourages instructors to complete "trial runs" to help students get
comfortable with the online environment (p. 22). These trial runs could be as
simple as sending out announcements encouraging students to complete either
the institutional- or instructor-created online orientations or as complex as ask-
ing students to post introductions and ask questions about the syllabus prior to
the first day of class. These sorts of exercises and expectations help to introduce
students to the online environment, the LMS, and the rigors of an online com-
munity that is essential in a writing course.

    One of the first class periods and exercises should focus on the demands of an
OWC. For example, many onsite writing courses provide a writing prompt for
in-class writing exercises. Students could be asked to read a short text, locate ad-
ditional information on the same topic, and then generate a short response text
that needs to be posted to the discussion board. This same work of a sample writ-
ing prompted by a specific thought or question can be imported to the online
environment. Hybrid courses may do this kind of writing in the onsite setting or
fully online depending on the teacher's goals. Such an assignment migration can
help to illustrate how difficult writing on the fly can be and encourage students
to set aside focused time for reading and writing for other course assignments.
This sort of immediate exercise helps to prepare students for the rigors of the
course and allows them to better assess whether they are ready for an OWC.

    In addition to preparing students before or in the early stages of the course,
following are some examples of effective practices that enable students to be suc-
cessful throughout the term. These examples build on Effective Practices 11.5
and 11.7 (p. 24). See Appendix 13.A directly following this chapter for an addi-
tional Student Preparation Checklist.

    · Incorporate elements into the course that reinforce information that stu-
        dents either should have learned in an orientation and/or that instructors
        believe students must know before they can take the course.

    · Include links to expand the syllabus.
    · Provide multiple and redundant entry points into assignments or little

        nuggets of information to which students can hyperlink, giving them
        individualized experience. Recycle these assignments and information as
        useful in the course.
    · Include multiple types and genres of assignments such a choose-your-
        own adventure, buffet-style learning that works really well online.
    · Use the course materials as a model for expectations of student perfor-
        mance (e.g., short video or audio that comments on their assignments

                                                                                                 435
Preparing Students for OWI

        that students can use as a model for peer review; commenting on a dis-
        cussion thread in the same way that you would want students to com-
        ment)
    · Create short exercises within the drop/add timeframe at your institu-
        tion that can help identify whether students are ready for the OWC. For
        example, students can be asked to find a specific article in the library
        databases, download it, attach it to an email, and submit it through a
        particular portal in the LMS. Then, they can be asked to write a summary
        of the article in the discussion board. Or, students can be asked to submit
        a short biography and post it to a specific place on the discussion board
        or class roster.
    · Create a short video that shows students where the pertinent information
        is on the course website and follow up with a short quiz in the LMS on
        information on the course structure and outcomes.
    · Create and post a page in the LMS that lists contact information for tech-
        nological problems. Most institutions have an IT office that deals with
        technology problems for the LMS or for student email. Locate resources
        either within your institution or that are available online outside the in-
        stitution that can help students with common problems. For example, it
        is likely that librarians have a tutorial on how to locate research resources
        (and it is possible that a librarian will agree to meet your class virtually).
    · Keep the technology as streamlined as possible. Students like multiple
        communicative channels, but they should be accessible without multiple
        logins or a series of different tools. Even if the LMS is not the perfect
        solution, it may be the best solution since students may have more fa-
        miliarity with it--particularly if the institution has done a good job of
        orienting them to the LMS or if they are online course frequent fliers.
    · Develop task-based or goal-oriented assignments and exercises.
    · Vary or add use of synchronous sessions in peer editing, OWLs, or office
        hours to appeal to students' different learning styles.

    Many of these examples are derived from advice offered by the CCCC OWI
Committee Expert/Stakeholders' Panel (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011d,
2012a, & 2012b).

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    No one-size-fits-all model exists for preparing students to take an OWC be-
cause students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, experiences, and ability
levels. Student diversity means that OWI teachers have little control over being
fully prepared to address each student's past experiences and current motivation.

436
                                                                                       Meloncon and Harris

    WPAs and their OWI teachers need to be vigilant in creating courses and
program environments that prepare students to be successful. We can say with
some confidence that being a successful online learner actually is not terribly dif-
ferent from being a successful face-to-face learner, yet there are areas of concern
that must be addressed. To that end, to ensure students' success in online cours-
es, institutions and instructors must prepare students for this experience (OWI
Principle 10); they must create a sense of community (OWI Principle 11); and
they must provide adequate support structures and resources (OWI Principle
13) (pp. 21-24, 26-28). Moreover, course design and content always should start
with accessibility (OWI Principle 1, p. 7). Practices that we have found to be
most successful at preparing online students include:

    · Reaching out to students prior to the start of class to ensure that they
        understand the type of course and the workload of the course.

    · Providing students with a technological and a personal self-assessment so
        they can adequately gauge their own preparation for an OWC.

    · Providing students an online orientation to the technology, which should
        be done both at the institutional level (for technology and general online
        learning strategies) and the course level (for OWI-specific learning strate-
        gies). In both of these orientations, the specialized needs of students with
        disabilities must be covered.

    · Offering students a detailed view of the structure of the course and course
        expectations.

    · Creating a course that adheres to accessibility guidelines (see Chapters
        8, 9, & 10)

    Finally, writing studies needs additional empirical research (OWI Principle
15, pp. 31-32) across multiple institutions that bring students' expectations,
experiences, and needs into the research process. In the evolution of OWCs,
writing studies badly needs additional information in order to answer the ques-
tion of how to prepare and empower students with a range of abilities to succeed
in OWCs.

         Are you able to accomplish tasks and assignments with little oversight?
         Are you using any adaptive or assistive technology to access your on-
           line courses that require additional help from your instructor?
         Do you need consistent reminders?
         Are you able to manage your time well so you're not waiting until the
           last minute?

    · Know your technology.
         Know what kind of hardware and software that you have and what
           you may need.

         If you use assistive technology, does it work well with the campus
           websites?

    · Know your LMS.
         Most institutions will offer online courses within the LMS.
         Take time to become familiar with the LMS by completing an ori-
           entation (if available), attending a training session, scheduling a time
           with someone at the technology center, or scheduling a time with your
           instructor to walk through the particulars of the system.

CHAPTER 14

PREPARING FOR THE
RHETORICITY OF OWI

Kevin Eric DePew
Old Dominion University

This chapter, directed to both instructors and students, addresses OWI as
a digital rhetoric with all of the political and ideological dimensions of a
rhetoric. As instructors and students prepare for OWI, they need to look
beyond the functionality of the technologies used to teach the class and
learn how to read them rhetorically. For instructors and students, digital
rhetoric is applied in the production of instructional communication (i.e.,
the strategies these individuals use to communicate about policies and
course content through the mediating technologies) and course content
(i.e., what students are learning to produce in OWI classes). This chapter
addresses the rhetorical features that OWI instructors should be aware of
and how they can reasonably impart this awareness upon their students,
particularly in light of OWI Principles 1 and 2.

Keywords: applied rhetoric, digital rhetoric, functional literacy, critical
literacy, rhetorical literacy

    To describe the practices of teaching and learning in OWI as applications
of digital rhetoric would hardly be provocative to many stakeholders and ob-
servers of these courses. However, I argue that the uncontroversial nature of this
description correlates with the way the term digital rhetoric typically is applied
to any practice using digital tools, such as the computers and--increasingly--
mobile devices (see Chapter 16) commonly used to mediate OWI. While such
an application of this term acknowledges that all communication can be rhetori-
cally construed, it often de-emphasizes the potentially persuasive and ideological
nature of this communication. In other words, rhetoric almost becomes synony-
mous with use in these situations. But digital rhetoric--or applied rhetoric using
digital technologies as it often is connoted in this chapter--should signify how
an interlocutor considers to use digital tools when choosing the best available
means of persuasion (to draw upon the Aristotelian definition) and how to use
their affordances. Or, even in the absence of digital technologies, the interlocu-
tor considers how digital tools can still influence one's means to be persuasive.

Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

Indeed, OWCs--to include FYW--should be perceived and taught as applied
rhetoric courses that use digital technology to mediate interaction between in-
structors and students.

    Others who have examined the rhetorical nature of digital communication
echoed the sentiments of this definition. James P. Zappen (2005), rather than
define digital rhetoric, acknowledged that it is "an amalgam of more-or-less dis-
crete components rather than a complete and integrated theory in its own right.
These discrete components nonetheless provide at least a partial outline for such
a theory, which has potential to contribute to the larger body of rhetorical theory
and criticism and the rhetoric of science and technology in particular" (p. 323).
To understand digital rhetoric is to understand the relationship between many
different technologies and the myriad of ways that arguments get made. Because
there are so many different ways that these components can be put together to
create both effective and ineffective arguments, it becomes difficult to identify
what exactly digital rhetoric is. Furthermore, the technological components have
expanded writers' capabilities to communicate multimodally, and thus argue in
new ways (see Chapter 15). As a result, the emphasis of digital rhetoric seems
to be shifting toward an emphasis on the digital writing tools that afford the
capability to compose multimodally. In a special issue of Computers & Composi-
tion entitled "Digital Rhetoric, Digital Literacy, Computers and Composition,"
guest editor Carolyn Handa (2001) also did not define digital rhetoric, but she
argued, "incorporating digital elements into writing--especially in the form of
Web pages and multimedia projects--demands that we draw on our knowledge
of rhetoric perhaps even more than our knowledge of HTML, design issues, or
graphics software. Images and sounds are rhetorical" (p. 2). For Handa, the tech-
nology is less important than both the message and the deliberate strategies one
adopts to compose said message. However, recognizing the rapid rise of technol-
ogies that somewhat easily allow writers to incorporate visuals and sounds into
their text, Handa emphasized that writers cannot lose sight of these elements'
rhetorical nature. In short, "digital rhetoric" is not just about the use of digital
communicative technologies.

    In instructional contexts, the art of persuasion is prevalent, not just in the
work students do in their writing courses but in their everyday interactions.
Both instructors and students are constantly persuading each other. Among the
many arguments that instructors make, they typically want to convince stu-
dents that the subject matter is important, that their version of the subject mat-
ter is more accurate than competing theories, and that they are using the best
approaches to help students understand the subject matter. Students, likewise,
want to persuade instructors; they mostly argue for their capabilities to retain
and apply what they have learned with hopes of leveraging this argument for a

446
                                                                                                        DePew

favorable assessment and/or recommendation. Moreover, if writing instruction
is understood to be the teaching of applied rhetoric, the students, whether they
understand it or not, are learning how to make such arguments in the cours-
es they take. James Berlin (1982) wanted writing studies to accept that, "[i]n
teaching writing, we are not simply offering training in useful technical skill
that is meant as a simple complement to the more important studies of other
areas. We are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and
making sense of it" (p. 776). Writing instructors are teaching students how to
interact with the world around them using various semiotic systems--how they
are shaped by others' use of these semiotics and how they can shape others.

    In the context of OWI, especially in fully online OWCs, the means by which
instructors and students make arguments mostly is mediated by digital tech-
nologies and delivered through writing, even though the multimodal nature
of many Web technologies does expand one's repertoires for making these ar-
guments. Whether instructors and students choose to communicate textually
with linguistic symbols or through other modalities, the actual technologies they
use to communicate impacts the ways they can and do communicate. These
contextual conditions positions the first two principles of A Position Statement
of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI's (CCCC OWI Commit-
tee, 2013) as crucial guidelines for what instructors do in their courses. OWI
Principle 1 reminds course designers to consider who will be taught and OWI
Principle 2 reminds them about what needs to be taught. While administrators
and instructors should clearly want OWCs to be accessible to all students, de-
ciding the role the technology will play in the course is less straightforward and
has to be context-dependent. OWI Effective Practice 7.2 stated that those who
teach OWI should be hired for their expertise in writing because they are teach-
ing a writing course (p. 18). However, when most writing in our contemporary
age is composed and delivered with digital technologies, can instruction ignore
the material conditions of our writing practices? This is not an easy question
to answer, especially when an OWI technology's role often depends upon local
institutional and programmatic resources, including, but not limited to what
technologies are available, the OWI faculty's competencies with various digital
technologies, and the knowledge of the rhetorical connections between writing
and writing technologies.

    Each of these technologies has affordances, or programmer-designed capabil-
ities, that prescribe how the user should use it (see Chapter 11). The problem is
that these programmer-designed features become transparent to many users--
instructors and students alike--who naturalize them as inherent parts of the
technology rather than the product of other people's decisions--an individual
or an organization with ideological worldviews (Stone, 2001). Specifically the

                                                                                                 447
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

influences on designers and users range from Hollywood to the mass media to
government agencies to educational institutions (Selber, 2004, p. 150). Unfor-
tunately, many instructors and students are unaware how the rhetorical deci-
sions of the corporations, teams, and individuals who write and design their
digital technologies shape the ways they can communicate and, therefore, con-
struct arguments. It is only when they experience a cryptic error message meant
to be deciphered by "computer experts" that they become hyper-aware of these
decisions that others have made (Selber, 2004). Arguably, the digitally mediated
interaction between OWI participants, predominantly writing, is high stakes
and has consequences to both the students' well-being (e.g., the ways that suc-
cess in class can be leveraged for institutional and/or career success) and instruc-
tors' well-being (e.g., the ways that instructional success can be leveraged for job
security, promotion, and/or financial reward). Making these arguments some-
times becomes more complicated for instructors and students who have physical
or learning disabilities, who have a non-native command of English, who can
only access technologies for OWI during certain times and at certain places,
or whose technologies' limited capabilities provides diminished access to the
OWC. Even those who rarely or never experience these issues should understand
that individuals with these challenges will comprise a segment of their audience.
Therefore, instructors and students alike can benefit from developing an aware-
ness of the digital technology's influence on their communication. The question
becomes where and when in the program and course design do the stakeholders
incorporate this metacognition? To cover the widest swath of OWI participants,
the teaching of digital rhetoric should start with instructor preparation because
they, in turn, have the opportunity to impart this wisdom on their students.

    To build upon the work of the three previous chapters in this section (see
Chapters 11, 12, & 13), especially those that focus on instructor preparation, I
position teacher preparation, and by extension student preparation, as primarily
a response to A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices
for OWI's first two principles, respectively OWI Principle 2 about designing
curricula that emphasizes that OWCs are primarily about learning how to write
rather than learning how to use the technology and OWI Principle 1 about
making OWCs accessible and inclusive. Discussing Principle 2 before Principle
1 does not deprioritize issues of inclusivity and accessibility; instead it helps to
frame these access concerns as practical and rhetorical issues about connecting
with one's audience. Using an Aristotelian foundation for writing instruction,
I juxtapose the institutional realities that many writing programs face with the
ideals the field advocates as a way to address what we should be preparing faculty
and students for before and during the OWI course. Stuart Selber's (2004) the-
ories of multiliteracy, especially his treatment of the concepts functional literacy

448

and rhetorical literacy, provide useful vocabulary for discussing and contextually
prioritizing the lessons that need to be learned to make OWI successful and the
lessons that educators want instructors and students to learn in order to foster
an outcome of rhetorically aware students and citizens. In the second part of
the chapter, I highlight the principles in the OWI Statement that help to justify
developing a rhetorical understanding of the technology among the OWI facul-
ty and students, as well as exemplifying possible practices for developing these
understandings.

FUNCTIONAL AWARENESS VERSUS RHETORICAL
AWARENESS

    A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI's
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) second principle stated that "an online writing
course should focus on writing and not on technology orientation or teach-
ing students how to use learning and other technologies" (p. 11). As Beth L.
Hewett acknowledges in Chapter 1, this principle is a strained union between
two schools of thought. One school of thought prioritizes protecting both in-
structors and students. These advocates acknowledge the OWI should be more
about "writing" than about being "online" and mediated through computer
technologies. As a result, the curricular goals should be teaching students how to
"invent the university" (Bartholomae, 1985) in the introductory (FYW) writing
courses and teaching them how to communicate within their discipline's dis-
course in more advanced and writing-intensive disciplinary courses. Therefore,
WPAs, when recruiting from a pool of highly qualified writing instructors (OWI
Principle 7, Effective Practice 7.2), should not expect these instructors also to be
digital technology experts. Rather these instructors should be taught how to use
the computer technologies they need to competently manage the course and ful-
fill their institution's guidelines for writing instruction. The students, similarly,
should be expected to learn the conventions of various discourse communities
rather than how to use an array of applications, many they may never use again.
Furthermore, students should not be asked to make potentially burdensome fi-
nancial or time expenditures related to technology to participate in their writing
courses.

    The other school of thought contends that writing instruction is the teaching
of applied rhetoric. Therefore, the instructor is responsible for extensively teach-
ing students the available means of persuasion. Included among these means
is the canon of delivery, so increasing both the writing students' repertoire of
delivery modes, or writing technologies, and expanding their understanding of
these writing tools' affordances increases the available means for them.1 A writer

                                                                                                 449
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

with a vast array of rhetorical strategies can best approximate their audiences' ex-
pectations, and, arguably, have a greater chance of being successfully persuasive.
Students in these types of classes, as a result, are prepared in their writing courses
how to respond to different types of rhetorical situations rather than having
finite amount of prescribed strategies.

    Although scholars, instructors, and administrators who subscribe to these
schools of thought can become very entrenched in their positions, the schools
of thought, of course, are not mutually exclusive and can overlap in practice in
many ways. Writing programs can design courses that teach students how to
meet the expectations of their discourse communities through the writing and
pre-writing that they do with various digital technologies. Also, some scholars
maintain that instructors can use some multimodal composing technologies as a
scaffold for teaching students rhetorical strategies they can use to participate in
academic and disciplinary discourse communities, especially when working with
multilingual writers (DePew, 2011; DePew & Miller-Cochran, 2010).

    Resources, especially when limited, often prevent these positions from be-
ing reconciled. While some institutions can keep pace with the latest hardware
and software innovations, other institutions do not have a lot of technology,
have old and/or poorly maintained hardware and software, and/or experience
incompatibility between the hardware and software. Some of these issues can
be addressed with free software, but only if the applications are compatible with
the computers and the institution will allow these applications to be placed on
their computers. There is also the question as to whether among an institution's
resources are faculty who have been appropriately prepared to use the technol-
ogy and then to teach students how to compose with an expanded repertoire
of writing technologies (see OWI Principle 7). Institutions also must negotiate
how to address instructor preparation with the technology. Some institutions
have robust IT departments, but they may cater to "sage-on-the-stage" para-
digms that are discouraged for writing courses (DePew & Lettner-Rust, 2009,
p. 180) or they may be focused strictly on the LMS that may or may not be
appropriate for OWI. Other institutions will customize this technology prepa-
ration within the writing program. But even if instructors are learning how to
operate various applications to teach OWCs, they may not be learning how to
think about the rhetorical implication of these writing technologies--an issue
that can be exacerbated when technologies, like the present generation of LMSs,
provide little contextual information for blind users who cannot adequately ac-
cess the technology to understand its rhetorical nature. Anecdotally, there are
many institutions that offer OWI populated with faculty who think about the
technology much more functionally than rhetorically. If the administrators and
the OWI faculty do not value a rhetorical knowledge, then it cannot be impart-

ed upon the students. And this state of writing pedagogy, arguably, precipitates
from institutional attitudes that writing itself is a functional rather than a rhe-
torical technology.

    While most would perceive that advantages of expertise and resources would
favor four-year institutions over two-year institutions and private institutions
over public institutions, the realities are sometimes different. These issues that
institutions with very limited resources face are not just challenges for various
types of hybrid OWCs that help provide student access to OWI (see Chapter 2),
but in the fully online OWC these issues can limit how instructors learn how to
teach and how they can mediate their course. So, due to these limited resources,
two positions that seemingly can reach a compromise often remain contested.
The student body also needs to be considered. Just as some campuses have more
students who have developed adept literate practices, others have significant stu-
dent populations who struggle with various aspects of reading and writing; the
same can be said about students and their technology skills. And the students
who excel or struggle with their literate behaviors are not necessarily the same
ones who excel or struggle with the technology. Furthermore, the resources to
help these disparate students at different campuses are rarely equal. A Position
Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI has been written
to create the most effective literacy learning conditions for all students taking
an OWC, whether they are honors students at a well-funded, well-regarded,
research-rich, four-year institution or developmental writers at an underfunded,
provincially known, single-building community college. Since these clearly are
different contexts, individual institutions have to work within their given pa-
rameters to create the most effective experiences for all students. In other words,
student populations also have to be an important indicator of the appropriate-
ness of an "ideal" digital rhetoric approach.

    Due to all of these factors, the space to create this compromise often feels
as big as the eye of a needle--a narrow space in which administrators and in-
structors invested in OWI have to negotiate between designing practices that
are most pedagogically sound for an applied rhetoric course and designing prac-
tices based upon the resources, knowledge, and culture that comprise their in-
stitutional realities. In many instances, it is difficult to thread this needle, and
institutions often do the best they can to offer sound writing instruction with
the realities that their institutions offer. When all-types of higher educational in-
stitutions--four-year, two-year, public, private, and for-profit institutions--are
considered, a functional approach to writing and digital technologies appears
to dominate the OWI landscape. Therefore, to provide a different, and maybe
unfamiliar, perspective, this chapter primarily advocates for strategies to design
OWI as applied rhetoric courses using digital technologies.

                                                                                                 451
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

    Selber's (2004) descriptions of functional and rhetorical approaches to tech-
nologies help to explain the functional/rhetorical tension that is inherent in A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI's (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013) second principle. In Multiliteracies for a Digital Age,
Selber (2004) challenged his audience to understand that technological educa-
tion entails more than learning the tools' operational functions. Supporting Neil
Postman's (1995) argument that teaching technologies is a humanities-based
endeavor, Selber (2004) warned that "simply understanding the mechanics of
computing, particularly in decontextualized ways, will not prepare students and
teachers for the challenges of literacy in the twenty-first century" (p. 2). He
stated that although this mechanical approach to teaching technology will foster
"some extremely useful skills" within these students, he believed they "will have a
much more difficult time thinking critically, contextually, and historically about
the ways that computer technologies are developed and used within our culture,
and how such use, in turn, intersects with writing and communication prac-
tices in the classroom" (p. 9). And one also can include contexts outside of the
classroom. The situation Selber described is exacerbated in the OWC context
because whether the course is hybrid or fully online (see Chapter 2), the students
not only have to interact with the digital technologies, but they must interact
with other people--especially those who have authority over them--through
the technologies. Therefore, through this critical, contextual, and historical anal-
ysis of one's digital writing tools, writers may begin to understand how they can
adapt the tools for their own purposes, which in the OWC can have immediate
communicative consequences.

    To paraphrase Selber, those who subscribe to the perspective that technolo-
gies are simply instruments also tend to fully embrace them as panaceas or reject
them as a social cancer. These digital technologies, according to Selber, are much
more complex than overblown pronouncement of their potential. The "hype,"
whether supporting or vilifying these tools, ignores that "computer technolo-
gies are aligned with competitive and oppressive formations that tend to shore
up rather than address existing social inequalities" (p. 12). The stakeholders,
too immersed in the commonplaces about technology, rarely are prompted to
challenge these ubiquitous arguments. But, as Andrew Feenberg (1991) taught,
the digital technologies are never neutral. And despite the "kumbaya rhetoric"
of global equality that digital corporations use to sell their wares, at the end of
the day these companies need to turn a profit, so they design their hardware and
write their applications to appeal to hegemonic values and aesthetics (Selfe &
Selfe, 1994; Stone, 2001). Therefore, any adoption of these products by higher
education institutions to mediate online instruction--often through long-term
contracts perceived to be lucrative investments--positions instructors as agents

452

of these inequalities. For example, instructors at my institution were asked to
participate in a pilot of three different LMSs. Two were corporate products and
one was freeware, and my institution's IT department, based upon a confluence
of factors, chose to retain the ubiquitous LMS program it had already been us-
ing. Despite this decision, the institution responsibly gave the instructors from
across the curriculum an opportunity to test the different programs with their
respective courses and decide which was the most effective product for their cur-
ricular goals. But many institutions, based upon my conversations with peers in
field, do not solicit this type of feedback and choose programs for their instruc-
tors respective of how conducive they are for writing instruction.

    Even though some instructors will use or supplement instruction with other
digital applications, instructors and students--in some instructional contexts--
can make choices about how they use these technologies. For example, given the
choice, should an instructor ask students to build a blog with the institutional
LMS or using another online program? From one perspective, using an LMS
complies with A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices
for OWI's Effective Practice 10.7: "In most cases, teachers should make use of the
institutionally approved software and/or LMS on which students are prepared
for the OWC" (p. 22). The CCCC OWI Committee privileged colleges' and
universities' LMS because these programs, built into the institutional infrastruc-
ture, often are widely employed and supported by IT in their contexts, which,
therefore, reifies their presence and accessibility. In effect, when the institution's
LMS is used, the playing field is level for all students--except those for whom
access to the LMS has not been provided adequately--a critical issue that always
needs attention, as Chapter 8 details. Examined from another perspective, the
CCCC OWI Committee also recognized that LMSs, for some students and
instructors, can limit inclusivity and accessibility insofar as they may be poorly
designed. My students have described our campus' LMS as not being as intuitive
as popular program's interfaces, and my peers complain about its inefficiency.
Indeed, writing instructors often realize quickly that the LMS was not developed
with writing instruction in mind. Furthermore, because other blogging pro-
grams exist outside the LMS, the instructor for many good pedagogical reasons
(as suggested by Effective Practice 7.2), may prefer these programs because they
afford students the potential of a real audience for their writing.

    The CCCC OWI Committee also understood that some "composition
teachers may desire to bring additional, often free, software into the OWC," but
if they choose to do this, "they should: (1) have a clear pedagogical rationale for
doing so; (2) have appropriate permission to do so; (3) make sure that it is ac-
cessible to all students; and (4) prepare students adequately for the change and/
or addition to the LMS" (pp. 22-23). OWI instructors, and in some cases their

                                                                                                 453
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

WPAs, have to balance many challenges to make difficult decisions. In the case
of choosing between the LMS and an outside software, should the instructor
create a course in which all course features are contained within a LMS, a single
and presumably familiar program? Or should OWI instructors also incorporate
programs with affordances that differently support their pedagogical goals (e.g.,
using outside software that is not password-protected like an LMS and allows
writers to push their works to outside, more "real" audiences) and choose the
non-LMS program? These stakeholders also have to weigh other considerations.
With both programs, students concede ownership of their texts to the institu-
tion or corporation. Does the instructor or do the students know the implica-
tions of this often unspoken requirement? Also, do these stakeholders consider
the pedagogical and ethical implications of the privacy the LMS affords versus
the access to outside audiences that outside software affords? And do the instruc-
tors understand how making these decisions disadvantages some students and
privileges others? Answering these questions and making these decisions are not
easy, but that is exactly why administrators and instructors need to understand
the implications of these issues and be involved in the decision-making process
for selecting OWI technologies.

    These arguments often go unchallenged in courses that teach students how
to use these technologies. Citing Don Byrd and Derek Owens (1998), Sel-
ber (2004) emphasized how the technologies' potential for generating hybrid
forms often goes unrealized; instead, the technologies often are used to reify
entrenched ideological positions (pp. 137-138). Considering that most higher
education computer literacy requirements are "monolithic and one-dimension-
al" and ignore "the fact that computer technologies are embedded in a wide
range of constitutive contexts, as well as entangled in value systems" (p. 22),
it is understandable that students simply accept these commonplaces as truth.
In other words, when institutions present digital technologies to students, they
also need to provide students with heuristics, yet these questions need to move
beyond "How do I use this technology?" to "What does this technology want
me to do?" and "Why?" Selber contended that "critique is certainly one crucial
aspect of any computer literacy program, for it encourages a cultural awareness
of power structures. But students must also be able to use computers effectively
as well as participate in the construction and reconstruction of technological
systems" (p. 7). This is the pivot point where function and rhetoric merge. By
understanding how an application's affordances reifies certain social values, such
as the hierarchical structure of most meeting software or the playful applications
in social media, the users, whether instructors or students, can understand who
the application designer thinks they are or who they want them to be. Only
with this knowledge can users then accept the affordances on their own terms or

454
                                                                                                        DePew

appropriate the affordances for their own purposes.
    Therefore, a complete rhetorical education of computer technologies entails

the operational functions, an understanding of the technology as an artifact of
power dynamics, and the opportunity to conceptualize new ways to design these
technologies--arguably an act of empowerment. To this end, Selber proposed
a multiliteracy education that covers functional, critical, and rhetorical litera-
cies. One of the ways that Selber defined these literacies is through how each
respectively positions the individual: "students as users of technologies, students
as questioners of technology, and students as producers of technology" (p. 25).
Although the students' agencies seem to increase favorably as one moves from
functional literacy through critical literacy to rhetorical literacy, Selber clearly
argued that there is no hierarchy among these different computer literacies and
students need to be competent in all three (p. 24).

    Selber (2004) came closest to defining rhetorical literacy when he said, "Rhe-
torical literacy concerns the design and evaluation of online environments; thus
students who are rhetorically literate can effect change in technological systems.
Students should not just be effective users of computers, nor should they be just
informed questioners" (p. 182). A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI's (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) OWI Principle 2
warned administrators and instructors about designing "writing courses" that fo-
cus on functional literacy to the exclusion of writing, that require OWI teachers
to become technology specialists, or that focus the course curriculum on teach-
ing how to compose with an array of writing technologies rather than how to
effectively communicate within various discourse communities, especially those
valued in the academy. Yet, a rhetorical literacy corresponds with this principle
by teaching students how to use and adapt the technologies most effectively to
produce desired texts. To help his audience understand rhetorical literacy, Selber
(2004) established its parameters. Where functional literacy aims at effective
practice and critical literacy aims at informed critique, rhetorical literacy aims
at reflective praxis or a "thoughtful integration" between the two former litera-
cies (pp. 25, 145). Additionally, Selber presented four other terms--persuasion,
deliberation, reflection, social action--that round out the rhetorical literacies'
parameters. As one uses these concepts to sketch an outline for what rhetorical
literacy can be, it becomes apparent that rhetorically literate students see the
devices' and applications' interfaces as not only texts produced by ideological
bodies that need to be read and negotiated, but such interfaces also are potential
entry points for users to become social actors in the design and use of interfaces.
For example, Selber explained that hypertext was supposed to empower its read-
ers by giving them choices about how they will read a text. Yet, despite the af-
fordances that allow readers to choose their own path through a site, or, for that

                                                                                                 455
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

matter, compose multiple paths through a site, the metaphor of the linear text
still guides most production and reception practices. Selber advocated teaching
students how to read the metaphor that guide one's practices paying attention to
both the "presences" and the "absences" (pp. 179-182).

    An example of the praxis Selber advocated can be found in the "Tech" sec-
tion of Time magazine from August 2013. Elinia Dockterman (2013) described
the different ways that mobile technology users in specific contexts are "appjack-
ing," or finding "presences" to repurpose applications for local and potentially
unintended purposes. Examples Dockterman included were using Instagram to
sell sheep in Kuwait, using LinkedIn for promoting prostitution, and employing
Vine to create six-second video résumés (p. 16). While these activities range
from the illegal to the practical, they demonstrate what a user can do if they
understand what a digital technology allows them to do (critical), knows how
to do it (functional), and adapts the digital technology for the argument (i.e.,
"Buy my product," "Hire me") the users wants to make (rhetorical). These users
essentially have "hacked" these applications by reading their affordances and
successfully adopting them for purposes that programmers may not have origi-
nally intended.

    To adapt this type of learning to the writing classroom does not mean that
the instructor is forgoing the teaching of linguistic-based writing to have stu-
dents play with social media sites and mobile phone apps. Instead, particularly
when this type of exploration is part-and-parcel of the writing course objectives,
such adaptation means that instructors are designing writing pedagogies that
allow students to choose the purposes for their own texts and they are help-
ing their students choose the best available means (i.e., digital technologies) to
achieve that purpose. While, I am not arguing that OWC instructors should be
teaching their students how to be hackers, I believe instructors--because stu-
dents have to use digital technologies to communicate with their instructors and
the institution--need to learn how to teach students how to use the sanctioned
technologies of the course to compose successful arguments, which may take
varied forms. With many students taking courses online, there is a good chance
that the strategies they learn for making arguments to their instructors will not
just be applied to the general education writing course; ideally they will also be
used for courses in the students' major or certificate programs, as well as contexts
outside the academy.

    Advocating that instructors learn how the technological tools' design in-
fluences a writer's composition would seem to contradict the OWI Principle
2--"an online writing course should focus on writing and not on technology
orientation or teaching students how to use learning and other technologies" (p.
13). This principle, however, was written to guide instructors away from using

456
                                                                                                        DePew

their own and the students' resources, particularly time (and possibly money),
just to teach students how to use the technologies that they need to participate
in the class or to provide a plethora of outside technologies that reflect teachers'
preferences over the LMS. In the latter case particularly, teachers risk a rela-
tively leveled playing field through common and presumably accessible LMS
technology for additional technologies that can be unnecessary in an OWC, as
addressed in OWI Principle 1. In other words, the instructor should not need to
begin a course with a unit about how to use the campus' LMS or ask students
to use outside technologies that an LMS would address unless a similar tech-
nology's affordances facilitate an instructor's pedagogical goals to teach specific
rhetorical applications (see earlier discussion about LMS blogs versus non-LMS
blogs). OWI Principle 10 placed that responsibility of basic LMS student-prepa-
ration on the institution's IT unit even though the same principle indicated that
OWI instructors should reify and repeat LMS skills and strategies relevant to
using it for writing and learning to write in the course.

    Instead, OWI Principle 2 made clear that the course should remain focused
on writing instruction--of which rhetorical understanding certainly is key.
The rationale for OWI Principle 2 (further explained in Chapter 1) also stat-
ed, "Unlike a digital rhetoric course, an OWC is not considered to be a place
for stretching technological skills as much as for becoming stronger writers in
various selected genres" (p. 11). A digital rhetoric course, narrowly defined, of-
ten teaches students a wide array of writing technologies (e.g., Web authoring,
image editing, video editing) with a focus on how each technology taught can
help students make the arguments they are composing or will compose for a
specific purpose. For example, in such a course, one might want to teach stu-
dents how to code a Web page so that they have more control over the outcome's
design than if they chose to use a pre-designed template. But an applied rhetoric
course, such as FYW, that is mediated by digital technologies (i.e., OWI), takes
advantage of the course's material conditions, whether fully online or hybrid, to
teach students real lessons about writing with digital technologies. Unlike the
narrowly defined digital rhetoric course, learning methods of digital delivery is
secondary to learning how to negotiate one's purpose with one's target audience.

    OWI Principle 2 did not indicate, however, that instructors and students
should not develop a meta-awareness of the ways that writing technologies in-
fluence the messages they compose. If all writing courses are applied rhetoric
courses, then teaching digital rhetoric, more broadly defined as a way to get
students to think about how writing technologies influence the message they
compose--for both course assignments and course communication--is appro-
priate in online writing-focused courses. In such OWCs, allowing students to
use templates is a suitable pedagogical method; however, instructors also may

                                                                                                 457
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

fold into their lessons a critical reading of these templates, urging students to
analyze what these prescribed designs allow and do not allow them to compose.
Likewise students can be taught to speculate why they think such templates were
designed in particular ways and who the designers think their audiences are.

    While some might argue that the writing classroom should be more focused
on linguistic productions than cultural readings of the world or of digital tech-
nology, I argue that the instructors and students can learn to be better producers
of texts when they, like the technology designers, have a better understanding of
their audience. Instructors and students often produce texts for homogeneous
audiences assuming that those with whom they are communicating have an
idealized standard of linguistic and technological access to the texts they pro-
duce (e.g., assignments sheets, assignments submitted, communication between
the instructor or students). This resonates with Paul Matsuda's (2006) myth
of linguistic homogeneity that Susan Miller Cochran describes in Chapter 9.
Therefore, by prompting instructors and students to anticipate different audi-
ences with diverse needs, it becomes an imperative that they understand how the
technologies they use also impact their audiences' access to and understanding
of their texts.

    A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI's
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) OWI Principle 1 addressed this imperative.
This overarching principle--"Online writing instruction should be universal-
ly inclusive and accessible" (p. 7)--exemplified the need for OWI instructors'
work to be grounded in digital rhetoric; this principle reminds them that they
have to consider all audiences while communicating through digital technolo-
gies. More specifically the principle's rationale argued that issues of inclusivity
and accessibility should "supersede[s] and connect[s] to every principle" in A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI, which
makes disability, linguistic, and socioeconomic difference primary consider-
ations when courses are designed and delivered (p. 7). The CCCC OWI Com-
mittee rationalized that "addressing the accessibility needs of the least confident
readers increases the potential to reach all types of learners" (p. 7). As with the
onsite, face-to-face classroom, the presence of these diverse student audiences
means that the instructor cannot simply prepare for a homogeneous audience
that one can expect will experience the course the same way: "given [OWI's]
inherent connection to technology; patterns of exclusion have too often resulted
from an uncritical adoption of digital technology and an indifference to how it
could be used by persons with various disabilities and learning challenges" (p. 8).
Instead, instructors have to think about the impact their strategies for commu-
nicating with students, especially the technologies that they choose, has on these
diverse student populations. Because this principle guides all of A Position State-

458
                                                                                                        DePew

ment of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI principles and example
effective practices, it demonstrates the importance of reaching a wide student
audience. While each OWI course will have general pedagogical goals, "OWI
teachers should determine their uses of modality and media based not only on
[these] goals but also on their students' likely strengths and access" (p. 9). How-
ever, to connect to this audience, the OWI instructor needs to know (1) how
students expect to experience the texts they produce, (2) what technologies they,
as faculty, have access to when communicating with and teaching this audience,
and (3) how they best can use the technologies to meet their audiences' needs.
Again, instructors who develop strategies for implementing these practices are
better positioned to teach them to their students.

    Students, likewise, have to consider similar heuristics when communicating
with instructors, other students, and audiences beyond the classroom. These
strategies should be adopted both when communicating with the diverse stu-
dent body of the class en masse and when interacting with diverse individuals
on a one-to-one basis. In an OWC designed to promote interaction among the
students, they not only will have to learn effective strategies for communicating
with each other; many also will need to learn how to use the same or similar tech-
nologies effectively to communicate with people with whom they work (and, we
should not overlook, play) outside of the academic context. Many homogeneous
and diverse FYW students, based upon the assumptions I have heard them artic-
ulate about their peers, believe that the student audiences they write for are just
like them. It is only when students are physically marked by their disability, such
as with blindness or limited motor skills, that their peers tend to acknowledge
and try to accommodate their different audiences. Indeed, students tend to be
less aware or sympathetic about linguistic diversity and often do not consider
how "invisible" disabilities (e.g., dyslexia, Asperger's Disorder), multilingual is-
sues, and socioeconomic problems might affect their audiences. Although these
can be difficult and touchy conversations to have with students--particularly
online where asynchronous text or audio/video might lead teachers to feel like
they are lecturing students rather than talking with them--the instructor can
design research and writing assignments that ask students to understand issues
of access and inclusivity in the class or in other writing contexts as a way to raise
their consciousness regarding how the technologies help or hinder with the ways
they digitally communicate with others (see the appendix to this chapter for
more details about such an assignment).

INSTRUCTOR PREPARATION

    Instructors clearly need to take the lead in understanding the rhetorical na-

                                                                                                 459
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

ture of writing technologies in order to use their knowledge to teach students to
develop such awareness. Therefore, faculty preparation is a writing program's best
opportunity for inserting elements of digital rhetoric into the OWI curriculum.
Faculty preparation for writing instruction, in its many forms (e.g., pre-semes-
ter orientations, in-service meetings and workshops, and graduate coursework),
often occupies the more practical side of the theory/practice continuum. Due
to limited resources and time, those who lead and design instructor prepara-
tion must decide which strategies and what knowledge instructors most need to
soundly teach students strategies for effective written communication as well as
how to manage a classroom environment. As I can attest from my conversations
with professors and administrators who prepare writing faculty, they--given the
limited time, and sometimes new instructor's inexperience--(sometimes) choose
to emphasize helping the instructors get through the daily business even though
they strongly believe that all instructors teaching their own courses should learn
how to theorize the curriculum and policies they design or have assigned to
them. In-service instructors are begging for this level of help in order to get
through the next class session. Similarly, for OWI courses, those who prepare the
faculty, in addition to teaching faculty how to impart the curriculum and man-
age the course, have to ready these instructors for the digital technologies that
will mediate all of this work (see Chapters 11 & 12). To answer why instructors
and, by extension, students are not learning a rhetorical digital literacy, the an-
swer emerges primarily from the decisions WPAs and others who prepare faculty
make regarding expending resources, especially time (see Chapters 6 & 7, for
example). Unfortunately often, when resources are limited, teaching instructors
about the rhetorical theories that inform their literacy education practices seems
extra-curricular. Yet, if administrators would emphasize that any writing course
is an applied rhetoric course, then those WPAs who prepare OWI instructors to
teach writing and the instructors who teach the student strategies for effective
writing can fold these practices into preparation and curricular design that an-
ticipate the rhetorical nature of writing technologies. Several principles from A
Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2013) justify this preparation.

    OWI Principle 7 specifically considered instructor and administrator prepa-
ration; it stated, "Writing Program Administrators (WPAs) for OWI programs
and their online writing teachers should receive appropriate OWI-focused train-
ing, professional development, and assessment for evaluation and promotion
purposes" (p. 17). As previously mentioned, when most OWI training, especial-
ly preparation in technology management, is handled outside the writing pro-
gram, instructors often receive only a functional knowledge of the technology,
usually with an emphasis on how to distribute knowledge to the students. A

writing program that prepares its own faculty--or supplements the preparation
of its faculty--can teach them how to use the technologies in ways that best sup-
port the field's preferred practices for writing instruction. Therefore, a WPA or
assistant WPA who is well-versed in OWI and digital rhetoric can provide OWI
teachers with effective strategies for using the technology to make the arguments
that instructors are most concerned about.

    While it is important for those who administrate writing programs to be im-
mersed in all of the mediated practices that they ask their faculty to practice, this
preparation arguably is more necessary for the writing instructors who interact
with the students on a regular basis. From the design of the course to the final
assignment's assessment (or possibly through addressing a grading grievance),
the instructor is constantly communicating with the students in terms of artic-
ulating curricula, establishing and managing policies, and providing feedback.
Because of this work and the subject matter of the writing course, the instructor
needs to be both a skilled rhetor and rhetorician. OWI Principle 7 also advocated
that OWI instructors be chosen from a pool of experienced writing instructors
who already have demonstrated capabilities to teach a soundly designed writing
course (p. 18). Writing instructors, as teachers of applied rhetoric, should be
familiar with the potential argumentative nature of communication. Therefore,
OWI instructors should be drawn from a pool of teachers already familiar with
teaching argumentation. When the technologies that mediate OWI are added
to the rhetorical strategies already taught, these instructors who are well-versed
in applying rhetoric and teaching the application of rhetoric will have a stronger
foundation for strategizing and applying how these OWI technologies can be
used best to produce desired results with their communication, including effec-
tively teaching students argumentation.

    Again, WPAs may argue that developing instructors' rhetorical literacy
during OWI faculty preparation is superfluous in light of the instructors' con-
cerns about managing the technology and the day-to-day practices of the OWC.
As with a WAC workshop, prompting new OWI instructors to write and reflect
briefly on their future practices during faculty preparation can frame how they
think about the functional elements they learn about their campus' OWI tech-
nologies. Instructors new to OWI always should start with the question, "What
are your curricular goals for your writing course?" so that they are reminded
that the teaching of writing supersedes the teaching of the technology. This is a
question that can and should be addressed even if the program asks or requires
faculty to teach a prescribed syllabus for the course. Other questions that might
be posed throughout the faculty preparation process include:

    · Why have you chosen to teach OWI?
    · What are your expectations for what the technology can do for you in

                                                                                                 461

        teaching your writing course?
    · What excites you about teaching with these technologies?
    · What are your concerns about the technologies you are expected to use?
    · Are any of these technologies unsuitable for your anticipated student au-

        dience given issues of access or inclusivity?
    · What are your questions and concerns about the assistive and adaptive

        technologies your students with disabilities might use?
    · What do you expect the technology to do for you in this course? Or, what

        would the ideal technology be able to do for you?
    · What do you want these technologies to allow you to do that they cur-

        rently do not?
    · What worries you about potential technology problems? How will you

        address any technology challenges that you have?
    These are not questions that instructors have to spend a lot of time respond-
ing to. But giving them five to ten minutes to write about these OWI issues offers
the instructors a critical and rhetorical frame for thinking about the technologi-
cal functions they are learning. Furthermore, as Selber (2004) argued, function-
al literacy cannot be separated from critical and rhetorical literacy. Therefore,
administrators, WPAs or other staff preparing the faculty for OWI have the
opportunity to develop many instructors' understanding of what OWI-relevant
applications can do. This development certainly includes addressing issues of
access and inclusivity to open and maintain avenues of communication to one's
entire student audience.
    First, it is useful to teach instructors that interfaces are rhetorical texts. Schol-
arly articles like those by Cynthia Selfe and Richard Selfe (1994) and Tim McGee
and Patricia Ericsson (2002) detailed how users can read these texts rhetorically.
Moreover, many people, writing instructors included, only know the most basic
functions of an application like Microsoft Word. Thus, for example, by teaching
the faculty about the comment function in Microsoft Word, an OWI teacher,
by virtue of knowing the possibilities of the application, may choose to use this
relatively efficient and nonintrusive commenting approach rather than inserting
bracketed or multicolored comments into the student's text (keeping readability
to various student populations in mind, of course). Or, to go one step further,
OWI faculty could be taught how to use a freeware application to provide audio/
video comments on students' papers, a strategy that some students have said
they preferred over written comments alone (Vincelette, 2013; Vincelette &
Bostic, 2013). Bearing in mind and attending to the access problems outlined
in Chapters 8, 9, and 10, such additional software uses may increase access by
blind students; multilingual writers who have grown accustomed to the instruc-
tors' accent; and overcommitted students, who because of having to balance

462

family, work, and education, can now take advantage of watching these videos
on various mobile devices during their bus commute to or from work. While I
can see the first two commenting methods being taught in faculty preparation
for OWI, the third option probably would not make many faculty preparation
schedules. But the video option does give the instructors another method for
a specific type of communication with their students. By expanding OWI fac-
ulty understanding of a feedback applications' functionality, for example, they
receive different opportunities to decide the most effective ways to make argu-
ments about revision (e.g., "These are the issues you will want to address with
your writing") to the student audience in their OWI class. Ultimately, the goal is
not to make instructors "power users" of the digital technologies; instead, it is to
increase their competency with OWI-relevant applications and functions so that
they have reasonable accessible options when they are choosing the most effec-
tive ways to communicate with their students in a given situation. Then, ideally,
OWI teachers can use this knowledge responsibly to help students develop the
same meta-awareness of the technology.

    By incorporating digital rhetoric into instructor preparation, writing pro-
grams can use the completion of the OWI Principle 7 to fulfill OWI Principle
12: "Institutions should foster teacher satisfaction in online writing courses as
rigorously as they do for student and programmatic success" (p. 24). Imple-
menting OWI Principle 12 helps to justify why digital rhetoric should be part
of instructor preparation. In the rationale for this OWI principle, the CCCC
OWI Committee (2013) wrote, "Teacher satisfaction is dependent on a number
of affective factors, including being personally suited to teaching online and be-
ing comfortable communicating with students using digital/electronic means"
(p. 24). By preparing instructors to go beyond teaching the technological nuts
and bolts of the digital tools they use and to critically examine the technologies
in order to consider the best means of adopting them for their own rhetorical
purposes, instructors receive the means to adapt their teaching as their rhetorical
situations shift kairotically. These shifts inevitably happen. They can happen in
the space of a fifty-minute hybrid class when an application suddenly will not
launch, or they can happen as the student body changes from class to class and
semester to semester. Certainly, they happen when technology producers design
new (and not necessarily better) applications or when new versions of existing
applications suddenly become inaccessible to certain groups of students.

    Preparing OWI instructors for their work as digital rhetoricians also responds
to OWI Principle 12's rationale that instructors should be taught "relative ad-
vantages and disadvantages of teaching an OWC in their institution" (p. 24).
While these discussions should include such factors as institutional policies and
compensation, they also need to address the rewards and challenges of teaching

                                                                                                 463

OWCs. One of the rewards that also is quite challenging is that instructors put
themselves in a position to learn how to use new writing and communication
technologies that they may not otherwise have used. In teacher training, this re-
ward can be extended to include not only a functional knowledge of these tech-
nologies, but also a rhetorical understanding of them. With this preparation,
instructors should learn specific "pedagogical factors as understanding how com-
munication in the OWC environment differs and learning the benefits and chal-
lenges of the asynchronous and the synchronous modalities" (p. 24). Learning
the course environment (see Chapter 2), affordances of modalities (see Chapter
3), and various media made available to all students enables OWI teachers to
choose the best ones to make arguments to their students (as with the comment
example), and by extension to their administrators about their OWCs and their
own competency as instructors. A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) emphasized that
"teaching writing online involves focused teacher responses that are crafted to
specific student compositions" (p. 25). Unlike other courses in which automated
feedback, such as instantaneous grades provided by the click of a mouse after
taking a LMS-mediated quiz or an exam graded by an optical scanner, is an
acceptable disciplinary pedagogical strategy, sound writing instruction requires
the instructor to provide individual and individualized feedback to the writing
and discussion board or other communications. Although automated messages
can be, and have been, composed anticipating general rhetorical situations, indi-
vidualized interaction requires responses crafted to specific rhetorical situations.
Moreover, developing strategies for reading and working with the technologies'
affordances helps OWI instructors not only to efficiently and effectively interact
with students, but it also helps them to teach their students these same strategies
for their own online mediation.

STUDENT PREPARATION

    Just as this rhetorical meta-knowledge about the technology helps OWI
teachers to make arguments to students, students who learn to understand the
technology they use as a rhetorical tool can develop effective communicative
strategies for the OWI course and beyond. As with the faculty, the purpose
of teaching students the rhetorical reading of digital tools is not to turn them
into power users but to make them more aware of the potential outcomes for
the rhetorical choices they make and potentially can make, especially regarding
the technologies they use to write. Furthermore, the focus for this instruction
should be on technologies relevant to the OWC, both in terms of how the stu-
dents' compose their assignments and how they communicate with their in-

464
                                                                                                        DePew

structor and peers. Several of the principles in A Position Statement of Principles
and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) help
to rationalize this instructional practice.

    OWI Principle 10 stated, "Students should be prepared by the institution
and their teachers for the unique technological and pedagogical components of
OWI" (p. 21). Students in OWI courses inevitably become practitioners of digi-
tal rhetoric because of the assignments they submit and the ways they communi-
cate with their instructors and peers, but their practice can be (more) purposeful
and consciously developed if they receive adequate preparation. Although con-
temporary students often are assumed to be "digital natives" (Prensky, 2001), or
individuals of a generation that has developed an adeptness with the technology
because of a perceived constant exposure to it and use of it, real users have prov-
en that there are individuals of this generation who struggle to use these tech-
nologies and need assistance from the institution and instructors to learn how
to use the technologies that mediate and manage the course (Hewett, 2015a;
also see Chapters 8 & 10). Moreover, even for the so-called "digital natives," the
rationale for OWI Principle 10 explained that "the kind of online communicat-
ing that tech-savvy students do in their personal lives often is fast, frequent, and
informal, which typically is not the kind of communicating they will need to do
regularly to be successful in OWCs" (p. 22). OWI teachers are positioned ide-
ally to design writing assignments that teach students composing strategies that
effectively use technologies to meet situational ends. During this process, OWI
teachers also need to teach students how to write and use the applications typi-
cally used in OWI (e.g., email, word-processing shortcuts, and blogs). Although
some students may have had experience with these technologies in the past,
few will have used them for academic writing (Hewett, 2010, 2015a, 2015b).
Hence, many students will not only need to learn how to use new technologies,
but they also will need to learn new expectations (i.e., academic) for what they
produce using already familiar technologies.

    While the institution primarily should be responsible for preparing students
to use technologies commonly employed in its courses, OWI Principle 10 also
advocated that individual instructors "support and/or repeat elements of that
training in the OWC to assist with student success" in that specific writing class.
In short, instructors should familiarize students with the ways that they will be
using the technologies for writing instruction. To this end, "appropriate OWI
preparation should begin with interface familiarization and experiential exer-
cises that make clear the public (i.e., communication to/from the teacher and
among all students in the course) and private (i.e., communication between the
teacher and individual student) spaces" (p. 22). Such communications provide
an exigency for instructors to help students examine how these interfaces can

                                                                                                 465
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

influence their real communications with real audiences, such as the instructor
and peer students. These are useful lessons that students may not receive from
writing assignments alone because the writing contexts are real.

    This understanding of how to communicate effectively with peers is crucial
for building community among the students--an important feature of OWI.
OWI Principle 11 stated, "Online writing teachers and their institutions should
develop personalized and interpersonal online communities to foster student
success" (p. 23). This principle mirrored the most effective social constructivist
practices already endorsed for the onsite, face-to-face classroom. Communities
are not an outcome that instructors simply can create by using a specific digital
technology or adopting a specific pedagogical practice. Instead, creating com-
munity is a rhetorical act deliberately attempted (DePew, Spangler, & Spiegel,
2013). In the onsite classroom, this process requires the instructor to convince
students that working together has benefits that are worth their time and effort.
Similarly, students need to compose arguments to their peers demonstrating
that they agree with the instructor's belief that working together will benefit all
involved; to support this argument, they also have to convince their peers that
working with them is worthwhile. Unless students are taking a hybrid OWC
(see Chapter 2), these arguments can be made only through the digital technol-
ogies, and having a metacognitive approach to do this communication can help
instructors and students make such arguments.

    Essentially, the last three effective practices for OWI Principle 11 support
the "hows" and "whys" of both instructors and students needing to understand
their digital tools' rhetorical nature. The first of these, Example Practice 11.5,
recommended that instructors design informal writing assignments that "elicit
meaningful responses among class participants" (p. 24). Thus the instructor's
focus should be more on the type of writing that will achieve these goals, not
the technology the class participants will use. The type of writing and the media
cannot be mutually exclusive decisions, but if the instructor's primary goal is for
the students to engage the class content and in doing so to engage each other,
then the instructor needs to use writing genres that allow students to make the
necessary arguments to each other and the instructor. Although this decision be-
longs to instructors, they can make their decisions transparent to their students
helping them understand why particular genres and the digital technologies that
support them are most conducive for the desired rhetorical outcomes.

    With Effective Practice 11.6, A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) recommended that
instructors use the course mediating technologies to collect anonymous and se-
cure feedback about the course at regular intervals. Although this type of course
feedback has been a typical practice in many onsite and online classrooms alike,

466
                                                                                                        DePew

for the OWC, evaluations can become an especially important teaching moment
(Hewett, 2010, 2015b). As OWI teachers ask students to compose arguments
that can produce real consequences for the course, they can highlight how var-
ious features of their digital tools used to elicit feedback--especially those that
foster anonymity but maybe also the interface (i.e., radio buttons or pull-down
menus for closed-ended questions or text boxes for open-ended questions)--en-
courage certain types of feedback from the students and might influence how
they create arguments.

    Similarly, Effective Practice 11.7 argued, "Teachers should develop forums,
threads, and assessments in which students can have open discussions, either
with or without teacher involvement, about course dynamics" (p. 24). More
specifically:

         If students are given opportunities to express their experi-
         ences and to vent their frustrations, perhaps in threads like
         "Lounge" or "Comments about our learning platform" or in
         an anonymous midterm course evaluation, that might en-
         gender a greater willingness to persevere in a new or different
         learning setting. Additionally, such communications enable
         OWI teachers to make adjustments and provide feedback to
         their administrators. (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013, p. 24)

    As with the formal feedback, this practice offers students an opportunity to
affect genuine change through a given digital writing tool used to argue how the
course can best serve one's own needs. When coupled with anonymous formal
feedback, students are given rhetorical choices about the best delivery methods
for their praise and/or grievances. They can consider which digital option might
produce the most significant impact while also providing the best personal se-
curity. Given these different opportunities to engage in discussions about the
course's infrastructure, the strategies OWI teachers develop for students to as-
sert agency in the OWC arguably can transfer to contexts beyond that writing
course.

    A common concern about teaching technology in the writing course is that
these lessons take time away from the teaching of writing, often defined as the
teaching of grammar and rhetorical techniques that masquerade as genres (e.g.,
narrative essay, persuasive essay, definition essay, compare/contrast essay). But
the challenge for instructors should be to consider how they can design assign-
ments and activities that fold lessons about the technology into the students' un-
derstanding of applied rhetoric. This focus means that as OWI instructors teach
students how to compose linguistic or multimodal texts (see Chapter 15), they
are raising the students' awareness of how the technology influences the texts

                                                                                                 467
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

they want to compose. This lesson is not a separate or extra-curricular topic; in-
stead, it helps to make the rhetorical lessons of writing instruction conscious and
metacognitive, especially in the context of OWI where each digitally composed
interaction can have implications.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    As WPAs who prepare OWI instructors, as OWI instructors who design and
implement their courses, or as OWI students who are learning how to negotiate
their education through increasing ubiquitous digital tools, it is useful to reflect
upon Selber's (2004) wisdom: "Not only are teachers obligated to prepare stu-
dents responsibly for a digital age in which the most rewarding jobs will require
multiple literacies, but students will be citizens and parents as well as employees,
and in these roles they will also need to think in expanded ways about computer
use" (p. 4). OWI, by its very nature, creates a situation in which instructors can
teach students skills and strategies they will need for various roles they will oc-
cupy throughout their lives. Nonetheless, when the technology is not taught at
all, this opportunity is missed. When the technology is just taught operationally,
this opportunity is missed. When the teaching of the technology is complete-
ly separated from the teaching of applied rhetoric, this opportunity is missed.
When writing is taught without acknowledging the material conditions of writ-
ing, this opportunity is missed.

    Administrators and instructors can seize these opportunities by using the
inherent features of OWI--online communication and writing instruction--
to teach OWI students how to be effective digital rhetoricians, not necessarily
master programmers, but people who can potentially shape their world with the
digital writing tools at their disposal. The OWI principles in A Position Statement
of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee,
2013) recognized this exigency.

    The following recommendations can assist WPAs and OWI teachers in pre-
paring students for the rhetoricity of OWI technologies:

    · OWI courses should be perceived and taught as applied rhetoric courses
        that use digital technology to mediate interaction between instructors
        and students. Therefore, the course's material conditions give instructors
        and students opportunities to practice what they are learning.

    · As an applied rhetoric course, audience is a primary concern in the OWC,
        and instructors and students should make concerted efforts to make their
        course communication accessible to all audiences. Therefore, these digital
        writers need to be taught how to address the communicative needs of
        students with disabilities, multilingual students, and other students who

468
                                                                                                        DePew

        cannot easily access a course through digital technologies.
    · Instructors should pose any real challenges that the technology creates as

        a real rhetorical problem and teachable moment.
    · WPAs and others who prepare OWI faculty need to teach instructors

        how to be functionally, critically, and rhetorically literate with the cours-
        es' technologies, as well as how to teach any digital technologies that
        students will use to compose assignments.
    · Instructors need to teach students how to be functionally, critically, and
        rhetorically literate with the courses' technologies, as well as any digital
        technologies students will use to compose assignments. To this end, in-
        structors might use the example lessons found in Appendix 14.A directly
        following this chapter.

NOTES

1. I want to acknowledge the works of Paul Prior et al. (2007) and James Porter
(2009), both of whom argued that the ways people communicate today (and, in the
case of Prior et al., even in Ancient Greece) are too complex for an oversimplified
understanding of the canon of "delivery."

APPENDIX: SAMPLE LESSONS

    OWI teachers can introduce students to rhetorical literacy as they teach
about audience. For example, in the first few weeks of the course, students can
be assigned a short assignment with the purpose of learning about their peers
as audience for the course. Assigned to groups of three to four, students would
begin by composing a 500-750 word literacy narrative that they post in a group
discussion board or on a blog. Each student in a group would read these narra-
tives, paying attention to how the author self-identifies as a writer and a reader.
Using this information to work together, the group would collaboratively com-
pose a survey to distribute to the rest of the class about their reading and writing
practices; students could be asked to use such tools as a discussion board, a
Wiki, or digitally shared document that enables real-time co-writing depending
on whole-class accessibility. After students collect data from their survey, they
would collaboratively compose an essay, memo, or report about the audience
needs that students should consider when writing to the class. The collective
knowledge created by the students' research and writing is intended to help
them throughout the course to select which technologies to use and which func-
tions on those technologies to use when writing to others in the class. From
these data, students may learn that a few of their peers are dyslexic or do most
of their technological work on their cell phone (per Chapter 16), which--with
the OWI teacher's assistance--should prompt them to consider how to com-
municate most effectively with these audiences. While this example assignment
gives students an opportunity to wrestle productively with digital rhetoric issues,
it also entails many of the lessons that educators want students to learn in writ-
ing classes (i.e., audience awareness, collaborative writing, research skills, and
such genres as memos and reports). By collecting these data themselves, students
learn to make sound decisions about how to communicate with their peers based
upon data rather than assumptions; such an assignment also makes the lessons
about digital rhetoric and audience accommodation a concrete reality rather

                                                                                                 471
Preparing for the Rhetoricity of OWI

than a seemingly liberal abstraction supported by the instructor.
    Likewise, instructors can use the applications commonly found on the LMS

as a text they ask students to learn how to read rhetorically. The goal of this
activity is to teach students how to understand what an application demands of
users and what it prevents or obscures from users based upon the application's
interface design. In other words, students learn to examine how writing technol-
ogies shape what the writer can or cannot do. Essentially, the instructor would
prompt students to analyze three different texts using text-specific modifications
to the following heuristics:

    · What is the argument the text's author makes? What does the author
        want the audience to do or think after engaging with the text?

    · What evidence does the author use to support this argument? Or, what
        leads you to the conclusion that such is the argument?

    · How did you respond to this text? Why?
    · Who do you think the target audience is for this text? Do you think the

        text effectively connects with that audience? Why or why not? Is the au-
        thor excluding certain members of this intended audience by overlooking
        their needs?
    · How do you think other audiences will respond to this text? Why? Name
        one of these different audiences.
    · What is your opinion of the author(s) based upon this text? Why?
    · How would you design this text differently? Would you use the same or
        different media? What features would you redesign and why?

    OWI teachers can begin this lesson with the first text, an editorial from a lo-
cal news organization. Regardless of whether it is available online, the instructor
needs to provide students with either a hardcopy text or an accessible PDF of
the hardcopy text. In this case, a hyperlink will not do. For example, in a hybrid
OWC in which the instructor has face-to-face time with the students, the in-
structor can provide a hardcopy of the editorial; in either the fully online or hy-
brid OWC, the instructor can use the LMS or email to send students a PDF of
the text and ask them to print it because they will need to work from hardcopy.
Given the selected genre, the editorial argument should be overt and relatively
easy to identify. The difficult task will be getting the students to think about the
text's interface because most people take paper and ink media for granted and do
not necessarily think of it as an interface.

    The second text would be a commercial website, such as Amazon.com (or
if one wants to gender the assignment, ESPN.com or Forever21.com); the stu-
dents should be provided a link to that website. While the argument "Buy our
products/services!" is pretty overt on any of these sites, they are not presented

472
                                                                                                        DePew

in ways that many students, especially in the early sequence of writing courses,
think about an argument. Thus, such sites help to develop students' understand-
ing of what an argument is and how it can be presented. Unlike the editorial,
the students would engage the website through something that they recognize
as an "interface" and one that the students, once they identify the argument,
will believe should be user-friendly and easy to navigate. However, it is at the
places where these texts are not easy to use that students may begin to see design
decisions. For example, how easy is it to access items on clearance sale versus
featured items? Or, how easy or possible is it to find the statistics for a female
athlete versus a male athlete in the same sport?

    Finally, the instructor should ask the students to read the institution's LMS
relative to how their own course is presented. The analysis of the editorial as an
interface and the commercial website as an argument should have prepared stu-
dents to see the LMS itself as an argumentative text and to consider whether and
how the interface design supports the argument it appears to make. Through
this exercise of analyzing the LMS, the students may become more critical con-
sumers of the applications they will need to use to make arguments in their
OWC. Moreover, the students would be provided with strategies to become
rhetorically literate with the LMS and to use their understanding of the LMS
as text/tool to fulfill their desired purposes as writers throughout the course of
the semester, and into future courses. Combined with the previously described
assignment in this section regarding learning about their class' student audience,
students could be empowered. They can synthesize their understanding of the
LMS's argumentative potential with what they know about their peer audience
and then use this knowledge through their writing to persuade their peers--the
outcome can be mutually beneficial.

    If writing courses are applied rhetoric courses, then these applications of
rhetorical awareness comply with programmatic outcomes. Such exercises can
be a series of stand-alone activities or they can be scaffolded in support of the
students' later analysis of an individually chosen interface.

                                                                                                 473

TEACHING MULTIMODAL
ASSIGNMENTS IN OWI CONTEXTS

      Kristine L. Blair
      University of Bowling Green

        This chapter provides effective practices for instructors who want to trans-
        form alphabetic text-centric assignments into multimodal ones in OWI
        contexts. By focusing on needs assessments, assignment options, tools se-
        lection, and assessment, the chapter advocates a shift from migrating and
        adapting onsite writing instruction to instead transforming it through a
        broadened definition of writing as multimodal composing that enables
        students to produce content as twenty-first century learners and citizens.

        sual rhetoric

    The 2013 film The Internship featured Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson as
two recently unemployed salespeople, downsized as a result of changing mar-
keting and purchasing trends that have migrated from face-to-face and door-
to-door to the online marketplace of point, click, and purchase. As part of their
efforts to retool, they sought a coveted internship at Google and participated
in a pre-interview at a local library computer with Web-cam access. The site of
two middle-aged men hovering over Webcam technology to which they had not
had access as users is endemic to the movie's theme. Technology has changed
the rules of interpersonal engagement in all contexts, including the classroom,
as many students (regardless of the millennial stereotype) and instructors are
not any more prepared than the characters in the film. Just as the protagonists
are accustomed to a face-to-face as opposed to video chat interview, we are ac-
customed in writing classrooms to a primarily alphabetic as opposed to a mul-
timodal text.

    Nevertheless, A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective Prac-
tices for OWI (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013) offered OWI Principle 3 as,
"Appropriate composition teaching/learning strategies should be developed for
the unique features of the online instructional environment" (p. 12). The ra-

Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

tionale accompanying this principle noted that "some changes in traditional
composition pedagogy are necessary for teaching writing in the OWI setting, an
environment that is by nature text-centric and reading-heavy and that requires
intensive written communication" (p. 12). Yet, as the larger writing studies disci-
pline challenges the operational definition of "writing" in light of a Web 2.0 era
of digital literacy and composing processes, June Griffin and Deborah Minter
(2013) contended that "the proliferation of online classrooms raises the field's
stake in emerging technologies not only for the impact of those technologies
on course design and students' literacies, but also for their capacity to help us
see more clearly changes on the horizon for our profession and to mine those
changes for opportunities to improve student learning" (p. 145). Thus, they
appropriately aligned themselves with Cynthia Selfe's (2009) longstanding call
to "pay attention" and how that call "is now extricably linked to literacy and
literacy education in this country" (quoted at p. 141). Certainly, technology
has been an impetus for constant change, and in the context of online writing
pedagogies, this change has impacted not only the spaces in which we teach
writing as process but also the increasingly diverse students we serve. Despite the
emphasis on the range of new media literacy practices and the tools and technol-
ogies that enable those practices, what we teach in the writing classroom, both
hybrid and fully online, has remained unchanged: we teach alphabetic writing
meant to be produced and consumed on an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper, accessed
onscreen or in-hand.

    There are a number of factors that contribute to this ongoing privileging of
the alphabetic, including a typical emphasis on print-based learning outcomes
within higher education writing programs that favor the production of the aca-
demic essay and are aligned with larger university general education outcomes,
as well as a lack of training and faculty development for the ever-growing contin-
gent of adjunct faculty and graduate students who typically teach undergraduate
writing courses. This lack of training and professional development also impacts
full-time non-tenure track faculty for whom professional development is not a
guarantee and, given the academic labor of teaching writing fulltime, does not
always allow for maintaining currency in the field as it evolves its understanding
of writing to include a more inclusive, integrated range of modalities and media
(see, for example, Chapters 7, 8, 11, 12, & 14). Sometimes these issues are gen-
erational; for instance, the composition director at my own institution, Bowling
Green State University, recently confessed concern about the lack of interest on
the part of some faculty to integrate more visual rhetoric into the curriculum
while graduate students, because of their recent training and often generational
status as millennials, are eager to integrate technologies that exceed the readiness
of the curriculum and the training available. Thus, despite our field's ongoing

multimodal turn in twenty-first century composing theories, if we do not heed
that call to pay attention to both the possibilities and the constraints as we de-
velop online writing curriculum, the identities students develop in such virtual
writing spaces will continue to be as alphabetic as ever.

    I have noted elsewhere (Blair, 2007) that this text-centricity also is due to the
spaces in which OWI typically occurs (i.e., LMSs). As Scott Warnock (2009)
recommended to new online instructors, "In your initial efforts to teach an
OWcourse, simplify things by using your campus CMS [aka LMS], and learn
only the tools you will need" (p. 23). Although Warnock appropriately and ef-
fectively encouraged important experimentation with a range of tools such as
blogs, Wikis, and SecondLife and acknowledged the potential for audiovisual
tools and alternatives to text-based assessment, the underlying assumption of
the "hows" and "whys" of his book Teaching Writing Online is that these tools
enhance alphabetic writing processes. Warnock overviewed the ability of various
tools to foster a more dialogic approach to writing, emphasizing tools that fos-
ter peer review, student-centered interaction, and personalized interactions be-
tween students and teachers. Thus, another useful guideline Warnock included
among his eighteen guidelines was, "Initially, you want to think migration, not
transformation, when teaching online. Think about what you do well, and then
think about how you use various resources to translate those skills to the OW-
course" (p. xvii.). For novice teachers of online writing, this advice undoubtedly
is sound, particularly because of the need to align any use of technology with
larger curricular objectives at both the program and course level. But the empha-
sis on migration as opposed to transformation has the potential to create an inad-
vertent gap between larger theoretical discussions of multimodal composing and
practical implementation of multimodal composing pedagogies in hybrid and
online writing classrooms, a gap described in Chapter 14. Indeed, these appar-
ently opposing needs reveal why the CCCC OWI Committee wrote both OWI
Principle 3 (outlined earlier; pp. 12-14) and OWI Principle 4 (regarding migrat-
ing and adapting appropriate contemporary composition pedagogy to OWI; pp.
14-15), which are, as Hewett indicated in Chapter 1, yin and yang principles.

    Undoubtedly, there exist numerous challenges to integrating multimodal
production into fully online OWCs--perhaps more so than in hybrid OWCs--
and the ability to "transform" the curriculum. Such challenges include:

   1. the ideological presumption that writing remains a "text-based" process,
       and thus OWI may not align with the field's emphasis on literate practic-
       es (see Chapters 14 & 16);

   2. the limited/inconsistent access to digital composing tools for both stu-
       dents and teachers (see Chapters 1, 8, 9, 10 & 16);

   3. the ableistic nature of some of the multimodal technologies and their

                                                                                                 479
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

       denial of bodily and neural diversity among users (see Chapter 8);
   4. the lack of faculty training for multimodal curriculum development (see

       Chapters 11, 12, & 16); and
   5. the course design logistics within LMSs that have few internal options for

       multimodal composing (see Chapters 8 & 14).
    Given these challenges, my particular focus is upon the whats, hows, and
whys of transforming OWI from a text-centric composing space for our students
to one that integrates multimodal elements for students and instructors in as via-
ble, accessible, and introductory a way as possible. This focus meshes with OWI
Principle 2: "An online writing course should focus on writing and not on technol-
ogy orientation or teaching students how to use learning and other technologies" (p.
11). Thus, I include a series of effective practices for new and more experienced
OWI teachers, as well as for administrators who develop OWI initiatives in both
hybrid and fully online contexts. These practices focus on needs assessment, as-
signment design, and assessment processes that foster multimodality in progres-
sive ways that begin to bridge the gap between migration and transformation,
ultimately helping instructors ground multimodal composing in rhetorical con-
texts and positively impacting the evolving identities that online students must
develop as twenty-first century composers.

THE TENSION BETWEEN OWI AND MULTIMODAL
COMPOSING

    Just as Warnock (2009) provided useful advice to new OWI instructors for
migrating existing composition curricula, contributors to Selfe's (2007) collec-
tion Multimodal Composition provided similar practical strategies for transform-
ing that same curricula, calling for writing teachers to acknowledge "multiple
semiotic channels" and agree that "literacy pedagogies must account for the
multiplicity of texts allowed and encouraged by digital technologies" (Takayoshi
& Selfe, 2007, p. 2). For Takayoshi and Selfe, the multimodal turn is more than
moving students away from composing practices that are all too similar to those
of their parents and grandparents. They align themselves--as most multimodal
theorists do--with the New London Group's 1996 "Pedagogy of Multilitera-
cies," in which literacy is not only technological but cultural, material, and po-
litical. In this way, the writing studies field needs to rethink its goal of migrating
writing to instead transforming our understanding of writing as multimodal
composing that better prepares undergraduates to communicate successfully
within professional and social contexts outside the academy.

    The distinction between "writing" versus "composing" frequently is posi-
tioned as an either/or argument--that in privileging one over the other, we do a

480
                                                                                                           Blair

disservice to students either in not sufficiently introducing them to more tradi-
tional print-based discourse crucial to their academic success or in not bridging
the gap between how students use technologies to compose outside the class-
room and how we use (or do not use) those same technologies. As Selfe (2009)
powerfully argued:

         My argument is not either/or but both/and. I am not arguing
         against writing, the value we place on writing, or an under-
         standing of what writing--and print--contribute to the hu-
         man condition that is vitally important... . I do want to argue
         that teachers of composition need to pay attention to, and
         come to value, the multiple ways in which students compose
         and communicate meaning. (p. 642)

Similarly, I am not recommending the elimination of alphabetic texts in OWI;
rather, I embrace Jay David Bolter's (2001) longstanding position that digital
text does not signal "the end of print; it is instead the remediation of print" (p.
46). This remediated process stresses print as one modality among many, and as
I shall stress in the OWI effective practices section of this chapter, the relation-
ship among these modalities must be flexible, to address the existing skill sets of
both students and instructors as well as the access issues and learning styles our
students may bring to OWI per OWI Principle 1: "Online writing instruction
should be universally inclusive and accessible" (p. 7).

    Even as I attempt to bridge the gap between migration and transformation,
however, it is equally crucial to interrogate some assumptions we may hold about
students as multimodal composers, the most common being our students' gen-
erational status as "digital natives" (Prensky, 2001). As many of us who have
taught OWCs have discovered, our students can be anything but typical in such
environments: working adults, military personnel, transfer and international stu-
dents, and even high school age students enrolled in post-secondary programs.
Such diversity calls into question the presumption of equal access (see OWI Prin-
ciple 1 and Chapters 8 & 10). For example, consider the current controversy
surrounding the shift of the General Education Development (GED) from a
paper-based to online process as a result of the profit-bearing partnership between
The American Council on Education and Pearson Vue (Tran, 2013), leading to
concerns about the affordability of the exam and the concerns about the lack of
computing skills among the unemployed, the working poor, and the incarcerat-
ed. Similar presumptions of access to and comfort with the array of tools needed
to compose in multimodal form can be a false one that rather than empower on-
line learners actually may disenfranchise them, as in the case of the GED. Indeed,
such presumptions often ignore issues of age and socioeconomic status, given that

                                                                                                 481
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

just as Takayoshi and Selfe (2007) may lament writing curricula that promotes
the pedagogies of our parents, the reality is that students the age of our parents
are, of course, more and more common, particularly in online learning environ-
ments. This concern inevitably resonates with OWI Principle 1 (pp. 7-11).

    Because of these tensions, it is not enough to reconsider our definition of
writing but also our definition of multimodality, understanding that, just as with
text-based assignments, it is important to integrate genres and modes in progres-
sively complex ways. And just as a typical FYW course would not automatically
begin with the extended research paper assignment, multimodal assignments
should begin where both students and teacher are regarding their composing ex-
pertise, allowing a point of entry that fosters early success and develops skills and
aptitudes over time. Such a process also should account for a definition of mul-
timodality that is not purely digital, recognizing the many print-based genres
that have multimodal components, from scrapbooks to posters to zines. Equally
important is that our understanding of multimodality should acknowledge the
redefinition of "literacy" as the more nuanced "multiliteracies" that Stuart Selber
(2004) outlined as (1) functional, which views computers as tools and students
as users of technology; (2) critical, which views computers as cultural artifacts
and students as questioners of technology; and (3) rhetorical, which views com-
puters as hypertextual media (i.e., multimodality) and as students as producers
of technology (p. 25; see Chapter 14). Thus, a multiliteracies framework has
just as much potential to foster critical thinking, reading, and composing as our
traditional text-based writing processes.

    My goal in outlining a range of effective practices for integrating, producing,
and assessing multimodal assignments is to bridge the gap not only between mi-
gration and transformation of OWI content but also between the either/or, both/
and positions in order to emphasize a twenty-first century model of online writ-
ing. The goal in doing so is to acknowledges, as Selfe concluded(2009), "all avail-
able means of persuasion, all available dimensions, all available approaches, not
simply those limited to the two dimensional space of the printed page" (p. 645).

OWI EFFECTIVE PRACTICES FOR MULTIMODAL
COMPOSITION

Needs Assessments

    OWI Principle 1 included a range of effective practices that address access
issues by making OWI a more multimodal process, specifically OWI Effective
Practice 1.9, "Teachers must become acquainted with multimodal means for
distributing and assessing learning materials" (p. 10), and OWI Effective Prac-

482
                                                                                                           Blair

tice 1.10, "OWI teachers should offer instructional materials in more than one
medium" (p. 10). Undoubtedly, these practices help to ensure equitable access
for students with a range of abilities and learning preferences. The greatest chal-
lenge to integrating multimodal assignments in the OWC is the lack of consis-
tent access to hardware and software that afford students the opportunity to not
just consume digital material but produce it themselves, something frequently
tied to fully online students' place bound status as well as their inevitable differ-
ences in sensory ability and socioeconomic status.

    For these reasons, it is important to conduct needs assessments prior to the
start of a class. Needs assessments are not new to online curricula; standard prac-
tice at both the postsecondary institution and course level encourages feedback
prior to the start of an online program about the types of technology students
to which student have access and the types of skills students possess, from the
ability to upload an attachment to the ability to edit digital images or record
audio (see Chapter 13 for other student assessment advice). Such assessments
are consistent with OWI principle 1 and the need to ask students "to confirm
that they have the required technology at the beginning of an online course ...
and advise students regarding how to meet course requirements through, for
example, institutional computing equipment" (p. 9). This guideline is particu-
larly significant in light of the high-end digital tools that simply cost more than
the average student can afford, a consideration that aligns with OWI Effective
Practice 1.3 (p. 9) and that calls for instructors to familiarize themselves with
both free and open-source alternatives to proprietary, institutionally supported
software applications. Admittedly, the time and effort required for such work is
both an academic labor and a professional development issue, particularly in in-
stitutional settings where there is not a training program for new and continuing
OWI teachers across the disciplines.

    Another important assessment involves students' learning styles. According
to Neil Fleming and David Baume (2006),

         Much education is either mono- or at the most bi-modal.
         Teaching often reflects the teacher's preferred teaching style
         rather than the students' preferred learning styles. Managed or
         Virtual Learning Environments may not change that as much
         as we hoped--they simply implement old teaching styles in
         new technologies. (p. 6)

Fleming's research has included the development of VARK, a learning styles
questionnaire that allows students to self-assess their preferences for visual, au-
ral, read-write, or kinesthetic approaches to academic tasks. While this issue
resonates with OWI Principle 1 and the need to develop and deliver course

                                                                                                 483
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

content in multiple modalities and with varied media, acknowledging students'
learning styles also connects to their communication strengths as well. Within
the context of an OWC, it is clearly important to focus on writing genres that
ensure success in both academic and non-academic venues, thus mandating that
instructors balance more text-centric assignments with those that allow a broad-
er range of modalities with which students are familiar.

    Regardless of that familiarity, students often come to OWI with even more
traditional expectations than their instructors: writing equals print essays; writ-
ing equals grammar. Thus, another aspect of needs assessment includes deter-
mining the expectations students have about the course, about what they will be
learning, and about their own motivation to be successful. For writing instruc-
tors, some of the initial icebreaking activities used within face-to-face writing
courses, such as asking students to share their definitions and attitudes about
writing, and what tools they use to "write," are critical in an OWI environment.
Students may not see the texting, Facebooking, Tweeting, Instagraming, and
YouTubing (many of these tasks have become action verbs in the larger Web
2.0 culture) they do as a form of either writing or multimodal composing, but
helping them to see the way technology transforms our collective definitions
and assumptions of what a writing course is supposed to be is as crucial to their
success as to the instructor's.

Assignments and Activities

    One key to success in multimodal assignment construction is to allow organ-
ic opportunities for multimodal composing--that is, to not integrate new media
technology for its own sake but because the development of a visual argument or
an audio essay represents a rhetorically appropriate response to the assignment
context. As the following assignment options suggest, these genres are not nec-
essarily new to OWI but may involve transforming an alphabetic-only option
to one that provides students the opportunity to meaningfully assemble digital
artifacts to compose a multimodal response for a specific purpose and audience.
In the spirit of a both/and model, as opposed to either/or, OWI teachers could
develop such representative activities to mesh with existing assignment contexts,
or even to introduce multimodal elements as part of particular stages of the
writing process, from invention to showcase, ensuring that they can maintain
alignment of these assignments with existing rhetorical learning outcomes.

Literacy Narratives

    Asking students to reflect on their reading and writing practices has become
a standard genre in undergraduate writing course, and it often has involved

484
                                                                                                           Blair

discussions of various writing technologies that students use to communicate.
In OWI, such a literacy narrative is an equally significant task, particularly at
the beginning of the term when students need opportunities to self-assess their
comfort level and its impact on their success in the course. Such narratives can
serve multiple purposes. On one hand, they offer that critical opportunity for
reflection on growth as writers and composers and ground their access in cultur-
al and material conditions that may include such issues as age, gender, and class.
On the other hand, the literacy narrative offers a significant opportunity for
multimodal composing in that instructors, even if using a word-processing tool
such as Microsoft Word, can encourage the inclusion of images--located online
or created by students themselves through a basic cell phone camera--that relate
to textual content. Another important aspect of this assignment is its ability to
serve as a representation of progress throughout the course, with students' up-
dating the document and enhancing its design and development over time, even
shifting from a basic tool to a more advanced one as their skills grow.

Visual Arguments

    Given the multimodal possibilities of the literacy narrative assignment, it
is clear that this particular genre has the potential to be represented visually.
Students encounter visual arguments on a daily basis: on billboards, online, and
perhaps without realizing it, they both create and circulate these images through
an array of Web 2.0 genres that we did not have names for just a few years
ago, including memes, tag clouds, comics, and the remediation of infographics
in social media. Because of this proliferation of visual rhetorical culture, OWI
teachers have ample opportunity to engage students in analysis of these visuals
as arguments and, in many cases, as parody and social commentary. This analysis
should move inevitably from consumption to production, and while it is not
necessary for the instructor to teach students to use the range of tools designed
to construct a visual argument, students should be allowed to select a tool that
suits that audience and purpose for their visual themes. For instance, memes
and comics may resonate more with some audiences than others, though such
literacy practices are indeed prevalent, as most recently represented in Jonathan
Alexander's and Elizabeth Losh's (2013) composition textbook Understanding
Rhetoric: A Graphic Guide to Writing (2013). Similar to the literacy narrative
assignment, students are equally able to create a visual argument with an image
pasted into a word-processed document, rather than to be expected to use such
higher end and expensive tools as Adobe Photoshop.

Storyboards

    Students and teachers are accustomed to the concept of outlining as an

                                                                                                 485
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

organizational plan for an alphabetic essay. While common invention strategies
also may include more visual elements such as clustering, storyboarding is a
standard process for both print and digital media projects where composers are
aligning image, text, and other modes to craft a persuasive message. The beauty
of storyboarding is that it applies across genres, from websites to photo and
video essays, allowing students to consider where elements will be placed and
how they will work together rhetorically. In addition to serving as a pre-writing
or invention activity, such an activity is itself a form of multimodal composing
that need not be digital, thus allowing students to reflect upon the relationship
among modes.

Digital Demos

    It is virtually impossible for an instructor or a student to be aware of the wide
range of applications that enable multimodal composing. One way to encourage
students to view themselves as co-equal participants in the course and collabo-
rative knowledge-makers is to share the labor of developing technological exper-
tise. Assigning students either individually or collaboratively to develop a brief
demonstration (if hybrid) that includes an online handout has the potential not
only to teach a particular tool's multimodal function but also, in designing the
handout, doing so allows teachers to balance alphabetic and multimodal texts
as students develop a viable set of instructions for completing the task. For in-
stance, an initial multimodal strategy that is common to the instructional genre
is a screen capture, an easy task on both Mac and PC platforms, that could then
be pasted into a basic word-processed document to be augmented with the use
of, in the case of Microsoft Office, word art that includes arrows and other useful
directional features. What makes this activity so useful to the course is the ability
to collectively develop an archive of multimodal composing tips that students
can refer to as they create upcoming projects and take with them as they move
forward to other courses in the curriculum.

Audio Essays

    Perhaps the greatest technology we have at our disposal is the technology
of the human voice, whether it be in the form of a personal narrative or an
interview. On one level, audio essays are manageable migrations of alphabet-
ic content into digital form with the most basic preparation being the text/
script itself; certainly, a necessary part of the audio process is the emphasis on
accessibility through including alphabetic transcripts. An important preparato-
ry activity is to have students review some of the powerful audio commentary
available online, including "This I Believe" [thisibelieve.org] and other related
commentary from sites like the National Public Radio, also known as NPR.

486
                                                                                                           Blair

Such essays often are brief, engage the personal, and stress the powerful role of
narrative and storytelling in the larger culture. There are both high-end propri-
etary and low-end inexpensive tools that make the audio recording process more
accessible to students (i.e., including the use of smartphones apps or free Web-
based or other sound-editing tools). As students' skills advance, they potentially
can layer in music and other sound effects similar to professional podcasts to
create a range of genres: arguments, debates, reviews, and interviews. Despite
the writing studies discipline's historical shift from teaching speech to teaching
writing, an emphasis on aural composing helps to ground the writing curricu-
lum within a rhetorical tradition that has emphasized the connection between
oratorical education and civic rhetoric. Indeed, instructors should offer these
media as options to students but also give them comparable credit in assessment,
particularly since not all students will be equally competent at employing certain
media. Moreover, Ann-Marie Pedersen and Carolyn Skinner (2007) acknowl-
edged the challenges of developing audio (and video) assignments in distance
learning settings where students may not have opportunities to advance their
skills; for that reason, they advocate collaboration in ways that allow students to
pool their knowledge and encourage instructors to pre-assess student expertise
before forming group project teams.

Research Exhibitions/Virtual Poster Sessions

    Admittedly, when we think of student presentations, the focus tends to be
on the use of slideware tools like Microsoft PowerPoint, which, despite being a
robust tool that fosters multimodal composing, conjures up all too many tem-
plate-driven bulleted lists of alphabetic text. As a result, students often view such
presentations as the mere copying and pasting of information, rather than taking
advantage of its affordances to shape and align visual and textual information
to communicate effectively and rhetorically to virtual and onsite, face-to-face
audiences. Fostering more rhetorically aware presentations also involves recon-
sidering how we label such genres; as the field evolves its definition of writing,
we have borrowed language and formats from other disciplines, including con-
cepts of the exhibit (from art and museum studies, for example) and poster
sessions, that while common to social and physical science disciplines are less
typical within the humanities. Regardless of what we label them, these projects
represent significant forms of professionalization for students and an opportu-
nity to share the results of their efforts in public ways that often align with uni-
versity-level emphases on "undergraduate research." Depending on where these
projects are housed and the tools used to create them, an exhibition and interac-
tive commenting space can evolve in the LMS or other instructional space (e.g.,
blog, Wiki, Google drive, and the like).

                                                                                                 487
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

Multimodal Writing Journal

    One of the major problems with many LMSs is that the students have very
little control over ownership of the real estate; that is, there are few spaces that
are their own to customize in terms of format and to populate in terms of con-
tent (or even to keep in months or years after the course). Their role is that of
consumer rather than that of producer. Using a blog, for example, can allow
students to practice integrating visual images, links, videos and other resources
into their responses to course readings and writing tasks. Thus--once access
concerns have been identified and addressed--the multimodal journal has as
much potential to serve as an invention or prewriting tool as its more alphabetic
counterpart, particularly if similar to providing guidance for discussion or chat
forum posts in OWI, expectations are clarified with regard to the relationship
between and amount of both textual and multimodal content. Although a sep-
arate part from the course/LMS, instructors can provide links to the journals in
the event the spaces are meant to be shared with other students for commentary
and potential collaboration. Overall, the key for instructors is to be flexible to
the students' preferences and access needs regarding the tools that would enable
this activity to be successful.

    Certainly, as Rochelle Rodrigo's Chapter 16 suggests, the plethora of mobile
and tablet devices students use make it impossible to address all the possibili-
ties for multimodal composing given the numerous apps, free Web 2.0 tools,
and proprietary software available for both hybrid and fully online courses. But
success in integrating multimodal assignments is enabled through the recog-
nition that the curriculum must allow for composing flexibility, not requiring
that students use a particular tool unless is it genuinely available and accessible
to all. Inevitably, we also must recognize that our students, because of differ-
ences in access, may not be interacting with the course content in the same
way: some using smartphones, some using tablets, some using desktops, and
the like. Likewise, for many, this access is possible through the mediation of
screen readers, Braille displays, voice input systems, and other assistive devices.
Despite this potential, it also is important that, depending on the nature of
the assignment and on both instructor/student comfort and access, it is just as
possible to compose multimodally with ubiquitous word-processing and slide-
ware applications. While I do not focus on these specific applications within
this chapter, helping students to move beyond the more traditional alphabetic
uses of these applications is a progressive first step in (1) integrating visual and
other modalities into their composing processes and (2) understanding that text
is one modality among several that may not be the optimal choice based on an
assignment's rhetorical context. Although my breakdown of assignments and

488
                                                                                                           Blair

activities discusses multimodal composing in discrete terms (e.g., image editing,
audio), it is important to remember that many of these assignment genres enable
more complex integration of the aural, visual, and verbal. This integration has
strong implications for accessibility, particularly because of the need to provide
multiple versions of texts for differently-abled users, such as a textual transcript
for an audio essay or either transcripts or screen captions for video. This multi-
ple versioning is just one way multimodal composing can be as accessible as its
print, alphabetic, text-only counterpart.

Assessment

    The concerns about integrating multimodal composing projects into onsite
and OWCs are similar. Although instructors may have experience offering on-
line feedback in the form of email response, textual comments in word-pro-
cessed and PDF files, or even audio comments through a digital voice recorder
or audio, these same instructors typically have limited experience evaluating
the multimodal deliverables and production processes of their own students. A
common perspective is that the very same assessment criteria instructors use to
assess alphabetic texts can be applied to multimodal projects, given the emphasis
of those criteria on standard rhetorical concerns that apply across modalities:
purpose, audience, development, organization, style and editing. In "Evaluating
Academic Hypertexts," Anne Herrington and Charles Moran (2002) document-
ed the elements of assessment that remain consistent between print and online
texts, including "Focus and Central Claim," "Evidence of Constructive Think-
ing," and "Organization/Coherence" (p. 249). Herrington and Moran advised
that teachers new to hypertext and mixed media genres review as many samples
as possible, and as they reflect on their initial efforts:

         Reading hypertext with non-hypertext in mind not only
         serves to familiarize you with the various ... genres and
         approaches to composing ... it also helps to bring into relief
         our expectations for ... academic writing and some of the
         conventions and evaluation criteria we take for granted. We
         believe such self-reflection is valuable for any teacher. For us,
         it prompted critical examination of the ways of thinking and
         shaping of information that we value and ... the conventions
         for composing which we value. (p. 253).

    Understanding what we value in terms of assessment, as Bob Broad (2003)
has articulated, involves a process "by which instructors and administrators in
writing programs discover, negotiate, and publicize the rhetorical values they

                                                                                                 489
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

employ when they judge student writing" (p. 14) for internal and external stake-
holders. Contemporary discussions of multimodal assessment have stressed the
need to share and shape those values with input from students themselves. Sonya
Borton and Brian Huot (2007) urged teachers to view assessment as a way of
teaching production and design to go beyond the functional skills and technical
affordances of various media tools and genres. They advised teachers to col-
laborate with students in developing formative assessment criteria that ensures
multimodal projects are grounded in processes; they further suggested including
rubrics that allow students to assess their own texts and make rhetorical deci-
sions about when, why, and how to compose in various modalities. By doing
this assessment work together, multimodal composing becomes a sustainable
process, not something done for a singular class or a more teacher-centered au-
dience; rather, it involves an ongoing set of critical and rhetorical literacies for
students to deploy throughout their academic and professional careers. The fol-
lowing assessment strategies are designed to help students make those choices.

Multimodal "Norming"

    Although neither teachers nor students have extensive experience evaluating
multimodal compositions, there are some aspects of design that can be intuitive
even for novice composers. For example, students often can assess levels of acces-
sibility and readability on a basic slideware presentation, whether color schemes
or font sizes are more or less readable on a website, or whether visuals are aligned
appropriately in both design and theme with their textual counterparts. One
strategy for tapping these intuitive assessment criteria is to ask students to find
websites, slideshows, and other multimodal genres that they find rhetorically
appealing in terms of organization, design, and creativity and to share those
models electronically with other members of the class. As the class reviews these
artifacts, the instructor can facilitate interactive discussion about why the stu-
dents view these examples as effective, generating shared criteria.

The "Ugly" Composition

    Such multimodal design experts as Kristin Arola (2010) have stressed that
despite the "death" of the personal homepage coded and designed in HTML, "in
a Web 2.0 world, composition teachers need to engage, along with our students,
the work of design" (p. 4) to understand its affordances in fostering students'
writerly identities. And scholars such as James Inman (2004) and Dánielle De-
Voss (2013) have focused on multimodal design don'ts as a way to teach multi-
modal design do's. Having students collaboratively engage in an ugly slideware
design contest, as DeVoss has done in a number of her visual rhetoric courses,
can teach students a great deal about document design elements in making vi-

490
                                                                                                           Blair

sual presentations more rhetorically aware. These elements include typography,
color-scheme, and overall consistency, as well as the relationship among image,
text, color, and audio. Inman (2004) developed similar activities with websites,
using the activity to not only enhance students' understanding of design but also
to enhance their recognition that professional-quality design presumes access to
both tools and expertise (p. 216) and can equalize skills among students who
have had such access and those who have not. In addition, the emphasis on
design do's would offer an opportunity to emphasize accessible design strategies,
such as ALT Tags on Web-based images and the need for textual descriptions of
visual content in the content of the site.

Collaborative Rubric Development

    Despite the potential of intuitive knowledge to guide initial discussions of
multimodal assessment, OWI teachers should be prepared to work with students
to shape these conversations into detailed discussions of criteria to be formal-
ized in rubric form, ideally for each multimodal assignment given the differing
technical affordances and skills required for composing with video, audio, or
Web-design tools. As many of us who have developed multimodal assignments
can attest, rubrics and other forms of assessment must include a strong balance
between product and process. This balance may include completion of invention
activities such as storyboards, participation in peer review activities, self-assess-
ments and other forms of progress reporting, Above all, the rubric should func-
tion as a form of "instructive evaluation" that establishes a relationship between
the use of technology to compose in a particular medium and, according to
Borton and Huot (2007), "a course's specific instructional goals and a contex-
tual understanding of other rhetorical constraints and possibilities having to do
with purpose, audience, content, genre, circulation, and organization, as well"
(p. 103).

Peer Studio Review

    Often, our discussion of peer review presumes assessment of print-based
products, even in fully online settings. While we may use free digital collabora-
tion tools or small-group discussion forums in the LMS, formative multimod-
al assessment calls for a broader range of feedback options, ideally customized
to each type of assignment genre, whether it is a website or a video essay. A
common approach for multimodal assignments is the studio review, once again
relying upon interdisciplinary language about production and assessment that
involves the presentation and review by a larger group. Because students have
less familiarity responding to multimodal texts, a good strategy is to have them
respond to sample genres prior to such a studio review. Because not all students

                                                                                                 491
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

may have the same level of access or comfort with a particular technology, it is
important to design activities that allow all students to participate regardless of
how complete their projects are. In my own hybrid courses, I often have provid-
ed in-class studio time to first work on aspects of the project prior to a formal
studio review; when it is time for review, students call up work on the screen and
craft a series of questions for fellow classmates to address about the project as the
group migrates around to different student stations. Assessment then becomes
a co-equal process, with both students and instructor providing frequently con-
sistent advice about next steps for revision, based on shared assessment criteria.
Such a studio review process may not be as logistically viable in a fully online
asynchronous course; nevertheless, it is possible to assign students to peer review
based on similarities in genre, or relative strengths in certain aspects of compos-
ing process, including alphabetic skills, to ensure a rich review of the various
modalities at work in a single artifact.

Revision Plans

    Given the substantial amount of feedback students could receive during a
studio review as described above, the need for synthesis and summary helps to
prioritize next steps in the revision process. As Kara Poe Alexander (2007) has
suggested, the revision process for multimodal texts is far more complex than
the standard alphabetic essay. Regardless of the useful content and format sug-
gestions students receive, the normative timeframes for multimodal assignments
do not always allow for complete overhaul of work. Therefore, having students
create a revision plan summary of the general feedback received, decisions on
what to prioritize, and a general timeline for completion can serve as a useful
self-assessment strategy for both individual and group projects. Additionally, it
helps to have students share these plans publicly in a discussion forum or other
course space (indeed, I have even used social media-based groups for this pur-
pose), as very often, the types of feedback and necessary revisions can help other
students to see that they are not alone in their multimodal composing challenges
and also to get additional strategies for enhancing their own work.

Student Conferences

    Not unlike student discussion board posts where it would be unrealistic--
and not necessarily student-centered--to expect an instructor to respond to each
and every post in every thread throughout the term, it may not be as possible to
respond to every multimodal artifact each student produces in a studio review
environment. For that reason, ensuring one-to-one interaction is crucial in order
to clarify instructor expectations and alleviate students' concerns that they are
making progress toward achieving assignment outcomes. The importance of in-

492
                                                                                                           Blair

structor-student interaction on multimodal work in progress mandates the flex-
ibility on the instructor's part to communicate in whatever modality or media
are most accessible for individual students. While in hybrid OWCs, this com-
munication strategy may include face-to-face and even telephone conferences,
in fully online formats, the possibilities are bountiful depending on access and
comfort level. Free video conferencing software can expedite the conferencing
process, although access might make text-based chat forums a more viable alter-
native. Undoubtedly, student conferences are a significant part of an instructors'
academic labor; some ways to consolidate efforts may include group conferences
organized around genre or other aspects of the composing process.

Electronic Portfolios

    Undoubtedly, electronic portfolios, or ePortfolios, have the potential to play
a vital role in the multimodal composing process in their ability to serve similar
functions to their paper-based counterparts of development over time, self-re-
flection, self-assessment of progress, and summative showcase of rhetorical ac-
complishments. An ePortfolio, as Kathleen Yancey (2004) has suggested, helps
to "remediate" the self, allowing the student designer to use multimodal literacies
to construct a relationship between technology and identity. For Darren Cam-
bridge (2010), "fully embracing them requires finding ways to make ePortfolios
simultaneously serve individual self-actualization and institutional transforma-
tion. Excellence in lifelong learning and assessment are inextricably linked" (p.
11). Cambridge's latter point makes ePortfolios a strong assessment option for
multimodal composing, connecting to Borton and Huot's (2007) emphasis on
instructive assessment. Of course, ePortfolios can be an "easier said than done"
strategy for a lone instructor, and ideally any portfolio initiative for hybrid and
fully online OWC will represent a programmatic collaboration among the WPA
and the instructors. With careful planning, however, instructors and programs
can develop an ePortfolio space even within common LMSs, as Christine Tulley
(2013) documented, although Tulley conceded that these systems are likely to
be augmented with other open source and Web 2.0 tools.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    At the conclusion of The Internship, the film I used to introduce this chapter,
there existed both a predictable happy ending common to the comedy genre
and an important message. The two middle-age protagonists helped their team
and themselves to land the coveted future job at Google, not only as a result of
their emerging tech savvy but also as a result of their strong communication
and rhetorical skills that made them good salespeople in the first place. The

                                                                                                 493

message is not one of either/or but both/and, and as we look to transform our
understanding of writing, we must maintain an understanding of our goal of
equipping students with all available means of persuasion in our OWCs and
their communicative lives beyond them.

    Much of this chapter has focused on the whats and the hows of integrating
multimodality into the online curriculum. But like Warnock's (2009) power-
ful emphasis on the whys of OWI, it is equally important to consider, in this
case, the whys of multimodal composing. Moving beyond a functional view of
multimodal literacy not only aligns technology with rhetoric to foster a critical
citizenry that communicate in a range of media, but in the case of OWI, also
allows students to deploy multimodal genres to critically and rhetorically explore
identity and the role that various tools play in shaping and representing that
identity through a broadened definition of writing.

    Even as I recognize the whys of multimodal composing, in the spirit of both/
and, I concede it is not always possible for programs, instructors, and students to
make every assignment multimodal. What I hope I have provided in this chap-
ter are starting points and options given the access needs, specific curriculum,
instructor expertise, student population, and delivery options unique to readers'
individual OWI contexts. Similar to Warnock's advice, I would begin with the
tools you need and what you can do well. That may mean transforming one
single alphabetic assignment to a visual argument instead, or including a virtual
poster session as part of a collaborative research project. It does not mean making
each and every assignment a high-end technological endeavor for students and
instructors, but it may mean making assignments flexible enough so that stu-
dents have technological and rhetorical choices. Future success for OWI teachers
also involves establishing a professional development plan in which they outline
multimodal composing goals for their students, determining what education
and training is needed on their end to achieve those goals, and seeking out those
resources both on and off campus and both onsite and online. This need not be
an isolated process, however. Dickie Selfe (2007) has advocated "communities of
practice" to ensure that such multimodal initiatives are sustainable over time and
across the writing curriculum and that include instructional support specialists
for instructors and students.

    In attempting to address Griffin and Minter's (2013) important call to pay
attention to the material and ideological conditions of OWI, I have addressed
the possibilities and constraints of integrating multimodal assignments, select-
ing tools and resources, and assessing student success. These efforts are aligned
with Selfe's (2009) point that:

         Composition classrooms can provide a context not only for
         talking about different literacies, but also practicing different

494
                                                                                                           Blair

         literacies, learning to create texts that combine a range of mo-
         dalities as communicative resources: exploring their affordanc-
         es, the special capabilities they offer to authors; identifying
         what audiences expect of texts that deploy different modalities
         and how they respond to such texts. (p. 643)

    Several of the OWI principles stress the ongoing need for instructors and
tutors to communicate with students across modalities and to use digital tools in
developing content for students to consume--clearly transformative processes.
Granted, no one text, regardless of modality, is accessible to all, and instructors
should consider the ways that students can produce multiple versions of texts
(e.g., audio transcripts, video captions, rich description of images, and the like)
to enable critical awareness of audience access needs. Thus, my goal in this chap-
ter has been to suggest representative multimodal writing contexts that enable
students to produce content as twenty-first century composers and to experi-
ment with multiple modes as much as possible to provide access to as many users
as possible. To this end, OWI teachers, in collaboration with WPAs and other
university stakeholders have a vital advocacy role to play to transform learning
outcomes in OWI and face-to-face writing instruction that continue to privilege
alphabetic textual production as the singular mode of rhetorical effectiveness.

    A summary of recommendations toward these goals include:

    · Integrate multimodal assignments at a pace where you and your students
        seem most ready to begin. For example, piloting a visual essay in a partic-
        ular course will help you determine existing challenges and future skills
        required the next time around.

    · Align multimodal assignment genres with rhetorical outcomes of pur-
        pose, audience, development, organization, and style; help students un-
        derstand why an audio essay, for instance, is a more viable choice with
        some audiences (and for some rhetors).

    · Make assignments flexible enough that students could complete multi-
        modal composing tasks using a range of tools to which they may have
        more consistent access than the ones you initially suggest.

    · Develop flexible assessment processes, understanding that because of
        the learning curve involved, students' initial multimodal efforts may be
        messy and may not represent the ideal response you had in mind.

    · Provide as many resources, websites, campus IT services, and other forms
        of documentation and training to students who will be completing these
        assignments independently and from a distance.

    · Include opportunities for student self-assessment of their progress, as
        such opportunities that not only help them to reflect on their growth

                                                                                                 495
Teaching Multimodal Assignments in OWI Contexts

        in aptitude and attitude but that also help instructors to understand the
        assignment difficulties and any resulting need for modifications.
    · Begin your own professional development plan for integrating multimo-
        dality. What do you need to know to effectively align the technological
        and the rhetorical? How are you going to get there?

OWI ON THE GO

      Rochelle Rodrigo
      Old Dominion University

        A growing number of students own smartphones and tablets, some of
        whom use those devices as their primary Internet connection. To account
        for this trend, OWI administrators and instructors need to support stu-
        dents accessing and completing OWCs through their mobile devices.
        OWI WPAs should research the students of their own programs and di-
        alogue with IT administrators to learn how to support students on their
        mobile devices. OWI programs need to develop an ongoing professional
        development community that helps faculty and staff explore and under-
        stand the various devices students bring to their learning endeavors. OWC
        instructors need to design instructional content for delivery on the typ-
        ically smaller screens of mobile devices. To this end, they might use the
        need for supporting a myriad of hardware and software as well as the
        affordances of mobile connectivity as an exigency for designing both low-
        stakes and major course assignments using or about mobile devices.

        Keywords: digital divide, mobile, multimodal, professional development,
        smartphone, support, tablet

    In September 2013, EDUCAUSE's annual Study of Undergraduate Stu-
dents and Information Technology stated that "ownership of smartphones
and tablets jumped the most (among all devices from 2012-13)" (Dahlstrom,
Walker, & Dziuban, 2013, p. 24) and that students' "ownership of laptops and
smartphones exceeds that of the general adult population" (p. 25). In short,
undergraduate students in higher education are already mobile; therefore, OWI
Principle 1, with its call for universal inclusivity and accessibility (pp. 7-11), re-
quires that OWI WPAs and instructors start going mobile as well. Knowing who
owns smartphones is not enough; OWI Principle 2 reminds us that OWI should
focus on writing, not teaching the technology unless the rhetoric of technology
is part of the course outcomes (pp. 7-11; also see Chapter 14). Indeed, OWI
WPAs and faculty need to understand how smartphone owners use the devices
as well. A recent Pew Internet-focused study has noted a "mobile difference":

         Once someone has a wireless device, she becomes much more

OWI on the Go

         active in how she uses the Internet-not just with wireless
         connectivity, but also with wired devices. The same holds true
         for the impact of wireless connections and people's interest in
         using the Internet to connect with others. (Zichuhr & Smith,
         2012, p. 14)

    WPAs and OWI teachers deserve credit for all the hard work they already do;
however, the shift to smaller, Internet-connecting mobile devices will need both
groups to remain committed to writing instruction (OWI Principle 2) while
adapting to and adopting strategies for the growing number of students using
mobile devices (OWI Principle 1). This chapter uses the discussion of mobile de-
vices--their prevalence in higher education, the ways in which they complicate
OWI, and suggestions for ways to incorporate mobile learning into OWI--to
continue complicating the tension between OWI Principle 1 and OWI Principle
2, as discussed in Chapters 1, 4, 8, 9, 10, and 14 (pp. 7-11).

ON THE GO: MOBILE DEVICES IN HIGHER EDUCATION

    In The Mobile Academy, Clark N. Quinn (2012) discussed four capabilities
of mobile devices to consider when thinking about teaching and learning in
online settings: storing and accessing content, capturing materials, computing and
manipulating digital data, and communicating (pp. 17-18). These affordances
emphasize the core communicative--dare I say, rhetorical--nature of mobile
devices. As smartphones and tablets become increasingly popular for day-to-
day business and personal communications through the Internet, why wouldn't
composition instructors be teaching mobile communication strategies in writing
courses generally and accounting for mobile learning strategies in OWCs par-
ticularly?

    This call is not new; in 2009, Amy Kimme Hea, the editor of Going Wireless,
claimed that composition teachers and researchers needed to pay attention to
mobile devices and their quickly evolving nature. However, as the iPhone had
just been released in 2007, most of the chapters within Hea's collection discussed
the impact of laptops, as well as cellphones and/or PDAs occasionally. Although
many of the critical arguments found in Going Wireless are relevant to smart-
phones, smartphones are impacting our culture in slightly different ways that
make investigating them separately or differently from how we examine laptops,
especially in terms of OWI, a required endeavor.

    The New Media Consortium's (NMC) and the National Learning Infrastruc-
ture Initiative's (a group within EDUCAUSE) second Horizon Report (2005)
projected "ubiquitous wireless" as a technology within the one year or less time-

500
                                                                                                       Rodrigo

to-adoption within higher education. Although they were discussing laptops,
handhelds, and cell phones (p. 9)--not explicitly discussing smartphone or tab-
let usage--it is quickly becoming obvious that the NMC and EDUCAUSE
have had a clear view of the importance of mobile devices in higher education
long before many OWI-focused WPAs and teachers; they particularly consid-
ered devices ranging from "larger" laptops to more personalized and smaller cell
phones, tablets, and smartphones.

    Thinking about mobile devices in higher education is no longer about look-
ing forward to change; instead, it is about reconciling with technological chang-
es that have been occurring over the past decade as Internet connection devices
have become smaller, more personalized, and more prevalent--currently sta-
bilizing in the shape of the smartphone (a cell phone with its own operating
system and Internet connectivity through both cellular and Wi-Fi networks).
This reconciliation with mobile technologies is at the heart of OWI Principle
1, making sure OWI is designed and delivered in a way to include participants
accessing OWCs with dominant technologies--which now includes mobile de-
vices (pp. 7-11).

    Aaron Smith's (2012a) March, 2012 Pew Internet and American Life report
announced a tipping point: Suddenly, there were more smartphone than regu-
lar cell phone users; 46% of Americans owned smartphones with 41% owning
other phones (p. 2). Since then, the numbers have only increased. The Nielsen
Company (2013b) announced in March, 2013 that 59% of Americans owned
smartphones (p. 17). Ownership numbers are higher among traditional col-
lege-aged people: 66% ownership 18-29 year olds (Smith, 2012a, p. 5). Ad-
ditionally, income and educational attainment are not as significant with this
younger-aged group; in other words, individuals under 30 years of age are more
likely to own smartphones whether or not they make more than $30,000 and/
or have some college experience (p. 5). Although these numbers are outdated
even as I write this chapter (e.g., as soon as September 2012, six months after
Smith's report above, Lee Rainie's (2012a) September, 2012 report from the Pew
Foundation emphasized both youth and higher income brackets as markers of
smartphone ownership), and definitely by the time this book is published, the
data still demonstrate important trends for faculty and administrators of OWI
programs.

    OWI Principle 1 specifically addressed the digital divide with concerns about
"technological equality" and the financial accessibility of technologies required
by an OWC. Ownership statistics about smartphones flip some commons as-
sumptions about technological equality and accessibility. Age and education are
not the only markers of smartphone ownership. In March, 2013, The Nielsen
Company (2013b) announced the following smartphone ownership patterns

                                                                                                 501
OWI on the Go

by ethnicity: White 55%, African American 68%, Hispanic 68%, and Asian
74% (p. 17). One of the Pew studies (Zickuhr & Smith, 2012) more eloquently
stated:

         Groups that have traditionally been on the other side of
         the digital divide in basic Internet access are using wireless
         connections to go online. Among smartphone owners, young
         adults, minorities, those with no college experience, and those
         with lower household income levels are more likely than other
         groups to say that their phone is their main source of Internet
         access. (p. 2)

    A few months later in June, A. Smith (2012b) claimed that "55% cell phone
users use their phone to go online" and 17% "go online mostly on cell phone"
(p. 2). By March 2013, a Pew report claimed that 74% of teens ages 12-17 ac-
cess the Internet on mobile devices "at least occasionally" and "one in four teens
are `cell-mostly' Internet users" (Zickuhr, Rainie, Purcell, Madden & Brenner,
2013, p. 2). In October 2012, Rainie's (2012c) report from Pew discussed Pew's
need to change how they ask about and define Internet usage. Although they
added a question that "counts" mobile Internet usage, it did not increase the
number of American Internet users in a statistically significant manner (p. 2).
However, Rainie acknowledged that there are "demographic differences when
mobile connectivity is added" (p. 2).

    Studies of undergraduate smartphone ownership generally parallel national
studies of technology ownership. During their 2008 annual national study of
undergraduate students and information technology, EDUCAUSE stopped ask-
ing about basic cell phone ownership (Smith, Salaway & Caruso, 2009, p. 87).
As of 2012, 62% of undergraduate students owned smartphones and "nearly
twice as many in 2012 (67%) than in 2011 (37%) reported using their smart-
phone for academic purposes" (Dahlstrom, 2012, p. 14). In 2012, students also
reported a growth in tablet ownership and a leveling off of e-reader ownership
(p. 15) with many using the devices for academic work--67% and 47% re-
spectively (p. 14). According to Eden Dahlstrom and Stephen diFilipo (2013),
in 2012, students brought on average at least two Internet-capable devices to
campuses; they projected that by 2014, students would be bringing more than
three devices (p. 10).

    Although studies from Pew and Nielsen may reveal data that can overturn
how most faculty understand the socio-economic digital divide, EDUCAUSE's
data remind scholars that a digital divide still exists. In 2011, "students at asso-
ciate's colleges and other two-year programs [were] more likely to own `station-
ary' technologies, such as desktop computers" (Dobbin, Dahlstrom, Arroway, &

502
                                                                                                       Rodrigo

Sheehan, 2011, p. 9). The 2012 report specifically discussed smartphone own-
ership:

         There are some significant differences in the demographics or
         institution type of undergraduate students who own smart-
         phones but the field is equal for age and gender. Students
         who said they use their smartphones for academics, however,
         tended to be non-white (p <0.0001>), were not freshman/
         first-year or sophomore/second-year students (p <0.0001) and
         were presently attending four-year institutions as opposed to
         an AA institution (p<0.0001). (Dahlstrom, 2012, p. 15)

    Whereas all the data demonstrate an increased trend of smartphone owner-
ship across all demographics, knowing specific populations within specific con-
texts obviously is important.

    Although student ownership of smartphones and other Internet capable mo-
bile devices is up, Gartner's 2012 Hype Cycle1 report for Education (Lowendahl,
2012) put both "mobile-learning" and "mobile-learning smartphones" in the
"sliding into the trough of disillusionment" portion of the chart (i.e., as people
have spent more time with the technology, they now have overcome the "peak
of inflated expectations" and have lower expectations about what, how, and why
the technology will work successfully). Based on almost ten years of predictions
in The New Media Consortium's Horizon Reports (2005-2013), faculty in higher
education should not be surprised with Gartner's placement of mobile-learn-
ing--small screens and tiny keyboards are not surprisingly challenging tools for
writing lengthy papers, for example. However, just because mobile-learning is
not new and people have adjusted their expectations does not mean we should
be ignoring mobile technologies when discussing online learning. The statistics
from Pew, Nielsen, and EDUCAUSE above demonstrate that a majority of our
students have smartphones and a growing number own e-readers and tablets
as well. As mobile-learning moves towards Gartner's "slope of enlightenment"
and the "plateau of productivity," now is the perfect time to critically strategize
mobile-learning in relation to OWI.

    Both Pew studies as well as reports from The Nielsen Company emphasized
the rise of the "connected viewer" (Smith & Boyles, 2012) who moves between
screens "watching across different platforms including both mobile and tablet
devices" (The Nielsen Company, 2013b). These are the same type of habits
scholars already have tracked with students doing academic work (e.g., Dodd &
Antonenko, 2012; Ihanainen & Moravec, 2011; Laffey, Amelung, & Goggins,
2009). However, whereas much of the scholarship about teaching and learning
implies a distracted student, especially by social media (e.g., Fewkes & McCabe,

                                                                                                 503

2012), A. Smith and Jan Lauren Boyles (2012) discussed how television viewers
were checking data or websites introduced on television, as well as discussing
and see what others had to say about a particular program (p. 2)--these evalu-
ative processes and informed communications are some of the many behaviors
we ask of "information literate" students (Association of College and Research
Libraries, 2000). Kathryn Zickuhr and A. Smith's Pew study (2012) emphasized
how Black, non-Hispanic, and Hispanic groups are more likely to use various
functionalities of their smartphones like accessing the Internet; taking, sending,
and receiving photos; playing music, games, and videos; as well as doing online
"business" like social networking, banking, or video calling/chatting (p. 21).
Rainie's (2012b) Pew report also discussed similar differences across race/ethnic-
ity; however, the gap was quickly closing even then. Again, these mobile com-
municative activities speak to both OWI Principle 1 (accessibility) and OWI
Principle 2 (focus on writing) and can be included as part of the content covered
in OWI courses (pp. 7-11).

    EDUCAUSE's annual reports of undergraduate and information technology
also documented how and why students use their devices. As early as 2009, over
50% of the owners of Internet-capable handheld devices were checking informa-
tion, e-mailing, using social networking sites, and instant messaging (Smith et
al., 2009, p. 95). Over 20% of the undergraduates polled were also conducting
personal business, downloading/streaming music, and downloading/watching
videos (p. 95). By 2010, using maps via satellite had jumped to over 50%, and
those activities that had been at 20% usage increased to over 30% (Smith &
Caruso, 2010, p. 60). In 2010, students rated the following mobile technologies
as "extremely valuable" for academic success: laptop computer at 81%, netbook
at 46%, smartphone at 33%, e-reader at 33%, mobile/cell phone at 32%, tablet
(not iPad) at 26%, and iPad at 24% (p. 16).

    When the CCCC OWI Committee conducted their surveys about fully on-
line and hybrid/blended writing instruction (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a
& 2011b, respectively), they did not list mobile technologies as an option in
their question about "which virtual tools and online teaching strategies" instruc-
tors use; however, the survey was conducted in 2010, only two years after ED-
UCAUSE stopped asking about cell phone ownership. Although the surveys
shortsightedly did not provide the option, one individual wrote in "mobile blog-
ging" while many short answers to open-ended questions discussed using phone
calls and conferences as a strategy.

    In short, mobile devices--especially handheld, personalized devices like
smartphones and tablets--are here to stay, and they are used for educational
purposes. With their general functionalities that emphasize various literate prac-
tices (e.g., reading, writing, image and video viewing), as well as the growing

number of individuals that use mobile devices as their primary access to the
Internet, WPAs and OWI teachers should be planning for mobile-learning now.

READY, SET, GO: MOBILE DEVICES AND OWI

    As indicated, the basis for this chapter is OWI Principle 1, which stated,
"Online writing instruction should be universally inclusive and accessible" (p. 7)
Specifically, Effective Practice 1.6, an example strategy for providing that access
and inclusivity, reminded instructors that students may use mobile devices to
access OWCs; however, the statistics above demonstrate that students may be
doing more than just accessing the course materials. While a growing number
of individuals use their mobile devices as their primary means of accessing the
Internet, instructors need to be prepared for students who both may want, even
need, to access and actively participate in the class from their mobile device. And
OWI instructors are not alone because the institution and any student support
service (i.e., IT, LMS, OWL, advising, and the like) also should be prepared to
support students accessing their online resources and services through mobile
devices (see OWI Principle 13, pp. 26-28; and Chapters 5 & 8). In other words,
the digital divide works both ways; educators need to support the "haves" as well
as the "have nots."

    There are a variety of ways that student uses of mobile devices impact the
understanding and interpretations of the different OWI principles. Although
OWC instructors should focus on writing, not the technologies, as explained
in OWI Principle 2 (p. 11), the reality is many instructors still need to support
their student's technological interface with the course, which is primary to put-
ting access first, as advocated in OWI Principle 1 (p. 7). For example, many
experienced OWI teachers probably have scripts of texts reminding students
that the current version of the LMS works better in a particular browser. With
the rise of mobile use, instructors--ideally through their institutions--will need
to make students aware of whether or not their institution's LMS has a mobile
application as well as on which mobile operating systems that application runs.
Studies have shown that students greatly prefer accessing their course materials
from a native mobile app versus the mobile Web browser (Bowen & Pistilli,
2012, p. 7). Many companies first develop their applications for the iOS, Apple's
mobile operating system, since it does not run Flash; they leave Android, and
now Windows, mobile users working through the mobile device's regular Web
browser. Indeed, just because the LMS has a mobile application does not mean
that the application includes all of the functionality required to complete an
OWC course. Many first attempts at LMS mobile applications result in func-
tionality that only allows the students to access and consume course material,

                                                                                                 505

as opposed to producing and uploading their writing. Many institutions have
labeled "facilitating anytime, anywhere access to course materials for students
[as] a high or essential priority" (Dahlstrom & diFilipo, 2013, p. 33); however,
that does not necessarily mean students would be able to use the various in-
teractive functionalities like posting and responding in discussion boards and/
or uploading assignments. Verifying an LMS's mobile app does not take into
consideration whether the app itself is accessible, in the more traditional sense
of the term, to students with different auditory or visibility abilities. Just as with
computers, there is hardware and software that makes various applications more
accessible in mobile environment; does the OWI LMS and course materials
interface with those apps?

    Even if the LMS or other required course applications are available in a mo-
bile environment, it does not necessarily mean that a student's mobile device is
prepared to handle the application. Just as with software, different applications
and media have different hardware, software, and Internet connectivity require-
ments. OWCs that require accessing videos or synchronous meetings might re-
quire large amounts of bandwidth. Students may not have access to a robust
enough Wi-Fi network or they may not have purchased a large enough data plan
from their mobile service provider. Writing programs will need to warn students
in advance of the technological requirements, not only in terms of hardware and
software, but also in terms of bandwidth and media/modalities.

    Especially after trying to access their own courses from within a mobile en-
vironment, instructors may find that they need to be even more careful about
course design and delivery for smaller screens. Not only should OWI instructors
think about alphabetic text delivery, writing shorter, chunky paragraphs (OWI
Effective Practice 3.3, pp. 12-13); they also might think about the ability, or
lack thereof, for mobile device users to move back and forth between different
sections of the course or assigned texts. Mobile devices might not allow students
to move easily between tabbed browser pages or have two word processing doc-
uments open, one with notes and the other with drafted text. In looking to a
future of more mobile devices and students accessing higher education through
them, instructors and scholars would do well to start thinking about, experi-
menting with, and sharing strategies for composing in different environments,
including the affordances and constraints found with mobile hardware and soft-
ware.

    Onsite and OWI teachers also need to consider that if a student's prima-
ry computer is, in fact, her mobile device, she might be drafting entire papers
with her thumbs. Similarly, although the word processing programs on mobile
devices are becoming increasingly sophisticated, students still might struggle to
handle more complex formatting requirements like hanging indents for bib-

506
                                                                                                       Rodrigo

liographic citations. Whereas OWI teachers traditionally have not been as con-
cerned with students finding proctored computer labs to take high stakes tests,
faculty need to help students realize that final formatting of papers likely needs
to happen on a "regular" computer with a fully functional word processing pro-
gram. As with the nontraditional students discussed in Chapter 10, the solution
for these students may be the public library if they do not have alternate access
at home or work and if the campus is geographically too distant. Although this
may require more work on the student's part and creative, patient support from
the instructor (especially at a distance), it also represents an opportunity to em-
phasize core instructional principles about teaching and learning writing--in
this case, emphasizing multiple drafts as a productive part of a writing process.

    Although there may have been the illusion that instructors could somehow
"know" all of the interface possibilities with their online courses while students
were primarily using full-function computers (e.g., desktops or laptops), the
various makes, models, and operating systems within the world of mobile de-
vices definitely makes it impossible for any individual instructor to know how a
student's device will interface with the course material. The CCCC OWI Com-
mittee certainly is not asking such an impossibility of teachers. Although OWI
Principles 2 and 10 emphasize that institutions should be the ones supporting
student technology use (pp. 7, 21-23), respondents to the surveys about fully
online and hybrid/blended OWI emphatically agreed about the need for "pro-
viding reasonable support to students for succeeding in the online environment"
(CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a, 2011b). To provide this type of support to
the growing number of students using mobile devices, or at least having faculty
reasonably aware of some of the major issues that might occur when their OWC
interacts with popular mobile devices and operating systems, WPAs will need to
advocate for institutional support of students, faculty, and programs per OWI
Principle 12 (pp. 24-26).

    One final problem--for now--regarding the issue of OWI in mobile en-
vironments is the WPAs' and OWI teachers' general lack of awareness of mo-
bile computing with respect to OWCs. Since many of these individuals cannot
imagine taking an online course and/or writing an entire paper on a mobile
device, especially a small-screened device, they disavow the fact that students
actually are doing a lot of work, sometimes a majority of their work, on mobile
devices. Even with evidence like that presented at the beginning of this chapter,
many faculty and administrators cannot imagine that their students fit into this
category. Hence, WPAs and their OWI faculty cannot begin to discuss what
might constitute "reasonable" support for online learners using mobile devices if
they are not aware of the students in their programs. Just as A Position Statement
of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI concluded that folks in an

                                                                                                 507
OWI on the Go

OWC should be committed to ongoing research (OWI Principle 15, pp. 31-
32), this chapter now ends the discussion of potential problems and starts the
discussion of solutions and recommendations, beginning with the suggestion
that writing programs specifically research the types of hardware and software
students are using in their OWCs--and, in many cases, may be using in their
onsite courses as well.

AWAY WE GO: OWI AND MOBILE DEVICES

    Organizations like Pew, Nielsen, and EDUCAUSE are regularly collecting
and publishing data about mobile device ownership and usage patterns. These
organizations, as well as higher education administrators, instructors--even this
author--can get caught up in the positivistic rhetoric produced by business and
industry. WPAs and instructors of OWCs should collect similar data so that they
can talk more precisely about the mobile needs of their program, per the research
suggestions of OWI Principle 15 (pp. 31-32). Writing programs (again, students
use these devices in onsite courses, too) probably should collect more than just
ownership and basic usage data; access is more than just having the hardware and
software, but also entails knowing how to use it flexibly. Researchers can begin
identifying students with whom they might conduct more robust, even longitu-
dinal, studies and about how students learn and write in a mobile environments.
Beyond researching and exploring the specific contextual needs of their program
so that they are universally inclusive and accessible, administrators and instruc-
tors of OWCs should think about how to engage with pedagogical, professional
development, and institutional support issues related to mobile learning.

Good to Go: OWI and Mobile Pedagogy

    Most of the pedagogical suggestions below attempt to balance the need to
make OWI inclusive and accessible, as stated in OWI Principle 1 (pp. 7-11),
while still staying focused on the instruction of writing, per OWI Principle 2
over teaching technology or attempting to become versatile in all of the tech-
nologies students may use (p. 7). In many cases, the pedagogical suggestions fall
within OWI Principle 3 by taking unique features of mobile learning to design
OWI instructional materials and activities (pp. 12-14).

    Michael G. Moore and Greg Kearsley (1996) claimed that in distance learn-
ing there are different types of interaction: learner-to-content, learner-to-in-
structor, and learner-to-learner. When instructors of OWCs acknowledge that
a growing number of students will be accessing and participating in the course
via a mobile device with a smaller screen and probably slower connection speeds

508
                                                                                                       Rodrigo

(Cheon, Lee, Crooks, & Song, 2012, p. 1060), they need to plan these interac-
tions accordingly. If the majority of the interactions are asynchronous, speed is
not as high of a concern; however, in a culture that privileges speed and efficien-
cy, having a "slow" course reflects poorly upon both the instructor and the insti-
tution. To meet the needs of students accessing the course via mobile devices, in-
structors need to make sure course content is downloadable in bite-size chunks.
To facilitate learner-to-instructor and learner-to-learner interaction, instructors
should try to work with the methods and applications that are more streamlined
on the students' mobile devices; this workaround implies that instructors will
survey students at the beginning of the semester to find out what hardware and
software or applications they are using to access and participate in the course.

    In other words, as students continue to use a growing variety of hardware
and software options to access the online course, they will need help understand-
ing and reflecting upon their individualized learning experience. Besides indi-
viduality, Eric Klopfer, Kurt Squire, and Henry Jenkins (2002) identified four
more properties of mobile devices that can impact teaching and learning writ-
ing online: portability, social interactivity, context sensitivity, and connectivity.
These characteristics describe certain affordances and constraints of designing
OWCs with mobile learning in mind. Considering portability means that not
only can online learning take place anywhere, instructors specifically can require
that OWI take place in a multitude of locations; instructors can ask students
to identify context-specific examples of different rhetorical acts and/or other
communicative texts (e.g., advertisements on billboards, pamphlets in medi-
cal offices). Many mobile devices are geo-spatially aware; faculty might include
reflections of analyzing (as well as producing) texts that account for specific
geo-spatial coordinates or other information. For example, faculty might have
students collaboratively construct maps with content that is tagged with specific
location information. Mobile devices allow OWI teachers not only to design for
distance learning but for location-specific composition as well. And, since the
devices are connected, instructors can ask for students to interact asynchronous-
ly or synchronously from within different environments, especially using social
media or document-sharing applications; while discussing mobile composition,
Olin Bjork and John Pedro Schwartz (2009) reminded us that "where students
write determines not only what they write but also what they write with" (p.
225). Now, more than ever, this thinking is apt.

    Ultimately, the online writing instructor should be focusing on teaching
writing, not teaching technology (OWI Principle 2, p. 7); however, as students
use an increasingly diverse set of hardware and software to access and engage
course materials, OWI instructors do need to account for technical support.
Effective practices emphasize that institutional IT staff should help support stu-

                                                                                                 509
OWI on the Go

dents' learning and using the required course technologies; however; OWI facul-
ty might want to incorporate low-stakes learn-the-technology assignments where
students safely can explore how they will interact in a specific course with their
individual devices. These types of activities will help all students practice access-
ing course materials with their specific hardware, like smaller screened mobile
devices, and/or software, like screen readers. And although students may appear
to know how to work their mobile devices, they may only know how to send text
messages and post Facebook updates. The 2012 EDUCAUSE undergraduate
students and IT report explicitly claimed that "even though most students felt
prepared to use technology upon entry, most also said they need or want more
technology training or skills" (Dahlstrom, 2012, p. 22). Although it is not the
explicit responsibility of OWI teachers to increase their students' techno-liter-
acies, doing so can be considered within their purview as writing-as-rhetoric
teachers (see Chapter 14, for example). On a practical level, historically, writing
instructors have had to accept this task in terms of educating their students
about specific communications technologies, especially concerning advanced
formatting features in word processing programs, which is one reason that OWI
teachers asked for a guideline such as OWI Principle 2 to begin with (p. 7).
Providing low-stakes opportunities to understand better how a student's device
interacts with the different course technologies and materials, and then repeat-
ing the activities (OWI Effective Practice 3.6, p. 13), can help to avoid major
crises during later high-stakes assignments. It is helpful, therefore, to make sure
students understand that testing technologies in advance is a techno-literacy skill
with learning benefits for students and instructors alike. For example, should
the mobile device fail to be usable for a particular assignment, the students who
tested their technologies will know that they need to access a different device
to complete the work. More importantly, testing technologies in advance is a
techno-literacy administrators need to understand as well. The first day of class
is too late for students to realize the computer they plan to use for their OWC
will not suffice. Administrators need to construct a system that makes students
aware of the technological requirements of OWCs and allows students to test
their computers and mobile devices prior to enrolling in the OWC per OWI
Principle 10 (pp. 21-23; see also Chapter 13).

    Learn-the-technology assignments need not only be low-stakes or assigned
to individual students; OWI teachers can design major assignments that ask all
students to take responsibility for learning and supporting their own comput-
ing devices. Based on the course modality, OWI students already will be more
aware about how they interface with different technologies--or, their teachers
can endeavor to make them so. Minimally, faculty can adapt typical technical
or professional writing "instructions" assignment for OWI learn-the-technology

510

assignments. Grouping students who own similar devices would allow them to
share resources and support one another as well as to develop support commu-
nities that foster student success per OWI Principle 11 (pp. 23-24). This type of
activity by no means excuses instructors and institutions from supporting stu-
dents' technology issues (i.e., they can share resources located and developed by
instructors and/or the institution); instead, it makes online technology support
per OWI Principle 13 (pp. 26-28) a collaborative endeavor--the way it often is
in business and industry.

    Beyond merely being prepared for students using mobile devices in OWCs
(OWI Principle 1, pp. 7-11), mobile devices offer certain affordances that pos-
itively support writing instruction (OWI Principle 2, p. 7). Mobile devices al-
ready are multimodal pocket notebooks that should be leveraged so that stu-
dents can record images, sounds, video, and traditional alphabetic text while
they are out and about in the world. Instructors can ask students to find and
record examples of course concepts or to accumulate a digital pile of multimodal
invention or research notes. Clay Spinuzzi (2009) stated that the "genie's out of
the bottle" and students already are using their mobile devices to record "news"
in the real world; OWI should prompt students to use mobile devices to "re-
cord" and write the world as well.

    As it is likely that many-to-most students in the OWC own mobile devices
of some kind--despite their choice to use more traditional and potentially more
manageable technologies for their classes--some assignments can ask the entire
class to consider and use a mobile device. For example, mobile devices might
be used to help emphasize different possible steps in any given writing process
and/or different canon of rhetoric. Johndan Johnson-Eilola and Stuart A. Sel-
ber (2009) proposed the "3CT" framework to help students analyze and reflect
production processes in terms of context, change, content, and tools. As indi-
cated in Chapter 14, students and instructors can use the variety of production,
publication, and consumption devices as a way to discuss the rhetorical appro-
priateness of a composition process and/or product. Discussing with students
how final formatting might require a different environment, maybe even a dif-
ferent hardware and/or software application, helps to emphasize the distinction
between drafting and global level revision with final formatting, editing, and
delivery or publication. Asking students to write in different environments can
help to "foster awareness of their social, cultural, and historical locations" (Bjork
& Schwartz, 2009, p. 231).

    Mobile devices are, at their core, communication environments where an in-
creasing amount of "business," both inside and outside of higher education, gets
done. Having students compose and deliver mobile-friendly genres (i.e., emails,
social media posts and responses, even digital images and videos with basic ed-

                                                                                                 511
OWI on the Go

iting) from their devices in a critically sound and reflective manner promotes
a variety of twenty-first century and multimedia literacies (National Council
of Teachers of English, 2013). Students might even conduct research on how
communication practices in their field, discipline, and/or future profession have
been impacted by mobile devices. In other words, with mobile devices student
might both take the OWI course as well as complete the OWI writing assign-
ments.

    Considering that many smartphone users access the Internet from their
smartphones for information, especially just-in-time and location/activity spe-
cific (Dahlstrom, 2012; The Nielsen Company, 2013a; Rainie & Fox, 2012;
Smith & Boyles, 2012), it makes sense to add a layer of discussions and activi-
ties around accessing, evaluating, and using electronic resources. The Pew study
"How Teens Do Research in the Digital World" (Purcell et al., 2012) claimed
that both "teachers and students alike report that for today's students, `research'
means `Googling'" (p. 3). In that same report, 42% of the instructors who said
they had their students use cell phones in the classroom said that they had stu-
dents look up information during class (p. 32). Beyond teaching mobile-adapt-
ed information literacy skills, OWC instructors that require students to access
and use library databases for their research projects might need to verify that the
institution's databases are adequately designed for mobile interfaces and/or sug-
gest that students find alternative Internet access (e.g. institutional and library
computer labs) for such work.

    Many of the social media applications readily available for mobile devices
promote community building per OWI Principle 11 (pp. 24) as well as sharing
and providing feedback on specific texts. There are a multitude of mobile appli-
cations that promote sharing and communicating about texts; these applications
easily could support both peer and instructor reviews and comments of works
in progress as well as final drafts. In discussing major methods for incorporating
social media (most of which have at least one mobile application) into teaching
and learning, Tanya Joosten (2012) specifically mentioned increasing commu-
nication and encouraging contact, developing a richer learning environment,
and building cooperation and feedback through dialogue.

    Learning from a mobile device has some challenges, as one could easily sur-
mise. A. Smith (2012c) reported that survey participants said mobile phones
can make "it harder to give people your undivided attention" and more difficult
"to focus on a single task without being distracted." Some scholarship about dis-
tance learning already has discussed the need for students to be highly focused,
extremely motivated, and self-regulated learners (e.g., Artino & Jones, 2012;
Briggs & Wagner, 1997; Harnet, St. George, & Dron, 2011; see also Chapter
13); and it appears that distance students participating in their online cours-

512
                                                                                                       Rodrigo

es through mobile devices may need to be even more focused. Requiring that
students monitor and reflect upon their own time management may help with
these issues; there are mobile applications that students can use to help manage
and monitor time management.

Gotta Go: OWI Professional Development and Mobile Devices

    These pedagogical suggestions cannot simply be added on top the responsibil-
ities of an OWI teacher. While the following discussion begins to add to faculty
professional development workload, it also provides suggestions for how OWI
WPAs and faculty might start learning about mobile learning per OWI Principle 7
(pp. 17-19). According to data collected by the CCCC OWI Committee (2011c),
most instructors of fully online and blended/hybrid courses have participated in
some formal training for online teaching and online course design; however, most
have not worked with instructional technology specialists or collaborated with col-
leagues to help design a course. Respondents also mentioned some of the follow-
ing types of activities as "essential" for faculty training: sharing/interaction with
peers and colleagues, training taught by other faculty, informal/group discussions,
faculty mentorship and collaboration, and support network. Developing collegial
and casual faculty and staff learning communities can provide the continual pro-
fessional development opportunities OWI need, especially to adapt to continu-
ously changing technologies like the variety of mobile devices (Harrington, Rickly,
& Day, 2000; Hewett & Ehmann, 2004; Rodrigo, 2009).

    Based on the need to be universally inclusive and accessible, WPAs and faculty
in OWI programs need to become increasingly aware of how any of the required
technologies function in different types of mobile environments. Instead of pas-
sively waiting to see how the LMS or packaged textbook website will manage mo-
bile devices, OWI administrators and faculty need to engage actively in discussions
with representatives from IT and the LMS companies. Faculty and staff from the
institution can consider combining the need to aggressively test and engage dif-
ferent types of mobile devices with faculty professional development. Faculty with
different makes and models of mobile devices can test the various applications and
share the results with the rest of the writing program and institution.

    Instructors, even institutional IT departments, cannot possibly know and
support every make, model, and operating system of mobile devices; instead,
administrators, WPAs, and faculty, as well as other technical and student sup-
port personal, should embrace the diversity of devices. To help increase aware-
ness regarding the functionality of different devices, institutions might develop
faculty and staff learning communities that continuously explore pedagogical
affordances as well as other topics, issues, and policies related to mobile learning.

                                                                                                 513
OWI on the Go

Within a large enough group, faculty and staff hopefully will own different mod-
els of devices. They can play within online course environments and share the re-
sults of working within specific LMSs and other learning applications. Similarly,
meeting and dialoging as a group allows faculty to share not only experiences
and instructions on how to function within a given device or application but the
opportunity to discuss pedagogical reasons and ideas for critically incorporating
and supporting mobile devices. The group can start to collect, develop, and
share resources collaboratively.

    In short, most of these ideas about building community to support OWI
faculty learning about and incorporating mobile learning into their pedagogical
strategies, suggest a twist of OWI Principle 11: Online writing teachers and their
institutions should develop personalized and interpersonal online communities to
foster student and faculty success (pp. 23-24).

Here Goes: Institutions Supporting Mobile Devices and OWI

    In an EDUCAUSE report discussing how to best support mobile growth on
campuses, Eden Dahlstrom, Tom de Boor, Peter Grunwalk, and Martha Vockley
(2011) emphasized the need for a "balanced approach to mobile development"
that accounts for developing resources for the mobile Web, native apps, and/or
mobile frameworks (p. 5). In a Gartner report about Bring Your Own Device
(BYOD) strategies in the workplace, David A. Willis (2012) similarly empha-
sized a balanced approach that goes beyond just the technology that includes
"policy, software, infrastructure controls and education in the near term, and
with application management and appropriate cloud services in the longer term"
(p. 2). Especially if OWI administrators have collected data about mobile device
ownership and usage patterns in their specific programs, they will be prepared to
have meaningful conversations with the Chief Information Officer (CIO) and
other IT administrators at their institutions. CIOs in higher education know
that mobility matters and to continue moving forward they must collaborate
with administrators and faculty. In a discussion about IT in higher education
in 2020, symposium participants most commonly identified faculty as institu-
tional stakeholders (p. 6) and that CIO's need to be "date-maker[s]" to facilitate
productive collaborations (Grajek & Pirani, 2012). To help the institution de-
velop mobile learning support mechanisms so that OWI instructors can focus
on the teaching of writing per OWI Principle 2 (p. 7), OWI administrators and
instructors should reach out to the IT leaders on their campus to proactively
start these discussions.

    No matter what, if campuses are sincerely promoting a BYOD environment,
they need to make sure that student introductions to LMS environments do not

514
                                                                                                       Rodrigo

assume the use of any given device, browser, or application. Instead, institution-
al introductory materials should promote both the teaching and learning of the
environment by both demonstrating what the environment should generally
look and function like, and, more importantly, provide learning activities that
prompt students to engage in the environment from and with their own devices.
When asked about the delivery format of student orientation for fully online
and/or hybrid/blended courses, the respondents to the CCCC OWI Commit-
tee's surveys implied that most of the options, especially those offered by the
institution, were extremely static, lacking any opportunity for students to inter-
act and play with the online learning environments (CCCC OWI Committee,
2011c). Students needed time and prompting to explore how to use the specific
online learning environment with their specific devices per OWI Principle 10
(pp. 21-23). Students should have the opportunity to test their individual devic-
es and receive feedback and any required support prior to the start of a specific
course per OWI Principle 10. Institutions or OWI programs might even want to
start device-specific users groups that invite faculty, staff, and students to explore
and support one another; the user groups would also need to reach out to and
support the truly geographically distant online students as well.

    OWI WPAs and faculty need to talk about mobile learning beyond just
understanding how it impacts their OWCs; they also need to be in serious dis-
cussions with institutional LMS decision makers. If the online writing program
theoretically and pedagogically privileges student-student interaction, OWI ad-
ministrators and faculty need to emphasize heavily the need for LMS mobile ap-
plications that do more than access online course materials. Students definitely
prefer working within native mobile applications in comparison to mobile Web
browsers, primarily because the mobile applications are generally faster and eas-
ier to use (Bowen & Pistilli, 2012). Although experts may worry about the lack
of diversity or "closed gardens" that will emerge if apps dominate the access and
use of the Internet (Anderson & Rainie, 2012, p. 7), they acknowledge that apps
make it more streamlined for people to do what they want to do and, therefore,
they will continue to be preferred and grow as a favored method for accessing
the Internet (p. 6).

    Not only will OWI administrators and faculty want to participate in discus-
sions about campus-wide technology adoptions, they also will want to be in on
discussions about supporting students, as well as a growing number of faculty,
who use mobile devices to teach and learn in online environments.

CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS

    Alan K. Livingston (2009) claimed that no one noticed the "revolution" of

                                                                                                 515

mobile phones and multimobile services in higher education. Specifically, he
claimed the Internet "changed everything" while the mobile revolution "changed
nothing," especially because faculty and staff in higher education have not re-
alized what is going on. Instructors in and administrators of OWI programs
cannot ignore the growing use of mobile devices. Instead, OWI programs must
acknowledge mobile devices are here to stay, students are using them to access
and interact in OWCs, and there will be no streamlining of the mobile platforms
and/or applications. Dialogs with IT administrators, professional development,
support of OWI faculty and students, and OWC material and assignment de-
signs all must consider the various affordances and constraints associated with
mobile learning.

    The following recommendations may help OWI WPAs and teachers to inte-
grate mobile devices into their thinking and OWCs:

    · Student technological access is no longer just divided by Macs and PCs
        or different browser applications. As such, instructors, WPAs, and insti-
        tutions need to be thinking about students both accessing and complet-
        ing work (i.e., writing papers) on smartphones and tablets with different
        operating systems.

    · Check OWCs for usability, or at least check the institutional LMSs, with
        all major brands of devices and interface operating systems. Develop fac-
        ulty and staff learning communities to share this work and its results.

    · Research your own student population to develop appropriate course,
        programmatic, and/or institutional support materials (especially to help
        students test and prepare their devices for working in the online course
        environment before the term begins).

    · Take advantage of students' access to mobile devices when designing as-
        signments. Emphasize process; have students reflect on the affordances
        and constraints of production and consumption of texts in mobile envi-
        ronments.

    · Help students support one another with "teach/learn the technology"
        assignments. Also take advantage of mobility with space- and loca-
        tion-aware assignments. In keeping with the advice offered in Chapter
        15, there is no need to give up multimodal assignments; many mobile
        platforms include robust multimodal recording and editing applications
        as well.

This chapter examines strategies for researching distance education in the
OWI context. It considers overall methodological research approaches
that can be employed to engage in consistent and useful investigation of
one's program whether it has a writing course or writing center focus.
The chapter also addresses key factors related to choice of research instru-
ments, sample selection, data collection, and analysis, as well as issues of
reporting and information dissemination post-research.

Keywords: automated writing evaluation (AWE), data collection, empir-
ical research, mobile technology, MOOC, methodological design, out-
comes, practice, RAD research, replicable, qualitative, quantitative, stake-
holder, theory

    A significant challenge facing online education is committing to a deeper
understanding of the efficacy, values, and inner workings of OWI (both class-
room- and tutor-based); its innumerable, rapidly changing modalities; its dis-
tinctive nature; and how it functions in a pedagogical sense. The writing studies
discipline awaits viable theories of OWI as a philosophy of writing and as a series
of strategies for teaching and learning to write in digital settings. To these ends,
the CCCC OWI Committee has reasoned that ongoing research is crucial. OWI
Principle 15 stated, "OWI/OWL administrators and teachers/tutors should be
committed to ongoing research into their programs and courses as well as the
very principles in this document" (CCCC OWI Committee, 2013, p. 31).

    This chapter focuses on how useful, ongoing research into OWI might be
developed by examining and highlighting the crucial need for a deeper under-
standing of OWI; it offers suggestions for developing a rigorous framework of
investigation when engaging in OWI. Methodological strategies for research-
ing distance education in the OWI context also are considered. Specifically, the

OWI Research Considerations

chapter examines overall methods and research approaches that can be employed
to engage in consistent and useful investigation of one's program whether it has
a writing course or writing center focus. The chapter analyses key factors related
to choice of research instruments, sample selection, data collection, and analysis.
In a final section, the chapter discusses reporting and information dissemination
post-research.

A NEED FOR RESEARCH INTO OWI

    The Internet has had a profound impact across educational contexts with the
teaching and learning of writing among the most primary. There are innovative
and exciting writing models that are linked inextricably to the online modalities
that power them. The education landscape is marked by rapid growth and ex-
pansion of online technologies that are used to construct and deliver education
and instruction--including writing instruction.

    Systematic and broad scale national and international data specifically tar-
geting OWI trends do not exist. Overall, however, US higher education has
seen considerable enduring growth with online education. For example, the
National Center for Education reported that over 200 fully accredited online
higher education institutions currently operate in the United States (Radford,
2011)--these institutions all provide high-enrollment, core courses that include
composition. Further, Eduventures--a leading research and consulting firm for
higher education institutions--estimated that in the fall of 2010, 2.78 million
students enrolled in fully online programs. This number represents 14% of all
higher education enrollments (Aslanian & Clinefelter, 2012). Along these lines,
77% of all four-year university presidents reported that their institutions of-
fered some type of online or hybrid classes (Parker, Lendard, & Moore, 2011).
Worldwide trends are similar; both online programs and enrolled students are
increasing yearly. Indeed, even students in traditional onsite courses can expect
to access some of their course materials and/or communicative experiences in
online settings such as an institution's LMS or, minimally, email.

    These statistics reflect online learning overall. As this book demonstrates,
when we consider OWI alone, there is much that remains unknown. Undoubt-
edly, there is much to learn about how the changing digital landscape affects
writing instruction in online settings. Among a wide variety of possible concerns
are issues of accessibility, mobile technologies, and experimental learning for-
mats. We provide the following examples to ground the exigency of developing
appropriately sound and potentially helpful OWI research.

    Accessibility, for instance, received primary importance in A Position State-
ment of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (CCCC OWI Com-

524
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

mittee, 2013). OWI Principle 1 concerned the need for inclusivity and acces-
sibility in OWI for all students and teachers. Where inclusivity has been more
or less retrofitted (Oswal & Hewett, 2013) to online settings in the past, it is
provided a paramount position in this position statement. With OWI Principle
1, it becomes clear that every activity in an OWI setting and the technology
choices for those activities should be determined with accessibility as a priority
for both students and teachers (pp. 7-11). Student audiences, for example, are
masked in online settings, making it difficult to know whether they are physical-
ly disabled, intellectually challenged, struggling with multilingual needs, and/or
socioeconomically disadvantaged. Some students may have none of these spe-
cific problems but may be poor or slow readers with challenges in online educa-
tional settings (Hewett, 2015a). Without self-disclosure of such vital concerns,
teachers may be unaware of particular student needs yet somewhat aware of
their struggles as revealed in the student's writing. Indeed, given a potential for
difficulties in handling the increased literacy load of a common OWC (Griffin
& Minter, 2013), all students might be considered somewhat disadvantaged in
OWI settings (Hewett, 2015a). Too little research has been produced to assist
with understanding this phenomenon although scholars are beginning to ad-
dress this stark need (see, for example, Meloncon, 2013). Even though Chapters
8, 9, and 10 address many access and inclusivity concerns, it is useful to consider
here some of the most pressing areas to be researched:

    · Regarding teacher/tutor training for accessibility:
         What kinds of training, if any at all, do teachers and professional and
           peer tutors currently receive to provide universally accessible and in-
           clusive OWI?
         What training, if any, from different college disciplines or other online
           systems would support writing teachers/tutors in providing more ac-
           cessible and inclusive OWI?
         What attitudes do teachers/tutors need to acknowledge, address, and/
           or overcome to develop more accessible and inclusive OWI?

    · Regarding self-disclosure:
         How many students self-disclose some type of disability before, during,
           or after their OWCs? What types of disabilities do student disclose?
         Under what situations (e.g., pre-course preparatory materials or gen-
           eral encouragement from teachers) do students tend to self-disclose
           accessibility needs for OWCs?
         Given legal restrictions from the Family Education Rights and Privacy
           Act (FERPA) and the ADA, how can students be provided helpful

           grams and campus disability services to learn about disabled students'
           technological needs, learning styles, and other academic preferences?
         How, if at all, do teachers (or tutors) modify their work with online
           writing students to meet access needs?

    · Regarding students who may not previously have been considered as
        needing particular access:

         What kinds of accessibility and/or inclusivity needs do multilingual
           students have in an OWC?

         Under what conditions should multilingual students receive accessi-
           bility assistance in an OWC or with an online tutor?

         What do we know about the accessibility of online tutoring systems
           for students with disabilities?

         What are the socioeconomic factors that teachers/tutors must consider
           when providing accessibility OWI for students?

         What are the socioeconomic factors that administrators must consider
           when preparing OWI teachers and tutors?

    In the field of writing studies, there is a wealth of scholarship about multilin-
gual student writers as well as students whose literacy performances are affected
by their socioeconomic conditions. But there is a dearth of scholarship about
how these student populations perform in OWI contexts.

    As a second example of the need for continued OWI research, the trend of
using mobile devices and cell phone technology for OWI is among the changes
in digital technologies, which is discussed in Chapter 16 of this book. Using
such technology in writing courses undoubtedly will have an impact on writing
instruction and student competency (Ehmann, 2012) as well as on student read-
ing literacy (Hewett, 2015a). There is growing evidence to suggest that a grow-
ing population of students is using tablet and even mobile phone technology for
educational purposes. Apple alone counts 1.5 million iPads in use by students
in K-12 US schools (Kessler, 2012). In early October 2012, Piper Jaffray ana-
lyst Gene Munster released survey results showing that iPhone ownership also
is growing at a rapid rate. According to Munster's findings, 34% of surveyed
high school students now own an iPhone, and 40% said they planned to buy
one in the next month (CourseSmart, 2012). A May 2012 survey released by
CourseSmart estimated that 93% of university students own laptops, 57% own
smartphones, and 22% own tablets (CourseSmart, 2012). As students become
ever-more attached to their mobile technology, online learning opportunities via
mobile devices undoubtedly will expand. A 2011 Pearson Foundation study on
US students and tablets reported the following findings:

    · Seventy percent of high school seniors and university students would like

                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

        to own a tablet device.
    · Twenty percent of college students and 7% of university-bound high

        school seniors planned to purchase one in the next six months.
    · Sixty-nine percent of university-level students reported that they think

        tablet computing will change education in the future.
    · Sixty-three percent of students surveyed reported that tablets can en-

        hance education.
    · Almost half of the surveyed students expect digital textbooks to replace

        paper textbooks within the next five years (p. 2).
    In theory, there are some interesting opportunities for learner engagement
with mobile devices and the development of writing skills. For example, stu-
dents can easily and collaboratively share information and ideas with each other
through this very social technology--as well as enjoy easy access to peer reviews.
Research questions surrounding such mobile technology choices for OWI in-
clude:
    · Regarding flipped classrooms:

         Contemporary composition courses typically are taught in "flipped"
           manner--with lecture rejected for in-class practice and peer work-
           shops--because it makes sense to have students perform the hands-on
           or direct engagement aspects of the learning process in the presence of
           the teaching professional. Given this scenario, how can mobile devices
           facilitate the flipped classroom?

         Are mobile devices the best or just one of several tools for such activ-
           ities?

         What are their best uses in a writing instruction context?
         How do these technologies enable or inhibit accessibility and inclu-

           sion?
    · Regarding anywhere/anytime learning:

         In what ways, if at all, do students actually use such mobile devices for
           educational writing experiences?

         What is student satisfaction level with such uses?
         In what ways, if at all, does the use of these devices hinder or support

           writing improvement from the teacher's perspective? From the stu-
           dent's perspective?
         To what extent and in what ways do these technological tools promote
           learning and engage participants?
    · Regarding writing conventions:
         In what ways, if any, do students follow or reject traditional writing
           conventions, to include Standard Academic English, when they use
           mobile devices for educational writing experiences?

                                                                                                 527
OWI Research Considerations

         What kind of writing skills do students need and use for texting,
           tweeting, and other types of instant messaging modes that are twen-
           ty-first century skills necessary both in the work place and daily life?

         How do (or can) writing teachers address and/or support such writing
           skills?

         In what real contexts do the discourses of the academy and online
           discourse overlap, and how are these facilitated (or not) by mobile
           technology in writing course settings?

    Houghton-Mifflin Harcourt conducted a US study from 2010 to 2011 on
one of their mobile applications that teaches Algebra I and reported positive re-
sults. Although very small, this study is widely cited as evidence for the efficacy
of mobile learning within the sciences (HMHEducation.com, 2012). Such a
study for writing has yet to be published.

    Another relatively recent movement that is gaining attention and points to
the significant growth of online learning with potential impact on writing in-
struction is that of MOOCs. Targeting learners world-wide, MOOCs are an
experimental form of online courses available to large audiences of learners
through open Web access. MOOCs developed out of the open educational re-
sources movement as "a response to the challenges faced by organizations and
distributed disciplines in a time of information overload" (Cormier, 2010). Ac-
cording to Dave Cormier (2010), the most important feature of a MOOC is
that it "builds on the active engagement of several hundred to several thousand
`students' who self-organize their participation according to learning goals, pri-
or knowledge and skills, and common interests." Structurally, MOOCs may
be similar to some college-level programs. Typically, MOOCs do not offer the
college credits that paying students at colleges and universities receive although
some colleges have done so (Koller, 2012).

    The CCCC OWI Committee's A Position Statement of Principles and Exam-
ple Effective Practices for OWI currently lists MOOCs as an experimental use
of educational technology and OWI Principle 6 suggested that they "should
be subject to the same principles of pedagogical soundness, teacher/designer
preparation, and oversight detailed in this document" (p. 16). A study of such
experimental uses of educational technology has not yet been published for
composition or writing-enhanced disciplinary courses, although data have been
collected on the four institutions (i.e., Duke University, Georgia Technological
Institute, San Jacinto Community College, The Ohio State University) that won
Gates Fellowship Grants to establish MOOCs for writing courses. Questions for
such research on MOOCs, adaptable to other experimental OWCs, might be:

    · Regarding the philosophies driving contemporary composition:

528
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

         In what ways, if at all, do MOOCs, support core writing studies
           philosophies?

         In what ways do they not support core philosophies?
         How, if at all, do writing MOOCs extend core writing studies philos-

           ophies and/or develop new strategies helpful to student writers?
         The four writing MOOCs piloted in 2013 enrolled a large number

           of students from around the world. What potential does such global
           reach of MOOCs offer to writing studies pedagogy?

    · Regarding accessibility, enrollment, retention, and persistence:

         What student accessibility challenges exist surrounding OWI? How
           and to what extent can such challenges can be addressed?

         What types of students most benefit from the MOOC environment?
           In what ways do they benefit?

         What types of students are most challenged by the environment? In
           what ways are they challenged?

         What qualities of MOOCs encourage writing students to enroll?
         Why do some students persist and others drop out?
         What measures, if any at all, would encourage greater retention?

    · Regarding the written products that students develop from learning in a
        MOOC:

         In what ways, if any, is peer review supportive of a student's writing
           development in a MOOC?

         In what ways, if any, would such students benefit from experienced
           writers' (e.g., teaching assistants, teachers, and professional writers)
           review and response in a MOOC?

         How, if at all, should student writing be evaluated for course credit
           when the student has completed a writing MOOC?

    The rapid expansion of such technologies and trends as those listed above
and the growing sphere of instructors who engage in digitally enhanced and In-
ternet-based education are evidence that online education in general and OWI
specifically are becoming significant within the higher education landscape (Eh-
mann, 2012; Krause & Lowe, 2014; see also Chapter 18). Although actual tech-
nologies, formats, and procedures may change, the Internet has transformed
education and the teaching of writing in meaningful ways. Within this exciting
context of change and transformation, however, few individuals have investigat-
ed the outcomes, processes, and procedures of online teaching and learning in
rigorous and empirical ways. This reality also holds true for OWI specifically. In-
deed, the empirically based learning science surrounding online writing contexts
has a long way to go before replicable results yield convincing learning theories

                                                                                                 529

in connection with writing.
    Certainly, the understanding has developed that digitally enhanced or hosted

writing instruction is not a replacement for onsite courses but rather a comple-
ment to them. Educators have begun to recognize that providing writing in-
struction in multiple modalities supports writing instruction rather than limits
it (Hewett, 2010, 2015a, 2015b; Snart, 2010; Warnock, 2009), making OWI a
substantial tool in a large toolbox that we use to make learning more accessible
to a more diverse population of learners throughout the world, with some stu-
dents benefiting from online learning and writing instruction more than others
(Hewett & Ehmann, 2004). Nonetheless, even the anecdotal literature that ex-
ists often avoids the question of what really works and why.

    Many experts have discussed the need to understand more deeply the various
pedagogies related to OWI. As seen in the CCCC OWI Committee's Annotated
Bibliography on Online Writing Instruction (2008) that gathered, reviewed, and
annotated Web texts, articles, and books from 1980 to 2008, still much about
what we know of OWI, what those processes look like, how students learn, and
how teachers teach in the online writing environment is not comprehensive and
does not account fully for the intricacies or complexities of participants and con-
texts (CCCC OWI Committee, 2008). Another annotated bibliography, "Stud-
ies Comparing Outcomes among Onsite, Hybrid and Fully Online Writing
Courses" compiled by Scott Warnock (2013), studied the notion of difference
between traditionally onsite and online (fully online and hybrid) composition
courses. Warnock stated, "While generally few differences have been found in
terms of educational outcome based on course modality, some studies identify
nuanced differences in course experiences" (p. 2). Such nuances tend to affect
retention and persistence as well as "student behaviors or performances in online
courses in ways that lend themselves to comparison with onsite courses" (p. 2).
Yet, such comparisons may be inappropriate for various reasons including that
OWI often is scrutinized more than or differently from onsite writing courses,
as Warnock indicates in Chapter 4.

    Nonetheless, essential questions as to what distinguishes OWI from com-
position instruction and learning in onsite settings remain. Such distinctions,
reported anecdotally and experientially by practitioners and researchers alike,
strongly suggest that OWI may need its own theories unique to student cog-
nition, teacher instruction, and affective dimensions of learning when working
online (Hewett & Ehmann, 2004). The most obvious difference from onsite
learning is in the affective realm from the loss of real-time body/face/voice con-
nections where researchers have suggested that such loss interferes with devel-
oping classroom community (DePew & Lettner-Rust, 2009; Ehmann, 2010;
Gouge, 2009). To some degree, these ideas are comprised of teacher impres-

530
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

sions that require thoughtful research to test their veracity. On the other hand,
in a few studies that questioned student experiences (see Warnock, 2013, for
example), students have reported that their interactions with instructors and
peers were similarly satisfactory when compared to those in onsite settings and
that their satisfaction was connected in part from frequency of interactions and
prompt feedback from instructors (Boyd, 2008; Johnson & Card, 2008). These
issues would benefit from additional research. In particular, affective loss, stu-
dent progress and retention, and the notion of leveling classroom power would
be useful topics for further research.

    Beyond concerns of affective connection, Beth L. Hewett (2010, 2015b)
theorized in The Online Writing Conference: A Guide for Teachers and Tutors that
OWI requires an increased clarity of written language, what she calls semantic
integrity--response to students that recognizes fidelity between what teachers
and tutors say in their writing and what they mean. This fidelity enables instruc-
tors to express themselves with clear intention and students to interpret their in-
tentions as accurately as possible. Semantic integrity involves using straightfor-
ward language that is linguistically direct rather than indirect or suggestive and
avoiding such conditional language as rhetorical questions and yes/no closed
questions. In Reading to Learn and Writing to Teach: Literacy Strategies for Online
Writing Instruction, Hewett (2015a) theorized that the decreased connection of
body/face/voice in OWI reflects most strongly in lost cognition. When writing is
taught primarily through reading and writing, an increased literacy load (Griffin
& Minter, 2013)--where reading and writing are text-heavy and text-rich--tax-
es students who must make cognitive connections among what they read about
writing generally, their writing specifically, and how to apply that information to
their own writing-in-progress. Such reading challenges students, but it also chal-
lenges teachers who must understand that they are responsible for writing com-
prehensible instructional text that is straightforward and clear, leading directly
back to a need for semantic integrity (Hewett, 2010, 2013, 2015a, 2015b).
Indeed, according to David Alan Sapp and James Simon (2005), "Though many
writing teachers may have the skills to communicate content and assignment
instructions to students online, few have the sophisticated communication skills
necessary to connect with students interpersonally, to build trust and rapport in
unfamiliar virtual environments" (p. 478). Hewett's (2015a) literacy-cognition
theory of OWI requires additional research both for confirmation and mitiga-
tion of its effects on students with various learning needs and styles.

    Although composition theories and some teaching strategies can be migrat-
ed and adapted to online settings as described in OWI Principle 4 (also see
Warnock, 2009), institutional writing programs cannot simply move or trans-
fer traditional educational methods online in a wholesale manner (pp. 14-15).

                                                                                                 531
OWI Research Considerations

Rather, new techniques and pedagogies unique to digital environments must be
discerned and employed, as revealed in OWI Principle 3, to address the heavi-
ly text-based nature of OWI and the myriad of technological devices available
for educational uses (pp. 12-14). However, what educators believe are the best
online teaching strategies are not always the best learning strategies for students,
which means that research must address that aspect of OWI as well. As described
in the Introduction, the CCCC OWI Committee's weakest area of research in
terms of its field visits, surveys, and work with the expert/stakeholder panel was
in its consideration of student learning experiences. The discipline needs to step
back and understand what works for students and then consider how to marry
that with overall pedagogical approaches--particularly given students' accessi-
bility needs. Depending on local institutional constraints, that marriage may
look different within and across various contexts.

    With these points in mind, there is a strong need for open-ended research into
overarching areas of interest surrounding OWI as it occurs in naturalistic settings
across institutions and student and teacher cohorts. To be sure, close-ended,
tightly controlled experimental studies that, for example, test pre-determined
theories or hypotheses about such issues as how students learn in this environ-
ment can serve an important role and can address various research questions
about quantitative benefits and measurable outcomes (Ehmann, 2003). These
we recommend as well. From a pedagogically driven perspective and in light
of the current landscape of OWI knowledge, however, we believe strongly that
more interpretive open-ended research should be a leading priority in any study
of OWI. Given existing questions about participant experiences and OWI pro-
cesses, therefore, a primary need is to explore the phenomenon of OWI--with
individual cases across various institutions and learning contexts being viewed as
opportunities to investigate overall trends and patterns that can lead to a deeper
understanding of OWI as a phenomenon in and of itself. Based on previous
exploratory research, compelling areas for empirical, theory-generating research
are related to literacy and cognition, processes, participant perceptions and ex-
periences, and outcomes. Because much of OWI is text-based, scholars are well
positioned to delve into archives of teacher and learner work to explore short-
term/one-off moments as well as longitudinal evidence of learning. In addition
to deepening our understanding of the literacy and cognition challenges of OWI
and pedagogical inner-workings and processes of OWI, it is essential that stu-
dent outcomes also are assessed. Outcomes include student grades and other
performance measures, course retention, and persistence. Although the analysis
of such outcomes in relation to student achievement and learning has its pitfalls,
it is undeniable that such information is useful as a baseline for both faculty and
administrators who require such data as a means of quantitative efficacy.

532
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

    This background strongly suggests that program and course design should
be developed to allow such information to be captured and analyzed. Within
an interpretative framework, both qualitative and quantitative methodological
designs can be employed to address key questions surrounding OWI and OWL
outcomes, processes, and participant perspectives. These areas will be discussed
in the next sections of this chapter with particular focus on how they relate
to planning for a postsecondary program that includes OWI and designing an
OWI course; however, readers may adapt these discussions particularly to OWLs
where the focus seems relevant.

PERSPECTIVES FOR OWI RESEARCH

    As indicated in the previous section, the urgent call for OWI educators in
assessing their current courses/programs and in contemplating the outlook of
future development is, minimally, fourfold:

    · Establishing opportunities within courses to investigate the phenomenon
        of OWI through an interpretive, process-oriented research framework;

    · Using the analytic data available through LMSs to study students' assis-
        tive technology use and learning patterns;

    · Establishing opportunities to collect and study a baseline of perfor-
        mance-related student outcomes that can be analyzed by internal and
        external third parties; and

    · Establishing opportunities to collect and study instructional strategies
        pertinent to both composition and the OWI-environment that also can
        be analyzed internally and externally for quality measures.

    This need for research is highlighted in OWI Principle 15 of A Position State-
ment of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI (p. 31). Specifically, the
CCCC OWI Committee's statement reported on a common theme from leaders
in the field about the need for professional development in the area of OWI and
OWLs. The CCCC OWI Committee expressed a pressing need to "educate the
writing community on OWI and OWLs and to help direct the teaching and
learning of our students with what is known about state of the art and effective
practices" (p. 31). Moreover, the statement called for developments in OWI and
OWLs to be rooted in "valid and reliable research findings and systematic infor-
mation dissemination" (p. 31). In other words, of paramount importance is the
knowledge sharing that occurs pre-, mid-, and post-research.

    As in other contexts, the challenge for undertaking the type of aforemen-
tioned research resides in the time and funding resources for accomplishing such
work. For an obvious example, student writing appropriately is one measure of

                                                                                                 533
OWI Research Considerations

any writing program's efficacy. Studying that writing, however, is time and labor
intensive. With that in mind, some computer programs or automated writing
evaluation (AWE, a term that appears to have been coined by Warschauer and
Paige [2006]) tools potentially may be used for research purposes to determine
writing differences by, for example, indicating linguistic changes across drafts
and revisions--provided the AWE tool is adequately trained and normed to
specific prompts informed by human-directed parameters of strong and weak
writing. At this time, such AWE programs typically cannot accurately synthesize
within individual contexts (i.e., for individual students and their unique essay
writing) whether and how those changes represent an individual's specific rhe-
torical strengths and weaknesses, content accuracy and depth, and overall writ-
ing maturity (NCTE Position Statement on Machine Scoring, 2013; Perelman,
2013). Indeed, this work requires trained human instructors and readers. Given
the need to balance the requirements of human expertise with the time and re-
sources necessary for research into OWI, it is worth considering how markers of
writing change may be quantitatively assessed via AWE technology in conjunc-
tion with human efforts related to the qualitative understanding, teaching, and
assessment of writing.

    To be sure, there is much controversy surrounding the use of AWE for place-
ment, assessment, and instruction--let alone as a potential analysis tool to aid
research of OWI. Earlier critiques of AWE have (1) typically focused on scoring
rather than integration of AWE into the writing classroom and (2) relied more
on composition theory than on empirical classroom studies of AWE's impact
on student learning (Ericsson & Haswell, 2006; Grimes & Warshauer, 2006;
Shermis, Burstein, & Bliss, 2004). More recent studies have investigated the
impact of AWE on student scores on standardized tests, teachers' impressions
of AWE, student impressions of AWE, impact on student writing, and student
behavior as they use AWE applications (Chen & Cheng, 2008; Cotos, 2011;
Grimes & Warshauer, 2010; Holman, 2011; Perelman, 2013; Schroder, Grohe,
& Pogue, 2008; Shermis & Burstein, 2013; Shermis & Hammer, 2013). The
point we wish to make here is that whether or not AWE is positioned as an op-
timal instructional or evaluative tool for complex and unique writing challenges
and development issues that individual learners face, it may be leveraged for
research into OWI if done with its strengths and limitations in mind. These items
certainly warrant further consideration.

    The human labor involved in OWI research requires training, developed ex-
perience, allotted time, and funding, all of which have been an impediment to
OWI and other writing researchers who typically are not expected, encouraged,
or educated to seek grants for such research. Indeed, writing studies scholars--
whether focused on onsite or OWI--often are not prepared for such research

generally. And, when it is developed, venues for publishing it can be scarce.
    In 2005, Richard Haswell's "NCTE/CCCC's Recent War on Scholarship"

cogently argued for RAD research in composition studies. His argument for
empirical research in the field serves as a counterpoint to Stephen M. North's
(1987) popular and helpful The Making of Knowledge in Composition: Portrait
of an Emerging Field--in that the field no longer is emerging and that assump-
tions drawn from research ought to be validated and, to some degree, compa-
rable across studies. Janice M. Lauer and J. William Asher's (1988) Composition
Research: Empirical Designs provided solid advice toward RAD research, but
Haswell (2005) speculated that because the key NCTE/CCCC journals for the
writing studies field (e.g., College English and College Composition and Commu-
nication) failed to publish sufficient RAD research, it discouraged publishing
scholars from conducting it. To the field's benefit, some scholars have taken up
Haswell's call to action with powerful critiques of current non-RAD research
and practices based on it; Rebecca Day Babcock and Terese Thonus' (2012)
Researching the Writing Center: Toward an Evidence-based Practice comprises one
such critique. In support of OWI, a few scholars have taken up such research
(Hewett, 2000, 2004-2005, 2006; Jones, Georghiades, & Gunson, 2012; Wolfe
& Griffin, 2013), which has helped to ground practice-based OWI develop-
ment. Nonetheless, few researchers actually have replicated previous studies--
using prior research methods, taxonomies, or other analytical tools--allowing
the research to become part of a growing body of knowledge where comparisons
might be made. Hewett (1998, 2000), where previously used methods and tax-
onomies were adapted to a new setting (2003-2005, 2006), provided one exam-
ple of an attempt at RAD research based on earlier used talk and revision taxon-
omies (Faigley & Witte, 1981; Gere & Abbott, 1985, Gere & Stevens, 1985).

    RAD research into OWI presents considerable challenges that we are not
dismissing in this chapter. However, given these challenges, a strong case can
be made to apply an action research approach to the overall study of OWI--
such that educators can leverage their own practices as scholarly investigation.
Grounded in an action research approach that is designed to ask educators to
investigate, reflect, and report on their own practices, the CCCC OWI Com-
mittee's explication of this research-focused principle encouraged practitioners
to research their own courses, students, and programs (also see Hewett, 2010,
2015b; Hewett & Ehmann, 2004). As co-creators and/or participant observers,
OWI and OWL administrators and teachers/tutors alike are situated ideally to
commit to continuous research of their courses, students, and programs--with
the overall intention of building and strengthening the theoretical and peda-
gogical frameworks for OWI and OWLs. Pepperdine University's Center for
Collaborative Action Research advocated a similar version of action research.

                                                                                                 535

They explained that action research:

         is the systematic, reflective study of one's actions, and the
         effects of these actions, in a workplace context. As such, it in-
         volves deep inquiry into one's professional practice... . Action
         research is a way of learning from and through one's practice
         by working through a series of reflective stages that facilitate
         the development of a form of "adaptive" expertise. Over time,
         action researchers develop a deep understanding of the ways
         in which a variety of social and environmental forces interact
         to create complex patterns. Since these forces are dynamic,
         action research is a process of living one's theory into practice.
         (Reil, 2010)

    As emphasized in OWI Principle 15 of A Position Statement of Principles and
Example Effective Practices for OWI, "Empirical, repeatable, and longitudinal re-
search that addresses questions regarding the phenomena of OWI and OWLs
will drive a deeper understanding of OWI and OWLs, ultimately benefiting
students and the teaching and learning of writing in online contexts" (p. 31).
Similarly, follow-up reporting and information dissemination are important
phases in the strategy of "progressive inquiry" (Reil, 2010) for action research.
The intention is for research findings to be critiqued and validated by peers as
well as the scholarly community and administrators in composition studies. As
the CCCC OWI Committee's A Position Statement of Principles and Example
Effective Practices for OWI advocated under OWI Principle 15:

         OWI and OWL administrators and teachers/tutors should en-
         gage actively in the scholarly conversation by sharing research
         findings at regional and national conferences and through
         peer-reviewed journals and other academic publications. OWI
         and OWL administrators and teachers/tutors should share
         research findings with the general public in suitable venues
         to assist with setting appropriate expectations for and under-
         standing of OWI and OWLs. (p. 31)

Perhaps most importantly, such research can be used to inform and ultimately
improve one's own practice within a cyclical, phased approach.

    As indicated earlier in this chapter, there are numerous main areas that, in
light of the current state of knowledge about OWI, can be considered research
priorities. For the purposes of this chapter, we categorize these priorities into
three overarching areas pertinent to OWI/OWLs: processes and interactions,
participant perceptions and experiences, and outcomes. Although a myriad of

536
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

potential research topics related to these broad areas exist, the point here is to
highlight examples of research questions and methodological choices that can
serve to deepen understanding and knowledge of processes, participant experi-
ences, and outcomes of OWI for both teaching and tutoring practices.

Processes and Interactions

    Effective Practice 15.1 of the CCCC OWI Committee's A Position Statement
of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI articulated the need to design
and deploy empirical investigations surrounding "the processes of asynchronous
and/or synchronous OWI or OWL interactions" and "student and teacher/tutor
behaviors, actions, and relationships within the context of the actual exchanges"
(p. 31). Processes and interactions in an OWI context can be taken to mean one-
to-one and group interactions that occur among teachers/tutors and learners.

    Within these areas, there are multiple subsets of OWI that warrant inves-
tigation including asynchronous and synchronous modalities, fully online and
hybrid contexts, effects of medium on learning, feedback and response strategies
using different technologies, and overall approaches to online learning where
writing is the focus. Common examples include fully online or hybrid class-
room exchanges among individuals, one-to-one exchanges in an online tutorial
or conference setting, online conversations that occur in peer revision groups,
and email exchanges. Moreover, these interactions occur in asynchronous and
synchronous modalities such as delayed, multi-textual, correspondence ex-
changes; one-way or two-way audio and audio/video messages; and voice and/or
text chat-based messaging. Above and beyond the specific context, the primary
point here is that the focus on processes and interaction relies on studying the
nature of the human-to-human interactions and exchanges among participants
in digital, educational settings--all of which, in most settings, can be captured
and accessed with consent via online archiving and records. Following an inter-
pretive strategic methodological approach, open-ended research questions about
processes can address broader, descriptive notions about the OWI phenomenon
(Ehmann, 2003, 2012). Such questions include but are not limited to the fol-
lowing areas:

    · What happens in fully online OWI courses, online conferences (course-
        based and/or tutorial), and associated text-based exchanges?

    · Similarly, what happens in hybrid courses and conferences?
    · What is the overall structure and format of these online teaching and

        learning environments--in both fully online and hybrid contexts?
         What is the length of engagement for a class?
         What is the frequency, length, and nature of one-to-one conferences,

                                                                                                 537
OWI Research Considerations

           group interaction, and any peer interaction?
    · What is the substantive focus of participant exchanges in these contexts?
    · What topics do teachers/tutors initiate and how do students respond?
    · What topics do students initiate and how do teachers/tutors respond?
    · How do participants "talk" in text about the topics they initiate?
    · What pedagogical strategies do instructors employ in their teaching of

        writing?
    · What strategies do students employ in their learning of writing?
    · How do these strategies compare with those of students with learning

        disabilities?
    · What strategies can develop to suit these students' learning needs?
    · What indications or evidence of understanding and progress do partic-

        ipants demonstrate in their participation, written work, and revision?

    The kinds of data required to address these types of process/interaction-fo-
cused questions point to artifacts that are inherent to OWI. Specifically, A Posi-
tion Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI reported that
the OWI and OWL environments are "particularly well positioned as sites of on-
going research in that almost all interactions are saved and archived ... enabling
empirical analysis" (p. 31) Indeed, the inherent characteristics and qualities of
OWI and OWLs can be leveraged in meeting this call and commitment for
on-going research. Key records of interaction among teachers/tutors and learn-
ers can involve such texts as email, various modes of online platform commu-
nication, online group discussion, and a portfolio of longitudinal writing drafts
and revisions. These records can serve as artifacts available for investigating the
deep pedagogical processes of OWI in meaningful ways.

    When considering meaningful analysis methods for the interaction data col-
lected, an approach that remains true to the open-ended intent of the research
is paramount. With the intention of exploring what individuals actually are do-
ing rather than what existing sentiment says they should or could do, analysis
methods need to support the desire to produce findings that accurately reflect
participant practices and to build on previous research where applicable and
appropriate (Ehmann, 2003). Options for analyzing interactions can involve
fine-grained scrutiny of participant talk such as linguistic or discourse analysis
of participant talk which entails the detailed and systematic investigation of
functional structures and hierarchies potentially related to student revision (see,
for example, Hewett, 2006, 2003-2005, 2000, 1998).

    Broader brush-stroke approaches include the identification of thematic ac-
tivity, behaviors, or writing development within or potentially connected to
such learning exchanges. Regardless of the level of granularity, however, a unit of
analysis within an interaction must be identified and justified for the investiga-

538
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

tion's purposes--whether the unit is a conversation move, an episode, or some
other discreet chunk within social and instructional exchanges. Depending on
the research objectives, both quantitative and qualitative methods can be used in
the analysis of largely qualitative talk or text-based data--for example, using nu-
meric analysis to describe the actions that individuals take in teaching and learn-
ing exchanges. Units of analysis can be counted and presented; such an approach
may lend external credibility to findings depending on the audience. Based on
actual conferencing interactions, Hewett's (2004-2005, 2006) research is among
the most relevant empirical scholarship regarding OWI interactions to date. In
her work, Hewett found that students' revised writing demonstrated linguistic
connections to the online conferences in which they participated; where the
connections did not exist, however, the students' open-ended survey responses
provided interesting evidence toward her theory that instructors' semantic in-
tegrity is crucial in a text-based setting (Hewett, 2010, 2015a, 2015b). Some
of these findings have been replicated in recent research into uses of metaphor
in online tutoring (Thonus & Hewett, 2015). Moving forward, new empirical
studies might build upon this work, which can ground adaptations and changes
in instructional approaches for both asynchronous and synchronous settings.

Stakeholder Perceptions and Experiences

    The importance of deepening our understanding of OWI/OWL interactions
and learning exchanges is clear. An additional area that requires investigation is
that of participant perceptions and experiences. The CCCC OWI Committee's
example Effective Practice 15.1 called attention to this point, suggesting that
"Studies might examine participant perceptions of OWI or OWLs (e.g., ben-
efits, challenges, experiences) via interviews with students, teachers/tutors, and
administrators" (p. 31).

    Students are primary stakeholders in the OWI endeavor. As such, their first-
hand experiences warrant exploration in addition to their reasons for engaging
in OWI and their views about its purpose and value in the postsecondary con-
text. A priority of this approach is to seek descriptive responses that are rooted
in respondents' actual experiences rather than evaluative responses about what
OWI should or should not be. Both Nancy Sommers (2006) and Jane Mathison
Fife and Peggy O'Neil (2001) have indicated how important it is to understand
how students believe they have benefitted from feedback and essay response, for
example. The student experience helps to triangulate what researchers see in the
many texts that OWI makes archivally available.

    Similarly, with teachers/tutors, a priority is to explore descriptive accounts of
OWI experiences as well as observations about OWI beyond the scope of single

                                                                                                 539
OWI Research Considerations

instances or courses. It is crucial to understand notions about the purpose and
value of what they are doing as teachers/tutors within the OWI context as well
as why and how are they doing it.

    A third OWI stakeholder includes administrators and non-faculty deci-
sion-makers about OWI programs. Exploring their views of OWI also is im-
portant, with the primary objectives being to discern their perceptions about the
purpose and value of OWI and how OWI fits into other ways of teaching and
learning writing at the institution.

    With attention to these stakeholders and their needs in mind, the following
types of research questions can be formulated:

    · Why do stakeholders engage in and with OWI/OWLs?
    · What are the perceived purposes of OWI/OWLs--from all participant

        perspectives?
    · What approaches to practice do participants see themselves taking?

         What pedagogical strategies do they view as most effective?
         What pedagogical strategies do they view as least effective?
         What evidence do they look for in terms of efficacy and student learn-

           ing?
    · What is the perceived value of OWI/OWLs for students, faculty, and

        administrators?
    · What are the perceived benefits for students, faculty, and administrators?
    · What are the perceived challenges for students, faculty, and administra-

        tors?
    · What approaches to practice do stakeholders see themselves taking?
    · What approaches to learning do students see themselves taking?
    · What training and professional development opportunities do instruc-

        tors and administrators view as most helpful, least helpful, and most nec-
        essary?

         What delivery mechanisms are best for such training and professional
           development?

         How can training and professional development best be evaluated for
           potential efficacy?

    · What orientation and support services do students, in particular, view as
        most helpful, least helpful, and most necessary?

    Furthermore, regarding students as stakeholders, it is paramount to under-
stand which populations of learners are served better online than others. While
ADA law is clear, institutions may not have equipped themselves to support
students online who have learning disabilities and/or physical challenges. While
their needs may be connected more to ethical rather than legal exigency, stu-

540
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

dents with multilingual issues, limited socioeconomic resources, or who are
ill-prepared for college also have access and inclusivity needs. Institutional re-
sponsibility includes preparing teachers/tutors for developing their online in-
struction inclusively. In its early days, online learning was lauded as a new way to
help those students who could not get to campus for whatever reason. Ironically,
however, the CCCC OWI Committee's research strongly suggested that writing
studies educators really do not know how to support those who are, perhaps,
most in need of the access-based opportunities that OWI can afford--such as
the blind, the dyslexic, and auditory learners, for example. There is little anec-
dotal literature and even less research on the matter, making it a crucial area for
future research.

    From the instructor perspective, we must determine the strategies, skills, and
understandings needed in orientation, training, and on-going professional de-
velopment--for new teachers as well as veteran onsite teachers entering into the
online environment, perhaps for the first time. As is commonly documented
in the OWI literature (Hewett & Ehmann, 2004; McGrath, 2012), many have
seen firsthand that the best face-to-face teachers and subject matter experts do
not always make the best online teachers--this reality crosses international as
well as subject-area boundaries. The instructional skills needed in the OWI en-
vironment do not transfer directly or straightforwardly from physical contexts,
and online instructors need training as well as ongoing professional develop-
ment to orient them to the most effective strategies for teaching writing in on-
line settings. In addition to comfort and fluency with the online technologies,
instructors need to be strong teachers and tutors of writing. Attracting, train-
ing, and retaining good teachers to use technology as well as implementing and
advancing online writing-specific pedagogies together provide the cornerstone
for any online writing program's success. How to accomplish this twofold goal
definitely warrants further study and can be explored via collecting participant
perceptions.

    The kinds of data required to access and to investigate individuals' views and
perspectives about OWI can be collected effectively via interviews and surveys
(both open- and closed-ended). As an interpretive starting point, semi-struc-
tured, open-ended interviews can focus on issues deemed important to an OWI/
OWL study and provide an opportunity to understand how respondents make
sense of those issues as well as other topics they believe are important within the
OWI context. Such perspectives can be captured with individual students in
pre-course surveys, mid-course feedback sessions, and exit-interviews after the
course. They also can be captured in student and professor course evaluations.
In the analytical process, it is possible to explore themes surrounding, for exam-
ple, approaches to OWI practice, attitudes towards OWI and students in the

                                                                                                 541
OWI Research Considerations

online environment, and perceived benefits and challenges of OWI. Employing
appropriate sampling techniques and using findings from and empirical analysis
conducted on interview data can then inform closed-ended surveys and ques-
tionnaires that ultimately can be administered on a larger scale. Based on ini-
tial open-ended interviews with identified OWI leaders in the field, the CCCC
OWI Committee administered two larger scale surveys regarding hybrid and
fully online OWI environments (CCCC OWI Committee, 2011a, 2011b), as
described in the Introduction to this book. The State of the Art of OWI (CCCC
OWI Committee, 2011c) report indicated important contextual background
and trends for the OWI landscape including:

    · the lack of a common pedagogical framework grounded in theory and
        practice specifically related to OWI,

    · the urgent need for training and professional development of educators
        and supplemental support (such as online writing centers) involved in
        OWI,

    · the lack of knowledge about ELL students and those with disabilities in
        the OWI environment, and,

    · the challenges associated with instructors' professional satisfaction with
        OWI in terms of adequate institutional support for training and technol-
        ogy needs.

From the report, it is clear that more work in the aforementioned areas is warranted.

Outcomes

    Quantitative studies that investigate student performance in terms of learn-
ing outcomes or benchmarks, grades, and course retention should be designed
and deployed for OWI and OWL settings. From an administrative perspective,
return on investment studies also can be deployed to help understand the finan-
cial impact--and potential benefits and challenges--of OWI or of an OWL
to institutions. Where possible, longitudinal research should be designed and
institutionally funded to understand the differing complexities of learning to
read and write in digital, online, and distributed online educational settings.
Retention is one of the greatest challenges for institutions and students; this
certainly is true in the United States, and other countries face the same challenge
(Boston, Ice, & Gibson, 2011). With that challenge in mind, experts must pur-
sue targeted, strategic research, and administrators must implement newfound
effective practices surrounding the support of online writing students in terms
of the expectations and modes of interaction those students encounter in online
learning environments. The following types of questions can be formulated to
address student and institutional outcomes:

542
                                                                                        Ehmann and Hewett

    · What are demographics of the students who participate in OWI/OWLs?
    · What are demographics of the instructors who participate in OWI/

        OWLs?
    · What quantifiable measures of student engagement can be tracked and

        reported on--such as attendance, assignment completion, participation
        levels, and student-to-student and/or instructor-to-student contacts?
    · What are student grades in these settings?
    · What are OWI course pass rates?
    · What are OWI course completion rates?
    · What are the OWI course retention and persistence rates?
    · What are the overall institutional retention rates and how are they affect-
        ed by the OWI courses and/or OWL presence?
    · What other standardized and/or high stakes competency or skills testing
        gains do OWI students achieve?
    · What is the fiscal and/or human investment for OWI to a department
        and/or institution and what is the return on this investment?

    The kind of data required to address the aforementioned research questions
involves student demographic information that is typically collected in standard
institutional database systems. The questions also require course-level informa-
tion typically collected in an LMS. Data analytics regarding student usage, activ-
ity, and other such behavior also can be used to triangulate and provide a fuller
picture of outcomes in the OWI environment.

    With an eye toward understanding these key areas of interactions, experi-
ences, and outcomes, practitioners and administrators alike would do well to
design courses with these factors in mind. When designing research, using data
that already may have been collected by the institution for any given course (e.g.,
student demographic information or performance) can help to achieve optimal
efficiency for research. Finally, there must be a commitment on behalf of the
institution to allow practitioners the crucial time to organize, analyze, reflect,
present, refine, and disseminate their research and findings. This commitment
to time and timing is an important element in course design that must be ne-
gotiated in the design process. Additionally, such a commitment to practitioner
time for research reflects attention to the needs for appropriate compensation for
OWI development work, as suggested by OWI Principle 8.

RECOMMENDATIONS

    This section of the chapter summarizes key points and recommendations for de-
signing an appropriate research strategy for OWI, which includes the uses of OWLs.

    Table 17.1 provides a sample research memo that can be adapted to gain

institutional, administrator, and faculty support and resources for the endeavor.
It may be used as well to encourage buy-in for a course/OWL design that can
accommodate on-going research.

    Table 17.2 (Ehmann, 2013) further summarizes research strategy options
and illustrates: key relationships between dependent and explanatory variables,
an array of possible data collection methods with corresponding analysis tech-
niques for quantitative and qualitative data, and final reporting and action steps.
It succinctly encapsulates research options, and it can be used as a starting point
for discussion with various audiences.

    The ultimate credibility of any research will rely on the goals, justifications,
articulated limitations, and overall transparency of the projects. Addressing the
following areas can serve to provide such credibility in the dissemination of
research findings:

    · A plan for researching OWI
    · Research questions
    · Overall research strategy
    · Choice of research instruments
    · Role of researcher
    · Ethical considerations
    · Selecting the sample
    · Conduct of and lessons learned during piloting
    · Data collection
    · Conduct of the interviews and/or surveys, if used
    · Analysis of the interactions
    · Analysis of the interview data
    · Findings
    · Conclusions
    · Recommendations for additional research

CONCLUSION

    Rhetoric and composition educators understand the need for OWI research
and evidence that supports OWI teaching and learning strategies. As indicated,
there are many areas open for research where scholars and practitioners can con-
tribute to the knowledge of this field. Among such areas are:

    · Outcomes on quantitatively measurable OWI student gains (e.g., grades,
        course retention, and sequence persistence) to justify overall course suc-
        cess to, for example, administrators and institutional leadership for fund-
        ing purpose, and

 Introduction

 With the pervasiveness of Internet-based education (and paucity of data and analysis),
 questions abound surrounding teaching and learning in online writing instructional contexts,
 instructor preparation, student gains, and the administration and delivery of online programs.
 This memo outlines potential research options for the exploration of online writing processes
 and the relationships between student participation in online writing and student perfor-
 mance in academic courses. It encourages the investigation of student usage data and OWI
 session archives generated via the course platform.

 Institutional Background

 [Insert key contextual information about the institution]

 Research Concept

 While many factors, such as faculty effort or student demographics, can have an impact on
 grades, course pass rates, and retention, online writing instructional courses are an important
 margin in schools' administrative decisions and budgets. Understanding the potential links
 between OWI services and various measures of student satisfaction and student academic
 success is an important step in designing OWI programs that improve overall institutional
 performance. To reach a better understanding of this intersection, research into OWI is well
 suited to focus on high-risk attrition courses such as math, chemistry, and writing. Findings
 from such a study could facilitate an institution's assessment of OWI as it relates to student
 experience and learning, retention, and ultimately return on investment.

 Methods

 Depending on specific research questions, the project can be designed in various ways that can
 lead to a largely instructor-driven initiative. Potential data sets, a summary of potential op-
 tions for research design and methods, and timeline guidelines are outlined in Chart A below.

 Data Sets

 Outcomes: Institution X's system tracks student course performance, usage, activity, and
 grades. These data provides contextual information about how and when students use the
 service. Overall student performance (grades, retention etc.), demographic information, and
 other needed data would be required from the institution.
 Student perspectives: Students' perspectives of their experience engaging in OWI qualify the
 extent to which and ways in which they view this type of online instruction as beneficial to
 their learning and potentially to other aspects of their education. Course evaluations, inter-
 views and online surveys could provide cost-effective means of collecting such perspectives.
 Faculty perspectives: Via interviews and online surveys, faculty could provide feedback on
 the effect of OWI on student learning and participation as well as how OWI has an impact
 on their teaching and pedagogical approaches and understandings. Similarly, administrators
 could provide feedback on the level of understanding and impact of OWI on overall depart-
 mental and institutional advances.
 Interactions: Via archives of student work, peer collaboration/communication/engagement,
 and faculty-student interaction, the processes and procedures of OWI can be studied. A de-
 tailed analysis of such interactional data can yield deep insights into the pedagogical strategies
 and approaches that are most beneficial to students and can assist with training and profes-
 sional of faculty members.

that can address quantitatively as well as qualitatively focused questions within
an action research paradigm. When planning for a postsecondary program that
includes OWI and designing an OWI course or that involves the intricacies of
tutoring in an OWL, these recommendations can incorporate and ultimately be
used to strengthen and fortify the teaching of writing and student learning in
online and onsite settings alike.

THE FUTURE OF OWI

        This chapter asks readers to consider future trends in OWI by understand-
        ing its contemporary nature. Given the rise of online, computer-mediated
        technologies such as an LMS for many writing courses, we argue that
        more and more in the near future writing instruction will be hybrid in
        nature--if it is not already so. We further suggest that OWI can influence
        composition writ large for the better in the twenty-first century by setting
        the pace for teacher training, working with and beyond text, rethinking
        the student, thoughtfully teaching with technology, sharing resources
        openly, reframing research and assessment, and always keeping access in
        the forefront.

        Keywords: access, alphabetic writing, assessment, collaboration, compo-
        sition writ large, ethics, "good" OWI, hybrid, literacy, multimedia, read-
        ing, House of Lore, MOOC; MOOEE, OWI Online Resource, research,
        WPA, writing pedagogy;

    Throughout this book, the authors have provided detailed explanations of
principles that emerged from research about OWI. But as these writers mention
repeatedly, the OWI principles also are good writing instruction principles in
general. Thus, as we look to the future of OWI, we must address the nature of
composition instruction itself. How much of what we say about OWI is the
same for all composition/writing courses? In our travels to conferences and other
institutions and in our many virtual interactions, educators are telling us that
the OWI principles can be applied broadly to the motivations and the exigencies
for composition writ large.

    We believe that OWI is composition writ large because OWI enables teach-
ing students to write with, through, and about the next wave of writing technol-
ogies. Dennis Baron (1999) explained that writing itself is a technology, and Mi-

The Future of OWI

chael Halloran (1990) detailed some of the tools with which writing became a
common technology in the nineteenth century, leading to a rise in the American
middle class and a postsecondary focus on writing as well as oral declamation.
When writing then superseded the once-primary orality for the citizen rhetor,
institutions and teachers sought to teach it both in person and at a distance
using such tools as US mail correspondence, television broadcasts, and audio/
video tapes; now, of course, we continue this trend digitally (Declair, 2012;
Hewett, 2013). This cycle of shifting educational technologies will continue. As
with writing technologies of times past, those used for OWI also will change--
particularly in terms of mobile devices, as detailed in Chapter 16. Indeed, some
technologies have returned us, not coincidentally, to orality through audio/video
technologies. In fact, OWI Principle 1's access requirements remind us--be-
cause both educators and the general public may forget about textual literacy
in the face of visual communication--that written transcripts must accompa-
ny those more oral and visual productions to ensure inclusive communication.
Walter Ong (1982) said, "Writing can never dispense with orality" (p. 8), and
we are seeing that orality cannot dispense with writing in OWI.

    We believe one major change in OWI will be the gradual--but not necessar-
ily slow--diminishment of distinctive features between a hybrid OWC and one
that traditionally has been considered onsite and face-to-face. Such a change
will emerge naturally as digital devices infiltrate onsite writing courses--by in-
dividual instructor initiative, institutional decree, and a trickle-down cultural
effect--and as teachers rely more often on the Internet and an LMS of some
kind to distribute content, collect writing, and provide feedback. As evidenced
through what many now call Web-enabled onsite courses, teachers increasingly
will learn to develop their courses with interactions mediated both physical-
ly onsite and through Internet technologies (see Chapters 1 & 2), which is
a key aspect of hybridity regardless of designated seat time. Although there
certainly will remain core differences regarding geographical presence when
considering the interactions of face-to-face and fully online meetings, we go
one step further in this prediction: In time, many differences among teaching
in onsite, hybrid, and fully online classrooms will begin to disappear, creating
a fluid transition from one educational environment to the other. For exam-
ple, almost all composing will be accomplished digitally through keyboard and
even voice-recognition technology, so pen and paper will become, if not old
fashioned, then simply a different way of approaching the technological prob-
lem of composing texts; these digital tools will be invisible technology-wise
in the same ways that we do not now differentiate composing by pencil (e.g.,
wooden, disposable, and refillable mechanical) versus pen (e.g., fountain pen,

554
                                                                                        Hewett and Warnock

ballpoint, and rollerball). Many contemporary students are not taught cursive
handwriting--or even keyboarding--as they grow up pecking and swiping on
hand-held devices (Shapiro & Voisin, 2013). They are interacting--albeit more
socially than educationally--via computer technology (Hewett 2015a). Educa-
tional computing certainly will become the norm rather than the choice that it
now is, and educators and students alike will need to work with it as education
all too slowly aligns with the cultural attraction to digital technologies. The
culture will then move inexorably ahead of education, as it always seems to do
(Jukes, McCain, & Crocket, 2010), leaving educators to keep what is the best
of what we now know as OWI and to attend to ever new technological advanc-
es requiring pedagogical adaptation.

    The future of OWI is not down the road. It is now. Even a book that pur-
ports to be up-to-date reflects the past more than the future. The publication
of this book is like any other book in that it leaves a time gap from its incep-
tion to when it is in the hands of readers. However, that future of OWI also is
now because digital technologies will not wait on educators to catch up. Digital
technology's nature requires continuing change, and the strategies that teachers
and tutors can and should use to teach students online must follow, albeit a
few steps behind. Indeed, we hope we will see composition studies use OWI to
elbow its way to the financial and production tables and participate in necessary
conversations about the development of technological innovations. As Christina
Haas (1996) once indicated, the changes in technologies inevitably change the
landscape and nature of composition itself, which is the primary theme of this
final chapter.

    Interestingly, perhaps, the kind of broader disciplinary absorption of OWI
practices and approaches into what we just generally think of as composition
means a re-thinking of our terminology. OWI may end up being reserved for the
administrative side of composition and for the logistical and material consider-
ations of teaching via computer and online technologies instead of in an onsite
classroom. As Jason Snart demonstrates in Chapter 2, logistics and place still
matter in terms of how courses are designed and deployed. But pedagogically,
the term OWI may mean less and less to us.. We will need a new way of think-
ing about the ubiquity of digital tools, a new term--and we wonder whether
maybe that term is simply composition. Thus, OWI is and will continue to be
about composition--not just composition taught in an online setting but, we
argue, composition writ large. In this sense, we smile to think that the CCCC
OWI Committee as it currently is named and conceived is moving toward ob-
solescence given that its specialized online work is becoming that of writing
instruction more generally.

                                                                                                 555
The Future of OWI

"GOOD" OWI

    At the end of this book, we find ourselves trying to articulate what we be-
lieve comprises "good" OWI. For those who have paid attention to OWI itself
as merely a supplemental educational approach for composition writ large, the
ongoing, global march of digital technology into all composing processes and
educational venues offers the potential to revitalize composition instruction
overall--to enable new views of composition, some subtle, some overt. OWI
offers all writing educators a new lens for framing our work. To that end, good
OWI extends the potential to revisit what we think about composition overall
and how we, as a discipline, want to move forward.

Good OWI Means Being a Good Teacher

    Good OWI means that one first must be a good teacher. To this end, we
strongly believe that OWI Principle 7 rightly grounds OWI teacher preparation.
One first should be a good teacher of text-based composition--remember that
alphabetic writing is not going away--then a teacher who can teach composi-
tion through text as well as image and video, and then a teacher who knows how
to do these things using digital technologies. The writing studies field, perhaps
through re-designed graduate training, will need to prepare new teachers by
painstakingly and methodically addressing all three of those needs.

    To expound on these three needs, first, it seems clear that knowledge of
writing studies with respect to teaching writing is crucial. There are fundamen-
tal concepts without which teachers of writing cannot proceed. Some scholars
(Meyer & Land, 2006; Wardle, 2012) have explored writing studies' "threshold
concepts," which are crucial to teachers' understanding of what they do as well as
helpful for students who strive to make sense of what they are being taught and
why. The notion that "conceptions of writing matter, come from somewhere,
and various conceptions of writing are more or less accurate and helpful" is
important for grounding the teaching of writing in a stable body of knowledge.
Such concepts also include "text mediates human activity; people don't write
in a vacuum" and "`composing' goes far beyond our usual conceptions of it as
related to alphabetic/print-based writing. What counts as composing changes as
our world and technologies change" (Wardle, 2012). These concepts underscore
the commonality of this field of study, recognize its challenges for pinning down
a single theory of writing, and validate its flexible nature.

    The second aspect--the ability to convey that knowledge through text, im-
ages, and video--is a newer factor, however. In years past, writing primarily
has been conveyed through textbook content and oral lecture. In OWI, com-

556
                                                                                        Hewett and Warnock

posing knowledge is conveyed asynchronously through thousands of teacher's
words and students' written responses (Warnock, 2009). Hewett (2010, 2015a,
2015b) theorized that some students fail to persist and/or succeed in OWCs
because writing is taught through teacher writing and student reading of that
writing. Students' basic reading literacy skills particularly need to be strong in
OWI because much of their understanding of writing strategies is gained pri-
marily by reading text-based instruction. Where their literacy skills are weak--
and we think many contemporary students have suboptimal traditional literacy
skills--they can become lost in what often is an effort to teach themselves how
to write through comprehending and applying to their own writing what they
are reading about writing (see, for example, Fleischer, 2010; Hewett, 2015a;
Rose, 2012). Where teacher writing skills have not been developed with in-
structing through text as the goal--and most contemporary teachers have been
prepared primarily for oral instruction and the use of others' professional, edited
textbooks (see, for example, Britton & Glgz, 1991; Hewett, 2015a)--then
teachers strain to make themselves understood (to fully-online students par-
ticularly); they may find themselves frustrated with their OWI students. These
situations must change with focused teacher preparation for primarily text-based
instruction.

    The third need for good OWI teachers is that all teachers, not just the select
few OWI pioneers, should understand how to use digital technologies effectively
and flexibly to reach the wide variety of student learners matriculated into con-
temporary postsecondary institutions. This means teachers need training and
support in an access-friendly LMS through which the teaching of writing is
stressed over how to use the technology acontextually, and they need to use
their writing studies knowledge to benefit a wider variety of learners than ever
before. To foster teacher satisfaction, Effective Practice 12.1 suggests that only
teachers who are best suited to OWI should be assigned OWCs. That practice
makes sense given that some educators have taught onsite for decades and may
find online teaching to be so different or off-putting as to hurt their effectiveness
and to damage students' writing course experiences. Consider that even today
many teachers have no model of online instruction from a participant view:
They have never taken such a course. However, in what might seem like an un-
fair turn-about, we believe that in the OWI future that is now, all new teachers
should be being prepared to teach writing in hybrid and fully online settings.
The future of OWI as composition writ large will not be able to accommodate
teachers who function well only onsite where technology does not intrude or
does so in merely a Web-enhanced manner. When digital technology is part of
all writing instruction, as we believe it will be, every writing teacher should be
able to function in that milieu.

                                                                                                 557
The Future of OWI

Good OWI Means that Composition Is Both About and Beyond
Text

    Good OWI also encourages and enables the field of writing studies to con-
tinue the redefinition of what it means by "composition" beyond text and then
to use the digital strategies, such as those described in this book and articulat-
ed through research with other experienced instructors, to help students learn
how to produce both traditionally text-based writing and digitally and multime-
dia-enhanced products. Rhetoric and composition educators have long thought
in terms of alphabetic, text-based writing; while we strongly believe this is a
necessary literacy focus that needs continuing attention, as technorhetoricians
point out (see Chapter 14, for example), however crucial textual literacy re-
mains, multimodal composition also is important. Undoubtedly, composition
is about a broader digitally produced, image- and audio-based type of writing
that integrates with text to convey a message, and composition researchers have
looked at composition in terms broader than text for some time. For example,
Mary Hocks and Michelle Kendrick (2003) said we need to move beyond stark
binaries and instead focus on the "complex, interpenetrating relationships be-
tween word and images" (p. 5). In the opening chapter of her co-edited anthol-
ogy, Writing New Media, Anne Wysocki (2004) said she need not even argue
"that we need to open writing classes to new media" because so many similar
arguments had already been made; instead, she stated, "I want to argue that new
media needs to be opened to writing" (p. 5, emphasis in original). Indeed, because
OWI naturally is connected to digital tools, multimodal composing processes
may be reinvigorated and strengthened in this learning environment--although
significant differences remain when teaching such composing processes as ways
to engage digital technologies versus teaching those processes online, at a distance,
and through digital technologies. OWI platforms are almost always digital and
thus invite new communication media into the writing process and product
because all media forms are arguably more easily accessible, reproducible, and
shareable online.

    Textual, visual, and oral/aural literacies are, of course, increasingly neces-
sary to communicate in the globally digital world that is home to us and our
students. Teaching these literacies means rethinking the types of texts, genres,
styles, purposes, and audiences on which a composition course focuses. It means,
as well, reconsidering the notion of literacy in the face of text, image, and audio/
video media. Is the expository or argumentative researched essay that students
have been taught in FYW and supported in upper-level writing courses still the
most viable or crucial genre to teach? If so, why? If not, what elements of that
genre should be carried into the instruction of new or different genres? These

558
                                                                                        Hewett and Warnock

questions represent a miniscule part of the conversation that writing studies ed-
ucators should address broadly because OWI is not only a tool, style, or strategy
for teaching writing. Writing online is the essence of composing for the many
students and teachers who have grown up with digital tools.

    Contemporary students certainly must supplement their traditional reading
and writing skills with the additional rhetorical strategies of visual and oral/
audio literacy. However, students often are not getting this instruction because
many instructors resist learning how to use these technologies, perhaps thinking
that teaching how to compose with them is optional, and many administrators
directly or tacitly support this perspective. With OWI, instructors minimal-
ly will need to learn different technologies and how they support pedagogical
goals. This task perhaps is not easy or intuitive, yet as digital tools become in-
herent components to all writing instruction, we should become more able to
incorporate these approaches into what we do. If students are to develop highly
critical literacy skills in written, visual, and oral/aural venues, then composition
writ large must change. In addressing that need, we believe teachers will become
better by teaching with and through digital technology.

Good OWI Means Rethinking Our Students

    Suppose that writing teachers really can be better at what we do because we
use technology throughout our instruction. If this is the case, how can we help
students become better students because they learn to write with and through
the same technologies?

    The CCCC OWI Committee believes the OWI principles fundamentally
hold regardless of modality, media, or digital device, but we recognize that we--
we as a committee as well as the writing studies field--will have opportunities to
refine teaching practices, and some of these refinements no doubt will be based
on our student populations. The question then becomes one of understanding
our student populations, perhaps in new ways. Does OWI lead us to the creation
of different approaches for thinking about the types of students in our courses?

    For certain, educators must continue to improve how we work with under-
served populations, as OWI Principle 1 stated. These populations include, but
are not limited to, first-in-the-family college students, those who work full time,
those who return to college after previous postsecondary failure or attrition,
and those who leverage their future through student loans. They include, as
Part 3 of this book indicates, students with physical disabilities; both significant
and minor learning differences; multilingual backgrounds; socioeconomic dis-
advantages; and access concerns inherent to remotely rural, urban, incarcerated,
and military populations. The committee's overarching drive in including access

                                                                                                 559
The Future of OWI

front-and-center is to help us think more about who is in our courses and work
creatively to address them, using a generosity of spirit that accommodates all.

Good OWI Means Teaching with Technology in Thoughtful Ways

    As we mentioned, the time may be upon us to move from the dichotomy
between onsite and OWI and into the frame that all writing instruction is now
taught through/with digital technology and students in all settings share the
promises, challenges, and responsibility of writing in the technology-centric
twenty-first century. "Computers simply are not going to go away," said Tim
Mayers and Kevin Swafford (1998; see also Hewett & Ehmann, 2004), arguing
that we need to put them to good use (p. 146). From the perspective of 2015,
we argue that digital tools are even more ingrained.

    Luddites might rankle at the idea of digital ubiquity, but think about how
such technological commonality might advance several educational causes. For
example, educational technology is siloed in writing studies. At the CCCC con-
ference, those who teach OWI can choose to submit or attend a panel from the
"Information Technology" cluster. At other venues, the conferences of NCTE or
MLA, the "computer people" (or people who think about teaching literacy skills
through digital technologies) are off to the side. (Think how ridiculous it would
be to have a "cluster" about pencil-based writing!). So-called computer people
may only be the majority at the Computers and Composition conference. If we
begin to think about digital technologies as woven into the writing and com-
munication experiences of all teachers and students and as an essential part of
composition writ large, the conversation about OWI will change. OWI sudden-
ly will be less a colorful addition to writing studies' tapestry and more the weft
to the warp with every OWI line, shape, and color becoming just as important
as traditional onsite writing instruction. Just as OWI Principles 3 and 4 offer
a yin and yang position between developing theory and practice for OWI and
migrating appropriate onsite theory and pedagogy to online settings, a more in-
tegrated sense of OWI into composition will enable teachers to provide ways for
students to learn that occur on a continuum of sorts. Teachers and tutors then
will have techniques to teach with their best selves and strategies while they also
engage innovative digital strategies based on what they want to do in a class[room].

    The perspective that OWI = alphabetic text remains locked into the mindset
of many institutions, and, again, we strongly believe alphabetic writing remains
important. But as we mentioned above, the exciting--and access-based--ways
that OWI encourages multimodality and other experimental or newer permu-
tations of composing will continue to demand attention as new digital develop-
ments appear and writing evolves (or, by ancient standards) returns to compos-

560
                                                                                        Hewett and Warnock

ing in varying media. The premise of such work might be, although it does not
have to be, technologically deterministic: How do learning technologies shift
pedagogy and philosophy? For example, as work by Jeff Sommers (2002) and
others (e.g., Warnock, 2008) have shown, using audiovisual commentary to re-
spond to student writing may alter students' interactions with their own writing
because the medium may shift how they understand the feedback and apply it
to their composing processes; these shifts are beyond the platform and form of
commentary yet also related to them. As we continue to explore the ways that
OWI inspires us to use multimodality for teaching and learning, we will have to
think about how we communicate with and teach our students and how those
approaches shift in varying environments--as well as how what we teach as
composing and process change. In line with Sommers (2013), how might dif-
ferent means of communicating with students about their writing change those
very conversations? How might technologies that link students and provide easy
spaces to share and comment on peer texts? What might that mean for teaching?
Other fundamental questions arise, such as how does multimodal OWI alter
relationships between teachers and students and among students themselves?
As Gail Hawisher (1992) pointed out, asynchronous dialogue can be liberat-
ing in its reduction or outright elimination of barriers based on identity. How
will multimodal OWI change that dynamic in both positive and negative ways?
Thoughtful answers to such questions certainly emerge from a well-considered
research agenda and sharing of both empirical and experiential studies, as we
discuss next.

Good OWI Means Cataloging the House of Lore

    Who has the next killer app to help students access course material? Is that
app really wonderful for students or just interesting to technologically sophisti-
cated teachers? How can we create, as part of our fundamental course structures,
environments that provide access--and opportunity--for all learners? Will op-
portunities for us to use big data tools help us not just know our students demo-
graphically but also understand their writing profiles in new ways? What can we
learn about writing from these tools? What is the best support in terms of online
tutoring, library access, and counseling access for online writing students? Why
do we think so? What do we need to know? The fields that comprise writing
studies could do a lot more to design research that help us think through how
particular applications, technologies, and technology-facilitated approaches af-
fect student populations.

    Stephen North's (1987) House of Lore is oft cited because it is an enduring
and endearing metaphor of composition teaching knowledge--"a rambling, to

                                                                                                 561
The Future of OWI

my mind delightful old manse" (p. 27)--but we have wandered that house for
too long without cataloging it. Writing instruction in general needs a better col-
lective memory so we are not all reinventing student interactions, pedagogical
strategies, and assignments (Haswell, 2005). Composition itself, if for no other
reason than the widely varied number and types of offered writing courses cou-
pled with the quasi-professional status rendered upon so many writing teachers,
has a large, specific problem in this way. Writing teachers who meet each other
annually at professional meetings may not realize that they are inventing the
same innovative teaching practices. To help end this serious problem for OWI,
the CCCC OWI Committee has undertaken the major work of developing an
OWI Online Resource. We hope that writing educators who teach online will
submit their own OWI effective practices for possible publication. This peer-re-
viewed, open-source, community-themed resource is designed to assist all OWI
instructors in sharing, developing, and refining teaching practices that are con-
nected to the OWI principles and effective practices. Of course, in line with the
broader point we are making here, this endeavor will evolve into an open, free
resource for all writing instructors.

Good OWI Means Re-Framing Writing Research and Assessment

    As Chapter 17 indicates, one of the most prominent obstacles in the way of
advancing powerful writing education is a dearth of empirical research. Conse-
quently, many people in positions of community, state, federal, and corporate
power--people who do not know anything about teaching writing--have been
given the opportunity to dictate how teachers generally and writing teachers
specifically teach and assess our classes. Again, OWI can help reverse engineer
the entire field of writing instruction and influence composition writ large by
tapping into the campus and national curiosity that online learning engenders to
develop strong, concrete research that demonstrates what students are learning,
how they are learning, and, perhaps, what methods are most effective for helping
particular student populations learn. Our humanistic work does not require sci-
entific reproducibility, but the lack of concrete markers for success undoubtedly
has contributed to the disciplinary respect issues of writing studies.

    Viewed from this perspective, this book does not merely provide methods
for teaching writing online more effectively but also a map for launching into
empirical research not just for OWI, not just for composition writ large, but for
teaching in general. As the Introduction asserts, the CCCC OWI Committee
made such strides by engaging in data gathering and research that otherwise
does not exist regarding real teachers conducting real OWCs. To this end, good
OWI certainly requires quality and kairotic writing research.

562
                                                                                        Hewett and Warnock

    Writing assessment itself has too long had its own place as an uncatalogued
branch of composition's House of Lore and needs to be addressed more straight-
forwardly and even eagerly. To that end, good OWI requires an understanding
of teaching effectiveness through assessment, which should be developed based
on OWI principles and effective practices. Both teachers' work and the stu-
dents' learning need such evaluation badly because we know too little about
how to effect genuine and lasting change in student writing in online settings.
OWI's fundamental connection to technology through AWE opens up many
assessment opportunities, as described in Chapter 17. We need to know what
students are learning in their composing and whether and how their writing
looks and changes over time. The digital technologies inherent to OWI capture
and archive student writing in connection to teachers' assignments, content, and
feedback. And if we open our minds to the possibilities of technology-assisted
assessment, we can harness the wealth of available data to describe writing char-
acteristics and qualities, learning empirically the nature of writing in our time.

    Why should researchers, WPAs, and OWI teachers be aggressive here? We
might view our OWI assessment prospects with AWE as analogous to how com-
position treated the machine grading of student writing: The field did not act,
and now these types of applications have spread like kudzu (Haswell, 2006) yet
they do little to help teaching and learning. If we do not design assessment mea-
sures that make sense based on writing class and program outcomes--as well as
on the characteristics inherent in genuine student writing--without question
such measures will be defined for us and implemented upon us. Going forward,
OWI teachers need to construct and pilot ways of measuring their courses and
student writing growth in terms of change that allow sensible, applicable results.
We also need to study and share such assessment measures with students, whose
feedback is essential to refining these assessment tools. To this end, we should
consider how OWI provides entrée into empirical ways of research; such research
should inform our assessments going forward.

    OWI's inherently technical nature meshes naturally with AWE, corpus anal-
ysis, and data mining because digital platforms provide unprecedented ways of
helping writing researchers get at tough questions about writing instruction and
its effects. In fact, we envision a continuing shift in graduate programs to help
those who want to specialize in composition toward hybrid-type research meth-
odologies that involve statistics, social science, ethnography, linguistics, and rhe-
torical and textual analysis. In their introduction to a special issue of College
English, "The Digital Humanities and Historiography in Rhetoric and Com-
position," Jessica Enoch and David Gold (2013) discussed how the invention
by digital scholars of "tools to mine and make sense of this archival infinitude,"
in the context of the digital humanities, "is breeding a new type of scholarship:

                                                                                                 563
The Future of OWI

digital historiography" (pp. 106-107). There are, in short, new research methods
and tools that will be developed as we deal not only with the newness of these
texts but also with their sheer volume and our need for ways to access and assess
them. (The rest of the issue addresses specifics for how to do just that.) Again,
because of the inherent digital nature of the teaching, learning, interactions,
and community of OWI, these approaches, we believe, are a natural part of the
overall composition endeavor.

    While the teaching of writing undoubtedly will change by virtue of OWI,
we worry that without the kind of conscious actions discussed in this book that
composition itself, in fact, will not change the way it needs to. We worry that
digital technologies simply will be used as a mechanism to replicate the troubled
structures of traditional, onsite writing instruction: bad pay, no respect, few full-
time professional opportunities, and lack of shared development among others.
If that happens, our CCCC OWI Committee is concerned it will have served
no one. June Griffin and Deborah Minter (2013) talked about Cynthia Selfe
(2009, 1999), to whom we return here: We must pay attention to not allowing
OWI to worsen education and social inequities, both larger and within the field
writ large. The danger certainly exists (Griffin & Minter, 2013, p. 141). Our
hope resides in the fact that the artifacts of writing revealed and presented so
beautifully via OWI can help us; the "digital classroom record can be mined
for information," and it can help change the material conditions of teaching
for the better because the "intellectual work" of the class "might be more easily
documented now that online classrooms have the long memory of the digital"
(Griffin & Minter, 2013, p. 153). One thing is for certain: We have always been
confident that if external audiences and stakeholders could see and understand
what we do in composition courses with students, they would be amazed and
come to understand the incredible complexity of teaching composing.

Good OWI Means Ethical and Moral Writing Instruction

    It is appropriate for us to end this chapter, and thus the book, where A Po-
sition Statement of Principles and Example Effective Practices for OWI begins: The
fundamental responsibility we have is to make sure that OWCs are inclusive of
and accessible to all learners. As education, especially higher education, contin-
ues to ask difficult questions about accessibility, OWI educators now find our-
selves at the forefront--a place where composition itself also should be. Based
on our committee's research, unfortunately the overall field of writing studies
is not at the forefront of access issues. As OWI Principle 1 insists and all the
chapters of this book support, ethical and moral composition instruction means
being thoughtfully inclusive and providing willing, flexible, and generous access

564
                                                                                        Hewett and Warnock

at all stages of the writing instructional process and with any tools necessary.
To put access first--to be proactive and not retroactive--changes the nature
of every administrative and pedagogical decision that follows (see, for example,
Part 3 of this book and Oswal & Hewett, 2013). Every question asked of or by a
WPA is changed in light of proactive access policies. Every student need should
be considered in light of whether inclusivity and access are at issue, and not just
for the sake of legality but because such consideration is a reflection of who we
are as rhetorician/compositionists and as human beings

    The OWI principles in A Position Statement of Principles and Example Effective
Practices for OWI stress genuinely fair treatment of OWI students and teachers.
These OWI principles, if applied, suggest practical approaches to experimental,
online, educational venues such as the massification of writing courses involved
in MOOCs. We would not, as a committee, try to undermine the extraordinary
openness that computers can represent (as described so optimistically by those
like Bonk, 2008), but composition never has been and never will be able to be
represented by a massive dumping of content. It cannot be leveraged with ap-
proaches of massiveness. For example, if 15 to 20 students are the maximum any
OWI teacher should have in any one course, as OWI Principle 9 stated, obvious
mathematics indicate how many teachers and/or set of tutor-teachers need to be
involved if a MOOC counts as a credit-worthy writing course where students
receive individual, learned feedback. Principle-generated thinking encourages
such creative options as designating the MOOC to be more a writing lab or oth-
er supplementary or non-credit bearing educational experience, what Warnock
calls a MOOEE in Chapter 4. OWI Principle 13 also calls for online tutoring
that matches the OWC's modality and medium, creating a smoother techno-
logical transition for students from OWC to OWL assistance. Indeed, applying
the OWI principles to online tutoring clarifies that providing accessible learning
support is more crucial than how that support is provided or paid for--enabling
administrators a different way into the problem. We treat students ethically and
morally when we provide them with appropriate preparation and sufficiently
well-prepared teachers and tutors. The OWI principles call for fair and appropri-
ate compensation for teachers' work, class sizes that enable genuine instruction
to occur, and professional development that helps teachers fit the teaching mo-
dality to themselves rather than the other way around.

    Thus, good OWI that is composition writ large means using the intentions
of the OWI principles to foreground all of our teaching with access and in-
clusivity no matter how much doing so might require changing our personal
teaching strategies. Accessible OWI means rethinking the very nature of writ-
ing by enabling and encouraging students to write with both text and voice
(e.g., using computer or cell-phone voice recognition software for drafting) to

                                                                                                 565
The Future of OWI

compose their ideas and perhaps even to deliver them. Access-focused OWI
means letting go of some habits of thinking about composing and recognizing
that being straightforward, using linguistically direct language, and providing
students flexibly varied entry points into writing are not cheating but rather
teaching them to use the best available means for their composition purposes.
It means modeling how to write, re-teaching reading strategies that some never
learned well, and thinking differently about collaboration and plagiarism wor-
ries (Hewett, 2015a, 2015b, 2010). Such changes can enhance the moral and
ethical practices for writing instruction overall.

    Good OWI inevitably will--must--change the face of composition by its
ethical and moral practice. This future that is now offers an invitation we should
accept, and we should try not to step back into the mass of colleagues who teach
online in rote ways that ignore the complexities of writing and writing through
and with digital technologies. Students at all levels of education and with all
kinds of backgrounds take writing courses. They all need our attention no mat-
ter how challenging their backgrounds make them as writing students.

CONCLUSION

    Good OWI should help the field of composition be better. We believe that OWI
will--if allowed--change how people in our profession view their work as writ-
ing teachers overall and ultimately change how outsiders view us. Good OWI
should move composition, the whole structure, forward. As we discussed earlier,
our terminology may not be keeping up with the pedagogical approaches of
composition now, approaches that draw from and fundamentally use not just
the actual tools but also concepts of digitality and virtuality. A challenge going
forward for our committee may be to re-frame the term OWI, separating con-
ceptually the logistical offering of courses in different modalities (online, onsite,
hybrid/blended) from the composition pedagogies that all use digital tools--no
matter whether teachers breathe the same air as their students once a term, once
a week, or never. For now, though, we see OWI as merging into a compositional
future when digital composition and creation will be inherent.

    Many scholars have labored to study the effects of the computer and other
digital technology on composition, teaching, and learning. In fact, this book
is dedicated in honor of their work and contributions. Without them, there
could be no principled study of OWI. Over 25 years ago, Lisa Gerrard (1989)
said that we must remember that the computer is an additional tool, not the
primary one (p. 107). Perhaps that reality has changed in that the computer has
become--if not a must in postsecondary institutions (as well as in most places
of business)--then at least a transparent part of the cultural and communica-

tions landscape: We are one with these devices; they are part of our lives. Those
without adequate access to OWI continue to suffer from the resulting digital
illiteracies much as those who cannot read or write do (Selfe, 1999, 2009). In
fact, all of their literacies necessary to navigating their world suffer by extension.
The future of OWI is composition in flux. It is composition in tension where
traditional literacies and digital composing strategies must learn to collaborate
in the digital production of messages. As technology becomes ubiquitous--even
to those who currently are denied adequate access--and as it changes to become
increasingly common, OWI necessarily and repeatedly will return to a need for
textual, alphabetic literacy.

    OWI indeed offers composition writ large the opportunity to supplement
traditional reading and writing skills just as it requires higher levels of atten-
tion to those same traditional literacy skills. OWI takes the worn-out role of
teacher we are used to and forces us to rethink it as well as notions of literacy,
student, reading, writing, composition, collaboration, and course. OWI offers us
opportunities to reconstruct not only our roles but how we go about teaching--
and treating--students of all physical abilities, ages, learning styles, economic
backgrounds, and languages as humans who want to learn how to use reading,
writing, images, and oral/aural means to think.

    Using the OWI principles to guide online writing instructional work is what
this book has been about; yet, as this chapter suggests, these OWI principles can
help to guide composition to a new place. The future of OWI is now. How shall
we take it on?

FOUNDATIONAL PR ACTICES OF OWI

Foundational Practices of Online Writing Instruction (OWI) addresses the questions
and decisions that administrators and instructors most need to consider when devel-
oping online writing programs and courses. The contributors to this collection explain
the foundations of the recently published (2013) "A Position Statement of Principles
and Examples Effective Practices for OWI" and provide illustrative practical applica-
tions. The editors offer this collection in the hope that it will encourage readers to join
a conversation about designing practices, contributing to the data about OWI, and
reshaping its theory.

Beth L. Hewett has written numerous articles and books, including Reading to
Learn and Writing to Teach: Literacy Strategies for Online Writing Instruction, The On-
line Writing Conference: A Guide for Teachers and Tutors, and Preparing Educators for
Online Writing Instruction: Principles and Practices. Dr. Hewett's other interests in-
clude the characteristics of college-level writing, the public rhetoric of eulogies, and
connections between postsecondary writing and the world-at-large. She also writes
about grief and works as a bereavement coach and facilitator trainer.

Kevin Eric DePew is Associate Professor at Old Dominion University. His work about
OWI has appeared in Computers and Composition as well as the Handbook of Research on
Computer Mediated Communication and Emerging Pedagogies in the Networked Knowl-
edge Society. His other work explores social justice and writing instruction, the teaching
of multilingual writers, and the design of writing curricula that encourages knowledge
transfer. He currently serves on the CCCC's Committee for Effective Practices in On-
line Writing Instruction and the CCCC Committee on Second Language Writing.
