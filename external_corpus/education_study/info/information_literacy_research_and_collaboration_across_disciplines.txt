Series Editors, Susan H. McLeod and Rich Rice

The Perspectives on Writing series addresses writing studies in a broad sense.
Consistent with the wide ranging approaches characteristic of teaching and
scholarship in writing across the curriculum, the series presents works that take
divergent perspectives on working as a writer, teaching writing, administering
writing programs, and studying writing in its various forms.

The WAC Clearinghouse, Colorado State University Open Press, and University
Press of Colorado are collaborating so that these books will be widely available
through free digital distribution and low-cost print editions. The publishers and
the Series editors are committed to the principle that knowledge should freely
circulate. We see the opportunities that new technologies have for further de-
mocratizing knowledge. And we see that to share the power of writing is to share
the means for all to articulate their needs, interest, and learning into the great
experiment of literacy.

     INFORMATION LITERACY:
RESEARCH AND COLLABORATION

         ACROSS DISCIPLINES
INTRODUCTION

      Barbara J. D'Angelo, Sandra Jamieson, Barry Maid,
      and Janice R. Walker

When we began discussing our vision for a collection on information literacy
(IL), our initial conversations revolved around the incredible amount of schol-
arship and practice that already existed in both Writing Studies (WS) and in
Library/Information Science (LIS). Yet, while librarians, writing faculty, and
other disciplinary faculty had presented and/or published together, there was
still not enough cross-over in disciplinary literature addressed to both faculty
and librarian audiences.

    One of our goals for this collection, then, was to bring together the rich
scholarship and pedagogy from multiple perspectives and disciplines to provide
a broader and more complex understanding of IL in the second decade of the
21st century. Further, we hoped that a collection that bridged the disciplinary
divide would advance the notion of shared responsibility and accountability for
the teaching, learning, and research of IL in the academy: faculty, librarians,
administrators, and external stakeholders such as accrediting agencies and the
businesses/industries that employ our graduates.

    As we issued the call for contributions for the collection, our view of IL was
guided by the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL) Information
Literacy Standards for Higher Education (IL Standards) which defines IL as the
ability to "determine the extent of information needed, access the needed infor-
mation effectively and efficiently, evaluate information and its sources critically,
incorporate selected information into one's knowledge base, use information
effectively to accomplish a specific purpose, understand the economic, legal and
social issues surrounding the use of information, and access and use information
legally" (ACRL, 2000). Widely cited since its formal approval by the ACRL
Board, the IL Standards has seen widespread acceptance by librarians, faculty,
administrators, and accrediting bodies. As a result, librarians and faculty have
created strong partnerships to develop pedagogy related to IL and the IL Stan-
dards have been adapted to meet disciplinary contexts.

    However, the IL Standards also have faced considerable criticism as both
research and practice began to highlight and illustrate the shortcomings of a
standards- and competencies-based approach. Critiques of the IL Standards,
theoretically and research-based, have focused on the de-contextualized nature
of standards that potentially emphasize a prescribed set of skills. Research

Introduction

demonstrated that IL is a contextual concept situated in specific information
landscapes. For example, Carol Kuhlthau's ground-breaking research on the
information search process (Kuhlthau, 2004) clearly demonstrated the process-­
oriented nature of research and has shaped IL pedagogy within LIS. Christine
Bruce's (1997) landmark work on the relational nature of IL, along with the work
of others in Australia and Europe (see, for example, Lupton, 2004; Limberg,
2008; Lloyd, 2010), further demonstrated that IL is contextual and that individ-
uals "experience" IL in ways that are dependent on the context of the situation.

    Not long after we began work on this collection, ACRL established a task
force to review the IL Standards and to make recommendations to update them.
In recognition of the broad constituency that is impacted by and responsible for
IL, the task force consisted of librarians, administrators, and external constitu-
ents from accrediting agencies and other relevant associations. Our development
of the collection and the Task Force's work to review and make recommenda-
tions about the IL Standards ensued nearly simultaneously and it became clear to
us that the emerging framework based on threshold concepts and metaliteracy
was consistent with trends we were seeing in WS and in higher education in
general. Recognition of the roles of faculty and librarians within the academy
and of the rapidly changing dynamic information landscape all contributed to
the impetus for the Task Force's work, resulting in the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (Framework for IL).

    The Framework for IL is divided into six frames, each with a set of related
knowledge practices and dispositions:

      · Authority is constructed and contextual

      · Information creation as a process
      · Information has value
      · Research as inquiry
      · Scholarship as conversation
      · Searching as strategic exploration

    The Framework for IL draws upon both threshold concepts (foundational
concepts within a discipline that serve as portals to thinking and practice) and
the concept of metaliteracy (Mackey & Jacobson, 2011; Mackey & Jacobson,
2014). Metaliteracy presents a vision for IL as an overarching literacy that places
students in the role of both consumer and producer of information within
today's collaborative information environments. Metaliteracy also emphasizes
four domains of engagement within the information environment: behav-
ioral, affective, cognitive, and metacognitive with metacognition as particularly
important for individuals to become self-directed learners required in today's
rapidly changing landscape.

    Rather than focus on discrete skills, the Framework for IL is grounded in
core concepts with the intent that implementation would be flexible to allow
local contexts to influence the development of teaching and learning practices.
The revised, expanded definition of IL accompanying the Framework for IL also
explicates current thinking of IL as a more sophisticated and contextual concept
relevant to student learning throughout their academic careers (and beyond):

         Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities encom-
         passing the reflective discovery of information, the under-
         standing of how information is produced and valued, and the
         use of information in creating new knowledge and participat-
         ing ethically in communities of learning. (ACRL, 2015)

    The adoption of the Framework for IL presents a challenge to all of us who
research, teach, and assess IL. The use of the word "framework" intentionally
emphasizes that the document is a structure to set the context for ongoing dis-
cussions and collaborations between librarians, faculty, administrators, and other
stakeholders to connect and to partner for the development of IL programs that
are relevant within each program and institution. The Framework for IL further
challenges all of us involved in IL to learn about and envision what threshold
concepts and metaliteracy mean in order to develop pedagogy that facilitates
transfer of learning across contexts as well as how these concepts influence and
shape research studies and projects related to IL. As the Task Force worked,
releasing drafts for discussion, the Framework for IL was received positively by
many librarians, who began using it to discuss and shape instruction programs
even before its approval by the ACRL Board. While it would be easy to view the
Framework for IL as a marked shift away from the IL Standards, in reality it is an
evolution based on nearly 20 years of research and practice.

    As this collection moved to fruition, we realized, as editors, how much
of an exigence the Framework for IL was and continued to be. Themes that
authors explore in chapters mirror the threshold concepts and metaliteracy
principles that ground the Framework for IL. The scope of the collection began
as an attempt to bridge disciplinary boundaries, which is also a goal of the
Framework for IL. As we read the submissions, a further vision for the col-
lection emerged as a bridge between past/current knowledge and the future.
As such, we defer to Rolf Norgaard and Caroline Sinkinson, the authors of
the first chapter, who refer to the Roman god Janus as a potential presiding
deity for their essay. We would suggest that Janus, with one face looking back
and one looking to the future, further serves as the presiding deity for the
collection as a whole: one face looking back and celebrating past and cur-
rent work on IL and one looking forward to the continued evolution of IL

                                                                                                    5
Introduction

as the Framework for IL continues to take hold and influences our pedagogy,
research, and assessment practices.

ORGANIZATION OF THE COLLECTION

Within the dual exigencies of bridging boundaries and creating connections past
and future, the chapters presented in this collection facilitate an understanding
of how IL has evolved and continues to evolve. Chapters address the core con-
cepts articulated in the Framework for IL and demonstrate the relevance of it to
higher education; indeed, chapters emphasize how the foundational underpin-
nings of the Framework for IL have been part of our understanding and work in
IL, even if unarticulated. Chapters also address related threshold concepts, meta-
cognition, large-scale research studies, programmatic and institutional efforts
to institutionalize IL, and pedagogical innovations. Above all, this collection
should be viewed as part of the conversation about IL as we adapt to and imple-
ment the Framework for IL. In that spirit, the book begins with a conversation
between WS and LIS as Rolf Norgaard and Caroline Sinkinson engage in dia-
logue to look back over more than a decade of teaching and learning related to
IL and ponder the future.

    To continue and build upon the dialogue, we have organized the collection
into four sections, each representing a core focus area of IL. Section I situates
IL and provides us with understanding of how and why IL is a contextual con-
cept based on threshold concepts and metaliteracy. Section II presents results of
research projects which help us to further our understanding of IL and of stu-
dent learning related to it, particularly the threshold concept of Scholarship as
Conversation. Section III explores the already rich collaborations taking place to
define IL locally within programs and institutions and to define shared respon-
sibility for IL. Chapters in Section IV describe pedagogical strategies and eval-
uation of them. This section ends by returning us back to the notion of conver-
sation and collaboration between WS and LIS. Finally, in the afterword, Trudi
Jacobson wraps up the collection by reminding us of the complex information
landscape we and our students now find ourselves in and how the Framework for
IL and metaliteracy are providing us with a new lens to facilitate our teaching
and learning of IL as shared responsibility.

SECTION I. SITUATING INFORMATION LITERACY

Authors in Section I bring together past theory and practice to situate IL for us by
articulating what the Framework for IL means for the evolution of IL pedagogy,
research, and assessment. Just over a decade ago, in one of the few notable pieces
of scholarship to cross disciplinary boundaries, Rolf Norgaard contextualized IL

                                                                                                  Introduction

rhetorically in his seminal paired articles in Reference and User Services Quarterly
(2003, 2004). Norgaard and librarian Caroline Sinkinson begin our collection
in conversation to look back at the ensuing decade and the progress that has (or
hasn't) been made, and to speculate on what the future may hold. Barry Maid and
Barbara D'Angelo then articulate how the Framework for IL connects with the
Writing Program Administrator's Outcomes Statement and "Habits of Mind,"
furthering their work to contextualize and rhetoricize IL for WS. Maid and
D'Angelo's explanation of the threshold concepts foundational in the Framework
for IL as portals to knowledge construction deeply connected to WS, reminds us
that our pedagogy and assessment of IL should acknowledge the situated nature
of the concept and the ways it extends beyond the classroom to our students'
professional, personal, and civic lives. Following on this theme, Dale Cyphert
and Stanley Lyle articulate IL within a business context, reminding us that the IL
landscape expands beyond academia and WS and that "the functional role of any
individual within a large, complex organization is neither linear nor independent,
and information is only occasionally objective. . . . Organizational activities are
not simple collections of acts performed by discrete individuals, each carrying an
individual set of skills, but collectively constituted patterns of interaction, affor-
dance, and social interpretation" (Chapter 3, this collection). The recognition of
IL's situated nature within a landscape and contextualized by social, political, and
other factors emphasizes the threshold concept that knowledge is constructed
within discourse communities and that types of authority may differ based on
those communities. As such, they remind us that the conversation related to IL
extends beyond academia to the workplace and other contexts.

    Kathleen Blake Yancey considers the current moment of information literacy
as an ecology by outlining three "periods" in its recent history: (1) the period of
all-vetting-all-the-time where gatekeepers assured the credibility of the sources; (2)
the period of online access of information; and (3) the most recent, ongoing cur-
rent period located in an ecology of interacting sources--academic; mainstream;
and "alternative." Yancey situates this history within the context of source analysis
and the challenge all researchers face when establishing source credibility.

    Irvin Katz and Norbert Elliot round out Section I by articulating the impor-
tance of defining constructs for assessment and using assessment methods that
are capable of evaluating complex concepts such as IL in a way that respects its
contextual and process-oriented nature. Their case study is particularly timely
as the Framework for IL shifts IL away from a skills-based foundation to one
that is grounded in metaliteracy. Their chapter addresses the question of how
we--librarians, faculty, and administrators--adapt and employ assessments
that can effectively evaluate IL within the academy. Katz and Elliot describe
Educational Testing Service's iSkills to demonstrate how assessment within a

                                                                                                    7
Introduction

digital environment can go beyond the mechanized skills-testing of paper bub-
ble tests to a richer and more robust assessment of a construct that is situated,
mediated, and remediated--i.e., that information creation is a process in which
an information need and data collection and analysis are constantly revisited
and revised based on feedback and effectiveness. Katz and Elliot conclude that
IL is a threshold concept that requires holistic instruction, a conclusion that is
consistent with metaliteracy as an overarching literacy serving as the theoretical
underpinning of the Framework for IL.

SECTION II. RESEARCHING INFORMATION LITERACY

Section II focuses on large-scale research projects that are contributing to our
understanding of IL, in particular, our understanding of students' ability to use
information to construct knowledge. The threshold concept of Scholarship as
Conversation is clearly evident in the work of these researchers and scholars.
Sandra Jamieson leads off Section II with a discussion of results of Citation Proj-
ect research concerning the kinds of sources students selected for source-based
papers in first-year writing, how they incorporated them, and the implications
for IL. Following this chapter, Katt Blackwell-Starnes reports on the results of a
pilot study for the LILAC Project revealing the impact of students' focus on final
product rather than process when completing a research project. Karen Gocsik,
Laura Braunstein, and Cynthia Tobery report on the results of a six-year study
to research and code wiki assignments to determine how students analyze and
use sources. Then Patti Wojhan, Theresa Westbrook, Rachel Milloy, Matthew
Moberly, Seth Myers, and Lisa Ramirez describe the results of an analysis of
student research diaries and self-assessments to identify trends in students' use
of information. Maintaining the focus on student perceptions, Donna Scheidt,
William Carpenter, Robert Fitzgerald, Cara Kozma, Holly Middleton, and Kathy
Shields describe a collaboration between composition faculty and librarians to
study students' perceptions of research with an emphasis on source use.

    What all of these authors highlight in their work is the importance of the
threshold concept related to the use of information and entering into a scholarly
conversation, making them timely and, perhaps, leading to strategies that allow
us to adapt practices to help students become information literate.

INFORMATION LITERACY IN SPECIFIC COURSES

IL into the classroom, both in first-year composition and disciplinary subject

courses. The frame Scholarship as Conversation again dominates the themes of
these chapters.

    Miriam Laskin and Cynthia Haller describe their strategy to help students
identify citation trails and the failure of students to identify and work within
source networks. From a multimodal perspective, Christopher Toth and Hazel
McClure challenge us to consider the use of infographics as a tool for IL peda-
gogy and provide an example of IL in a digital environment in which informa-
tion is presented in ways other than text. In a demonstration of the metaliteracy
that underlies the Framework for IL, they show that students are producers of
information through remixing and remediation of information graphically.

    Susan Brown and Janice R. Walker describe yet another collaboration for
instruction exploring IL in pre-service teacher education classes. They raise the
concern that absent a common terminology across disciplines, the focus on IL in
both K-12 and higher education is fragmented. Brown and Walker call for "scaf-
folded, cross-disciplinary, teacher-librarian collaborative interventions" (Chapter
13, this collection) to facilitate shared language and ownership of IL. As such,
like so many other authors in this collection, they point to the shared responsi-
bility for IL and for the importance of dialogue.

    Rachel Winslow, Sarah Skripsky, and Savannah Kelly describe a collabora-
tion between a librarian and teaching faculty in WS and social science to incor-
porate the citation manager Zotero to help students learn to use sources. Finally,
Diego Méndez-Carbajo raises another issue regarding discipline specificity, not-
ing that the relationship between IL and quantitative reasoning is one that has
not been fully explored previously. He provides an effective example of how IL
can be integrated into an intermediate level economics course with the use of
quantitative case studies. His model is based on how the Framework for IL frame
Research as Inquiry relates to the economics course as students learn to collect,
manipulate, and analyze quantitative information in order to contextualize and
apply it.

SECTION IV. COLLABORATING TO ADVANCE
PROGRAMMATIC INFORMATION LITERACY

Chapters in Section IV highlight collaborative efforts to develop IL on a pro-
grammatic level. Authors in this section describe the partnerships involved in
creating and evolving shared ownership of IL within their institutions. In light
of the Framework for IL, the challenge of encouraging broad-based ownership
of IL beyond librarians and individual librarian-faculty partnerships is a timely
one, and these chapters give us interesting models that are potentially replicable
at other institutions.

                                                                                                    9
Introduction

    Lori Baker and Pam Gladis describe a programmatic effort to institution-
alize IL at their small liberal arts college. In particular, they discuss a key issue
associated with IL instruction--that of ownership and the required shift of per-
spective required when the agency of IL becomes institutional. From a different
perspective again, Angela Feekery, Lisa Emerson, and Gillian Skyrme explore
issues related to the integration and scaffolding of IL throughout a degree pro-
gram in New Zealand. The results of their action research revealed the shifting
perspectives of faculty related to the responsibility for IL within the curriculum
as they were introduced to holistic views of the concept. Feekery et al. show us
the power of collaboration and conversation to advance IL practices.

    Alison Gregory and Betty McCall describe collaborative work to integrate
IL vertically into the curriculum at their institution, discussing their recognition
that developing IL skills are progressive and the process cannot be taught in
one-shot sessions or in one course. Their results also point to the value of collab-
oration when faculty are pro-active in viewing their role in the development of
IL. Beth Bensen, Denise Woetzel, Hong Wu, and Ghazala Hashmi describe the
impetus for the Quality Enhancement Plan at their institution and the first step
in its implementation in the second semester first-year writing course as part of
a planned vertical implementation of IL.

    Francia Kissel, Melvin Wininger, Scott Weeden, Patricia Wittberg, Randall
Halverson, Meagan Lacy, and Rhonda Huisman round out the collection by
presenting a model for faculty-librarian-administrator collaboration related to
IL through the establishment of a community of practice, a volunteer work
group to develop pedagogical strategies for teaching in courses with research
assignments. Kissel et al., then, brings our collection full circle. The community
of practice they describe embodies the notion of shared responsibility for IL and
for the importance and power of collaboration and dialogue to engage us in
advancing IL teaching and learning.

WHITHER IL?

As we reflect on the tremendous amount of research, pedagogical planning,
teaching and learning that has enveloped IL since the IL Standards were ini-
tially adopted, we are impressed with the inroads and advancements that have
been made in a short period of time. Yet, we also recognize how much work
there is still to be done as Norgaard and Simkinson have so aptly described in
their reflective conversation to open this collection. As we finish our work on
this collection, the Framework for IL has been approved, discussion surround-
ing it continue at conferences and in webinars, and plans for implementation
and development of related resources to facilitate adoption are underway. The

Framework for IL serves not just as a vehicle for evolving our conception of IL
and how we help students to become information literate, it serves as a potential
vehicle for sharing ownership of the responsibility for IL. Recalling our presid-
ing deity Janus, we believe this collection, as part of the ongoing conversation
on IL, serves to help us--librarians, faculty, administrators, external collabo-
rators--to meet the challenge by looking back and learning from the past and
looking forward to envision the future.

SITUATING INFORMATION LITERACY
CHAPTER 1

WRITING INFORMATION
LITERACY: A RETROSPECTIVE
AND A LOOK AHEAD

      Rolf Norgaard and Caroline Sinkinson
      University of Colorado at Boulder

Roughly a decade ago, two paired articles published in Reference and User Services
Quarterly under the title "Writing Information Literacy" voiced what became a
rather widespread call for more broadly shared ownership of and responsibility
for information literacy (IL) on our college campuses (Norgaard, 2003; Nor-
gaard, 2004). In these articles, Rolf Norgaard claimed that enhanced collabo-
ration between librarians and writing faculty would yield improved educational
opportunities for students. By pairing Rhetoric and Writing Studies with IL,
Norgaard argued that a more robust understanding of IL as a situated, pro-
cess-oriented, and relevant literacy would ensue. More specifically, he encour-
aged a collaboration that extended beyond librarian service to the discipline and
course structures. He envisioned a collaboration that was steeped in dialogue on
both theory and practice, going far beyond our more traditional roles as "class-
room colleagues" or "curricular compatriots" (Norgaard, 2003, p. 124).

    The call voiced in those paired articles, although appreciatively recognized,
has not been fully realized. Therefore, in the spirit of collaboration, this chap-
ter engages Rhetoric and Writing Studies scholar Norgaard (RN) and librarian
Caroline Sinkinson (CS) in a dialogue that explores reactions and outcomes in
the intervening decade. In doing so, the authors hope to identify barriers which
hindered progress and to identify suggestions for the decade which lies ahead.

ORIGINS

CS: Your articles resonate with many librarians who are eager to break down
the perception of IL as a generic, skills-based, and normative behavior. Instead,
many view IL as a critical habit of mind, which functions within situated and
contextual information landscapes (Lloyd, 2006, p. 572). I return often to your
articles, and each time I reread your words, I am curious about what factors
invited you, a Rhetoric and Writing Studies scholar, to so deeply engage with IL.

    RN: The paired articles were the direct result of a very powerful moment of
radical institutional change. Rather high-level, campus-wide discussions led to
the formation of a new Program for Writing and Rhetoric. With the new pro-
gram we engaged in a fundamental reconceptualization of our suite of first-year
writing courses, which provided the initial platform for working with IL. These
efforts have since expanded to our upper-division curriculum. The prior writing
program had no investment in IL. Indeed, I doubt if its leaders and much of its
faculty would even have recognized the term.

    The opportunity to fashion a new program and a new curriculum made it
possible to integrate IL into our pedagogy and our program mission, instead of
treating it, as it most often is, as a supplement, an add-on. We were fortunate at
the time to have forward-looking IL advocates, at the highest levels of campus
discussions. Additionally, we had dedicated librarians to shepherd our IL efforts
during the early stages of program building. So, when I speak of partnerships
in these two articles, the call for reconceptualizing and broadly sharing IL is not
merely abstract or theoretical. It is grounded in an institutional landscape and in
deeply rewarding personal and intellectual friendships. But it goes well beyond
those particularities to advance a vision of IL that has been widely appreciated,
if not always implemented.

    CS: Well, your articles have influenced many librarians, both pedagogically
and conceptually. Your work helped librarians frame IL rhetorically, to justify
enhanced collaborations with writing colleagues, and to build or revise pro-
grams, which is evidenced by the several examples in the literature (Jacobs &
Jacobs, 2009; O'Connor et al., 2010; Holliday & Fagerheim, 2006; Gruber et
al., 2008; Artman, 2010; Davidson & Crateau, 1998). In addition to practical
applications, your work has had significant influence on IL theorists, specifi-
cally in the discussions surrounding critical IL (Elmborg, 2006; Elmborg, 2012;
Jacobs, 2008; Accardi et al., 2010).

    RN: As truly gratifying as that reception has been, it is unfortunate that the
two articles failed to elicit a similarly robust discussion in my own field, Rhetoric
and Writing Studies. Important work is being done; Rebecca More Howard and
the Citation Project come to mind (Howard et al., 2010; Jamieson & Howard,
2013). Nevertheless, we have a ways to go to foster the disciplinary dialogue and
disciplinary cross-fertilization that I envision in the two articles.

    With a decade of hindsight, I now realize that I should have written not two
but three articles. The first article focused on how Rhetoric and Writing Studies
can contribute to the conceptualization of IL (Norgaard, 2003). The second
focused on pedagogical enactments of that concept in the classroom (Norgaard,
2004). That missing third article should have focused on the institutional iden-
tities and roles whose transformations are likewise necessary if we are to make

progress in IL, both conceptually and pedagogically. I am imagining an article
that maps strategies and methods for institutionalizing IL, and as Sharon Weiner
(2012) has argued, these strategies must acknowledge specific institutional con-
texts and cultures in order to meet success.

INSTITUTIONAL IDENTITIES AND DISCIPLINARY ROLES

RN: Both of our faculties--in Writing and Rhetoric and in University Librar-
ies--have historically been marginalized groups whose identities, roles, and
"place" have been defined more by others than by ourselves. We are in some
sense natural allies. But as each faculty seeks to overcome its historical burden
in distinctive ways, address new institutional challenges, and realize disciplinary
aspirations, our roles and identities may in part conspire against the dialogue
and partnership we seek, and the more robust understandings of IL that we wish
to enact.

LIBRARIANS IN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE

CS: At the very least, traditional roles compound our challenges. If asked, stu-
dents might describe the library as a location for study or as a resource for access-
ing course materials; fa culty might describe the library as a service in support of
their research, scholarship and teaching. These descriptions reinforce the perva-
sive image of the traditional campus library as a storehouse of resources offered
up to support and serve. However, the iconic library image obscures the work of
librarians, specifically the work of teaching librarians. To an individual walking
through the stacks or even posing a question at the research desk, that work is
not visible or apparent. Libraries have historically been rooted in concepts of
information, knowledge, and learning, but the librarian as an active educator
invested in pedagogy and praxis has not fully matured. We continue to confront
perceptions of the librarian role that undermine IL, both internally in the pro-
fession and externally with campus colleagues.

    Internally, as Courtney Bruch and Carroll Wilkinson (2012) observe, ten-
sions may exist between librarians who embrace a teaching identity and those
who resist it (p. 14). This tension is increased when library structures and admin-
istration do not demonstrate a commitment to a culture of teaching. It is not
uncommon for institutions to employ one individual, an instruction coordina-
tor, primarily responsible for instruction programming and coordination. Bruch
and Wilkinson (2012) point out that these positions often lack the authority
and management oversight necessary to impact change (p. 21). Furthermore,
for other library positions, teaching is a peripheral responsibility, if one at all,

                                                                                                  17
Norgaard and Sinkinson

and must compete with other more traditional library tasks such as reference,
collections or cataloging. Structures across library organizations and institutions
vary widely, but these observations highlight an ongoing tension surrounding
librarians' identity as teachers and educators. Equally, the emphasis placed on
teaching roles within Masters of Library and Information Science curricula
varies drastically across institutions. For example the University of Missouri,
Columbia School of Information Science and Learning Technologies offers a
robust slate of courses on instructional design, assessment and pedagogy which
clearly demonstrate an expectation of librarian as educator. Yet, several other
programs offer only one or two course options related to IL theory and prac-
tice (ACRL Instruction Section, Professional Development Committee, 2013).
These variations underscore an unequal approach to the librarian's teaching role
within the profession at large.

    Despite these barriers, some individual instruction librarians have embraced
a teaching identity and have developed as experts in the scholarship of teaching
and learning.

    RN: And as this expertise grows, our institutions and our students stand to
lose if we don't tap into and highlight that expertise. Librarians occupy a unique
and distinctly valuable position in the university. Your active integration of sev-
eral domains--knowledge construction, new media, information networks, and
information technologies--places you at the center of the educational enter-
prise, not at its periphery. Disciplinary faculty members across campuses are
slow to recognize this expertise.

    CS: Indeed. Even as librarians work to advocate for internal support of our
teaching role, we also must work to showcase our value as pedagogical partners to
disciplinary teaching faculty. A frequent narrative in the literature is that faculty
members do not understand the librarian's teaching role or are unaware of our
pedagogical knowledge (Elmborg, 2003, p. 77; Derakhshan & Singh, 2011, p.
227; Phelps & Campbell, 2012, p.16). However, as librarians, we need to con-
sider how our actions reinforce perceptions of the librarian simply as a service
provider. For example, more often than not, librarians adjust teaching strategies
to faculty-outlined objectives and goals, which are typically bound up in research
assignments. Yvonne Meulemans and Allison Carr (2013) suggest that if librar-
ies truly value collaboration, they must become more brazen in their approach
with faculty. If librarians disagree with an assignment design, or wholeheartedly
find fault with a stand-alone tour, they should converse with faculty about those
opinions and their beliefs as educators (Meulemans & Carr, 2013, p. 82). This
approach might be very fruitful if, as Laura Saunders (2012) found, the lack of
faculty-initiated collaboration is not a result of disrespect but rather a lack of
awareness about how librarians can help in teaching and learning (p. 232).

WRITING TEACHERS IN INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE

RN: If librarians struggle to make their role as educators visible and appreci-
ated, writing teachers suffer from a role definition that is different but equally
problematic. Our role as teacher and educator is a given, but what we are
expected to teach, and who is seen as qualified to teach, have been shaped by
disciplinary, campus, and public expectations. Rhetoric and Writing Studies
differs from any other discipline in that our field has historically been tied to
but one course: first-year writing or freshman English. This traditional curric-
ular moment, occurring in the first year, tends to privilege a narrow perspec-
tive on IL, emphasizing preparation for general academic work in college but
neglecting broader civic and workplace contexts for IL. Moreover, the focus
on the first-year composition course tends to promote a skills-oriented "inoc-
ulation" approach to IL, and tends to obscure how IL ought to be seen as a
rich, multifaceted literacy that is responsive to changing contexts and oppor-
tunities. Writing across the Curriculum (WAC) programs and Writing in the
Disciplines (WID) initiatives do offer a far more expansive set of contexts for
IL. But here too, writing faculty are often seen as merely providing a service to
various disciplines, and are relegated to secondary status with respect to their
expertise and their pedagogical roles. As Rhetoric and Writing Studies expands
its curricular offerings, it can embrace a more capacious understanding of IL,
for example by developing a more vertical curriculum that engages writing and
IL at various points and for various purposes throughout the undergraduate
experience (Gregory & McCall, Chapter 18, this collection). At our institu-
tion, we are fortunate to have a robust upper-division curriculum, and as a
free-standing program not located, as most are, within an English department,
we may have greater latitude to seize new opportunities for teaching IL. The
growing number of Writing Studies majors, as well as certificate programs,
provides fertile ground for greater integration of IL throughout the writing
curriculum. Likewise, the growing number of free-standing writing programs
provides an opportunity to reach beyond the orbit of English departments to
reach whole campuses.

    CS: I can easily understand how this historical emphasis on first-year writing
tends to place a lot of expectations on that single course. My sense is that writ-
ing teachers often feel overwhelmed by the many goals and objectives they are
expected to meet, and that IL adds but one more item to an already full plate.

    RN: Yes, feeling overwhelmed comes with the territory. First-year writing is
one of the very few courses that nearly all students take on campus, and campus
administrators often look to the course as a platform for a variety of campus
initiatives.

                                                                                                  19
Norgaard and Sinkinson

    With these external pressures, writing instructors continue to deal with mis-
understandings of our role on campus. For a surprisingly large number of faculty
members, we are still the grammar police whose purview extends little further
than correct style, organization, and, yes, citations. Writing is still all too often
seen as the transcription of finished thought rather than central to the genera-
tion of insight. What matters to all too many disciplinary faculty are that the
citations are in correct shape, not that the process of acquiring and evaluating
information has given students insight into the discursive and cognitive features
of a discipline. Ten years ago, in the first of the two paired articles, I noted how
the still widely entrenched "current-traditional" paradigm of writing instruction
limits our ability to enact a more robust approach to IL. That very same para-
digm also limits our institutional roles and identities.

    As to internal pressures, one of the greatest ongoing concerns is staffing. Our
field is all too reliant on contingent labor--part-time lecturers and graduate stu-
dents for whom writing instruction and IL may not be central to their long-term
career interests. This reliance on contingent faculty has only gotten worse in the
last ten years, especially with the Great Recession, and has become the subject
of explicit concern and national discussion. Turn-over in personnel is constant,
and puts pressure on effective training, professional development, and quality
control and assessment. At large state universities, the sections of first-year writ-
ing offered during any one semester can easily reach well over 100 (Bousquet,
2008; Bousquet, Scott & Parascondola, 2004; Palmquist & Doe, 2011; Schell
& Stock, 2001). Last minute accommodations to enrollment demand can easily
lead to the impression that virtually anyone can teach writing. No matter how
well conceived, an IL initiative in a writing program can only succeed if it has
buy-in and intellectual engagement from people in the trenches, not just the
writing program administrator, several tenure-track faculty, and a handful of
full-time instructors.

    As a discipline, Rhetoric and Writing Studies has continued to mature over
these last ten years, with more graduate programs, and more undergraduate
majors and certificate programs. The very limitations to our institutional roles
that I note above are gradually being addressed on campuses that have active
writing centers, and robust WAC and WID programs. But the higher disci-
plinary profile that Rhetoric and Writing Studies has achieved can also limit
intellectual partnerships. However gregarious we might be by nature, an interest
in establishing disciplinary authority adds just one further disincentive to insti-
tutional and disciplinary partnerships. Incentives and reward structures tend to
recognize work done on one's own home turf. Librarians and writing faculty are
natural partners, but historically determined identities and campus roles can
conspire against that partnership.

MOVING FORWARD ON CAMPUS

CS: Despite the barriers that we have discussed, librarians and writing teachers
across the country are engaged in successful partnerships. For some, the collabo-
rations are the outcome of campus level change. For example, at Purdue Univer-
sity there was a "perfect storm" of campus curricular initiatives, library-invested
initiatives, and local experts engaged in IL which resulted in a broad campus
initiative as well as an endowed chair of IL (Seamans, 2012, p. 228; "W. Wayne
Booker Chair," 2014). On our own campus, a similar "perfect storm" enabling
new approaches to IL accompanied the formation of a new Program for Writing
and Rhetoric.

    However, other local or individual IL partnerships shared in the literature
describe a different story. A solitary librarian is driven by intrinsic motivations
to actively extend IL education. She may identify an amenable faculty mem-
ber with whom she shares her ideas for collaboration in the classroom. Often,
these efforts may end successfully and work as exemplars for other librarians and
faculty. For example, Heidi Jacobs and Dale Jacobs (2009) describe a partner-
ship that grew organically from a casual conversation but resulted in significant
curricular and programmatic change to IL integration in English Composition
courses. In this example, had the process begun with a goal to impact full pro-
grammatic change, the authors admit that the magnitude, and one may assume
the associated time commitment, may have halted their efforts (p. 79). For that
reason, the authors argue for initiatives led by individuals and stakeholders who
pursue manageable commitments and responsibilities in unison with existing
workloads.

    RN: But as effective as "stealth innovation" can be (and I'm a fan of working
undercover until the right institutional moment emerges), this approach can
have its downsides. Unless IL initiatives become part of core identities and core
budgets, they easily get pushed to the side. The impact of accreditation agencies
on an institution's commitment to IL can have significant impact on local buy-in.
For example, in 2002 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools required
"Quality Enhancement Plans" from its member institutions (SACS, 2012). Col-
leges and schools were asked to create proposals that broadly improved student
learning. As a result, 18 institutions focused the plan on IL while at least 100
institutions included IL to some degree (Harris, 2013, p. 175). Similarly, organi-
zations and IL leaders are encouraging librarians to actively participate on local
national assessment and curriculum reform committees in order to explicitly
include IL in student learning outcomes (GWLA, 2013; Iannuzzi, 2013). Plac-
ing IL at the core of a writing program's mission helps to create a more cohesive
sense of IL and helps guard against this notion that it is a peripheral add-on.

                                                                                                  21
Norgaard and Sinkinson

Also, it is worth noting that we have endured a modest budget crisis in 2003 and
the Great Recession starting in 2008. Fiscal crises tend to have administrators
circle the wagons to protect core responsibilities and identities.

    CS: Moreover, Barbara D'Angelo and Barry Maid (2004) caution that when
change is led by individuals, it is typically the individual who "absorbs the
increased workload and time commitment without institutional change or sup-
port" (p. 212). Similarly, Barbara Fister (1995) warns that these programs will
dismantle when collaborators withdraw due to burnout, career advancement
or general turnover. Or alternatively, the programs will be handed off to junior
colleagues who may view the project as superfluous to their core functions (p.
34). While it is clear that energetic individuals are essential to sparking improve-
ments to IL teaching and learning, like you, I agree that garnering institutional
support is essential.

    RN: I believe the trick is to find the institutional "sweet spot": high enough
on the institutional food chain to garner real support, visibility, continuity, and
investment, but also low enough so that on-the-ground expertise is not neglected
and can be leveraged effectively through personal relationships.

    CS: Assuming we can find that "sweet spot," Fister (1995) suggests a few
central characteristics and conditions for collaboration. The first is a "need to
trust one another and have a sense of shared ownership" (p. 47). In order to
reach that trust, writing instructors need to understand the evolution of librar-
ians as educators. Similarly, it will be helpful for librarians to appreciate the
demands and expectations placed on the writing teachers. Second, Fister rec-
ommends that goals be set together by librarians and writing instructors, which
will inevitably encourage a sense of shared ownership and understanding. Third,
Fister encourages the sharing of "insights both practical and theoretical" (p. 16).

ADVANCING CONCEPTUAL DISCUSSIONS

RN: As we continue our discussion here, the need looms large for more clearly
articulated shared goals and understandings between librarians and writing
instructors. Only by sharing conceptual discussions can we improve student
learning.

LACK OF SHARED LITERATURE

CS: Alas, that shared conceptual discussion has not developed as we hoped.
In your first article, you recognize that few IL-related articles have successfully
invoked theoretical foundations or pedagogical frameworks from Rhetoric and

just that, with the intention of theorizing IL to a greater degree. (Here I'm think-
ing of the work of Jacobs (2008), Veach (2012), Elmborg (2012), and Fister
(1993, 1995), to name a few.) However, while both writing instructors and
librarians have pursued investigations into IL, they have failed to directly speak
to one another through this work.

    RN: Quite true. The literature produced by both fields has largely remained
siloed and directed to an audience of peers within their home disciplines, rather
than reaching beyond these boundaries. The politics of publication and the
reward systems of, and criteria for, tenure may play a role in this.

    CS: That seems like a solid assumption, and represents a problem not unique
to Rhetoric and Writing Studies faculty. According to Sue Phelps and Nicole
Campbell (2012), the models of successful librarian-faculty partnerships for IL
are mainly written by librarians (72%) and appear in library journals (82%) (p.
15).

    RN: My own paired articles from ten years ago share in that dynamic:
although writing as a rhetorician and writing teacher, those articles appeared
in a library journal that goes largely unread by my colleagues in Rhetoric and
Writing Studies. The library community has warmly received this "interloper"; I
just wish that such work would no longer be seen as interloping!

    CS: These findings might be interpreted to mean that collaborative partner-
ships are of a higher priority to librarians, or perhaps, they may simply indicate
a lack of awareness from writing instructors, or the lack of shared language and
understanding between fields. Regardless, we can safely conclude that formal
written collaborations have not yet crossed disciplinary boundaries to the extent
you encourage. However, conference presentations and papers offer evidence
that cross-disciplinary conversations are taking place in less formal settings. For
example, papers from the Georgia International Conference on Information Lit-
eracy (2013) include works co-authored by librarians and writing teachers as
well as presentations that indicate a desire for increased collaborations (Dew et
al., 2013; McClure & Toth, 2013; Carter & Schmidt, 2013; Gola & Creelman,
2013). Similarly, the 2013 Conference on College Composition and Commu-
nication included at least three sessions that integrated IL into composition and
curriculum discussions (CCCC, 2013). This evidence reveals that collaborations
continue to grow between cross-disciplinary colleagues, yet, perhaps still not to
the degree that you suggest.

LACK OF SHARED DEFINITION

RN: A prerequisite for that discussion, but also a valuable outcome, is a shared
definition of IL. Definitions--acts of naming--are not trivial, and carry with

                                                                                                  23
Norgaard and Sinkinson

them political and disciplinary dimensions (Scheidt et al., Chapter 10, this col-
lection; Kissel et al., Chapter 20, this collection).

    CS: Clarifying a definition of IL has indeed been an area of debate and con-
versation in librarianship (Owusu-Ansah, 2005). There are numerous standards
and definitions devised by international, national, regional, and state organiza-
tions (International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA), Australian and
New Zealand Information Literacy (ANZIL), Society of College, National and
University Libraries (SCONUL), Association of College and Research Libraries
(ACRL), Middle States Commission). Scholars and practitioners, on a global
scale, have devoted considerable energy without reaching a uniformly accepted
definition or understanding of IL. A reader of the complementary and compet-
ing definitions will quickly understand that IL is a complex concept interwoven
with myriad other literacies.

    RN: In a similar vein, Rhetoric and Writing Studies was plagued by disparate
understandings of what the outcomes of first-year composition should be. After
broad consultation, the national Council of Writing Program Administrators
adopted in April 2000 the "WPA Outcomes Statement for First-Year Composi-
tion" (2000). This statement has had an amazing galvanizing influence on cur-
ricular design in writing programs across the country. It omits the term IL, and
yet the original document, and the several revisions that have followed it, remain
quite amenable to the concept.

    CS: While it is unfortunate that the WPA Outcomes Statement and the Infor-
mation Competency Standards for Higher Education (ACRL, 2000) were written in
isolation, writing instructors and librarians have taken it upon themselves to mesh
these two documents while pursuing local initiatives (McClure, 2009; Jacobs &
Jacobs, 2009; Gruber et al., 2008; D'Angelo & Maid, 2004). The documents pro-
vide a strong means for one to enter discussion in the other's community, because
the precepts and beliefs had already been endorsed by the broad professional com-
munity. While many faculty members may not be familiar with the term "infor-
mation literacy," when the concept is defined they easily comprehend the value
and importance. Furthermore, Laura Saunders (2012) surveyed faculty from 50
colleges and universities and found that a faculty member's awareness of standards
or defining documents increased her enthusiasm for integrating IL (p. 232).

    RN: A more recent foundational document in the Rhetoric and Writing
Studies community, the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing, pub-
lished by the Council of Writing Program Administrators, the National Council
of Teachers of English, and the National Writing Project (2011), holds much
promise for collaboration. Although this document, too, fails to highlight IL
as I would like, it does a great service by highlighting "habits of mind" that
underpin success, among them the need for metacognition. Such habits of mind

24
                                                                              Writing Information Literacy

are necessary complements to the more instrumental definitions that have dom-
inated IL discussion thus far.

    CS: Indeed, such "habits of mind" are similar to elements found in the Amer-
ican Association of School Libraries Standards for the 21st Century Learner
(2007). So we can clearly identify overlap between professional documents
authored by writing teachers and those written by librarians.

    RN: Perhaps it is not enough to recognize the similarities in our reform
impulses; we need to advocate strongly for our associations and national
groups to join in intellectual partnership through shared documents (Maid &
D' Angelo, Chapter 2, this collection).

    CS: Yes, I think that would prove very fruitful and could add depth to our
existing guiding documents. While the IL Standards have been invaluable in
developing momentum for IL initiatives, the standards are problematic due to
their decontextualized and linear structure. The document's performance indi-
cators suggest that an individual's IL might be measured against precise action,
regardless of circumstance or context; one may be judged to have or not have IL
based on measured performance. Furthermore, the IL Standards fail to clearly
articulate that information is bound in conversations between ourselves and oth-
ers and between varied contexts or situations. Information is not represented as
a "product of socially negotiated epistemological processes and the raw material
for further making of new knowledge" (Elmborg, 2006, p. 198). Rather, it is pre-
sented as a static entity, which learners may acquire and evaluate based on cod-
ified and imposed criteria. In 2011, the ACRL, having noted the shortcomings
of the IL Standards, took initial steps to consider a revised document. Beginning
March 2013, a taskforce, whose membership included an array of stakeholders,
not only librarians, worked to develop the Framework for Information Literacy
for Higher Education (ACRL, 2015), which approaches IL through conceptual
understandings rather than standards. In the Framework for IL, IL is defined as
"a spectrum of abilities, practices, and habits of mind that extends and deepens
learning through engagement with the information ecosystem" (ACRL, 2015).

    Because the Framework for IL resists defining IL through a "prescriptive enu-
meration of skills," it may strengthen your argument against misconceptions of
IL as a neutral, on/off skill (ACRL, 2015). Perhaps, the Framework for IL will
encourage advocacy for a situated literacy as you have done.

    RN: The academy, however, situates IL in narrow ways. And the historical
connection, indeed identification, between Rhetoric and Writing Studies and
but one first-year course further limits how we might situate IL in innovative
and genuinely useful ways. To broaden our approach, we might tap into WAC
and WID programs and writing center activities, which offer more expansive
and differentiated venues for discussing IL.

                                                                                                  25
Norgaard and Sinkinson

    CS: You also call for a process-oriented approach to IL rather than a product-­
focused approach. The IL Standards present IL as neatly packaged skills which
result in a successful product, performance, or presentation. Yet, lived informa-
tion experiences are far more complex, problematic, and entwined with one's
own identity, beliefs, and experiences. Instead of an intellectual process in which
the learner is an active agent, as written in the IL Standards, IL positions the
learner as passive recipient. A brief nod to an individual's past experiences and
beliefs is given in standard three: the information literate individual "determines
whether the new knowledge has an impact on the individual's value system
and takes steps to reconcile differences" (ACRL, 2000). The Framework for IL
improves that shortcoming by recognizing that "students have a greater role in
creating new knowledge" (ACRL, 2015). Still, a process-centered IL needs to
place great attention on the learner's construction of knowledge, whether in past
information experiences, current experiences, or through reflection on experi-
ences (See Yancey, Chapter 4, this collection).

    RN: As you suggest, the myth of the student as "blank slate" pervades higher
education, and is related to our focus on purveying information, the domain
content of a field, and not on cultivating rhetorical and cognitive aptitudes and
strategies. Our traditional approaches to IL have much in common with the
"banking concept of education" that Paolo Freire (1970) so roundly criticized.
We have much to gain by leveraging students' varied IL activities, and by better
understanding how they might misinterpret contexts and misuse tools. Appre-
ciating how people construct their world through information is where we need
to begin, not end.

    CS: The third dimension of your interest in rhetoricizing IL is the need for a
relevant literacy--that is, relevant to a "broad range of social, political, and intel-
lectual endeavors," and appreciative of the dynamic early moments of invention
when we launch inquiry and formulate problems (Norgaard, 2003, p. 128).

    RN: It is not surprising given the intended audience of the IL Standards--
higher education--that they have been used within one particular context and
have become representative of one information landscape alone, namely aca-
demic. To be genuinely useful, our conception of IL needs to be attentive to
what we might call "information ecologies," in all their varied forms. Higher
education, broadly speaking, is becoming more aware of the need for a new
culture of learning that has similar ecological impulses. All of this underscores
the exigence of extending our understandings of IL, and the relevance of the
Framework for IL, as it defines IL as situated and contextualized.

    CS: Indeed. Much of the practice surrounding IL in higher education has
privileged textual and codified norms of information such as the peer reviewed
article and academic research databases. And very little attention is paid to the

26
                                                                              Writing Information Literacy

social, economic, political, and cultural influences on the creation, dissemina-
tion, and the use of information (Luke & Kapitzke, 1999, p. 11).

    An essential aspect of IL is a critical stance towards information systems
(Elmborg, 2006, p. 196). In other words, learners would scrutinize information
systems, in any mode, understand the systems' norms (what counts as knowl-
edge), and identify the voices included or excluded (Luke & Kapitzke, 1999, p.
484; Simmons 2005, p. 301). Students are not provided the opportunity to do
so when academic values are imposed without question, and students are told to
use peer-reviewed articles and to limit searching to academic databases.

    Accepting one frame or focusing on one information landscape is not only a
misrepresentation; it may alienate students and deter the transfer of critical dis-
positions to other contexts. As students enter alternate information landscapes,
they will need to examine the unique contextual information and learning tools
therein and to acclimate to the specific "skills, practices and affordances" required
(Lloyd, 2006, p. 572). In order to offer a more holistic and authentic view, IL
education should expand across domains as well as to new information modes
and formats. As educators, if we hold our focus to textual information only, we
ignore the "mediascapes and infospheres" in which students live presently, not
to mention the new modes they will encounter in the future (Luke & Kapitzke,
1999, p. 469).

    RN: As you mentioned, ACRL has filed the Framework for IL. What prom-
ise does this revision hold for fostering the kind of collaboration I called for a
decade ago?

    CS: The current draft revision strongly encourages librarians to introduce
the document at home institutions in order to identify "synergies" with other
educational initiatives (ACRL, 2015) The task force chairs recognize that the
IL Standards limited conversation between librarians and course instructors
because of their skills-based approach (Jacobson & Gibson, 2013). The new
model abandons the "standards-like inventory" in favor of identifying core
dispositions that may be cultivated in varied information contexts, including
workplace and lifelong learning (Jacobson & Gibson, 2013). The goal is to be
more flexible and responsive given the current environment and the speed with
which the information ecologies change. Additionally, the intended audience is
all educators, not only librarians, as evidenced by sections dedicated to faculty
and administrators, "For Faculty: How to Use the Framework" and "For Admin-
istrators: How to Support the Framework" (ACRL, 2015). According to the task
force chairs, the new document provides "a conceptual approach for collabora-
tion, pedagogical innovation, curriculum planning, and a weaving together of
literacies that is critical for today's Information Literacy" (Jacobsen & Gibson,
2013). Given these guiding principles, the revised Framework for IL has the

                                                                                                  27

potential to foster conversations between course instructors and librarians (Maid
& D'Angelo, Chapter 2, this collection).

REFINING PRACTICE AND PEDAGOGY

RN: New national standards are most welcome. Indeed, the Framework for IL is
especially promising in that it resonates with the "habits of mind" stressed in the
2011 Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing developed by the Council
of Writing Program Administrators (2011). Yet there remains the issue of what
is often the yawning gap between concept and implementation, theory, and the
practical demands of the classroom. Many inherited and now ossified norms
compete with the more holistic and dynamic view of IL and writing to which we
have been pointing. Ten years ago I felt the need to complement my first article
on "Contributions to a Concept" with a second on "Pedagogical Enactments
and Implications." Today, that need to connect concepts with classrooms is as
pressing as ever.

    CS: And it is pressing because of the disconnect that we see. The process
we dearly hope students experience is one in which information seeking, read-
ing, and writing are recursive and intertwined. Through these experiences,
students would begin to build their own meaning, their own knowledge, and
contribute their own voices into a wider conversation. Yet, in failing to deeply
engage in reciprocal relationships, writing teachers and librarians present a frag-
mented process to students in which writing and information may appear vastly
disconnected.

    RN: One culprit in this disconnect is the sedimentation of classroom prac-
tice. We tend to recycle our pedagogy--handouts are photocopied yet again,
and while files may now be posted electronically, with all the speed and freshness
that such technology implies, those files (and the classroom approaches that
inform them) may themselves be years old.

    CS: The research paper, another inherited practice, has significant influence
on the ways in which librarians and writing teachers collaborate. The common
one-shot library seminar is often designed to directly support students' comple-
tion of the research paper (Blackwell-Starnes, Chapter 7, this collection).

    RN: I would have hoped that the old ghost of the research paper would have
by now faded away, for it has been under such intense criticism in Rhetoric and
Writing Studies. Yet the old ghost continues to haunt us, and with it outmoded
notions of IL.

    CS: The same sentiments have been echoed in librarianship as well, perhaps
most compellingly by Fister (2013). She spoke at the 2013 LOEX conference,
making several "outrageous claims," one of which was to abandon the research

28
                                                                              Writing Information Literacy

paper in first-year experiences. Fister identifies many ways that the research
paper is not suited to first-year students, because they are novices to academic
communication norms and because the assignment de-emphasizes research as
an intellectual and knowledge-building act. When we couple the research paper
with one shot library seminars, where the focus is information retrieval, it is no
wonder that students fail to comprehend sources as rhetorical acts or to see their
own information interactions as rhetorical choices (Fister, 2013).

    RN: If the ghost of the traditional research paper endures, what I saw ten
years ago as the new specter of plagiarism has grown even larger. Of course, we
wish to instill a sense of academic values in our students, and with it the ethical
obligation and practical ability to document sources according to codified rules
of citation. Yet this goal has privileged procedure in much the same way as has
information gathering. Students are fearful of breaking the rules to the point
that they cut and paste citations into a paper without comprehending the prag-
matics inherent in these academic practices. There is ample evidence provided
by the Stanford Writing Project, the Citation Project, and Project Information
Literacy that students do struggle with understanding citation and plagiarism
fully (Lunsford, 2008, Jamieson et al., n.d.; Project Information Literacy, n.d.).
Students patchwrite rather than summarize sources, and quote sentences with
little awareness of their rhetorical role in the original sources (Jamieson & How-
ard, 2013). Students are taught about plagiarism with fear tactics, threatening
punishment for infringement. Students hear this warning. They do not hear
that citation is a means to support claims, track scholarly discourse, and create
allegiances with other writers. If students obsess with "covering their behinds" so
as not to get caught by Turnitin.com, they will not appreciate how real authors
use citations and why (Jamieson, Chapter 6, this collection).

    CS: And the most pernicious aspect of this narrow focus on plagiarism is
the way it disenfranchises student writers. Students construct citations because
"knowledge belongs to other people," so they must follow the rules (Fister,
2013). When writing and IL become divorced from knowledge making, we've
lost far more than the battle against plagiarism.

    RN: Plagiarism-detection software loomed large ten years ago, and is still
with us. What looms large now, ten years later, is the specter of automated
or machine grading of student writing. News reports now happily claim that
this or that software can lighten the burden of teachers as they respond to
student writing--neglecting all the while the crucial distinction between
grading or scoring and responding. As Common Core State Standards sweep
into high school classrooms, so too do heavily marketed software products
that purport to evaluate the writing that is meant to meet those standards.
Although the Rhetoric and Writing Studies community has responded to

                                                                                                  29
Norgaard and Sinkinson

these developments with cogent arguments in both scholarly venues and the
public press, the more specific impact of this new technology on IL has yet
to be fully discussed (Strauss, 2013). Even as we endorse a more nuanced,
context-­sensitive approach to IL, if machines are grading the writing that is
meant to foster and showcase those capacities, our efforts will not be valued,
and may even be undermined.

    CS: And to note but another barrier, a significant failure of the coupling
between the research paper and the one-shot library session is an intense privi-
leging of academic enactments of IL. First, as already noted, this is an environ-
ment foreign to first-year students and one which requires a great deal of accul-
turation in order for students to authentically engage. Second, it ignores the
expertise and experiences that students have in other contexts and through other
information interactions. Third, it does not support students' future needs in
alternate contexts. At the core of IL is discerning what to learn, seeking patterns
across information (people, text, places), generating knowledge, and acting in
the world (Elmborg, 2003, p. 73). If we focus our efforts in IL on academic con-
texts, students may come to view its importance as relevant only in that context,
rather than being transferable and broadly relevant. Take, for example, Project
Information Literacy's "Passage Studies," which found employer dissatisfaction
with recent graduates' IL in the workplace. Employers interviewed in this study
value employees who are agile, collaborative, flexible, nimble, patient, persistent,
and resourceful. However, recent graduates lacked sophisticated habits of ana-
lyzing information across sources, distinguishing important information from
"noise," synthesizing information for problem solving, and finding patterns.
This example captures only one alternate information landscape, the workplace,
but there are many others that students will encounter after graduation in which
a critical disposition towards information will be vital (Cyphert & Lyle, Chapter
3, this collection).

    RN: As important as workplace contexts are, I also worry that our privileging
of the academic context renders students underprepared for civic life and advo-
cacy. Students deserve an approach to IL that will support broad engagement
and collaboration in our communities, not just in classrooms with access to
academic databases.

    CS: Indeed. As we take into account civic, social, and workplace contexts,
our potential strategies should ensure that the multiple actions inherent in IL--
questioning, seeking, reading, thinking, and writing--are not presented as sepa-
rate. These are in fact "non-consecutive acts," which are not neatly delimited or
linear (Fister, 1993, para. 19). To support students through these messy activ-
ities, collaborations may help to scaffold and to slow down students' inquiry,
allowing for time to reflect, pause, reverse or proceed. These are habits and

30
                                                                              Writing Information Literacy

functions much more authentic to self-motivated acts of inquiry transferable
across contexts and information landscapes.

    All of this leads us back to your initial claim, some ten years ago, that we
form intellectual partnerships.

    RN: Yes, the metaphor--and real act--of conversation is central to ensuring
progress and surmounting barriers. Our students best appreciate the relevance
of IL when they read information environments as invitations to converse, and
when we prepare them to enter those conversations fully aware of their obli-
gations and opportunities. But to do so, we ourselves must enter into a more
robust and sustained conversation with each other.

COMMON GROUND GOING FORWARD

CS: We started our conversation by looking back ten years. We noted in your
two articles a call that, if appreciated, went largely unheeded. And we've observed
more than a few obstacles along the path to intellectual partnerships, engaged
classroom teaching, and a more nuanced sense of IL.

    RN: But our conversation has also demonstrated that there has been con-
siderable progress as well. We have a better sense of the challenges as well as the
rewards of an IL actively shaped by collaboration between our two fields.

    RN and CS: And, now speaking in one voice, we've also arrived at several
desiderata that can inform our efforts going forward:

    Community
      · Share our educational identities, and our hopes with one another.
      · Formulate integrated guiding documents that lead to shared
         understanding.
      · Establish locations for shared conversation and collaboration, in for-
         mal literature, organizations, and institutions.

    Change
      · Reflect on our strategies through feedback from one another and
         students.
      · Experiment and revise so as to resist fossilized approaches.
      · Attend to student-centered approaches which call on contexts outside
         of our academic ones.

    Context
      · Embrace the rich environments in which students use technology and
         information.
      · Look beyond college to dynamic, life-long relevance and application.
      · Emphasize knowledge making in collaborative and interactive infor-
         mation environments.

                                                                                                  31

    If there were to be a presiding deity for our article it would Janus, the Roman
god of transitions, thresholds, and new beginnings. Janus is usually depicted as
having two faces, one that looks to the past, and one that looks forward into the
future. We have likewise looked back ten years to a pair of articles that had a
formative influence, if not on IL practices then at least on IL discussions. And
from our current position we have also looked forward. IL is itself similarly posi-
tioned at a threshold moment. The promise of the next decade is bright indeed
if collaboration and conversation drive our efforts, as they have in these pages.

THRESHOLD CONCEPTS:
INTEGRATING AND APPLYING
INFORMATION LITERACY AND
WRITING INSTRUCTION

      Barry Maid and Barbara D'Angelo
      Arizona State University

Originally approved in 2000, the Association of College and Research Librar-
ies (ACRL) Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education (IL Standards)
have been adopted by libraries in higher education as the basis of instructional
programs and for collaboration between librarians and instructional faculty for
student learning. In particular, librarians and writing faculty have collaborated
in what can be seen as natural partnerships due to mutual interest to develop
student research skills. The IL Standards have also been recognized by regional
accreditation agencies and serve as a foundation for many Southern Association
of Colleges and Schools (SACS)-accredited Quality Enhancement Plans (QEP),
a plan each member school must develop and submit as part of the reaccredi-
tation process. In 2012, the ACRL Board of Directors initiated the process to
review and revise the IL Standards with the formation of a task force, resulting
in the evolution away from standards towards a framework. The Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework for IL) is based on a cluster
of interconnected concepts intended to provide a skeleton for flexible implemen-
tation based on local context. Conceptually, the Framework for IL is grounded
in current learning theory which stresses threshold concepts and metaliteracy as
a way to enhance skills and knowledge transfer. As a result, the Framework for
IL presents librarians, instructional faculty, and administrators with challenges
to rethink how IL has been taught and assessed at their institutions and what it
means more broadly for accreditation.

    For those of us in Writing Studies, the Framework for IL provides an exigence
to consider our pedagogical and assessment practices within a changing infor-
mation landscape and a shifting higher education landscape. An understanding
of the Framework for IL and the concepts it is based upon, is, therefore, called
for within the context of the seminal documents grounding writing programs:

Composition (WPA OS) and the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing.

WHAT'S A THRESHOLD CONCEPT?

The Framework for IL establishes six frames, each with a designated threshold
concept. In addition, recent research and scholarship in Writing Studies has
focused on threshold concepts within the context of transfer. What, though, is
a threshold concept?

    In the early years of this century, British researchers Jan Meyer and Ray Land
(2006) proposed the idea of threshold concepts. Conceived as a way to under-
stand why some students "get stuck" and have trouble negotiating concepts,
threshold concepts represent a transformed way of viewing or understanding
something. This transformed understanding is required for a learner to progress
and may be seen as the way individuals think and practice within a disciplinary
(or other) community. Meyer and Land talk about a threshold concept as a "con-
ceptual gateway" or "portal" which a learner progresses through as they learn and
integrate the concept and are transformed by it. Importantly, threshold concepts
are not the same as core concepts. A threshold concept represents "seeing things
in a new way." When accepted by the individual, threshold concepts may lead
to an individual adopting a new way to see the world and/or changes the way s/
he may think about their own and others' choices. Core concepts are building
blocks on which learning progresses but that do not lead to a different view of
the subject or to transformation in perspective. While threshold concepts will be
unique to each discipline, it is possible to identify the properties of a threshold
concept. According to Meyer and Land (2006a; 2006b), features of threshold
concepts are that they are:

      · Transformative: once understood, a threshold concept represents a
         significant shift in the way an individual perceives a subject. The shift
         may be affective, as in a shift in identity, or it may be performance-­
         related in the way that an individual behaves.

      · Troublesome: a threshold concept may be seen as troublesome for
         a couple of reasons. One, moving through a portal to a new way of
         thinking results in letting go of the old way of thinking, something
         that students may find difficult to do. In addition, threshold concepts
         may constitute or lead to the acquisition of troublesome knowl-
         edge that is conceptually difficult to understand, is "alien" or from a
         perspective that conflicts with the one currently held, or is complex
         and seemingly inconsistent or counter-intuitive. Threshold concepts

38
                                                                                         Threshold Concepts

         may also be troublesome due to "troublesome language"; that is, while
         disciplinary discourse practices may facilitate communication between
         members of a discipline, the language may make familiar concepts
         seemingly foreign and conceptually difficult to understand.
      · Irreversible: once an individual has understood and adapted the
         transformation, it cannot be reversed without considerable effort.
         An individual may feel loss initially at leaving the old perspective or
         understanding behind.
      · Integrative: once acquired, a threshold concept reveals interrelated-
         ness between concepts or ideas in ways that were previously hidden or
         unclear.
      · Bounded: threshold concepts have boundaries, bordering with thresh-
         old concepts from other areas. These boundaries may represent the
         divisions between disciplines.
      · Discursive: the transformation brought about by the acquisition of
         threshold concepts results in new and empowering forms of expression
         for the learner.
      · Reconstitutive: Discursive practices distinguish disciplinary thinking.
         A learner's identity within a discipline is interrelated to their thinking
         and use of language.
      · Liminal: Learners pass through a liminal stage when acquiring a
         threshold concept during which there is uncertainty as the individual
         leaves the old ways behind and passes through the portal to the new.
         This liminal stage can be viewed in the same light as a "rite of passage"
         in which there is a change in status and the learner has been trans-
         formed--acquired their new identity and "thinks" and "practices" in
         their new identity (i.e., "thinks like a rhetorician").

    What is important to understand is that since a threshold concept trans-
forms a learner, that concept becomes a part of an individual's thought process
about a subject. It requires a shift in worldview and can be quite difficult. It also
often feels as though one has gone through a passage; hence, the gateway or
portal metaphor.

THRESHOLD CONCEPTS AND WRITING

To this point there have only been a handful of Writing Studies researchers that
have addressed threshold concepts and how they may be used to help in writing
instruction. Most notably they are Linda Adler-Kassner, Elizabeth Wardle, and
Irene Clark.

                                                                                                  39
Maid and D'Angelo

    Researchers have suggested certain traits of threshold concepts as import-
ant. Linda Adler-Kassner, John Majewski, and Damian Koshick (2012) tend to
focus on the traits of "troublesome" and "liminality." Based on a study of linked
first-year writing and history classes, they point out that these traits can be
useful in helping students understand the writing concepts of genre, discourse
community, audience, purpose and context. They look at the threshold con-
cepts the students face in each course as "snapshots." Irene Clark and Andrea
Hernandez (2012) focus on the same traits but also include "transformative,"
while they suggest writing instructors should think about "genre awareness"
rather than "teaching genre." By analyzing survey data and student reflections,
they suggest that students are taught and learn about genres in a defined context
and are not able to transfer that knowledge. They suggest students would be
more likely to transfer genre skills if the focus was on the context rather than
the surface features.

    In addition, scholars have connected threshold concepts to transfer.
Adler-Kassner et al. (2012) explore threshold concepts as a frame to consider
writing and transfer in the context of troublesome knowledge. Most recently,
Linda Adler-Kassner and Elizabeth Wardle, along with thirty other Writing
Studies scholars have presented five threshold concepts of writing (2015). Those
threshold concepts are

      · Writing is a Social and Rhetorical Act
      · Writing Speaks to Situations through Recognizable Forms
      · Writing Enacts and Creates Identities and Ideologies
      · All Writers Have More to Learn
      · Writing Is (Also Always) a Cognitive Activity

ACRL STANDARDS REVISION, THRESHOLD
CONCEPTS, AND METALITERACY

While the ACRL IL Standards were widely accepted by academic librarians and
have formed the basis of many collaborations between librarians and faculty
from across disciplines, the IL Standards have also faced significant criticism.
In particular, research and theory has shown that rather than a prescriptive
and de-contextualized set of skills, IL is a contextualized and situated concept
(Bruce, 1997; Lloyd, 2010; Lupton, 2004; Norgaard, 2003), In addition, Carol
Kuhlthau's (2004) research has shown that like writing, research is a process.
In addition, the information environment has changed significantly since the
inception of the IL Standards, both in the context of collecting information and
in its analysis and use. Individuals are no longer the consumers of pre-packaged

40
                                                                                         Threshold Concepts

information; they are also producers of information in dynamic and ever chang-
ing landscapes.

    In recognition of the evolving definition and understanding of IL based on
research and theory, the Framework for IL moves away from a standards-based
approach to one that is grounded in threshold concepts and metaliteracy. Rather
than a prescriptive set of standards, the Framework for IL is intended to be sit-
uational; that is, the intent is that each institution implement it and develop
learning outcomes based on local context. The new definition of IL emphasizes
the dynamic and flexible nature of the concept:

         Information literacy is the set of integrated abilities encom-
         passing the reflective discovery of information, the under-
         standing of how information is produced and valued, and the
         use of information in creating new knowledge and participat-
         ing ethically in communities of learning. (ACRL, 2015)

    For Writing Studies, the shift represented in the Framework for IL should
be a comfortable one as it is similar to developments within the discipline to
emphasize rhetorical (and contextual) pedagogy. However, the Framework for
IL presents challenges to the discipline of Writing Studies. Clearly, how we
approach IL as a pedagogical concept within curricula and for assessment will be
challenged. In particular, the place of the traditional "research paper" assignment
may continue to be contested and evolve as we help students adopt and adapt
to the threshold concepts and metaliteracy. This challenge potentially benefits
student learning by instilling a richer and fuller understanding of information
and its use and presentation and their own role as both consumer and producer
of information.

The Framework for IL Threshold Concepts

The Framework for IL is divided into six frames; each frame consists of associated
knowledge practices and dispositions.

    Authority Is Constructed and Contextual recognizes that information is pro-
duced within a context and that authority--expertise and what is accepted as
expertise--differs based on discipline or context. Novices rely on superficial
characteristics to identify authority such as publication type or academic cre-
dentials; experts rely on and are open to changes in schools of thought and
discipline- or context-specific paradigms. The concept that authority is con-
textual is a comfortable one for Writing Studies as it recognizes that authority
comes from disciplinary values, conversations that evolve with research and the-
ory building within a discipline, industry, or other context. Yet, in too many

                                                                                                  41
Maid and D'Angelo

cases, students are taught to evaluate authority based on rote mechanical criteria
such as an author's degree or affiliation rather than situating a source within the
broader disciplinary context/conversation.

    Information Creation as a Process recognizes that information is an intentional
act of message creation that may take place in any format/media and that is the
result of a process that involves research, creation, revision, and dissemination.
Experts understand and evaluate the process of creation as well as the final prod-
uct to evaluate the usefulness of information whereas novices frequently focus
on the finished product (or don't recognize that a product may be dynamic). In
today's information landscape, in which information may be produced, dissem-
inated and continually evolve within a dynamic medium, the ability to under-
stand process and how format/media impacts information (as both a producer
of it and a consumer of it) is critical. Even when assignments involve dynamic
media, often the constraints of a classroom mean that conceptually they appear
to be static (one author or team of authors producing a finished product that is
graded and forgotten) rather than the type of process that may take place within
the workplace or in personal lives (creating a product that is then continually
commented upon and/or revised). The ability to understand this has implica-
tions for evaluating information. In addition, as a threshold concept for IL,
Information Creation as a Process evolves beyond the traditional interpretation
of the "writing process" or "research process" to incorporate a more realistically
dynamic process that is potentially never-ending.

    Information Has Value recognizes that information may have several different
types of value: economic, educational, as a means to influence, or as a way to
negotiate and understand the world. The value of information is impacted by
legal and sociopolitical interests for both production and dissemination. This
threshold concept is clearly associated with critical thinking aspects of the WPA
OS as well as Knowledge of Conventions outcomes to understand legal implica-
tions of intellectual property and attribution.

    Research as Inquiry emphasizes that research is an iterative process of ongo-
ing inquiry and extends beyond academics. For Writing Studies, this threshold
concept is most closely associated with what is traditionally viewed as "research
process"--that is, the establishment of a need (research question or thesis) and a
plan to collect data/information based on that need.

    Scholarship as Conversation recognizes the role of discourse communities and
the evolution of discourse over time resulting from different perspectives and
interpretations of information. Seemingly overlapping with "Authority is Con-
structed and Contextual, Scholarship as Conversation focuses on the broader
disciplinary/social/industry conversation of relevant topics/interests rather than
on the evaluation of individual pieces or sources.

    Searching as Strategic Exploration recognizes that the search for information
is iterative and non-linear and is based on the evaluation of information sources
to adapt searches and collection of information. Similar to Research as Inquiry,
this threshold concept focuses on the search process itself and the mechanics of
that process.

Metaliteracy

The Framework for IL draws upon metaliteracy as a foundational principle in
conjunction with threshold concepts. Similar to the way that metacognition is
defined as "thinking about thinking," metaliteracy refers to "literacy about liter-
acy." It has become almost a commonplace in recent years to identify or describe
certain skill sets as literacies: visual literacy, critical literacy, and digital literacy
are just a few. How these literacies are defined and understood is dependent on
the community of practice to which they are most associated; many reflect sim-
ilar and overlapping skills and abilities.

    As defined by Thomas Mackey and Trudi Jacobson (2011, 2014), met-
aliteracy re-envisions IL as an overarching literacy in which individuals are
both consumers and producers of information. The four domains that form
the basis of metaliteracy are behavioral, cognitive, affective, and metacogni-
tive. Metaliteracy also forms the theoretical foundation for the Framework for
IL in conjunction with the six frames and related dispositions. These four
domains serve to integrate spheres of learning in a way that fosters student
development. This makes sense in terms of teaching for transfer. When we
cross through the portal, to use Jan Myer and Ray Land's metaphor, we have
changed the way we think, the way we perceive things, the way we act, and the
way we reflect about what we have done and need to do. Further, the domains
are familiar to Writing Studies as they also form the basis of the WPA OS and
Habits of Mind.

ACRL Framework for IL and the WPA OS/Habits of Mind

In previous work, we have noted the connections between the original IL Stan-
dards and the WPA OS (D'Angelo & Maid, 2004; Maid & D'Angelo, 2012)
there seem to be real differences in the movement of the revisions for both
groups. Both documents emerged in the 90s, partly as a result of the general
environment that called for more accountability and assessment in higher edu-
cation. Both standards and outcomes nicely fit the model for assessment pur-
poses. Both disciplines were able to use their respective standards and outcomes
for that purpose. However, while assessment is a good thing, especially when

                                                                                                  43
Maid and D'Angelo

groups need accountability with a variety of constituencies, neither document
really speaks to pedagogical concerns or learning theory.

WPA Outcomes: What They're Good For
and What They're Not Good For

The original impetus for the WPA OS came from a grassroots effort of writ-
ing program administrators who were convinced that even though they oversaw
programs with widely diverse curricula, there was an unarticulated agreed-upon
sense of what it was that students were supposed to learn in first-year composi-
tion. The original WPA OS articulated that previously unspoken sense of "what
it was that students should know when they finish the course."

    We can see, by looking at the original statement adopted by WPA, how
easy it would be for both students and teachers to interpret the outcomes as
goals that can be checked off. In this sense it is similar to the IL Standards and
the potential to see it as a discrete set of skills instead of contextualized set of
outcomes. The outcomes are defined by four categories: Rhetorical Knowledge;
Critical, Thinking, Reading, and Writing; Processes; and Knowledge of Con-
ventions; each category is divided into explicit statements articulating individual
outcomes (http://wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html).

    Not seeing the outcomes as skills to be learned so students can move on to
other things is crucial when we are concerned with the idea of transfer--the idea
that something learned in one context can be effectively adapted and applied in
another context. One of the most common complaints WPAs hear is that students
"can't write" even though they've successfully completed first-year writing or disci-
plinary writing courses. This phenomenon certainly isn't unique to writing; anec-
dotally it is not uncommon for instructors to complain that students don't carry
what they learn in one course to another even within their disciplinary courses. Of
course, faculty in all disciplines have undoubtedly heard or read similar complaints
from employers about students who haven't learned or "can't write, can't research,
can't do whatever it was they were supposed to have learned." But learning is not a
linear lock-step process. Is it, then, that students don't learn? Or have they, in fact,
learned but not transferred that learning for some reason?

    In 2011, driven by the need to determine what constitutes "readiness
for college success," The Council of Writing Program Administrators, the
National Council of Teachers of English, and the National Writing Project
jointly adopted the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing. The hall-
mark of this document are the "Eight Habits of Mind" that mark the processes
of successful writers:

44
                                                                                         Threshold Concepts

      · Curiosity--the desire to know more about the world
      · Openness--the willingness to consider new ways of being and think-

         ing in the world
      · Engagement--a sense of investment and involvement in learning
      · Creativity--the ability to use novel approaches for generating, investi-

         gating, and representing ideas
      · Persistence--the ability to sustain interest in and attention to short-

         and long-term projects
      · Responsibility--the ability to take ownership of one's actions and

         understand the consequences of those actions for oneself and others
      · Flexibility--the ability to adapt to situations, expectations, or

         demands
      · Metacognition--the ability to reflect on one's own thinking as well as

         on the individual and cultural processes used to structure knowledge

    We can easily see these habits of mind are not something that can be checked
off as an assessment of skills. They are clearly difficult to demonstrate and/or
assess. How, for example, would a program assess "curiosity" or "openness"? Of
course, they weren't intended to be assessed; instead they are intended to be
descriptors of behaviors of successful writers that should be emulated. Unlike
outcomes articulated in the WPA OS, the habits of mind are attributes or behav-
iors. If we view the habits of mind in the context of metaliteracy, they fall into
the affective and metacognitive domains. In the context of the Framework for
IL, the habits of mind are similar to and serve the same purpose as the disposi-
tions articulated for each frame. The Framework for IL, however, took a different
approach by integrating specific dispositions associated with each frame rather
than a separate document. As such, it presents a more integrated whole in terms
of contextualizing student learning.

    While the habits of mind or dispositions may be less teachable, clearly pos-
sessing them, since they are not context dependent, theoretically will more
likely allow students to transfer skills. In fact, Dana Driscoll and Jennifer Wells
(2012) suggest that individual dispositions should be an area of writing transfer
research. Wardle (2012) further called for more research on how educational sys-
tems encourage specific dispositions within students with an emphasis on "prob-
lem-exploring dispositions" vs. "answer-getting dispositions" and the influence
of standardized testing as facilitating answer-getting dispositions in students.

    In Writing across Contexts, Kathleen Yancey, Liane Robertson, and Kara
Taczak (2014) emphasize writers' needs to take control or their own learning
processes and that, as instructors, we need to construct pedagogies that will help
them do so. Yancey, Robertson, and Taczak describe a "teaching for transfer"

                                                                                                  45

model for writing classes which they believe guides students to learn and transfer
knowledge about their writing. A key component of this model is metacogni-
tion to facilitate students' reflection upon what they have learned and how it
can be applied to other contexts. Metacognition, or reflection, has of course
been well-documented as a strategy to facilitate student learning. The work of
Yancey et al. is based, for example, on the National Research Council's How
People Learn (2000) and Yancey's own extensive work on reflection and its use in
writing classrooms. Their work points to the realization that students must first
learn the appropriate language in order to be able to articulate their learning.
Further, they acknowledge the role of prior knowledge in student learning (a
nod to dispositions) as either a conduit or barrier to learning.

MAKING SENSE OUT OF RELATED CONCEPTS

So we see some hints at how these related ideas--threshold concepts, metaliter-
acy, habits of minds/dispositions--might have an impact on developing a writ-
ing pedagogy that would not only stress the ability to be information literate
but also allow student writers to transfer learned concepts from one context to
another. Where do we go from here? An example may help to illustrate how
these concepts are related in practice.

    The Framework for IL identifies Information Creation as a Process as a thresh-
old concept. For ages, writing instructors have been trying to teach students that
"writing is a process." Many of us have crossed that portal and can't understand
how writing can be viewed in any other way. However, how many of us always
really believed that in practice writing is a process? Can we articulate when we
really passed through the portal? Can we point to not when we learned about
process in an "I can come up with the right answer on a test" way (based on the
work of Flower and Hayes), but truly changed our thinking to understand that
effective writing can only be undertaken through a process? Do our students
really understand this? Can we articulate what process means in an era in which
information is communicated in media that is not static or fixed so that there
may not be, in reality, a "final product"? We can assess it by requiring drafts and
peer review and the like, but do they "really get it" or are they simply meeting a
course requirement to get the grade?

    Let us offer a personal anecdote to show how it might really be working
based on Barry's experience with "crossing the threshold" of understanding writ-
ing (information creation) as a process. He's not quite sure when he was first
introduced to the idea that writing is a process since high school teachers and
college TAs didn't then teach process as we have come to understand it. They
talked about formal outlines, first drafts, and final drafts. That didn't connect

46
                                                                                         Threshold Concepts

with Barry; instead his process included lots of reading and thinking. Eventu-
ally, close to when the writing was due, he'd type up (using first a manual and
eventually an electric typewriter) a draft, go over the draft for typos and the like.
Then he'd retype the final draft and hand it in. Perhaps since there were identifi-
able steps, that was a process. But when he first started teaching writing, he was
introduced to the whole process idea as a disciplinary construct. But he taught
it without really believing in it since the process that worked for him didn't fit
the model that was generally accepted as "writing process." In a sense, he was in
a liminal state--he understood the concept intellectually but didn't fully accept
it. In part this may be due to the concept of "writing process" as troublesome
knowledge. What he was being told was writing process didn't fit his conception
of it. Whether this was due to teaching that didn't quite resonate or his own ties
to his own prior knowledge, for Barry, the concept wasn't fully sinking in.

    Then one day as a relatively new assistant professor he received a manuscript
he had submitted back with a "revise and resubmit" verdict. Most of the revi-
sions were simple and easy to do. However, there was one paragraph, where the
editor asked several questions that required some serious thinking in order to
answer the concerns. Typing a new paragraph on an electric typewriter didn't
work so after a couple of tries, he then tried to insert longhand comments on
the typescript. Nothing worked, other than growing frustration until he had
an idea. The department had just received two TRS-80 computers with a word
processing program so he decided to word process the troublesome paragraph.
After typing it in and printing it out to read it, he made some additional changes
and was easily able to rewrite the text on the screen--in fact, he wrote at least a
dozen versions of that paragraph.

    What does this have to do with crossing the threshold of "writing process"
or Information Creation as a Process? First came the recognition of the power in
using the new technology. He now understood the capabilities and constraints
of creating information through various processes and with various technol-
ogies. But then came an additional realization, and the threshold was finally
crossed. Barry finally realized that this was what people were talking about when
they were talking about "writing as process": the reiterative and dynamic process
of revision, feedback, revision, and dissemination. Barry was transformed in the
way Meyer and Land describe as crossing the threshold to not only understand
a concept but be transformed by it. He could never go back to the old way of
seeing and practicing writing as a process.

    The question is, now that the threshold was crossed, could he teach it better?
The honest answer is he doesn't know for sure. Which leads us to the connection
to dispositions and to habits of mind. The passage through the portal, attain-
ing the threshold concept and never being able to look back, is an incredibly

                                                                                                  47
Maid and D'Angelo

individual act. That doesn't mean we should not attempt to help our students
understand the concepts and be transformed; it just means that doing so is nei-
ther easy nor "canned." Interestingly, "Process" is not listed as a "threshold con-
cept of writing" in the Adler-Kassner and Wardle book. This may be one more
indication of the incredibly individual nature of what we are describing.

    And therein lies the challenge of the Framework for IL. The integration of
threshold concepts and dispositions is a significant evolution in our understand-
ing of student learning. To understand what makes up a concept as complex as
IL, we need a way to articulate it. Using language which breaks down threshold
concepts into knowledge practices and dispositions may on the surface appear to
be similar to the standards model: a listing of skills or abilities or practices that
can be discretely assessed. However, the challenge is to go beyond that surface
appearance to understand how deeply situated and contextualized IL is based on
the information landscape (discipline, industry, personal life of the individual)
and on the individualized dispositions of each person.

    So, while we have seen two different professional organizations, who have
often had intertwined instructional goals, develop their own statements about
what students should know, we now see both of these professional organizations
slightly diverge as their statements get revised. Both ACRL and WPA created
their original documents out of the need for assessment and accountability. It
appears that the latest revision of the WPA Outcomes Statement is still in that
mode. ACRL, on the other hand, has moved to a new framework that stresses
threshold concepts--or ways of changing how students think about infor-
mation. Still, it would be wrong to assume that while ACRL has evolved in a
slightly different direction from 15 years ago that WPA has simply tweaked and
stagnated. The creation of the Framework for Success in Postsecondary Writing
with its Habits of Mind, clearly moves WPA in the same direction as ACRL.
Finally, then, we can see disciplinary leadership moving beyond assessment to
transfer, and in some ways embracing the importance threshold concepts have in
the way students not only learn but transfer skills and knowledge beyond a sin-
gle classroom setting. Looking at transfer really means looking at education in
a different way. It moves beyond teaching students identifiable and quantifiable
facts and skills that are easily assessed within the classroom context and towards
a pedagogy that teaches students how to apply what they have learned in the
classroom to other classrooms and other areas of life.

    The Framework for IL has the potential to open new dialogs between fac-
ulty, librarians, and administrators to share responsibility for the teaching and
assessment of IL. As Rolf Norgaard and Caroline Sinkinson (Chapter 1, this
collection) have pointed out, those dialogs and action resulting from them have
more often than not been aspirational rather than reality or limited to individual

initiatives. Still, progress has been made and the Framework for IL with its foun-
dation in core principles of threshold concepts and metaliteracy provides an
opportunity for those of us in Writing Studies and in Library and Information
Science to do more than simply focus on a common concern related to transfer
as we investigate ways to use seminal documents within both fields. It will no
longer be enough to understand one another's perspectives and only to engage
in dialogue. We now need to actively partner together to move forward with
helping our students become information literate.

EMPLOYER EXPECTATIONS
OF INFORMATION LITERACY:
IDENTIFYING THE SKILLS GAP

      Dale Cyphert and Stanley P. Lyle
      University of Northern Iowa

The 21st century finds renewed discussion of the importance of a liberal arts
education. Citing the demands of a "complex and volatile" global economy, the
Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU) presented the case
in terms of "essential learning outcomes," including information literacy (IL),
that cross all areas of study (National Leadership Council for Liberal Education
and America's Promise, 2007, p. 12). A survey of business executives conducted
by the American Management Association (2010) names the crucial skills, "crit-
ical thinking, creativity, collaboration, and communication skills" (p. 2), and
acknowledges four-year colleges as the educational institutions most likely to
develop a proficient workforce. Employers surveyed by the AACU (Hart Research
Associates, 2013) overwhelmingly felt these capacities to be more important
than a candidate's undergraduate major (p. 1).

    Unfortunately, the resurging interest in these broad language, thinking, and
interpersonal skills is largely driven by a sense that universities are not adequately
preparing the nation's students. Even in an economy beset by persistently high
unemployment, employers complain that jobs cannot be filled because appli-
cants lack these critical "soft skills" (American Society for Training and Develop-
ment, 2012, p. 7). They also report that recent college graduates rarely demon-
strate expected and needed research competencies (Head, 2012). The persistent
concern for graduates' career readiness suggests that traditional liberal arts edu-
cation is not meeting the needs of the 21st century's information economy.

    Within liberal arts universities, library faculty have been among the first to
address the issue, perhaps because they were first impacted by the same technol-
ogies that have so dramatically altered the global business environment. Over
the past thirty years, academic librarians have expanded their role as informa-
tion curators to embrace research and instruction within a broader notion of
"information skills" (Rader, 2002) or IL (Pinto, Cordón & Díaz, 2010). By
1987, the American Library Association (ALA) had appointed a committee to

Cyphert and Lyle

study the role of IL in business, government, and education (American Library
Association, 1989).

    Two years later, Patricia S. Breivik and E. Gordon Gee (1989) called for an
IL revolution, pointing to academic libraries as the "key to achieving higher
education reform goals" (p. 3) necessitated by the exploding information age,
along with public librarians who would be instrumental in locating and orga-
nizing their communities' economic development data. The resulting IL would
help workers engage in lifelong learning and allow them to become the flexi-
ble, easily trainable workforce that business leaders were calling for. Subsequent
work showed a "vital link between higher education, information literacy and
lifelong learning" (Head, Van Hoeck, Eschler & Fullerton, 2013, p. 75) with
some researchers focusing on the need to "guarantee a competitive workforce in
times of turbulent global change" and others on the desire to promote "personal
growth and social equality and enrich society" through learning (p. 6).

    Agreement that IL is important in the workplace has not offered, however,
much guidance to universities seeking to prepare their students for professional
success. Over the past two decades, efforts to better integrate IL into business
curricula have resulted in limited change. There has been no "collective impact
on business curricula in general," and business, trade and professional leaders
continue to describe IL with a vocabulary of desirable but generic soft skills
(Sokoloff, 2012). The lack of curricular and business attention to IL has been
attributed to accreditation pressure to focus on more easily measurable out-
comes (Sokoloff, 2012), an overemphasis on technology issues (Association of
College and Research Libraries, 1998), differences in terminology (Conley &
Gil, 2011; Klusek & Bornstein, 2006; Leveson, 2000; O'Sullivan, 2002), and
the overwhelming nature of the task (Fiegen, Cherry & Watson, 2002).

    Qualitative research (Head et al., 2013) suggests the mismatch between aca-
demic preparation and employer expectations is not a simple matter of incom-
mensurate vocabularies, or even the more embarrassing but equally simple prob-
lem of inadequate education. As a concept, IL grew from roots in bibliographic
instruction, but the contemporary domain encompasses functional, critical,
and rhetorical "multiliteracies" that extend across multiple purposes, technol-
ogies, and disciplines (Selber, 2004). The specific issues of differing priorities,
knowledge bases, and vocabularies have been clearly shown to be factors in the
academic/employer mismatch, but more fundamental issues involve the use of
information in a specific professional context. Extensive interviews conducted
across a wide variety of professional settings have revealed consistent challenges
(Head et al., 2013); college graduates are not well prepared for the social nature
of information storage, the ambiguities inherent in the search for information,
or the rigors of timely thoroughness.

    Recognizing these challenges, the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (ACRL, 2015) marks a significant broadening from function-
ally defined IL skills toward an appreciation for the context in which informa-
tion will be used and a capacity for contextualized interpretation of information
that leads to reasonable conclusions. The domain of IL still encompasses the
functional literacy of where and how to get information as well as the critical
literacy of assessing the nature and use of information, but it is the rhetorical
literacy of constructing meaning from contextualized data that seems to matter
most in the workplace.

ONE UNIVERSITY'S RESPONSE

The University of Northern Iowa's College of Business Administration helps stu-
dents develop their soft skills with a program designed to introduce all business
majors to the broad er thinking, communication, and interpersonal skills associ-
ated with professional success. Begun in 2010, the College's Professional Readiness
Program (Hillyer, 2013) relies on an advisory board of business faculty, a network
of alumni and corporate partners, and a staff of faculty and graduate assistants
from the liberal arts disciplines to create programming and resources that support
students' professional development efforts across their entire college experience.

    Relying on published survey research with Fortune 500 companies, the
program addresses 37 skill sets in the areas of professional attitude, communi-
cation and presentation skills, writing and reasoning skills, and organizational
awareness. Business research is classified as a writing and reasoning skill, along
with business documents, problem solving, clear descriptions, audience analy-
sis, critical thinking, persuasive arguments, and message construction (Cyphert,
2011). New business majors attend a series of mandatory meetings while they
are taking their liberal arts courses, followed by activities and resources designed
to integrate professional context and expectations into the major courses over
the junior and senior years. At both levels, professionals serve as speakers and
meeting facilitators, solidifying the students' ability to apply the skills during
interviews, internships, and ultimately in their business careers.

    Business research skills are one area of professional readiness, so a faculty
member and the library's business specialist began a project to develop profes-
sionally relevant resources for the program. It became apparent that neither the
general academic research skills that were part of the liberal arts curriculum,
nor the business-specific research tools that had been created to support the
academic curriculum were targeting workplace research priorities as described
by professionals. A project was undertaken to systematically define the career-­
relevant skill sets, determine the skills gap that existed for business majors taking

                                                                                                  53

professional positions in the region, and develop program resources to prepare
them more appropriately.

    The skill set that emerged encompassed broad notions of IL, unsurprising
based on the previous work that had been done regarding workplace readiness.
A subsequent survey of employers identified a somewhat more surprising pat-
tern of relatively small gaps between the skills desired by employers and those
held by college-educated entry-level employees, suggesting that a collaborative
process to define workplace skills from a professional perspective might resolve
some of the terminology problems. On the other hand, the project also demon-
strates the degree to which ongoing collaboration will be necessary to provide
instruction that prepares students for a socially and rhetorically complex work-
place environment.

DEFINING THE SKILL SET

The project began with a straightforward request within a professional network
of business librarians. In retrospect, the assumptions inherent in that request for
advice are illustrative. We asked about employer expectations regarding data-
bases, research reports, key trade journals, and automated information sources.
Our own focus on students' ability to use specific information sources belies a
functional orientation that we ultimately found to be out of sync with the pro-
fessional community's more rhetorical understanding of the skill set. A review of
the research on IL in business contexts illustrates the degree to which IL differs
in work and educational settings (Weiner, 2011) as well as the degree to which
employers describe a wide range of intellectual, technical, and social behavior as
just a few key categories of worker preparation. More recent studies, such as the
Project Information Literacy Research Report on recent college graduates, also
have found a "distinct difference between the information competencies and
strategies today's graduates bring with them to the workplace and the broader
skill set that more seasoned employers need and expect" (Head, 2012, p. 24).

RESEARCH ON INFORMATION LITERACY
IN THE BUSINESS PROFESSIONS

    In 1989, the American Library Association (ALA) committee's final report
warned that "a lack of timely and accurate information is costly to American
businesses" (American Library Association, 1989, para. 8) and promised that
"those who learn how to achieve access to the bath of knowledge that already
envelops the world will be the future's aristocrats of achievement" (para. 12).
Noting the role of libraries "as the potentially strongest and most far-reaching

community resource for lifelong learning" (para. 19) as well as the dearth of
attention in the business discussion of the emerging information society, the
ALA called for efforts to raise awareness of the importance of IL.

    A review of the research conducted over the following decade found that
businesses were focused on the pragmatic issues of technology adoption, leav-
ing the exploration of the uses of information to the academics (Bruce, 1999;
2000). Theoretical and educational models of IL thus continued to develop, but
they were based primarily on data collected in academic settings and analyzed
by professional librarians. Over the same decade, a few business faculty began
to explore the importance of research skills and IL in a contemporary business
environment (for example Ali & Katz, 2010; Burke, Katz, Handy & Polimeni,
2008; Hawes, 1994; Karakaya & Karakaya, 1996; Katz, Haras & Blaszczynski,
2010; Schlee & Harich, 2010; Walker et al., 2009), leading to expanded research
on workplace information use.

    The most obvious feature of this initial research is the broadened scope of
knowledge, skills, and attitudes involved in professional contexts. Acknowledg-
ing that "libraries and dedicated librarians have taken the lead," one organiza-
tional development consultant deemed it "not enough" in a business environ-
ment where "information comes from many sources and can be obtained in
many ways" (Goad, 2002, p. x). Abigail J. Sellen, Rachel Murphy, and Kate L.
Shaw (2002) used diaries of knowledge workers to categorize the complex infor-
mation tasks involved in their use of the Internet, which included steps to main-
tain and monitor the business environment as well as seek, evaluate, and retain
specific information. Similarly, O'Sullivan (2002) pointed out that workers "are
faced with information overload, have difficulty finding what they need quickly
and efficiently, and are struggling with issues of quality and credibility" (p. 9).

    The solution seemed to be an expansion of the concept of IL to encompass
the "peripheral" skills that allow a worker to "do the steps" involved in accessing,
evaluating, and using information (Goad, 2002, p. 30). Soft skills of time man-
agement, business outlook, delegation, and teamwork (O'Sullivan, 2002) as well
as communication, critical thinking, risk-taking, computer literacy, and business
literacy (Goad, 2002, p. x) were proposed as essential. O'Sullivan concluded that
it is possible to "massage" the concepts of learning organizations, knowledge man-
agement, and lifelong learning so that they encompass the terminology of IL, but
"this approach only skirts around the edges" of IL as a "holistic concept" (p.11).

    O'Sullivan (2002) proposed a framework to reconcile business and academic
perspective as an issue of organizational level, suggesting that

         businesses have been concentrating on implementing knowl-
         edge strategies and have not yet got past the infrastructure

                                                                                                  55

         and management buy-in hurdles to the question of individual
         capability and contribution. When they do start to look at
         how individuals are coping with life in a knowledge company,
         and at the employee's ability to contribute positively, the
         information literacy gap will be self-evident. (p. 11)

    Within an organizational context, however, individuals' goals, capacities,
and procedural choices do not lead to organizational outcomes in an additive
way. The success of a learning organization depends on tapping its complex inter-
nal interrelationships to foster long-term collective success (Senge, 1994), and
knowledge management is distinguished by the opacity of the underlying tasks
(Drucker, 1973). Peter F. Drucker later referred to the need to be "information
literate" in today's organization (Harris, 1993, p. 120), but any link between
individual skill development and enterprise-level outcomes is necessarily com-
plicated by the economic and political environment of the business, the contex-
tual complexity of work, and the systems nature of organizations.

    Economic and political environment. The initial formulation of IL was
itself a function of a changing workplace where technology was shifting labor
from routine manual and cognitive tasks toward more sophisticated behaviors
(Autor, Levy & Murnane, 2003). During the 1980s, U.S. business leaders had
recognized that global competitiveness would increasingly rely on a flexible,
quality-minded workforce and became concerned about worker readiness (John-
ston & Packer, 1987). Anthony Carnevale's (1991) influential report described
the shift as one from "job-specific to more general capabilities" and "personal
skills" that could be applied across a variety of "fluid contexts" (p. 101). In the
new technologically enhanced workplace, the "collecting, recording, analyzing,
and communicating of information" was just one more "labor-intensive" task
that was being "subsumed in information-based or communications technol-
ogy" (p. 102).

    Although the vocabulary of lifelong learning seemed to reflect the academic
learning that libraries traditionally supported, organizational goals were quite
different. The concern was not for workers to become better at information
processing tasks; computers were expected to take over those functions. Instead,
workers previously educated to do those jobs would be required to gain the
"self-management and interpersonal skills" needed for the increasing levels of
social interaction the new workplace required (p. 103).

    Similarly, business' call for more empowered workers was not a simple cor-
ollary to educators' notion of learners with information-gathering skills that
would allow them to learn on their own. Cost savings from an increased use
of technology could be amplified with a decrease in organizational levels. As

production workers gained communication, teamwork, and problem-solving
skills, they would be able to take on the autonomous, decision-making required
in a lean organization--one that aimed to replace multiple layers of expensive
management with computers and empowered workers.

    Complexity of information work. The last decade has seen a shift toward
more fine-grained attempts to identify the discrete information skills needed
in business contexts, fleshing out the relationship between traditional library-
based definitions of IL and the business community's concern for more broadly
defined communication and critical thinking attributes. The results highlight
differences in vocabulary and conceptualization of the tasks, but illustrate as well
the complexity of workplace information use.

    In one attempt to prove the importance of IL in the business environ-
ment (Klusek & Bornstein, 2006), elements of IL were mapped to the U.S.
Department of Labor's O*Net job categories. Louise Klusek and Jerry Bornstein
(2006) observed that those outside academe do not recognize that IL is neither
library-centered nor information technology-centered, and they concluded that
while the "business community has not embraced the concept of information
literacy, IL skills are in fact highly valued in the field" (p. 19). However, their
analysis does not fully account for differences in the perceived sophistication of
various skills. To some extent, academics and professionals simply reverse the
skill hierarchy. The O*Net descriptions place explicit search and manipulation
of information within larger categories of Complex Problem Solving and Critical
Thinking and Instructing, while the librarian authors argue that, "critical think-
ing and communication are core concepts of information literacy" (p. 5). Con-
versely, employers classify many IL skills as basic work readiness and learning
skills (e.g. reading comprehension, listening), rather than sophisticated knowl-
edge processing skills that might be expected of college graduates.

    In Carnevale's precursor to the O*Net database development, key compo-
nents of "learning to learn" were "the cognitive domain of skills we use to collect,
know, and comprehend information" (1991, p. 111), understood as founda-
tional to gaining the more sophisticated skills needed in the New Economy and
included in the O*Net catalog of basic skills (Askov, 1996). Carnevale's compe-
tency description was not focused on the manipulation of complex information,
but on leveraging individual learning styles and using learning strategies and
tools to effectively apply new knowledge to new job requirements. Conversely,
Carnevale's description of problem solving skills focused on the use of various
business-specific problem-solving methods (i.e., Juran and Friedman & Yarbor-
ough Comprehensive Models, as well as more general Dewey-based processes).
Beyond a first step to "recognize, define, and analyze problems" (1991, p. 115),
there is no overlap with the accepted elements of IL.

                                                                                                  57
Cyphert and Lyle

    An ability to use popular management tools is thought to prepare a newly
empowered worker for broader responsibilities, but the fundamental abilities
to think logically, critically, and systematically are seemingly subsumed in
the very basic elements of worker readiness to learn. In short, differences in
vocabulary and priority seem to involve implicit assumptions about the rela-
tive teachability of cognitive skills. Academic librarians understand problem-­
solving skills to be learned steps in the development of IL, while the business
community seems to perceive them as a general capacity to learn a variety of
relevant, technical skills such as computer use, managerial methods, and com-
munication processes.

    Theresa M. Conley and Esther L. Gil (2011) parse this dichotomy further
in a recent employer survey. Employers agree on the importance of the skill set,
but when challenged to provide a more business-oriented term for "information
literacy," their top two choices were "critical thinking" and "decision-making."
Meanwhile, the most traditional aspect of IL, the location and retrieval of infor-
mation from a wide variety of sources, was deemed the easiest part of the pro-
cess. The important and more difficult skills were the abilities to recognize the
need for information and to use it effectively.

    Jason Sokoloff (2012), after surveying employers, concluded, "non-l­ibrarians
have little awareness of information literacy and instead conflate technology
and communication skills as essential qualifications for mastering informa-
tion and managing knowledge in the work place" (p. 6). In the work context,
information use is not understood as a cognitive ability, but as a set of rela-
tively complicated technical tasks to be accomplished. Information technol-
ogy consultant Craig Roth (2011), for instance, describes the contemporary
information worker's job as an "active, conscious effort at subscribing to the
right sources, setting filters, creating watch lists, setting bookmarks, tagging,
friending, and developing the right social networks to get and analyze infor-
mation" (para. 5). Roth warns against an "old-fashioned" assumption that the
knowledge worker's only "`real' job is to define problems, analyze the informa-
tion, find alternatives, etc." (para. 4) using information easily at hand. At the
same time, his description of workplace information gathering emphasizes the
contextual and cultural experience of a worker whose "intuition about what is
of value, and applying years of accumulated knowledge about where to look
and (more importantly) who to pay attention to is of tremendous value in a
knowledge economy" (para. 7).

    Organizational systems. IL has been primarily concerned with the personal
development of an individual information seeker or learner, especially with respect
to text-based information resources (Ferguson, 2009). The skills are typically
defined within a predominant paradigm of computing and telecommunications

58

that understands information processing as a staged progression from "noise
(unorganized data) to perceived data, to (organized) information, to knowledge"
(Marcum, 2002, p. 3). The result is a linear model; independent assembly and
use of objective information is the ultimate goal. In contrast, the functional role
of any individual within a large, complex organization is neither linear nor inde-
pendent, and information is only occasionally objective. Instead, contemporary
business organizations are better understood from a complex systems perspective
(Axelrod & Cohen, 1999; Gharajedaghi, 1999). Organizational activities are
not simple collections of acts performed by discrete individuals, each carrying an
individual set of skills, but collectively constituted patterns of interaction, affor-
dance, and social interpretation (Taylor & Van Every, 2000; Wilson, Goodman
& Cronin, 2007).

    Professionals seem to intuitively recognize that social skills make it possible
for individuals to negotiate the complex "knowledge ecosystem" of "people,
processes, technology and content" (Standards Australia, 2005, p. 8), and work-
place research has begun to demonstrate the limitations of the individual-­based
model of IL in a contemporary organization. A survey of corporate librarians
and information professionals (Matesic, 2005), for example, found that IL was
understood as the special domain of the company library, while non-­specialists
were seen as needing communication and context knowledge to effectively uti-
lize the library staff's information resources. Similarly, Sokolof (2012) found
that new employees were not expected to engage in information tasks alone,
but instead to assist and rely on senior colleagues who had developed the com-
pany and industry experience needed for effectively accessing and evaluating
information.

    Christine Bruce (2011) has noted that two key lines of research have
emerged that contradict the "traditional skills and competency approach" (p.
335). One is her own "phenomenographic" framework; the other is Annemaree
Lloyd's sociocultural research (2006; 2011). This literature illustrates the degree
to which IL does not exist separately from an organizational environment, and
"its many dimensions are closely related to the contexts in which it is experi-
enced" (Bruce, 2011, p. 335). The takeaway is a distinction between informa-
tion experience, which is the collective, context-bound, and socially constructed
environment within which a set of embodied information behaviors utilize
individual knowledge, skills, and attributes. There is no simple translation of
individual IL skills to the collective, distributed negotiation of knowledge as
it occurs at an organizational level. The recently developed Framework for IL
(2015) recognizes this complexity by presenting flexible core concepts, such as
the constructed and contextual nature of authority, rather than a prescriptive set
of decontextualized skills.

                                                                                                  59

EMPLOYER EXPECTATIONS AND EMPLOYEE SKILLS

Research thus shows that any transition from academic preparation to work-
place application involves considerably more than a simple transfer of objective,
individual skills to a new context, and pedagogical success will require more
than simply translating IL vocabulary from library to workplace contexts or
acknowledging differing priorities. The economic and political environment,
information task complexity, and organizational systems create a dynamic pro-
fessional setting that is fundamentally different from the academic; professional
preparation requires a holistic understanding of the tasks expected as well as a
contextually relevant sense of the levels of mastery required. Relevant and work-
able definitions of IL in the workplace will necessarily require the input of busi-
ness professionals who are familiar with both the contextualized tasks and the
organizational expectations of mastery.

    In our college's effort to prepare business majors for the information work
they will be expected to do, an important first step was thus to clarify employer
expectations with respect to information tasks and the mastery levels involved.
The university had recently piloted a protocol for assessing career-relevant skill
preparation of its students. The authors elected to use the methodology which
allowed us to simultaneously determine employer expectations and gain a base-
line assessment of graduates' skill levels.

METHODOLOGY: THE TARGETED SKILLS GAP ANALYSIS

The assessment framework is derived from SERVQUAL (Parasuraman, Zeithaml
& Berry, 1985; 1988), a commonly used model for measuring outcomes in ser-
vice industries, including libraries, which have derived the LIBQUAL+ quality
instrument from the same framework (Association of Research Libraries, 2013).
In applying the SERVQUAL model to the service provided by an educational
institution, the service provider is understood to be the university, while the
regional employers seeking a ready workforce are understood as the customers.
The service delivery process involves mutually constructed relationships, behav-
iors, and features, which might be understood by an education provider as the
learning process. The resulting framework (Manning et al., 2012) includes seven
potential gaps in the delivery of educational services to the State's employers.

    Each of the gaps represents a point at which there can be differences in the
expectations of service. Gap 1 illustrates the differences between what employers
expect of new employees and what the University perceives those expectations to
be. That is, a gap occurs when faculty do not know which skills are most critical
to employers or the level of skill that would be required for success in the job.

                Figure 3.1. Potential employer-university service gaps.

    Gaps 2, 3, and 4 represent potential discrepancies within the service provid-
er's operation. Gap 2 represents a difference in the faculty understanding of an
employer's skill requirements and the learning objectives within the curriculum,
while Gap 3 indicates the degree to which instructional processes do not result
in the targeted learning objectives. Gap 4 reflects an important insight from the
service quality research: there can be discrepancies between the actual education
delivered and the educational outcomes that are advertised by the institution.
Although the model illustrates this as a single gap, it could be a complicated
three-way interaction among a university's recruiting division, faculty percep-
tions, and actual learning outcomes.

    The expectational discrepancy on the consumer side, represented here as Gap
5, has been shown to have the most impact on customer satisfaction (Parasura-
man et al., 1988). This is the difference between the employers' expectations of
graduates' skill levels and their perceptions of the actual skill levels possessed. This
implies a somewhat different relationship from the way educational assessment
is typically framed. When a student's performance in the classroom setting is
assumed to indicate capacities or behaviors that will be observable upon grad-
uation, the model is that of a student as a tangible product who carries certain
assessable characteristics. Assuming the assessment process to have been accu-
rate, any failure to express those characteristics after graduation is presumed to
be a function of the student's personality or the employment context.

                                                                                                  61
Cyphert and Lyle

    By contrast, the service model understands service delivery and the custom-
er's perception of that service as simply two perspectives on the same transaction.
That is, the student's performance as perceived by the eventual employer is the out-
come of the educational service delivery process. There is no implicit transfer of
responsibility from educator to student, but an integration of the teacher/learner
process within a holistically understood educational outcome. As any educator
will quickly realize, this represents a more complex situation than the more typ-
ical service industry product where a single person or employee team delivers
the service. In an effort to represent this unique aspect of educational service
delivery, two additional gaps are added to the original SERVQUAL model. Gap
6 illustrates differences between employers' expectations and graduates' expec-
tations of the skills required for a position, and Gap 7 represents differences
between the graduates' and faculty's expectations (Manning et al., 2012).

TARGETED SKILLS AS SERVICE CHARACTERISTICS

Service dimensions were conceptualized in terms of the functional and tech-
nical aspects of the students' performance of their education within the work-
place. Development of an appropriate set of general but workplace-relevant IL
skills was a three-stage process. A first round of meetings was held with pro-
fessional staff from the college's Business and Community Services division, a
self-­supporting unit that offers consulting and research services in marketing,
entrepreneurship, economic development, and a variety of business operations
throughout the state and the upper midwest (US).

    Still working with our initial expectation that specific research tools or data
resources would be professionally desirable, we were surprised by the broad
range of critical thinking and communication skills that were actually sought.
The ability to recognize what information would be needed to answer a specific
business question was identified as the most problematic element of research
skill. If given a specific information request, graduates were able to locate the
data, but seemed unable to determine what information was needed in the first
place. Further, their tendency was to try to solve the problem with whatever
information they knew how to find, regardless of its appropriateness or ade-
quacy for the task.

    The second step was to incorporate the full range of IL skills into our scope,
specifically seeking out those operationalized skill descriptions that had been
developed in workplace contexts. The aim was to insure that we were address-
ing the full range of skills that might be desired by our statewide employer
stakeholder group. Further, the utility of the survey items required that we use
terminology that would be clear and consistent across a variety of companies

62
                                                                                      Employer Expectations

and industries. A matrix was developed that lined up aspects of IL as described
by multiple resources. Sources included four academic efforts (Association of
American Colleges and Universities, n.d.; Association of College and Research
Libraries, 2000; Goad, 2002; Head, 2012), four that utilized research with busi-
ness contexts (Coplin, 2003; Graveline, 2013; Malcom, 2012; Sokoloff, 2012),
and two industry-specific lists for competitive intelligence and information
technology (Chung & Ripperger, 2013; Committee on Information Technology
Literacy of the National Research Council, 1999).

    The final step was to partner with professionals drawn from the college's
alumni community. We wished to verify our interpretation of each skill descrip-
tion, insuring that we understood the behavior in a business context and that we
were describing it in a way that would be clearly understood by our employer
respondents. As a result of these meetings, the skill matrix was reordered some-
what to reflect a more common job-related task sequence, and wording was
changed to reflect some important business distinctions. Initial steps in the
research process involved gathering data, while information was the preferred
term for the product of evaluation and integration steps that occurred later in
the process. A distinction was also introduced between secondary and primary
research, in large part because secondary research would typically be conducted
to determine the need for additional primary research. Finally, communica-
tion skills were expanded to reflect what employers perceived as distinct skills
involved in choosing just that information appropriate to a specific audience or
context and effectively delivering the result. The categories involved in the ethical
use of information were deemed acceptable, although the point was made that
attribution of sources was exclusively related to secondary research tasks, while
the ethical issues of most importance to the business environment had to do
with primary research, including ethical gathering of data, as well as confiden-
tiality and ethical dissemination of information. The final list of 24 skills was
used to determine gaps between employer expectations and employee readiness.

PRIORITIZING THE SERVICE GAPS

The service gaps for each skill dimension were measured with survey questions
that asked respondents to indicate both the expected level of skill and their per-
ceptions of the actual skill delivered. The average difference score provides a
measure of the gap for that dimension. This measure alone is not sufficient to
prioritize management attention. A large gap could exist in an area that is not
particularly important to the customer, and management resources might be
more effectively spent on reducing a smaller gap in an area of greater customer
concern. The Targeted Skills Gap Analysis (Manning et al., 2012) thus calls
for results of the expectations/perceptions gap survey to be plotted on a two-­
dimensional decision matrix that displays the gap in customer expectations as
well as the relative importance to the customer, prioritizing those service ele-
ments that are most deserving of management attention.

                       Figure 3.2. Skill gap analysis quadrants.

    The service expectation, the skill level sought in University graduates, is plot-
ted on the x-axis; the perception of the skill performance actually received from
those same graduates is plotted on the y-axis. A perfect match is represented
as the dashed diagonal line, x=y, and the perceived gap appears as the vertical
distance between the dashed diagonal line and the plotted point. Four decision
quadrants are then created by drawing vertical and horizontal lines at the mean
values of skill levels sought and delivered. Skills for which customers desire a level
of skill higher than the mean are deemed more salient to their operations, while
observed skills that are below the mean are areas of more concern. The resulting
quadrants assist management in prioritizing the gaps that require attention.

    A full map of the service delivery process would involve data collection on
each of the expectational gaps discussed above, but for practical reasons, most
data collection efforts focus first on customers' perceptions and satisfaction with
the service experience, designated as Gap 5. The results drive management inves-
tigation of the remaining gaps to determine causal relationships and develop
effective solutions. We sought the most salient measure of employer satisfaction
with the university's ability to provide information literate employees to create

                                                                                                  65

a baseline measure, and we will use these results to refine the IL skill definitions
before conducting research with respect to faculty perceptions, alumni percep-
tions, current student self-efficacy, and direct skill assessment.

RESULTS: IDENTIFYING THE SKILLS GAP

With IRB approval, a web-based survey was distributed by email to the uni-
versity Career Center's list of 1,306 employers and recruiters. Although this list
includes some education and government employers, a large majority of Career
Center activities involve business majors. Given our desire to create a skill set
that could be generalized across multiple industries and business functions,
we felt all employers could be included without distorting the results. We also
invited the recipients, many of whom are recruiters associated with the human
resource function, to forward the survey link to first-line managers within their
organizations. Survey data was collected from 168 recipients, a 12.9% over-
all response rate. Respondents worked for companies that ranged in size from
under 100 employees (46.7%) to over 1,000 (21.2%). New employees had been
hired in all O*Net career clusters, although business, management, and admin-
istration and marketing, sales, and service dominated the mix.

    Some respondents did not provide ratings for one or more skills, suggesting
that not all entry-level jobs necessarily encompass the full scope of IL, and for
each item at least a few respondents selected "don't know" as their answer. While
total numbers of responses on each item differ, their range from 74 to 106 was
deemed both adequate and sufficiently balanced. The average ratings of employer
expectations and perceived new employee skill were calculated for each (See Tables
3.1 through 3.4) and plotted into quadrants of the Skill Gap Analysis (Figure 3.3).

    Overall, the results demonstrated a relatively consistent result across all ele-
ments of IL. Employers expected only "moderate" IL skills, averaging only a 2.09
on our five-point scale. Across all skill categories, entry-level employees were not
fully meeting employer expectations, but in no case was the gap larger than .51,
barely more than half a rating category. Employers found new graduates to be
working at the moderate level desired, albeit not at optimal performance. An
evaluation of the results by skills area, along with comments from respondents,
provides additional insight.

    In the general category of knowing when to seek information, employers
acknowledge the need to learn the business context before a new employee can
be fully productive. As one respondent summarized it, "Knowledge of college
students is not industry specific. The [research] tools used vary by company, and
it would be impossible to teach every tool to students," further, says another,
"We can teach some technical [skills]." Employers see a key skill as the social

capacity that allows new employees to engage productively in "regular workplace
interaction" such that they are able to read the implicit and contextual cues that
cause them to "detect the need for research." Respondents named, in particular,
asking questions, teamwork, and getting along well with others.

    In the realm of accessing information, employers expected slightly less than
moderate skills, and graduates came closest to meeting expectations in this area.
Employers were most concerned with an ability to document results, with one
noting, "We find that typically college grads are enthusiastic about doing the
research and not so much on documenting it in a way that will be helpful to
others in the future." Although employee skills rated lower than moderate in all
other access skills, several employers admitted that their organizations' planning
or cost analysis practices were also less than optimal.

    Employers consistently desired moderate information evaluation skills. As
suggested by previous research in workplace IL, however, the focus seems to
be on reporting the results of evaluation, distinguishing those tasks from what-
ever cognitive processes are involved in the evaluation of information. As one
employer put it, "Not all positions require a research component. However, all
positions require problem-solving skills." The ability to evaluate data for social,
cultural, and personal bias is rather obviously context-bound, but comments
suggest that employers understand each of these skills in terms of relationship
and communication skills. Employers emphasized the need for "understanding
the corporate culture and doing it the way that is generally accepted by our
company" as well as functional elements of "grammar and spelling mistakes" in
the written documents used to report the evaluation.

    The largest gap in the uses of information involved the analytical methods,
but the lowest expectations lie in use of information for business purposes. The
highest expectations involved graduates' ability to communicate their findings
to others. Comments further emphasized respondents' concern for communi-
cation with general remarks that "people skills and exceptional communication
skills are absolutely necessary for every employee" and more specific complaints
that new employees were unable to format their communications so that col-
leagues could easily use the information being provided.

    Employers' highest expectations lay in the area of information ethics, but
this was also the only area in which new employees possessed moderate skills,
overall. Confidentiality was the largest ethical concern, especially with respect to
the careless use of social media.

    Each of the 24 skill gaps were plotted onto the Skill Gap Analysis Quad-

employees are performing all skills below the diagonal, which represents a match
between skills and expectations, but the gap is not large. Further, IL skills fall
primarily in the relative strength and lower priority quadrants. That is, although
all are lower than desired, those skills that are rated the lowest, generally falling
in the area of information access, are also those least expected by employers.
Meanwhile ethics skills, expected to be somewhat higher, are also observed to be
somewhat higher.

    Just three skills fall in the areas for improvement where the employers' expec-
tations are the highest (i.e., at or above the overall average of 2.09) but skills are
observed to be the lowest (i.e., at or below the overall average 1.74):

    These areas of concern and employer comments are similar to those reported
by the Project Information Literacy Research Report on college graduates
(Head, 2012). Of the 4 competencies rated as highly needed by employers, but
rarely demonstrated by recent hires (p. 12), two were identified by the employers
in this study as well. The communication aspects of "engaging team members
during the research process" are reflected in skills #1 and #18, while "finding
patterns and making connections" seems to appear as skills #19, #20, and pos-
sibly #18 as well. One area, "retrieving information using a variety of formats,"
appears to be encompassed by skill #7, but the fourth, "taking a deep dive into
the `information reservoir,'" does not appear to have a direct corollary. It is pos-
sible that our methodology, which was specific to the skill levels of new college
graduates, might have reduced employer expectations of the more independent
research skills implied in that descriptor.

DISCUSSION

Based on the survey data, the College's Professional Readiness Program staff will
be developing relevant and effective preparation in the area of business research
practices. The results seem to lead us toward action in four areas:

    1. Frame instruction in terms of the information tasks that will be common for
new employees. One of our most interesting findings was that employers perceived
new graduates as consistently but only slightly less qualified than expected. Given
the concerns reported in previous research, this was gratifying, but probably says
more about the survey methodology than about students' preparation. Because
we had taken steps to describe elements of IL with a generic but typical business
vocabulary, we believe that employers were responding in terms of generic but
recognizable tasks. Just as workers' skills cannot be easily differentiated from
the overall information experience, employers' evaluation of information skills
cannot be easily differentiated from overall performance of a task.

    2. Combine IL with communication skills. Employers see information-­related
skills as different and perhaps more limited than the "soft" skills of critical think-
ing and communication, which might still be reported as problematic. A com-
munication skill survey is planned, and the comparison will be informative.
In the meantime, the creation of task-related skill definitions suggests that if
academic institutions are going to prepare students to participate effectively,
they cannot neglect the communicative and problem-solving context in which
information is used. As Marcum (2002) puts it, "librarians must ratchet up their
standards and expectations from literacy to sociotechnical fluency" (p. 20).

    3. Provide IL skills in a business context. A consistent point made in both
published research and conversations with professionals was that information

                                                                                                  71

use is fully embedded in a specific organizational context. This does not seem
to mean that skills are impossibly specific; we were able to develop a set of suffi-
ciently generic business tasks to create a survey instrument that was usable across
multiple industries and job titles. We nevertheless believe that students will be
better equipped to transfer skills if the terminology and task vocabulary are con-
sistently maintained across academic and workplace contexts.

    4. Continue the collaboration. Finally, the most salient conclusion is probably
the most straightforward: we must continue to work closely with the profes-
sional stakeholders who can provide contexts, terminologies, experiential learn-
ing, mentoring, and coaching. To the extent that IL develops through a process
of socialization into a discursive community, the involvement of that commu-
nity is crucial to the success of any instruction.

IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH IN IL

The Framework for IL addresses the contextualized nature of IL that we have
described here with six "frames" that are relevant to information use across
academic disciplines as well as to civic and professional contexts. Our project
suggests that research must continue to explore the complicated nature of infor-
mation use in context. As our employer perceptions demonstrate, there seems
to be no effective way to separate IL from the social skills that allow individuals
to gain that literacy within a knowledge community. Nor are there useful dis-
tinctions between the effective use of information and its effective application
in a specific context. We have demonstrated here that employers perceive IL in
terms of purposeful information use, and we expect that the same will be true
of faculty and student perceptions of their instructional and learning activities.
Further, expectations of IL vary with a trajectory of experience, maturity, and
socialization into the rhetorical practices of a community.

    For those of us who work to prepare students for non-academic futures, it is
not enough to recognize that academic tasks are different from workplace tasks,
or even to translate academic skills into a more typically professional vocabulary.
Neither addresses the more important step of preparing students to undertake
the process of joining a socially and rhetorically complex workplace community.
As with any other professional behavior, IL develops as new workers learn to pay
attention to the salient features of their environment and respond in accordance
with social and rhetorical norms.

    Some argue that "the critical ground for information literacy is the workplace
and not the education sector" (Lloyd, 2011, p. 280), but that does not imply there
is no research to be done within the academic environment. Rolf Norgaard and

between IL and writing instruction, as well as the historical and institutional bar-
riers that conspire against students' participation in the rhetorical community that
is academia. As we solve these pedagogical problems, we are poised to learn a great
deal about how individuals master threshold concepts to negotiate an information
context and successfully adopt normative practices. Students entering the university
are learning to recognize the epistemological frameworks of their new academic
community in the same way any worker learns to recognize and effectively use
information to accomplish relevant tasks within a specific context. We can under-
stand how that happens--or doesn't happen--not merely to better prepare students
for academic work, but to translate that understanding into general principles of
IL as the process of becoming literate in the ways of a knowledge-using community.

CREATING AND EXPLORING
NEW WORLDS: WEB 2.0,
INFORMATION LITERACY,
AND THE WAYS WE KNOW

      Kathleen Blake Yancey
      Florida State University

This chapter--more of a story, perhaps, than a dialogue between two disciplines
interested in writing, although informed by each--identifies the current moment
of information literacy (IL) as an ecosystem requiring new ways of researching,
including new means of determining credibility of sources. It begins by outlining
three periods in the recent history of IL as experienced by the researcher: (1) the
period when gatekeepers were available to help assure credibility of sources; (2)
the period of online access to information held in brick and mortar libraries, with
digitized information providing new ways of organizing information and thus new
ways of seeing; and (3) the most recent period located in a wide ecology of interact-
ing sources--academic; mainstream; and "alternative"--sources that include texts,
data, and people inside the library, of course, but ranging far beyond it. In such an
ecology, as we see in the information ecologies presented in both the Framework
for IL (ACRL, 2015) and Rolf Norgaard's chapter (Chapter 1, this collection), stu-
dents trace some sources and actively identify and invite others: research, in other
words, has become a variegated set of processes, including searching and confirm-
ing credibility, but including as well initiating contact with and interacting with
sources. Given this new context for research, I also consider how we can introduce
students to this new normal of researching and identify some tasks we might set
for students so that they learn how to determine what's credible and what's not--in
addition to considering how, if in the future students are not only knowledge-­
consumers but also knowledge-makers, we can support this development, too.

RESEARCH ONE: THE TRADITIONAL SCENE

In the fall of 2006, I spent the better part of a day in the Victoria and Albert
Museum (V&A) in London, my purpose there to review some sources from

Yancey

                 Figure 4.1. Victoria and Albert Museum in London.
the V&A special collection for an article I was writing (see Figure 4.1). To put
it more simply, I was conducting a kind of humanities research in a very con-
ventional way--identifying a purpose, tracing textual sources in a sanctioned
library, drafting and revising. (Research in other fields takes various forms, of
course, including field work and lab work.)

    As I learned, the V&A library is very generous with its resources: it shares
materials with anyone who can show a simple identity card. This sharing, how-
ever, comes with three very noteworthy stipulations. The first is that one can
borrow materials only when the V&A is open, and they pretty much keep bank-
er's hours five days a week, so while access to materials is possible, it is only so
within a limited number of days and hours--and this assumes one can travel to
London. Second, the materials can be used only onsite; they can be copied on
library-approved copying machines, but they cannot be checked out, even over-
night. The third is that assuming a patron can get to the V&A at the appointed
days and hours, accessing the materials requires an elaborated process. Each item
requires a specific protocol, as the V&A (2015) explains:

         In the interests of security and conservation, materials from
         Special Collections are issued and consulted near the Invigila-
78
                                                                      Creating and Exploring New Worlds

         tion Desk. A seat number will be allocated by the invigilator
         when the material ordered is ready for consultation. Readers
         are asked to sign for each item issued. Readers who find that
         works ordered are "Specials in General Stock" will be asked to
         collect them from the Invigilation Desk and consult them at
         the desks provided for the purpose.

    In other words, the materials are there, but obtaining them isn't an expeditious
exercise, and using them requires a specific setting. As suggested, this is not an
open-shelf library, where the patron might wander among the stacks and peruse the
shelves, both practices that can lead to serendipitous discoveries: here the material
in question is requested by the researcher and then retrieved by someone else. Some
serendipity could occur as the researcher works with the V&A's materials them-
selves, of course, but then that discovery could prompt another request protocol.

    Nonetheless, it's worth noting that the materials at the V&A offer an import-
ant value: they promise credibility. Of course, this library is a very specific one
with a very specific mission; it is very unlike my academic library, which includes
materials both credible (e.g., Scientific American) and incredible (e.g., The National
Enquirer). If I am in doubt about the credibility of the materials, however, the
V&A, like my FSU library, employs faculty and staff who can assist in reviewing
materials and determining their credibility. What I thus need to do in such a sce-
nario is identify and access the materials, ask for assistance if needed, and use the
materials. Moreover, given its specific mission, a library like the V&A offers print
collections that are relatively stable: their materials change with additions, but they
don't change very rapidly; their very permanence promotes a kind of confidence in
the research process. Not least, such a research process is built on a tradition that
also promotes confidence. Such a scene has supported research for several hundred
years; to say that we have re-enacted and participated in such a scene in and of
itself endows the researcher with a certain authority.

    In sum, the V&A library provides one scene of research, a scene where mate-
rials are not always easily accessed, but where the materials themselves endow a
kind of authority and whose credibility can be authenticated with the assistance
of a library specialist.

RESEARCH TWO: THE TRADITIONAL SCENE DIGITIZED

When I returned home from London, I needed to do more research, and
fortunately, the materials I needed were available in Florida State University's
Strozier Library; even more fortunately, they were available online. In other
words, because the digital resources are available 24/7, I could access them
even when the brick and mortar library was closed. In this case, assuming I

                                                                                                  79
Yancey

have access--here defined quite differently, not as physical location, but rather
as a set of factors all working together: a computing device, Internet access,
and an FSU ID--I can read articles and ebooks, often the same research mate-
rials available in the brick and mortar library, and I can do so at any time in a
24-hour day. Moreover, because the electronic materials are located in a data-
base, they come with affordances unavailable in print. For example, in accessing
an issue of College Composition and Communication (CCC) through JSTOR, a
database available through the FSU library that mimics the print resources in
the library stacks, I can read the articles online; I can save them; and I can print
them; I can export citations via email, BibTex, RefWorks, or Endnote. More
important for situating an idea or author, there is a search engine inside both
journal and complete database (e.g., CCC; JSTOR) that enables looking for
authors, topics, and key terms: I can thus trace a given idea or author through-
out a set of articles, and if the source is digitized and in the FSU library--two
big conditions, admittedly--I can access it immediately. Other journals offer
even more options. For example, someone researching the relationship between
medical doctors and patients might consult the Journal of the American Medical
Association (JAMA) and, if so, find an article published in 2005, available in
FSU's proxy for JAMA, and, again, read or download it. The reader can also
immediately link to the articles that it cites in its references since most of them
are in the database; the process of finding other sources is thus even easier than
the one described above, and by engaging in this process, the reader can begin
to create his or her own context for the reading of the article, although it's worth
noting that in terms of reading, we haven't explored the impact on a reader of
links supplied by others. In other words, there is likely a difference between
reading a text that is unmarked and reading one with links provided by some-
one else, as I suggested in reviewing a digitized version of Hill's Manual of Social
and Business Forms:

         An addition to the text is a set of links taking the reader to
         surprising places inside Hill's--in one case, to an explanation
         of letters, in another to information about resorts. In that
         sense, reading this Hill's is like reading a text with links func-
         tioning as annotations: it's a text of someone else's reading.
         Do we find the links others have planted for us an annoyance
         or an opportunity to read differently and more richly?

JAMA also provides a citation index (see Figure 4.2) showing the number of
times the article has been cited in other articles and a graph showing how often
per year, and it provides links to most of those articles as well.

80
                                                                      Creating and Exploring New Worlds

                           Figure 4.2. JAMA Citation Index.
    In this Janus-like way, JAMA provides access to both the research the arti-
cle draws on and the research to which it contributes: the article thus literally
appears not as a stand-alone piece of research, but as one contribution to a larger
set of research questions. Moreover, for 25 medical topics, JAMA includes videos
of authors discussing the research. And not least, in the FSU online library, there
is information available in independent databases, those not linked to journals,
including newspapers from around the world, unpublished dissertations, and
the like. The resource bank of the online library is thus very full.
    As useful as the online library is, however, it's not without disadvantages to
the researcher. For one, the stacks and open shelves of the FSU brick and mortar
library have been replaced by links created by others: as indicated above, those
may or may not reflect the interests of the researcher, and in any event, online
texts preclude the kind of serendipitous self-motivated browsing supported by
brick and mortar libraries with open shelves, although it's fair to note that the
online files can promote a modified electronic bread crumbing that may be a
kind of digital equivalent. But not all materials are digitized: many articles are
not, and most books, at least for the moment, are not; the resources are thus
simultaneously fuller and diminished. And for yet another concern, the life span
of electronic materials in any given library is not assured: subscriptions to e-ma-
terials can change. Print, the library owns; electronic, it rents. If a journal's price
goes up or the library's budget goes down (or both), the library may be forced to
stop the rental. For yet another, as with print, formats that have been very useful
may disappear: four years ago, JAMA offered a citation map (see Figure 4.3) for
each of its articles, a very useful graphical representation visualizing an article's
influence. That affordance is now gone.
    And for one last, the digitized materials themselves are often selectively
digitized and thus are incomplete. Including only the "important" texts, they

                                                                                                  81
Yancey

                           Figure 4.3. JAMA Citation Map
exclude materials, like advertisements, that were a part of each journal issue and
that at the least provide information about context. But such excluded materi-
als can also prompt or locate research projects: without such information, for
example, it's not only impossible to complete a project tracing advertisements
for textbooks during the advent of writing process in the 1970s and 1980s,
but likewise impossible to see how publishers translated and marketed scholars'
research back to the field, and impossible as well for any reader of the digitized
journal to develop a fuller sense of the moment's zeitgeist.

    In sum, this scene of research is both richer and poorer than the traditional
scene; it offers materials 24/7, and through its database representations, new
ways of contextualizing materials--as long as it can offer them.

A RESEARCH ECOLOGY

In terms of research, what we see in academic libraries is by definition limited
in other ways as well, principally because libraries stock publications: they are
not sites of research themselves, but rather places we go to consult research
materials, including databases, primary texts, rare books, journal runs, news-
papers, and monographs. Put another way, there's research and there's publica-
tion: research materials are available in libraries, but research itself takes place
outside them in many sites--laboratories, field sites (from the Arctic to the
neighborhood cemetery), community centers, classrooms, and so on. Histori-
cally, research has been reported in many venues, some of them the long form,
peer-reviewed journals and books characteristic of traditional library holdings,
but also in informal texts--in letters predating journals (Bazerman, 2000); in
diaries; in logs; in newspapers and magazines. Such sites of research-making
and distribution have always existed, but are now, with the affordances of the
Internet, more visible, inclusive, and interactive. It's commonplace now for
researchers to share raw data and early findings in multiple venues ranging
from scholarly websites to personal or professional blogs, personally hosted
websites, and other social media outlets. Florida State University's Rhetoric and
Composition program, for example, hosts a Digital Postcard Archive (http://
fsucardarchive.org/), and two graduate students in our program have created
the Museum of Everyday Writing (https://museumofeverydaywriting.omeka
.net/), which they personally host on Omeka, and which links to Facebook
and Twitter. Likewise, I knew about Henry Jenkins' theory of convergence
culture over a year before his book on the topic was released because I'd been
reading his blog. Of course, given these sources, a researcher needs to deter-
mine how credible the information is.

    To help students explore this issue, which the Association of College and
Research Libraries' (ACRL, 2015) threshold concept "Research as Inquiry'
articulates, I have often assigned a "map of reading and researching" task: each
student is to pose a question and trace online where the question takes him
or her. As we can see from the map composed by Liane Robertson in Figure
4.4, a question about the impact of personal genetic testing leads to a robust
ecology of sources, including academic sources like the New England Journal of
Medicine; institutional blogs like Wired Science; newspapers like the Los Angeles
Times online; and personal blogs like The Medical Quack. These resources are
not all alike nor equivalent in credibility; sorting through them is one research
task, and a very large part of that task entails determining the credibility of
both claims and evidence that are displayed. Later versions of this assignment
have asked students to research in another way: by writing to a source to obtain

                                                                                                  83

information that isn't yet published, a task I have taken up myself. When I read
about research on contextualized pedagogical practice and its role in support-
ing students in science, I emailed Steve Rissing, the researcher quoted in the
Inside Higher Ed story, and he replied, helpfully, within a day. Another option
in researching, in other words, is to contact a researcher or informant, and with
electronic communication, it's never been easier.

    In this new ecosystem, establishing credibility of sources is a larger chal-
lenge, but there are frameworks available to help. The ACRL, for example,
includes this kind of task in its threshold concept Authority Is Constructed
and Contextual. Likewise, building on the thinking about IL created by the
National Forum on Information Literacy, the Association of American Colleges
and Universities (AAC&U) has issued a definition of IL, and a rubric to match,
entirely congruent with the ACRL's approach. The AAC&U definition (2009)
is fairly straightforward: "The ability to know when there is a need for infor-
mation, to be able to identify, locate, evaluate, and effectively and responsibly
use and share that information for the problem at hand." And as operational-
ized in the AAC&U VALUE (Valid Assessment of Learning in Undergraduate

Education) scoring guides, IL includes five components or dimensions expand-
ing the definition: (1) Determine the extent of information needed; (2) Access
the needed information; (3) Evaluate the information and its sources critically;
(4) Use information effectively to accomplish a specific purpose; and (5) Access
and use information ethically and legally. Although this heuristic for the activ-
ities required in research is useful, it doesn't speak very specifically to the issue
of credibility of sources, which is always at play, and never more so than in the
current research ecology with its mix of sources and materials. Indeed, speaking
to this research ecology, the ACRL (2015) observes that students have a new
role to play in it, one involving "a greater role and responsibility in creating
new knowledge, in understanding the contours and the changing dynamics
of the world of information, and in using information, data, and scholarship
ethically."

EXPLORING CREDIBILITY

When considering the credibility of sources, researchers find four questions in
particular helpful:

   1. What sources did you find?
   2. How credible are they?
   3. How do you know?
   4. And what will you do with them?

    In thinking about credibility--which we can define as the accuracy or trust-
worthiness of a source--the key question may be "How do you know," a ques-
tion that historian Sam Wineberg (1991) can help address. Wineberg's partic-
ular interest is in how students, in both high school and college, understand
the making of history, which he locates in three practices useful in many fields.
First is corroboration: "Whenever possible, check important details against each
other before accepting them as plausible or likely" (p. 77), a standard that is very
like the philosopher Walter Fisher's (1995) "fidelity," that is, looking for conso-
nance between the new information and what we know to be accurate. Second
is sourcing: "When evaluating historical documents, look first to the source or
attribution of the document" (p. 79), a practice of consulting attributions that is
just as important for scientists studying global warming and sociologists exam-
ining police arrest records as it is for historians. Moreover, Wineberg has also
found the sequence of checking attribution important in evaluating credibility:
historians predictably read attributions before reading a text whereas students,
if they check for attributions at all, do so at the conclusion of the reading. Put
another way, historians rely on the attribution to contextualize their reading,

                                                                                                  85
Yancey

while students barely attend to it if they do attend to it at all. Third is contextu-
alization: "When trying to reconstruct historical events, pay close attention to
when they happened and where they took place" (p. 80). Here Wineberg is, in
part, emphasizing the particulars of any given case, and recommending that in
researching we attend to those, not to some preconceived idea that we brought
to the text with us.

    Equally useful is working with Wineberg's practices in the context of case
studies: using these questions together with case studies can help students (and
other researchers) learn to use the questions as a heuristic to help decide the
credibility of sources and identify which sources to use and how--tasks that the
Framework for IL addresses in two threshold concepts, Authority is Constructed
and Contextual and Searching as Strategic Exploration. Here I highlight two
case studies: one in which students compare kinds of encyclopedias and contrib-
ute to one of them, and a second focused on some thought experiments raising
epistemological questions related to credibility.

    A first case study focuses on an analysis of an encyclopedia entry and a Wiki-
pedia entry: as defined in the assignment, this comparison provides "an opportu-
nity to consider how a given term is defined in two spaces purporting to provide
information of the same quality"; the task is "to help us understand how they are
alike and different and what one might do in creating a Wikipedia entry." A sim-
ple comparison taps what we all suspect: a conventional encyclopedia, written
by experts, presents an authorized synopsis on multiple topics, whereas Wiki-
pedia shares information identified by several people, none of whom may bring
any credentialed expertise to the topic. But this comparison isn't an evaluation.
It's not that one of these is credible and one is not: each has different virtues, as
students discover. An encyclopedia may be credible, but its entries are usually
short, including very few references; it's largely a verbal text; and it could be
outdated. Wikipedia typically includes longer entries (often longer by a factor of
3) and includes links to other sources so that more exploration is easily possible,
and its entries are often timely--assuming that they are not removed. But are
the entries credible? In Wineberg's terms, can we corroborate their claims? What
do their attributions tell us?

    Often students arrive at the same conclusion as Clay Shirkey (2009) in Here
Comes Everybody:

         Because Wikipedia is a process, not a product, it replaces
         guarantees offered by institutions with probabilities supported
         by process: if enough people care enough about an article to
         read it, then enough people will care enough to improve it,
         and over time this will lead to a large enough body of good

86
                                                                      Creating and Exploring New Worlds

         enough work to begin to take both availability and quality of
         articles for granted, and to integrate Wikipedia into daily use
         by millions. (p. 140)

    This latter claim is untested, of course, and can lead to discussions about the
value, or not, of peer review: what is the relationship between a scholarly pro-
cess of peer review and a Wikipedian crowdsourcing, and why is such a ques-
tion important? Likewise, Shirkey's claim is easier to consider when someone
has experience in the process, that is, if students are asked not only to compare
Wikipedia with another like text, but also to contribute to it themselves, either
by adding to or modifying an existing entry or by beginning a new one. What
students learn is twofold, about composing, of course, and a very different
composing than they are accustomed to, but also about the making of knowl-
edge--about, for example, how a claim that seems neutral to them is deleted
as biased by one of Wikipedia's editors or about how they too have to provide
a credible, "neutral" source in order for a claim to be published on the site. In
other words, asking students to compare different kinds of encylclopedias and
to contribute to one of them helps them understand firsthand the processes of
sourcing and of establishing credibility. And in terms of applying this assign-
ment to their own research, students find that there are no easy answers to
Weinberg's questions and that one encyclopedia, whether a traditional encyclo-
pedia or Wikipedia, isn't inherently better than the next. They also learn that
in conducting their own research, it might be useful to consult both as starting
places, to corroborate them against each other, and to explore the resources
identified in each.

THOUGHT EXPERIMENTS AS CASE STUDIES

Other kinds of case studies, which I have used with students and in faculty work-
shops, raise other kinds of questions, especially about the relationship of cred-
ibility and epistemology. To introduce this issue, I call on topical issues from a
variety of fields. For example, we might consider issues raised by a movie. Several
years ago, the movie Bright Star portrayed the life of John Keats: is it an accurate
portrayal? Is it a good movie? These different questions, both related to the ACRL
(2015) threshold concept Research as Inquiry, call for different approaches. To
explore the first, we might consult Keats' poetry and his personal writings; we
might consult accounts of Keats provided by colleagues and friends; we might
consult histories of the period. To explore the second, its value as a movie, we
might view movies that have received awards, especially other biographical mov-
ies, like Amadeus and The Imitation Game. And more philosophically, we might

                                                                                                  87
Yancey

consider the relationship between accuracy and value, especially in the context
of adaptation studies, which take as their focus questions about the relationship
between a print literary text, like Pride and Prejudice, and its movie version(s). A
single movie and two related questions, as a thought experiment, pointing us in
very different directions, helps demonstrate how we know what (we think) we
know, and in Wineberg's terms, helps us consider how we might (1) corrobo-
rate; (2) authenticate in terms of attribution; and (3) employ the specifics of the
movie in the context of historical and literary records.

    A second thought experiment is less canonical: it focuses on the website
"Patients like Me" (http://www.patientslikeme.com/). Late in the 1990s, James
Heywood's brother Stephen was diagnosed with ALS (Lou Gehrig's disease);
frustrated by his inability to be helpful, Heywood collaborated with two friends
to create the site, a

         free online community for people with life-changing dis-
         eases, including ALS, Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's disease,
         HIV/AIDS, Mood Disorders, Fibromyalgia and orphan
         diseases (such as Devic's Neuromyelitis Optica, Progressive
         Supranuclear Palsy and Multiple System Atrophy). Our mis-
         sion is to improve the lives of patients through new knowl-
         edge derived from their shared real-world experiences and
         outcomes. To do so, we give our members easy-to-use, clini-
         cally validated outcome management tools so they can share
         all of their disease-related medical information. Our website
         is also designed to foster social interaction for patients to
         share personal experiences and provide one another with
         support. The result is a patient-centered platform that
         improves medical care and accelerates the research process by
         measuring the value of treatments and interventions in the
         real world. (2015)

    In other words, this is a site that for the first time in history compiles patients'
accounting of their own diseases; that's impressive. But is the information on it
credible? Again, ACRL threshold concepts are useful here, especially Authority
Is Constructed and Contextual and Searching as Strategic Exploration. Speaking
to the first threshold concept, for instance, one ALS patient claims to have had
ALS for 21 years: given the disease's typical trajectory--most patients die within
five years--he is a very unusual person. Here, we might consider the value of
self-reported data, both on this site and in other, more conventional studies, like
those that informed early accounts of composing processes. In addition, we
might consider what we learn and how credible the aggregated information

88
                                                                      Creating and Exploring New Worlds

based on such data is. PatientsLikeMe offers considerable data; each disease
community page, for example, includes statistics speaking to how many mem-
bers of the site have the disease, how recently profiles have been updated, and
how many new patients with the disease have joined, as well as a bar graph show-
ing the age range of patients and a pie chart showing the percentage of patients
reporting gender. Patients themselves provide considerable information, includ-
ing treatment types and their efficacy, which is then compiled into treatment
reports with treatment descriptions and efficacies, numbers of patients who use
the treatment and for what purpose, reported side effects of use and so on. Some
think that the information is credible: as Heywood (2009) explains, it's shared
with pharmaceutical companies (which is how the site is financially viable): "We
are a privately funded company that aggregates our members' health informa-
tion to do comparative analysis and we sell that information to partners within
the industry (e.g., pharmaceutical, insurance companies, medical device compa-
nies, etc.)" (p. 1). But do we find this information credible? In Wineberg's terms,
how might we corroborate these data?

    Not least is the thought experiment regarding global warming, an exercise
that has changed over time. In the 1990s, the question was whether the planet
was experiencing the beginnings of global warming and how we would assess
that. Today, the question has shifted to how quickly global warming is affecting
the earth. Is a massive flood just experienced in India a sign of or an index to
global warming? In the millions of years of earth-time, haven't we seen global
warming before? What are the effects of global warming, and what do they
mean for public policy? And a related question that seems to be asked daily
in all parts of the world: is our current weather normal? What is normal, and
normal for what period of time--the last 10, 100, 1,000, or million years?
What is current--this hour, this day, this week, this month? What is weather
and how is it related to climate? Would we create our own records, consult back
issues of The Farmer's Almanac, examine diaries from centuries ago, log onto the
records available on weather.com or accuweather or wunderground, or would
we prefer data accumulated by the U.S. government? Would we include some
mix of these data? Many questions like these are taken up by citizen scientists
who are guided by rudimentary scientific protocols, as they have historically:
Charles Darwin, for example, relied on 19th century homemakers in the U.S.
to collect data for him. More generally, however, examining such protocols pro-
vides another window into how credibility is established, a window that seems
increasingly wide given the availability of raw data and the role of interested
laypeople in gathering them. Thus, Wineberg's questions are helpful here as
well, but they also prompt new ways of thinking, too. Given that much of his-
tory isn't recorded, corroboration will probably need to include multiple kinds

                                                                                                  89
Yancey

of materials, person-made and nature-recorded. What signs in nature might
help us--rings on trees, for example? Given that attribution is important, what
is the relative value to this project of a 17th century diary, a weather.com report,
and U.S. government data? And given Wineberg's interest in specifics, what are
the signs of warming that we may have missed? What are signs that we may
have mis-interpreted?

CONCLUSION

As we see through the concept of a research ecosystem, establishing credibility
is increasingly difficult. In a very short period of time--less than the lifetime
of many current academics--we have gone from a formalized IL system with
human interpreters to an ecology constituted of the valuable and the incredi-
ble--facts, data, personal narrative, rumors, information, and misinformation,
all inhabiting the same sphere, each info bit circulating as though it carried the
same value as all the others, each info bit connected to other info bits and also
disconnected from others in a seemingly random way. The good news, of course,
is that more information is available: the more challenging, that we are all called
on to make more sense of that information, to decide what's credible, how it's
credible, and how we know that, a task that--given the thought experiments
closing this chapter--is new not only for students, but for most of us.

    One way to begin taking up this challenge is through the use of case studies,
which raise very different kinds of questions and which are put into dialogue
with Sam Wineberg's (1991) schema for establishing credibility. Testing claims
and evidence--that is, establishing credibility--isn't easy, but with the lenses of
corroboration, attribution, and specifics, it is more likely.

NOTE

1. As explained by AAC&U, the VALUE project is "a campus-based assessment initia-
     tive sponsored by AAC&U as part of its LEAP initiative. VALUE provides needed
     tools to assess students' own authentic work, produced across their diverse learning
     pathways and institutions, to determine whether and how well they are progressing
     toward graduation-level achievement in learning outcomes that both employers and
     faculty consider essential. VALUE builds on a philosophy of learning assessment
     that privileges multiple expert judgments and shared understanding of the quality
     of student work through the curriculum, cocurriculum, and beyond over reliance
     on standardized tests administered to samples of students disconnected from an
     intentional course of study."

INFORMATION LITERACY IN
DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS:
CONSTRUCT MEDIATION,
CONSTRUCT MODELING, AND
VALIDATION PROCESSES

Information literacy (IL) is a 21st century skill most often conceptualized and
measured through 20th century assessment practices. Designed by the Associ-
ation of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) in 1999 and approved by its
board in 2000, the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Edu-
cation (IL Standards) is a fin de siècle statement. A construct caught between the
print-based world of the 20th century and the digitally based networks of the
21st, IL is framed as a skill that, once mastered, will allow those who possess it
to stem the tide of the "uncertain quality and expanding quantity of informa-
tion" that will surely "pose large challenges for society" (ACRL, 2000, p. 2).
Those who have this skill will be able to locate, evaluate, and use information
effectively to sort through the "abundance of information" that "will not in itself
create a more informed citizenry" (p. 2). With the advent of Web 2.0 over the
intervening 13 years--its social media, virtual communities, blogs, wikis, pod-
casts, folksonomies, and mashups--the IL Standards look as if they had been
cast by Gutenberg.

    In response, in 2013 the ACRL chartered a task force to begin the process
of updating the IL Standards. Noting the limits of the "competency and skill-
based approach," the revision promises a "conceptual approach" that provides
not just a detailed listing of skills but, rather, "a set of archetypal of core
abilities that will serve students well in a continuously changing informa-
tion environment" (Jacobson & Gibson, 2013, p. 1). The new Framework for

Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework for IL) (ACRL, 2015)
advances six threshold concepts, transformative perspectives discussed by
Barry Maid and Barbara J. D'Angelo (Chapter 2, this collection). Defined
as "a spectrum of abilities, practices, and habits of mind that extends and
deepens learning through engagement with the information ecosystem" (p.
1), IL is advanced as these threshold concepts are advanced: Authority Is
Constructed and Contextual; information is created through intentional acts;
information has value; research is a process of inquiry; scholarship is conver-
sational; and searching is strategic. Key to the Framework for IL in its present
form is the recognition that IL is a contextualized, complex experience in
which the cognitive, affective, and social dimensions of the searcher have
distinct roles.

    The emphasis on underlying cognitive abilities as they are identified, stud-
ied, and used in digital environments is the subject of this chapter. To identify
important conceptual and validation practices associated with the construct of
IL, in this chapter we focus on our experience with iSkillsTM, a digitally based
assessment that uses real-time, scenario-based tasks to measure a defined IL
construct.

iSkills: INFORMATION LITERACY IN
A DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT

In 2002, Educational Testing Service (ETS) recognized that digital environ-
ments made public since the early 1990s presented a unique opportunity for test
delivery (ETS, 2002). Instead of simply digitizing the bubble and booklet test
format that had been used since its charter in 1947, ETS researchers recognized
that emerging information and communication technologies held the potential
for new forms of assessment. In digital environments, items could be presented
that required a series of actions--not simply the identification of a single cor-
rect answer. If a student were to be examined on ability to access information,
that student could be required to enact a process of decision-making within
rhetorical contexts sensitive to aim, genre, and audience. The student could be
placed in a context--as an employee, for instance, seated before a computer at a
fictitious company named Restoration Demolition in which a request had been
made from a customer to find stained glass panels in good condition. Faced
with a choice of databases from which information may be drawn, increasingly
precise searches might yield exactly those results needed by the customer (Fig-
ure 5.1).Performing a simulation of information retrieval within databases, the
candidate demonstrates search capability and then selects information to meet
the customer request.

    In a print-based environment, the candidate would select a single correct
answer from a list; in this digital environment, the candidate selects the appro-
priate database from a list of alternatives, types search terms, reviews results
and may try an alternative search strategy, and then selects the responses from
the results that answers the customer's query--while the machine records data-
base selection, search terms, the number and characteristics of the potentially
multiple searches conducted, and the relevance and appropriateness of reviewed
and selected results. Blending process and product, the resulting system, iSkills,
represents a type of next-generation assessment in which real-life applications
track the learning process as it occurs in the digital environments (Tucker, 2009)
that exist within the ecologies of interacting information sources identified by
Kathleen Blake Yancey (Chapter 4, this collection). From the design of tasks to
the delivery of results, digital environments provide a new way of thinking about
large-scale assessment programs.

    For those responsible for the selection of assessment instruments in specific
institutional sites, answers to three questions will be helpful when assessment of
IL occurs in digital environments:

                                                                                                  95
Katz and Elliot

    1. Is the construct of IL itself mediated by the digital environments in
         which it is assessed?

    2. How might the construct of IL be modeled in digital assessment
         environments?

    3. What do present theories of validation tell us about how institutional
         assessments might be used to help students become more information
         literate?

CONSTRUCT MEDIATION IN DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS

For purpose of exposition, it is useful to begin by returning to the 1955 defini-
tion of a construct as proposed by the psychometrician and philosopher team
of Lee J. Cronbach and Paul E. Meehl (1955): "A construct is some postu-
lated attribute of people, assumed to be reflected in test performance" (p. 283).
Broadly speaking, all constructs are mediated--that is, following the Medieval
Latin origin of the word, the construct is divided in the middle, with part postu-
lated (or targeted) and part performed (and measured). Viewed in this fashion,
all environments mediate constructs, and the extent of the mediation depends
on standpoint. To use a well-known example, writing mediates knowledge, as
Walter Ong (1982) famously demonstrated in his study of orality and literacy.
Writing restructures consciousness, he boldly proposed, and backed it up by
calling to mind distinctions between orally based thought and literacy-based
practices: Oral cultures are empathetic, he claimed, while writing establishes
objectivity. A list of such dualisms, his psychodynamics of orality illustrate that
all constructs exist in domains that are mediated by--and reflected in--per-
formance. For Ong, the mediation of language by writing was of paramount
importance; for his critics (Scribner & Cole, 1981), the generalized cognitive
effects of the technology of literacy could not be substantiated.

    By the mid-1990s, it was becoming clear that the digital world--a new envi-
ronment--was emerging as the latest in a series of contextual shifts that had
begun 5,300 years ago with the writing on the clay tablets of Uruk (Woods,
2010). Whether the technology was the visible language created by stylus or
pixel, all mediation, Jay David Bolter and Richard Grusin (1996) claimed, is
remediation (p. 346). As a theory of media, remediation is a concept that allows
us to investigate the promise of digital representation: the way digital envi-
ronments import and refashion other media into digital space; the ways these
environments suggest reality itself with image, sound, and haptic technology;
and the ways they allow participants to reform reality as they synchronously
participate in events. So powerful are these digital environments today that it
is difficult to imagine a context in which a user could avoid mediation when

engaging the IL construct. The question thus becomes one of agency: How is
the IL construct mediated?

    Here Herbert A. Simon's parable of the ant is useful. In The Sciences of the
Artificial (1996), Simon offered the following narrative and its interpretation:

         We watch an ant make his laborious way across a wind- and
         wave-molded beach. He moves ahead, angles to the right to
         ease his climb up a steep dune, detours around a pebble,
         stops for a moment to exchange information with a com-
         patriot. Thus he makes his weaving, halting way back to his
         home. (p. 51)

    In coming to terms with the journey of the ant, we wonder at the irregular,
complex series of traced and retraced steps and realize that the wandering is due
to the encountered obstacles of pebble and path. Simon offers an hypothesis:
"An ant, viewed as a behaving system, is quite simple. The apparent complexity
of its behavior over time is largely a reflection of the complexity of the environ-
ment in which it finds itself " (p. 52).

    In the case at hand, let's imagine that Simon's ant parable is about the IL
construct and how it reveals itself through behavior. Let's narrow the construct
to the variable of information access as the employee of Restoration Demolition
engages it. Following Simon, the seeming elementalist (bubble and booklet) or
complex (constructed response) behaviors comes not from different constructs
but from the complexity of the environments in which the construct is assessed.
As such, print and digitally based samples of the construct used in a given assess-
ment reflect a different beach and therefore lead to different behavior. Effec-
tively, each measures a different construct--the measured construct requiring,
let's say, its own smaller circle of behavior--although the constructs may cer-
tainly be related, if only because they derive from the same underlying domain.

    So, to answer the first question--is the construct of IL mediated in digital
assessment environments?--we offer the following answer: Measured constructs
are indeed mediated by the way the assessment designers sample the construct.
As such, depending on how the assessment designers view the digital scene of
action, there may be differences in what is being measured.

CONSTRUCT MODELING IN DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS

The concept of mediation is extremely helpful in allowing us to reflect on the
impact of digital environments on constructs. However, that concept alone is
insufficient if we are to examine assessment of learning in digital environments.
Required is an additional concept: modeling.

                                                                                                  97

    Susan E. Embretson (1983) recognized that the impact of the informa-
tion processing perspective described by Simon led to a shift from "explaining
antecedent/consequent relationships to explaining performance from the sys-
tems and subsystems of underlying processes." "As a paradigm shift," she contin-
ued, "the information-processing view entails changes not only in the questions
that are asked but also in the type of data that are deemed relevant" (p. 179).
Because construct modeling was, in fact, the equivalent of theory building,
Embretson proposed that a sound construct model must account for individual
performance, allow for comparison of alterative models, yield quantification of
the constructs in the model, and provide information about individual differ-
ences in performance. In the study of writing--a field familiar to readers of this
volume--the most significant modeling work has been that of John R. Hayes
(2012) who has been modeling the writing construct for over three decades
(Hayes & Flower, 1980). Delineation of cognitive processes--writer's control of
task, writing processes, composition environment, and resource level--has trans-
formed our concept of writing. Because of the work of Hayes and his colleagues,
we now know that writing is not a series of mechanically executed displays of
knowledge of conventions but, rather, a complex socio-cognitive process.

    While the concept of mediation is one of scene (where IL occurs), the con-
cept of modeling is one of agency (how the construct is modeled). While the
digital environment of iSkills involves pebbles on a new beach, the differences in
performance we see are due to differences in the way the construct is sampled by
iSkills. Ultimately, the targeted construct--information access, for example--is
nevertheless identical to those for print communication, inasmuch as the digital
and print assessments both intend to assess IL. Even if the assessment-makers'
intentions are to assess IL, differences in performance are artifacts of the assess-
ment environment and may result in different measured constructs.

    Here is the key: the assessment environment of iSkills introduces nontrivial
performance differences within the constructed-response task (Bennett, 1993).
Knowing how to avoid pebbles and navigate the paths is essential to the perfor-
mance of the student and, in turn, to an institution's assessment of that candi-
date's level of IL. Just because two assessments are labeled "information literacy"
by their respective developers does not mean that the mediated construct of IL
(the measured construct) is the same--and, thus, may be modeled differently.

    Two examples are in order to bring this theoretical discussion into their prac-
tical application.

    Comparison of two tests--the print-based Standardized Assessment of
Information Literacy Skills (SAILS) test (O'Connor, Radcliff & Gedeon, 2002)
and the digitally based iSkills (Katz, 2007b)--demonstrates the distinction
between construct representation in print and digital environments. (Although

98
                                                           Information Literacy in Digital Environments

SAILS is delivered now exclusively online, the test maintains similar organiza-
tion and formatting as when it was delivered on paper.) Based on a strategy of
identifying the correct answer, a SAILS item asks the candidate, for instance, to
identify the best source of information about an event that took place two days
ago by asking the candidate to fill in the bubble next to the term "newspaper."
In identifying the answer, the candidate internalizes a correct response by an
analytic process of exclusion of incorrect answers. The response, distanced and
non-situated, is executed by a single action of identification. In contrast, in the
digital environment of iSkills the student is examined on ability to access infor-
mation experiences, both in a realistically simulated context and in a robust
constructed response environment. The task begins with just a description of
the customer need and an empty search screen. As the student selects data-
bases, keystrokes search terms, and reviews results over potentially multiple
search-and-review cycles, that student engages one aspect of the IL construct in
continuous process of mediation (the original approach) and re-mediation (the
original approach restructured by the constructed response task). Immersed,
the student adopts the persona of an employee of Restoration Demolition (Fig-
ure 5.1), a digitally created reality.

    In essence, the IL experience is transformed by that created environment.
Both the SAILS item and the iSkills constructed response task tap the IL vari-
able of information access but in distinctly different ways. Indeed, the distinc-
tion between print and digital environments is also carried into the function of
test scoring: SAILS allows only one correct answer; iSkills yields a competency
score based on levels of ability encompassing both efficacy of process and correct
answer identification.

    Contrast of two assessments--the print-based IL assessment at New Jer-
sey Institute of Technology (NJIT, 2012; Scharf, Elliot, Huey, Briller & Joshi,
2007) and iSkills (Katz, 2007b)--demonstrates the distinction between con-
struct assessment in print and digital environments. In 2005, NJIT researchers
conducted a study of the relationship between a model of writing informed by
Hayes and a model of IL informed by ACRL, as both constructs were repre-
sented in a sample of 100 portfolios of senior undergraduate students enrolled
in humanities courses. Similar to the curricular project reported by Beth Bensen,
Hong Wu, Denise Woetzel, and Ghazala Hashmi (Chapter 19, this collection),
the research was the result of collaboration between English faculty and librar-
ians. The overall score on the writing model correlated with the overall score
on the IL model at 0.50 (p < 0.01), evidence that the two models were related.
Based on this print-based system of assessment, NJIT and ETS researchers then
collaborated to investigate the relationship between holistic portfolio scores
(designed to capture both writing and IL skills) and iSkills scores of students

                                                                                                  99

enrolled in humanities courses (Katz, Elliot, et al., 2008). After controlling for
students' overall ability as measured by SAT scores, analysis revealed near zero
correlations between the portfolio scores and iSkills scores of first-year students
as well as upper-division students. At the time of the study, we concluded that
the constructs were related yet distinct. In the print-based environment of the
portfolios, students had been asked to read novels, search databases for peer-­
reviewed articles, and integrate those articles to develop various interpretations
of elements within the novels. One of the iSkills digitally based constructed
response tasks had asked students to compare advertisements from competing
vendors' websites by summarizing information into a table, or students had been
asked to present results from a sporting event into a spreadsheet to clarify stand-
ings and decide the need for playoffs. From task to scoring, the two assessments
could not have been more different. Although the target construct domain of IL
was the same, it was mediated by the respective assessments, resulting in differ-
ent measured constructs.

    Based on these two studies, our answer to the second question--how is the
construct of IL modeled in digital assessment environments?--is as follows:
While identification of the construct of IL, viewed as a system of behavior, can
be made in straightforward terms, the observed complexity of the behavior of
students as they perform in print and digital environments is a reflection of the
complexity of the environment in the assessment. While the core variables--
those postulated attributes of Cronbach and Meehl--exist in the larger domain,
their representation in the digital environment of the measured construct of
assessment systems such as iSkills is unique. The extent to which the construct
is digitally mediated depends on the extent to which the assessment leverages,
in Bolter and Grusin's terms, the delivery of other media, realistic simulation,
and participation in that created reality. And, while the target construct (the
intended construct domain) is shared among environments, in digitally medi-
ated environments there may indeed be differences in exactly what is being mea-
sured, as the NJIT study demonstrated.

    While that somewhat long-winded answer is conceptually useful, institu-
tional assessment staff and their instructional colleagues who are deciding on
how to assess IL must consider practical strategies of providing a clearer picture
of the underlying construct and its representation in the test at hand. Through
validation--the process of gathering evidence for the interpretation and use of
an assessment--institutions can begin to make such evaluations.

    As we will now show, such evaluations are as nuanced as is the representation
of the construct in unique forms of assessment. Through validation, assessment
stakeholders can make important decisions leading to claims about the IL of
their students. We turn now to present theories of validation and how they can

support institutional assessment efforts to help students become more informa-
tion literate.
CONSTRUCT VALIDATION IN DIGITAL ENVIRONMENTS
Michael T. Kane (2013) proposed an Interpretation/Use Argument (IUA) as the
most current form of validation. In presenting his case for an evidentiary sys-
tem of gathering validity evidence, he treated the concept of construct validity
in some detail. Tracing the idea of construct representation offered by Cron-
bach and Meehl (1955), Kane identifies three legacies of their model: test-score
interpretations cannot be taken as self-evident; validation is a process that is
dependent upon claims made in a defined interpretative framework; and critical
inquiry is the appropriate result of validation.

    Application of Kane's concepts of representation and validation to the study
of IL in digital environments is shown in Figure 5.2.

                                                                                                 101

    The large circle represents the construct domain--the postulated attribute
of developed knowledge, intended to be reflected in test performance--of
IL. This circle--the targeted construct--represents the full scope of IL: the
not-directly observable knowledge and skills in a student's mind that drive
observable performance on any IL-related task, whether real-world activities
or assessment tasks. Here we find the work of all who have attempted to define
this full construct of IL. Within this circle exists the initial concept of IL
found in the IL Standards, as well as the Framework for IL. Here, too, stand
particular institutional interpretations of IL, such as the one established at
NJIT, with its emphasis on traits scored in portfolio assessments: citation;
evidence of independent research; appropriateness; and integration (Scharf et
al., 2007). In the large circle we also find all forms of print and digital assess-
ment--those that have been examined, those that are emerging, and those that
can be imagined. Put another way, all the concepts of IL offered in this book
fit in the large circle.

    The smaller circle represents a single sample of the IL construct as it is
reflected in a digital environment. That is, the smaller circle represents the
measured construct--those knowledge and skill elements of the range of IL
measureable by a digitally based assessment. Note that the smaller circle is
drawn from the larger domain; although we would like the measured con-
struct to be a perfect subset, the reality is that the assessed construct might
also include knowledge and skills not described in the larger domain. In the
case of iSkills, the construct sample includes the five variables of IL that drive
the test: access, summarize, and integrate information from a variety of digital
sources; define an information problem or formulate a research statement;
communicate information to a particular audience or in a different medium;
create, generate, or adapt information to express and support a point; and
evaluate the usefulness and sufficiency of information for a specific purpose
(adapted from ETS, 2002).

    The host institution represents the specific site in which the assessment takes
place. It is there that the construct takes meaning for users of the assessment. As
we will demonstrate, this context shifts the validity framework from that of the
assessment designer to that of the assessment user.

    Institutional researchers who want to measure and guide improvement of
students' IL skills should create their own IUAs that will guide decisions about
sampling plans, use of scores, and needed curricular changes. However, because
the use of scores for a system such as iSkills--or any test, for that matter--is
not simply an up or down vote regarding validity, Kane (2013) offers a process
of validation attentive to sources of evidence that guide interpretation and score
use. We have illustrated these five sources on the right of Figure 5.2:

102
                                                           Information Literacy in Digital Environments

   1. Scoring inferences take us from the observed performances on a test to an
       observed score. These inferences include evidence about the appropriate-
       ness of the scoring criteria and the principles for combining scores. These
       inferences provide evidence that test scores reflect test performance. This
       inference might not be as obvious as it might initially seem, as we illus-
       trate below.

   2. Generalization inferences take us from the observed sample of perfor-
       mances (as reflected in the test score) to claims about expected perfor-
       mance in the construct sample (e.g., that the test score reflects expected
       performance not only on the current digital IL assessment tasks, but on
       similar digital IL assessment tasks).

   3. Extrapolation inferences extend the interpretation into the full construct
       domain, and are likely among the most common assumption made about
       test scores--that they reflect actual, real-world ability in the domain of
       interest.

   4. Consequence inferences extend the interpretation into the larger assessment
       environment, thereby strengthening the IUA. (Of course, unintended
       consequences that threaten validity should be considered and, when pos-
       sible, avoided.)

   5. Theory-based inferences extend the interpretation even further, into
       hypothesized relationships between the construct domain and other areas
       of interest.

    Kane proposed these five categories of evidence as a way to validate the inter-
pretation and use of test scores. We propose that instructors and administrators
may use these categories to design a program of research that will yield informa-
tion about the IL abilities of their students. As we show in the following examples,
the extension is not hard to make.

    Scoring inferences conceptually refer to the idea that test scores reflect stu-
dents' performance on the test. Although, traditionally, evidence for this infer-
ence includes technical issues such as scoring procedures, in an accreditation
context a key factor is motivation: Are students trying their best on an assess-
ment that might have no direct consequences for them? And, if they are not,
then how meaningful are the scores themselves? Because more motivated stu-
dents perform better on such tests (Liu, Bridgeman & Adler, 2012), one type
of evidence for sufficient motivation is to investigate the reception of a test by
students. Table 5.1 presents a feedback survey (N = 1823) gathered by ETS
during early field trials of iSkills. As the responses indicate, the students gave
the test their best effort, found it innovative and challenging, and realized that
success required both technical and critical thinking skills. The software--the

                                                                                                 103

digital environment--nevertheless presented problems that may have resulted in
interference with construct measurement. Using such information allows a more
complete representation of the meaning of the scores themselves.

    Evidence for generalization inferences would include information about stu-
dent performance on iSkills in relation to the level of test performance expected
to be considered "information literate." A large scale study (N = 1,442) of 14
tasks covering the five variables in Figure 5.2 tells us a good deal about student
performance on iSkills.

    Figure 5.3 shows the distribution of scores from 1,442 college students and
high school seniors. The mean score on this sample was 260, with a standard

deviation of 72; scores were approximately normally distributed across the pos-
sible score range of 0-500. Approximately 50% of students achieved a level
of foundational ICT literacy expected of entering college freshmen. (See Tan-
nenbaum & Katz, 2008, for details on the definition and establishment of the
foundational level.) Generalization inferences are supported because the distri-
bution of scores is consistent with what is expected on the distribution of IL.
While many librarians would not be surprised at this number, that only half
the students "passed" the exam suggests that the so-called digital natives are
not uniformly proficient at the effective use of technology (see Katz, 2007a, for
more descriptions of strengths and weaknesses of these test takers). At the same
time, this percentage is higher than what was observed in previous research (e.g.,
27-40% on earlier versions of the assessment; Tannenbaum & Katz, 2008).
While we cannot definitively attribute a cause of this rise in passing rates among
iSkills test takers, we would hope that the increase is due to increased attention
to IL and ICT literacy skills by accreditation agencies as well as by colleges and
universities who place these skills in the general education curriculum, such as
the work of Alison S. Gregory and Betty L. McCall (Chapter 18, this collection)
and Lori Baker and Pam Gladis (Chapter 16, this collection).

    However, generalization inferences need not rely on large-scale sampling plans
or inferential statistics alone, as a study of 88 undergraduates who responded

                                                                                                 105

to iSkills assessment tasks and to more open-ended "naturalistic" tasks revealed
(Snow & Katz, 2009). In that study, analysis of student interviews revealed
the response process used to answer both standardized tests and locally devel-
oped classroom assignments. In learning more about student response process,
instructors can design a curriculum that will allow success on both test types.

    Extrapolation inferences would include observations of relationships between
performance on iSkills and the performances in a related domain. As noted
above, the NJIT portfolio study (Scharf et al., 2007) documented the rela-
tionship between writing scores and IL scores. However, the writing scores
correlated more strongly with curriculum-related scores (current course grade
and overall GPA) than did the IL portfolio scores. The extrapolation inference
from these criterion measures allowed instructors to realize that IL was not yet
fully integrated into the curriculum and to design a way for librarians to help
increase the intensity of coursework in that area. A related study (Katz, Haras
& Blaszczynski, 2010) found that iSkills predicted grades in a business writing
course, demonstrating the type of connection between IL and business skills
explored by Dale Cyphert and Stanley P. Lyle (Chapter 3, this collection). Thus,
extrapolation inferences become a significant part of the validation process as
IL becomes an enabling construct suggesting across-the-curriculum expansion.

    Stemming from the use of iSkills at NJIT and the impact of the assessment
on the institution and the assessment itself, identification of consequential infer-
ences strengthen the IUA (American Educational Research Association, Ameri-
can Psychological Association & National Council on Measurement in Educa-
tion, 2014; Haertel, 2013). For NJIT, our studies contrasting the IL construct as
measured through print (Scharf et al., 2007) and as measured through a digital
environment (Katz, Elliot, et al., 2008) revealed shortcomings in the institu-
tions' view of the IL construct. Accordingly, the iSkills assessment was made
part of the NJIT suite of assessments, a decision that strongly reinforced an
information-literacy-across-the-curriculum framework that librarians had been
building since 2009. This integration had two consequences: digitally based IL
became part of the core curriculum for student learning adopted at NJIT; and
iSkills served as a key assessment component of the institution's 2012 success-
ful re-accreditation by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education
(NJIT, 2012). To bolster student motivation on assessments, the institution is
now examining how Certificates of Achievement--awards for predefined per-
formance levels on iSkills--might provide additional motivation for students to
try their best. Because enhancing motivation strengthens the validity argument
(Liu et al., 2012), case studies from institutions such as NJIT transformed the
environment of the assessment itself at ETS and led to certificates awarded for

    Theory-based inferences are also of great importance to instructors and
administrators as they help make explicit the connection between the construct
domain and strategies for curricular change. In the case at hand, a theory of
IL postulates the underlying framework that drove Simon's little ant, as well
as our students, in certain ways when encountering, respectively, pebbles and
constructed response tasks.

    An example drives home the importance of theory-building. To investigate
the nature of IL, as measured by iSkills, ETS researchers (Katz, Attali & Rijmen,
2008) used factor analysis to identify patterns in a set of items and establish
which combinations of items tend to be highly correlated. In the case of iSkills,
there were two primary ideal models to consider. First, a seven-factor model
arranged the items into the groups corresponding to postulated IL subskills
(define, access, evaluate, manage, integrate, create, and communicate; see Katz,
2007b). The iSkills assessment was originally designed with these seven skills,
with each task (and the items within a task) corresponding to one of the skills.
This model postulates that a student could do well on, say, finding information
(access) tasks but do poorly on tasks that require adapting materials to an audi-
ence (communicate). Second, the one-factor model took the view that all of the
items in the iSkills assessment together measure a single, integrated construct of
IL: Students are strong or weak at IL generally, with all of the items on the test
being highly correlated (e.g., high performance on one type of item implies high
performance on all types of items). Both exploratory and confirmatory factor
analyses suggest that IL, as measured by iSkills, consists of a single factor (Katz,
Attali, et al., 2008). That is, based on data from a sample of more than 600 test
takers, exploratory factor analyses suggested that the entire set of iSkills tasks
measure a single, integrated construct: students might have greater or lesser IL,
but there was no evidence that the seven IL skill areas were distinct from one
another. Similarly, in confirmatory factor analyses, the one-factor ideal model fit
the data much better than did the seven-factor ideal model.

    What does this research mean for instruction? Interpretatively, it appears
that IL is an integrated skill: improving one's IL is a matter of holistic, com-
prehensive instruction, rather than piecemeal training on component skills.
IL appears to be a truly significant threshold concept (Towsend, Brunetti
& Hofer, 2011). Such an integrated outlook on IL might reflect either a stron-
ger, more sophisticated view of information generally or a weaker, simplistic
view. Of course, instruction cannot ignore the various activities that make up
IL skill, as outlined in such documents as the Framework for IL or the particular
ways that NJIT humanities instructors teach and assess the construct. However,
focusing on those foundational skills alone might not be the quickest (or best)
path to IL. Instead, a balanced approach that points out the usefulness of more

                                                                                                 107

sophisticated attitudes toward IL might help students recognize the value in,
say, trying to figure out alternative descriptors for information (which, in turn,
should lead to better search results).

    Evidence that IL, as measured by iSkills, is a unified construct impacts how
that assessment should be administered. Institutional researchers should expli-
cate theory-based inferences about IL that postulate characteristics of students
and their experiences that lead to stronger or weaker IL. Are students who com-
plete a particular set of courses, compared with those that do not, more informa-
tion literate? Are transfer students entering with weaker IL skills, leading them
to struggle in programs compared with students who, from freshmen year, ben-
efit from the university's core curriculum in IL? Which majors tend to have the
most information literate students, and is that a function of students who tend
to go into that major or a function of the courses in that major? These are just
examples of theory-based inferences that could be investigated using an appro-
priate sampling plan in the administration of IL assessments such as iSkills. They
directly tie assessment results to the institutional improvement plans.

    Returning to Figure 5.2, we note that the arrows indicate that the interpre-
tation/use argument, and associated evidence, should be used by institutional
instructors and administrators to help them reconsider and redefine, as needed,
the construct domain itself and the elements of it that are most relevant to their
admitted students. Without that feedback loop, the gathered information will
only result in reports completed and papers published; with it, stakeholders can
work to ensure that the results of the assessment are used to improve learning.

    And so we conclude by answering our third question: What do present the-
ories of validation tell us about how institutional assessments might be used to
help students become more information literate? Present theories such as IUA
reveal the vital importance of a carefully planned program of research, based at
the institution, when complex constructs are under examination. In the field of
writing studies, such calls for contextualization have been well developed and
may serve as basis for IL research (Condon, 2013; Huot, 1996; White, Elliot &
Peckham, 2015). In similar fashion, each of the sources of evidence identified
by Kane suggests distinct programs of research focusing on areas of validation.
Research in these areas provides the level of detail necessary to identify ways to
help students improve their IL performance.

    Nevertheless, it is an error to conclude with triumphalism because so very
much remains to be done. Valuable as it is, the IUA perspective is that of an
assessment designer, not an assessment user. For those stakeholders at the host
institution shown in Figure 5.2, for example, motivation is of enormous impor-
tance. While the assessment designer will justifiably be concerned with technical
issues such as scoring procedures, making sure that students are willing to engage

the construct sample of iSkills is of paramount importance. Indeed, cultivat-
ing student motivation is one aspect of the assessment over which institutional
stakeholders have great influence. As Mariëlle Leijten, Luuk Van Waes, Karen
Schriver, and John R. Hayes (2014) have observed of the writing model, how-
ever, educators have not adequately learned how to combine motivation with
cognitive processes in our construct models in both academic and workplace
communication settings. If we follow the recommendations of the National
Research Council (2012) and attend to the broad spectrum of cognitive, intrap-
ersonal, and interpersonal domains--as the Framework for IL has proposed in its
emphasis on cognitive, affective, and social dimensions--we come to realize that
we must continue to broaden our investigation of the IL construct mediation
and its domain. And, in doing so, we must also continue to conceptualize the
IUA perspective in terms of all those who will be influenced by its use: advisory
boards, administration, faculty and instructional staff, parents, students, and
the public. Depending on audience, the IUA for an assessment may have to be
refashioned if it is to have meaning. When perspective is added, we realize that
we are only just beginning to understand our parables.

INTRODUCTION

In the introduction to the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Edu-
cation (Framework for IL) (ACRL, 2015), the ACRL Board explains (through
footnotes) that the thinking behind the Framework for IL is indebted to Thomas
Mackey and Trudi Jacobson's (2011, 2014) work on metaliteracy. That work, it
notes,

         expands the scope of traditional information skills (i.e., deter-
         mine, access, locate, understand, produce, and use informa-
         tion) to include the collaborative production and sharing of
         information in participatory digital environments (collabo-
         rate, produce, and share). This approach requires an ongoing
         adaptation to emerging technologies and an understanding of
         the critical thinking and reflection required to engage in these
         spaces as producers, collaborators, and distributors (footnote
         7, citing Mackey & Jacobson, 2014).

    As writing teachers and librarians develop ways to help students acquire the
dispositions identified in the Framework for IL, it is useful to look closely at
the kind of researched writing produced before its introduction. In addition
to providing a sense of the kinds of resources being consulted in response to
specific writing contexts, such analysis provides a baseline to work beyond--
and instructors against. We have learned a lot about attitudes, practices, and
expectations from student interviews such as those by Project Information Lit-
eracy (Head & Eisenberg, 2009, 2010; Head, 2013) and protocol analysis (see

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2016.0834.2.06  115
Jamieson

Blackwell-­Starnes, Chapter 7, this collection), but analysis of the final prod-
uct--the research paper--offers insight into how those various habits of mind
play out. Review of student research papers produced before the Framework for
IL reveals why the shift to a metacognitive information literacy (IL) is welcomed
by many involved in IL instruction. It also demonstrates the impact of some
of the limitations of the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for
Higher Education (IL Standards) (ACRL, 2000).

    As others have noted (see Norgaard & Sinkinson, Chapter 1, this collec-
tion), there are many institutional challenges preventing faculty and librarians
from working together to develop shared IL pedagogy. Not the least of these is
the common location of IL instruction in the required first-year writing course
(FYW) where IL assignments and too often product-based, focusing attention
away from IL as a process (Blackwell-Starnes, Chapter 7, this collection) and
obscuring the vision of IL as "a rich multifaceted literacy that is responsive to
changing contexts and opportunities" (Norgaard & Sinkinson, Chapter 1, this
collection). Yet the location of IL instruction is not likely to change with the
introduction of the new Framework for IL, making it essential for those who
would develop a more responsive IL pedagogy to understand what happens in
this current context. For this reason, analysis of the research papers produced
in first-year writing (FYW) prior to 2011 is particularly instructive. FYW is
the one college-level course that almost always includes a researched project
(Hood, 2010). Whether the instruction takes the form of the "one shot" library
visit (Gavin, 1995; Jacobs & Jacobs, 2009), a program-wide IL component
(Holliday & Fagerheim, 2006; Jacobson & Mackey, 2007), embedded librar-
ians (Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Kesselman & Watstein, 2009), or team-
taught courses (Alvarez & Dimmock, 2007; Jacobson & Mackey, 2007), final
papers are expected to reflect what students have learned about research writing
(Howard & Jamieson, 2014) and IL. Because IL instruction is often formally
or informally assessed based upon those papers, we can also use them to assess
the IL Standards.

    Articles published by librarians and by writing teachers that focus on or
include data on papers produced in FYW courses (Grimes & Boening, 2001;
Carlson, 2006; McClure & Clink, 2009) or other lower-level introductory
courses mostly populated by first-year students (Davis & Cohen, 2001; Jenkins,
2002; Davis, 2002, 2003; Carlson, 2006; Knight-Davis & Sung, 2008) can
help us begin this assessment, but all report on single-institution studies, so
they may be too limited to allow broad conclusions. Such single-site research
has important local relevance, permitting the campus community to explore
questions about the kinds of sources selected and retrieved at a specific moment
in a specific place and develop responsive pedagogies and policies. Individually,

                                                                        What the Citation Project Tells Us

though, they reveal little about national patterns or trends. These studies occur in
isolation and are designed to address local concerns rather than being developed
in response to other research. Indeed, single-institution studies are so inward-­
focused that very few replicate the methods or coding categories of other studies
with which they might compare data. Lacking such overlap, existing studies
cannot be easily aggregated as part of an evolving national picture of source use.
The two exceptions to this are Project Information Literacy and the Citation
Project, both of which are engaged in multi-institution study of student research
practices and products.

    This chapter reports on data from a study of the Citation Project Source-
Based Writing (CPSW) Corpus. The study in question explores the types of
sources selected and cited in 800 pages of source-based writing by 174 stu-
dents enrolled in FYW courses at 16 U.S. institutions, ranging from commu-
nity colleges to Ivy Leagues. Source codes replicate coding categories of earlier
studies (Carlson, 2006; McClure & Clink, 2009). Sub-codes allow the data
to be broken out for comparison with other studies (Davis & Cohen, 2001;
Jenkins, 2002; Davis, 2002, 2003; Knight-Davis & Sung, 2008), extending
their reach and reinforcing some of their findings while challenging other oft-­
repeated claims. This research allows us to understand the limits of decontextu-
alized and linearly focused IL instruction (Norgaard & Sinkinson, Chapter 1,
this collection). The data indicate that, nationally, students are broadly able to
identify, locate, and access information from apparently appropriate sources in
sanctioned ways; however, a closer look at which texts are cited and the ways
they are incorporated into the papers reveals the need to go beyond what has for
many become a checklist mentality to what the Framework for IL describes as
"an expanded definition of information literacy [that] emphasize[s] dynamism,
flexibility, individual growth, and community learning" ("Introduction").

THE CITATION PROJECT DATA

Citation Project Source-Based Writing (CPSW) Corpus

As reported elsewhere (Jamieson & Howard, 2013; Jamieson, 2013), the Cita-
tion Project Source-Based Writing Corpus (CPSW) gathered research papers
from 16 institutions distributed regionally and representing 12 states throughout
the United States and also distributed across 2008-2010 Carnegie classifications
(see Table 6.1). The papers were produced at the end of whatever the institution
identified as the standard FYW course, requiring a 7-10-page research paper
using at least five sources. Only decontextualized final research papers were
collected; Institutional Research Board (IRB) approvals required researchers to

                                                                                                 117

protect students and faculty from possible repercussion should plagiarism be
detected, which prevented collection of any demographic information, syllabi,
or assignments. The study focuses only on the finished product of the research
process--the papers--gathered between Spring 2008 and Spring 2010, and the
source use in a total of 50 pages from each participating institution was coded.
In all, 174 papers and works cited lists were examined, along with the 1,911
citations they included and the 930 sources cited.

Locating Sources Cited

In order to generate the 174 papers used in this study, 171 papers were rejected
(Table 6.1) because researchers were unable to retrieve all of the sources listed. In

some cases, the irretrievable sources were part of localized databases set up by the
participating institution but not accessible to researchers, or were part of larger
collections behind a prohibitive pay-wall. In other cases, citations provided
inadequate documentation, especially URLs containing typographical errors;
many others pointed to URLs that no longer exist or had been overwritten.
Other bibliographic studies spend considerable time discussing concerns about
unretrievable Internet sources. Grimes and Boening (2001) note that 30% of
the URLs cited in their sample could not be found "due to either student misre-
porting of the URL or inactive links" (p. 19); and when Davis (2003) checked
URLs for "accuracy and persistence" six months after collecting the papers in his
2001 study, he found that 35% did not take him to the original source (p. 55).

    In general, these researchers attribute their difficulty locating cited sources
to errors on the part of the students or imply that the difficulty reveals the
inadequacy of the source itself, citing both as further evidence of the need to
strengthen IL instruction. It is possible, though, that many of the URLs were
correct when the students listed them. Lepore (2015) notes that "the average life
of a webpage is 100 days," and Zittrain, Albert, and Lessig (2014) found that
70% of the 1,002 sampled URLs cited in the Harvard Law Review, the Harvard
Journal of Law and Technology, and the Harvard Human Rights Journal failed
to send readers to the information originally cited (what they term "reference
rot"). The same was true of 49.9% of the 555 URLs in all published United
States Supreme Court opinions. Instead of jumping too quickly to conclusions
about the quality of Internet sources selected by the students or blaming student
honesty or IL skills for irretrievable sources, these findings suggest that teachers
and librarians should revise IL instruction to include discussion of the role of
accurate citations, the problem of "reference rot," and the importance of listing
DOIs if they exist.

    The fact that, using the information provided, Citation Project researchers
were able to locate most of the Internet sources in the sample papers using the
Internet Archive (http://archive.org/), suggests that reference rot might have been
part of the problem in other studies as well. Successful retrieval of sources by Cita-
tion Project researchers was higher when papers used MLA-style works cited lists
that note access date, but approximate searches based on the date of the paper were
also largely effective. The Internet Archive allowed Citation Project researchers to
read Internet sources as they appeared the day the student consulted them.

Coding Categories

Data on source use has been reported elsewhere, along with a discussion of
methods (Jamieson & Howard, 2013, Jamieson, 2013). This chapter focuses

                                                                                                 119

on the sources themselves, which were classified into one of 14 types (see Table
6.2). The category "book" is uniformly described across studies of student source
use (Davis & Cohen, 2001; Jenkins, 2002; Davis, 2002, 2003; Carlson, 2006;
Knight-Davis & Sun, 2008; McClure & Clink, 2009); Citation Project cod-
ing replicated this category and, like other studies, included books accessed in
any format. The definition of journal article as peer-reviewed and written for
an academic audience is also quite standard, although Citation Project coding
replicated Jake Carlson's (2006) language, "written by an academic expert in
the field, incorporating scholarly perspectives such as theory or research, and
having an intended audience of other individuals knowledgeable in the field" (p.
16). The category "Specialized News Source and other periodicals" is defined by
Citation Project coding the way Carlson defines "Magazine article" ("reporting
an event, opinion, or other issue from a non-scholarly perspective . . . written
in a way that would be accessible to a general audience," p. 16), and includes
articles from publications such as The Economist, Nature, Mother Jones, The New
Yorker, and Harpers, regardless of how they were accessed. In the case of encyclo-
pedia, dictionaries, and government documents, again no distinction was made
between those consulted electronically and those consulted in print, although
almost all of the citations indicated that they were consulted online. The cat-
egory "General News Source" includes traditional newspapers that appear in
print and electronically, as well as news delivered by television and radio and
related websites (where broadcast news and related information is repeated and
updated), and via apps, social media, and email and text updates. Neither the
reputation nor the politics of the news source were noted, although sources were
also coded using a slight modification of the categories developed by McClure
and Clink (2009) as "information (apparently without bias)," "opinion," "advo-
cacy," "commercial," and "self-help."

    While Davis (2003) does note that some websites in his studies would prob-
ably be deemed sufficiently informational to be included in student papers, he
does not break out URLs in this way, nor do Carlson (2006) or Knight-Davis
and Sung (2008). McClure and Clink (2009) do make that distinction, and
Citation Project research followed their lead and used the categories they devel-
oped. Informational Internet sites are defined as sources that seem to be pre-
senting information without bias or commercial backing, such as the American
Cancer Society, and the CDC. Researchers also coded an additional category
not included by McClure and Clink, "Internet, multiple-author," special inter-
est websites or eZines that include articles by a number of contributors but do
not have a print version and are not associated with any news or entertainment
organizations (most notably fan sites for sports, collectables, or activities). This
category includes commercially produced multi-user fandom sites associated

with films, books, or television shows, although such sites were also coded as
commercial following McClure and Clink.

    Data was analyzed using SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Science 14.0).

Limitations of the Study

Although it includes students from 16 institutions, this study only provides a
snapshot of first-year college students in the U.S. as they leave a specific course
in a given year. As Carlson (2006) notes about his own study, the data are poten-
tially skewed by the fact that the instructors from whose classes the papers were
drawn and the students who submitted their papers were volunteers rather than
being randomly selected (randomizing occurred after papers had been submit-
ted). Instructors who felt they were doing a good job teaching research skills
were probably more likely to volunteer than those who had doubts; experienced
instructors were also probably more likely to volunteer. As for the students, those
who were misusing sources or who had very low confidence in their research and
citation skills probably selected out of the study. Papers were drawn from the
standard FYW course, which is sometimes the second writing course for those
deemed weaker writers and which in some institutions stronger writers place
out of and English Language Learners or multilingual writers are tracked out of.
These factors provided a fairly evenly prepared pool of writers for the study, but
also limit what might be learned from outliers.

FINDINGS

Types of Sources Selected and Retrieved

Surveys of faculty expectations for the FYW research paper (see Howard &
Jamieson, 2014) and conversations with librarians about sources they recom-
mend indicate that, in general, books, journal articles, government documents,
and specialized news sources (accessed either electronically or in print) are con-
sidered appropriate sources for FYW research papers. As Head and Eisenberg
(2010) among others have found, many assignments still require that students
use a specific number of types of sources, often one book and at least two journal
articles. Once those requirements are satisfied, many faculty also consider news-
paper articles appropriate, although of course this depends on the context and
the nature of the topic selected. The majority of FYW research papers address
general interest topics selected by the student, and 85% of the assignments stud-
ied by Head and Eisenberg (2010) either expected students to generate their own
topic or provided acceptable topics from which they could choose (p. 8). This

also appears to describe the papers in the CPSW, whose topics are frequently
abortion, gun control, Title IX, global warming, marijuana (legalization/health
benefits), and Internet privacy. Some papers focus on literature or discipline-spe-
cific topics requiring specialized sources, but these are the minority.

    As Table 6.2 shows, source types that fit the category "appropriate for FYW"
as described above dominate the list of sources selected, retrieved, and cited at
least once in the 800 pages coded. Of the 930 sources cited in coded extracts
written by the 174 student participants, 55% fall into this category. Of those,
books make up 14%; articles from scholarly journals, 24%; specialized news
sources and periodicals, 11%; and government documents, 7%. If general news
sources (15%) and visual images, mostly films (0.75%) are added to the list of
generally acceptable source types, as they often are in FYW courses, the per-
centage of the 930 sources that would be considered appropriate types for FYW
rises to 71%. Relatively few students cite encyclopedia and dictionaries (2% and
1%), or informal print or oral sources (0.5%), although this does not mean they
do not use them; only cited sources were studied.

A Closer Look at Sources

Where sources were available in print or electronically, they were coded by source
type (e.g., journal article) rather than method of retrieval, but sources that listed
a URL were also coded as "Internet" following previous research. Table 6.3

pages. More than half (54%) are informational websites, which is 14% of all of
the sources cited at least once. Such informational sources (including the Ameri-

cial (selling or promoting an item, brand, person, location, activity, etc.). These
findings are significantly lower than McClure and Clink's, revealing again the
influence of context on single-institution data.

A Closer Look at Books

When the category "book" is sub-divided, the question of acceptable source type
is further complicated, as Table 6.5 shows. Of the 128 books selected, retrieved,
and used at least once in the 800 coded pages, 49% are the traditional scholarly
texts probably imagined as the result of the instruction to "include at least one
book." Such texts make up 7% of the total 930 sources. A further 16% of the
128 books cited are works of literature, and 9% are literacy criticism focusing
on them. Of the remaining books, 13% are non-academic (self-help or popular
press books that do not cite sources or include notes regarding sources), and
12% are curated collections, such as the Opposing Viewpoints and At Issue series,
and short single-topic textbooks that arrange extracts from longer texts into a
"conversation" for the students.

    Perhaps unsurprisingly, while some books are cited frequently in literature-­
based papers, of the 930 sources only 14% are cited more than three times, and
56% are cited only once (Table 6.6).

DISCUSSION

Identifying, Locating and Retrieving sources

Bibliographic coding provides information about the kinds and combinations
of sources used in each of the 174 papers and also aggregate data about the
930 sources used within the coded pages (sources not used in the coded pages
were not retrieved or coded). It also reveals the frequency of use of each source
across the 1,911 citations in the sample, allowing comparison between what was
selected for the works cited list and what was actually used by the student to
build an argument within the paper itself. This allowed researchers to track what
percentage of citations drew on scholarly and non-scholarly sources and also to
explore the relationships among the sources cited.

    On the face of it, the data in Tables 6.2 to 6.5 indicate that students seem to
be able to retrieve types of sources that meet faculty requirements and that would
probably be recommended by librarians, thereby demonstrating an ability to
identify, locate, and access source types appropriate for their academic projects.
In spite of the inclusion of obviously non-academic sources and commercial and
advocacy websites, Tables 6.2 to 6.5 reveal that the majority of the sources being
cited at least once are of a type that most instructors of FYW courses would
consider "acceptable." Tables 6.2 and 6.3 reveal that 85% of the 930 sources
(791) would appear to be of acceptable types (although this does not mean that
the individual sources would be acceptable to support or build the argument in
question). Even when adjusted to remove non-academic books (see Table 6.5),
that number is still 80% (774 sources).

    While sources classified as "magazines" (such as Business Week, The Economist,
and National Geographic) may not be appropriate for research papers in courses
like those in economics studied by Davis and Cohen (2001) and Davis (2002,
2003), following McClure and Clink's (2009) lead, the Citation Project classi-
fies "specialized news sources or periodicals" as generally appropriate for FYW.
These differences are, of course, institution-specific (and sometimes instructor-­
specific), and lacking assignments and handouts, researchers cannot speak to
what was acceptable in each case. At the same time, although literature-based
and discipline-specific courses skew the data a little, the overall pattern described
here persists across sites.

    Because they classify sources by type (book, journal) rather than content,
the majority of scholars who study student researched-writing focusing on
source use or sources cited classify sources that can be accessed freely from
the public Internet as "websites" or "web" if a URL is listed with no further
subdivision. This means that the category includes everything from self-help
blogs to sites that would be considered appropriate for a paper in a FYW
course, such as government- or university-sponsored website. Just as the cat-
egory "book" tends to be considered appropriate without analysis of content,
so "web" tends to be considered inappropriate, and "sources from the Internet"
are still forbidden or limited by some faculty, particularly beyond the first year.
While Davis (2003) does note that some Internet sources would probably be
sufficiently informational to be included in first-year economics papers, his
study does not break out URLs in this way, nor do those of Carlson (2006)
or Knight-Davis and Sung (2008). McClure and Clink (2009), focus most
of their attention on the 48% of sources they coded as "websites," offering
a more granular classification and when Citation Project sources are coded
using those classifications (Table 6.4) it is obvious that not all Internet sources
should be considered unacceptable for source-based papers in FYW courses.
The decision to exclude sources found "online" from studies, and still from
some classes, seems increasingly limited given the ubiquity of the Internet,
the quality of sources available through it, and the growing sophistication of
the so-called "digital natives." Where earlier studies found cause for concern
in the types of Internet sources selected, the research reported in this chapter
echoes Carlson's (2006) observation that the quality of sources revealed in
single-institution studies do not appear to be generalizable to a national level.
The national snapshot provided by the Citation Project suggests less cause
for concern about the Internet and also records a high percentage of sources
classified as informational (websites from national organizations such as the
American Cancer Institute, or from government sponsored sites like the Cen-
ter for Disease Control).

    Perhaps because they were distracted by the Internet, earlier researchers have
not focused on the books students select, apparently imagining "books" by defi-
nition to be scholarly. In fact, data regarding this category (Table 6.5) suggests
the need to revisit the traditional instruction to "include at least one book." Some
of the courses in the sample were literature-focused, producing papers using
literary criticism (including SparkNotes and Cliff's Notes, which are frequently
used as criticism) to discuss literary texts. Another subset of courses aid the
"research" process by selecting curated collections such as Opposing Viewpoints
and At Issue series or single-topic textbooks. While these collections include
scholarly sources, they do most of the IL work for students, arranging extracts
from longer texts into a "conversation" rather than asking students to conduct
research in order to discover possible conversations themselves. Such collections
may help students understand the Framework for IL threshold concept Scholar-
ship as Conversation, and many of the papers also draw on other sources that
the students may have selected. The use of curated collections in FYW alongside
additional student-selected sources is worth further consideration as part of IL
pedagogy, especially if students learn to develop source networks from the
works cited lists of texts in those collections (Laskin & Haller, Chapter 11, this
collection). Books make up only 14% of the 930 sources, and of those, half
are monographs and edited collections that are sufficiently scholarly, although a
closer look at the books that would not be acceptable is instructive.

    Overall, the Citation Project research indicates that in the area of traditional
sources (books and journals) and in non-traditional sources (websites), first-year
students are mostly able to identify, find, access, and cite sources in ways that
would satisfy traditional bibliographic instruction. If the purpose of IL instruc-
tion is to help students navigate library databases and stacks along with the
Internet, select sources of an appropriate type on a specific topic, and access and
cite them correctly, then it seems to have succeeded. Studies of student bibliog-
raphies produced in intermediate- and upper-level courses report a high percent-
age of books and appropriate scholarly journals (Hovde, 2000; Jenkins, 2002;
Kraus, 2002; Carlson, 2006; Mill, 2008), confirming that this skill appears to
transfer beyond the first year. While Davis (2003) found that students were
using more Internet sources, he reports that they did not do so at the expense of
traditional sources but as part of an increase in the total number of sources cited
(p. 47). Of course, the IL Standards go far beyond simple information retrieval,
calling for a sophisticated understanding of sources and listing characteristics of
an equally sophisticated "information literate student" within the performance
indicators and outcomes. It is on this level that the Citation Project data suggests
the IL Standards have been less than successful in transforming both practice
and habits of mind. This observation reinforces critiques that the IL Standards

                                                                                                 127

present a set of "neatly packaged skills which result in a successful product"
(Norgaard & Sinkinson, Chapter 1, this collection) rather than encouraging a
process-oriented pedagogy. Such a recursive, rhetorically based IL pedagogy is,
of course, harder to measure using the kinds of checklists so common in FYW
and IL assessment, yet it is more in line with the process-oriented pedagogy
called for by Writing and Composition theorists, and perhaps a similar focus on
process in the Framework for IL will encourage radical pedagogical revision in
both areas.

A Deeper Look at Source Use

A closer look at Tables 6.5 and 6.6 suggests that there is still much IL work to
be done. The fact that the papers in this study demonstrate an ability to retrieve
appropriate types of sources does not mean students can do that work alone.
When instructed to include a certain number of books and peer-reviewed arti-
cles on their works cited list, most students will comply; however, if they are
not part of a brief literature review it is unlikely that a single citation was what
the professor intended. Overall, 56% of the 930 sources and 50% of the 128
books were cited only once, although the 21 works of literature were cited with
greater frequency. This finding suggests, again, that students need to be exposed
to a more sophisticated model of IL that teaches them to retrieve information as
needed from types and numbers of sources appropriate to the topic at hand, not
to satisfy a decontextualized checklist.

    Other studies (Sherrard, 1986; Hull & Rose, 1990; Pecorari, 2003; How-
ard, Serviss & Rodrigue, 2010) reveal that students working with sources write
from sentences within those sources rather than summarizing extended passages,
and in this expanded study they were found to do so in 94% of the citations
(Jamieson & Howard, 2013; Jamieson 2013). Together, these data suggest that
the focus of concern should not be the sources per se but the ways students
engage with them and use them to trace connections and create a conversation
among them. As Maid and D'Angelo (Chapter 2, this collection) observe, IL is
a "contextualized and situated concept," and by replacing the "prescriptive and
de-contextualized set of skills" with a deeper attention to metaliteracy, the new
Framework for ILs may begin to address this.

Information Literacy Dispositions and Habits of Mind

Because most of the students used the citation guidelines included in the 7th
edition of the MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers (2009), which
require the inclusion of the medium (print, Web, DVD) and the date a source

128
                                                                        What the Citation Project Tells Us

was consulted, it is possible to track the order that sources were retrieved and
the ways papers were constructed. Jenkins (2002), Davis (2003), and Carlson
(2006) all caution that there is no "average bibliography," and that observa-
tion holds for the Citation Project papers as well; there are, though, patterns
within the kinds of sources selected and the way those sources are used. A look
at papers that use "acceptable source types" reveals an often torturous research
process and paper-writing formula that is far from the "set of integrated abilities
encompassing the reflective discovery of information, the understanding of how
information is produced and valued, and the use of information in creating new
knowledge and participating ethically in communities of learning" identified as
a goal of the Framework for IL.

    One such paper, Z24, while not being typical, is representative of the many
struggles revealed in the coded papers, and reflects many of the concerns that
indicate the need to move beyond a checklist model of IL. A review of the works
cited list (Appendix A) suggests that few of us would find a problem with it
unless we looked at the sources themselves. It includes two books, one scholarly
journal article, two additional journal/periodical articles, one government web-
site, two informational sources from the Internet, an article from The New York
Times, and a website whose title at least would appear appropriate to the paper
topic (obesity).

"Authority Is Constructed and Contextual"

A closer look reveals the problems that can result from an over-dependence on
source type to assess authority. Neither of the two books cited in this paper is
scholarly, the first obviously so from the title--Skinny Bitch. The second, Com-
pulsive Overeating by Judith Peacock, is 64 pages long but may have appeared reli-
able to the student because s/he used LexisNexis Academic to access the (8-page)
chapter "Who is at Risk?" cited in the paper. The publisher, Life Matters, explain
"each book defines the problem, describes its effects, discusses dilemmas teens
may face, and provides steps teens can take to move ahead," giving it a Citation
Project classification of "book-self help." It could have been a useful source for
a paper analyzing the kinds of advice given to teens suffering from eating disor-
ders; however, that was not the focus of the paper, and it appears that the student
did not assess the contextual nature of the data in this source.

    One other source was also retrieved from LexisNexis Academic. Listed as
being from Biotech Business Week, the title is "Salad Bars in Every School: United
Fresh Applauds New Child Nutrition Bill," and no author is included by the
student, although it is actually listed as the United Fresh Produce Association.
Biotech Business Week notes on its "about" page that it publishes "News and

                                                                                                 129
Jamieson

information from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, with a focus
on business trends and analysis." The article reports on United Fresh's president's
visit to Capital Hill to thank legislators for including fresh produce in the New
Child Nutrition Bill, crediting Congressman Farr and United Fresh lobbying for
this legislation. The student introduces unattributed data about the importance
of fresh produce from the article with "research shows. . . ." This source should
have raised flags about authority when the student found it (Citation Project
researchers classified it as "company or commercial"). A student with a deeper
understanding of IL might have considered the role of context and purpose and
rejected it.

    While Z24 is an outlier in some ways, it reflects the impact of findings
by other researchers that students tend to trust the authority of all sources
they find "through the library" (Tolar-Burton & Chadwick, 2000). Head and
Eisenberg (2009) found that 84% of students reported that scholarly research
databases were the library resource they used most frequently (p. 22) and 78%
reported that such databases "contain more credible content than the inter-
net" (p. 27). Four of the sources in Z24 were retrieved via Academic Search
Complete, which notes that it "provides complete coverage of multidisciplinary
academic journals . . . [and] supports high-level research in the key areas of aca-
demic study by providing peer-reviewed journals, full-text periodicals, reports,
books, and more" (ebscohost). Two others came from The LexisNexis-Academic
"about" page notes that it allows researchers to "quickly and easily search full-
text documents from over 15,000 credible sources of information and pinpoint
relevant information for a wide range of academic research projects . . . [from]
comprehensive, authoritative news content, including current coverage and
deep archives" (LexisNexis). A final source was retrieved from a third "data-
base," about.com ("the largest source for Expert content on the Internet that
helps users answer questions, solve problems, learn something new or find
inspiration" according to the "about" page). In fact, about.com led the student
to a government document published by the Center for Nutrition Policy and
Promotion, which is part of the USDA, but the student does not even mention
that this is government research. Do students know the difference between
"peer-reviewed," "credible," and "expert"? This student appears not to have, nor
to have been able to make any judgment call about these different databases
when looking at the sources themselves or seen the difference between a gov-
ernment document and a company-sponsored promotion.

    The student does introduce Skinny Bitch as "New York Times Best Selling
book," but aside from that does not appear to consider the authority of the
sources selected, and only cites one 23-page chapter entitled "Have no Faith:
Government Agencies Don't Give a Shit About Your Health." (While this might

130
                                                                        What the Citation Project Tells Us

have been used in dialogue with the government data, it was not.) Source assess-
ment has always been part of IL instruction and is central to the IL Standards,
but as Head and Eisenberg's (2010) data show, if it is not accompanied by a
larger metacognitive discussion of the role of research and what we hope stu-
dents will learn through the process of researching a topic, they are unlikely to
incorporate such assessment into their normal research habits or the way they
think about information in general.

Information Creation as a Process and Information Has Value

Each of the sources in Z24 is used to introduce a reason why people might be
obese (eating disorders, high cost of healthy food, low cost of burgers, lack of
government concern), but the very different kinds of sources and the lack of
acknowledgement of their context or purpose undermines the argument. While
some of the sources selected are appropriate in terms of content and type, the
remaining sources are isolated voices on the general topic of the student's paper,
and the information in them is created and presented for a very different audi-
ence and purpose. One such source is a self-help blog, "Eat without Guilt,"
which promises to help readers "make peace with food, your body, and your
weight." A second comes from The New York Times Well blog and is entitled
"A High Price for Healthy Food," and a third is the book chapter "Compulsive
Overeating," which is cited twice in the paper, with both quotations taken from
the same page. Blogs and self-help sources would be appropriate for some kinds
of paper (an analysis of the rhetoric of "help," or the kinds of resources available
for people with eating disorders), but to mix self-help with academic research
in a paper whose stated aim is to explore the causes of obesity is a questionable
decision, and to do so without acknowledgment of the different context or rec-
ognition of the different scholarly weight assigned to each, reveals a student who
still needs to develop IL skills. If students are able to "assess the fit between an
information product's creation process and a particular information need" they
are also on the way to developing "an understanding that their choices impact
the purposes for which the information product will be used and the message it
conveys" (Framework for IL). Such an awareness may have guided this student
to different source choices.

Searching as Strategic Exploration and
Scholarship as Conversation

Perhaps more interesting than the student's inability to evaluate the sources s/he
cites is the story about the process of construction of the paper that the works

                                                                                                 131

cited list suggests. The student accessed four sources on 5 April, 2010, all four of
them via Academic Search Complete. Two come from academic journals (Pediat-
rics and New Scientist), and the other two are from the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences of the United States of America and the Tufts University and
Nutrition Letter. The New Scientist article, introduced by the student as "a recent
study by New Scientist" is a book review of Supersize Me. If one looks at these
four sources, a story appears to be emerging, moving from comments in Super-
size Me about corn to "Corn Content of French Fry Oil from National Chain
vs. Small Business Restaurants" (Proceedings), and from there to "Who's Losing
the Burger Battle?" (Tufts) and "Nutrition Labeling May Lead to Lower-Calorie
Restaurant Meal Choices for Children" (Pediatrics). All of these sources were
published in 2010 making it impossible for them to cite or reference each other;
however, all seem appropriate to begin an exploration of the topic of obesity, and
all are in some ways part of a larger dialogue on the given topic. It would appear
that on April 5, the student spent some quality time with a reliable database
beginning the process of strategically exploring an evolving topic and enter-
ing an ongoing conversation on that topic. Perhaps the class visited the library
to start their research or a librarian came to the classroom; certainly someone
introduced the student to this database and perhaps helped focus the research
question. So far, so good.

    But the next reported access of source material is not for another three weeks.
On April 25 the Biotech article on salad bars was added to the list, appearing to
continue the conversation begun on April 5; however, by April 27 when the four
remaining sources were accessed the paper seems to be on the way to its final
disconnected list of possible causes of obesity, one per paragraph, each supported
by a different source. Two of the sources accessed on April 5 (and still listed as
"works cited") do not appear in the final paper (the Proceedings article and the
Pediatrics article). Instead, on April 27 the student lists accessing the blogs "Eat
without Guilt" and the The New York Times Well blog, the book chapter "Com-
pulsive Overeating," and the report on fruit and vegetables from the USDA. The
book Skinny Bitch is listed as having been read in print so has no access date. It
is cited four times in the paper in two different paragraphs drawing from 4 pages
in one 23-page chapter. None of the authors of these sources is directly cited by
others, none of the student sources is drawn from the works cited lists of other
sources, and no citations from one source appear in any of the other sources.

    Because the sources selected in late April do not explicitly respond to other
sources about obesity or healthy living, it is easier for them to be used to provide
"evidence" for one item on the list of causes of obesity that ultimately orga-
nize the paper. Perhaps the need for a list-like outline came externally, but had
the student been reading the sources as part of a conversation on the topic of

132
                                                                        What the Citation Project Tells Us

healthy eating and explicitly creating source networks (Laskin & Haller, Chapter
11, this collection), paper Z24 might have evolved very differently. The student
concludes by stating agreement with the author of Skinny Bitch that ultimately
Americans are responsible for the "obesity epidemic" by remaining naive and
ill-informed, but this claim contradicts many of the "causes" that organize the
paper. The student neither counters that lack of information by adding to the
conversation about obesity, nor makes the argument expressed in the conclusion.

    It is this concept of research, and academic sources, as part of an ongoing con-
versation that seems most missing from the papers in the Citation Project study.
The organization of Z24 with one source per paragraph (and one paragraph per
source) makes it typical. When each source is a discrete item, and even a "type"
to be checked off, the possibility of those sources entering into conversation is
slim. If assignments do not specify why we do research or how research ques-
tions and conversations evolve as Head (2010) found to be the case, and if IL
instruction emphasizes identifying, finding, and assessing discrete sources rather
than developing metacritical frameworks for thinking about research (Kleinfeld,
2011), it should be no surprise that the resulting papers tend to be "information
dumps" rather than forays into academic conversation and the intellectual work
the research paper is imagined to be (Robinson & Schlegl, 2004). Diametrically
opposite to the image of scholarship as a conversation is the model of research as
formulaic, demanding particular types of sources and "killer quotes," which can
mostly be extracted from the first page of the source. This latter version of "The
Research Paper" characterizes the papers in the CPSW corpus.

CONCLUSION

The data generated by the Citation Project's multi-institution research suggests
that students who received IL instruction in the era of the IL Standards have
adopted a limited checklist mode of research rather than the nuanced appre-
ciation of sources and source selection included in that document. This sug-
gests that the IL Standards themselves did not totally displace the kind of bib-
liographic instruction that preceded them in 2000. The papers in the CPSW
corpus demonstrate that students have the ability to select, retrieve, and cite
the right kinds of sources, many of them appropriately academic for first-year
papers; however, the papers evidence little or no relationship among those
sources. Analysis of the incorporation of information from the sources into
the papers reveals students working at the sentence-level, and segregating each
source into one paragraph, mostly by including quotation or paraphrase rather
than by summarizing larger ideas in a text or comparing arguments with those
of other sources. Furthermore, most of the references to sources are to the first

                                                                                                 133

one or two pages and most of the sources are cited only once or twice, suggesting
little engagement with them as part of a broader scholarly conversation.

    It may be, as I have argued elsewhere (Howard & Jamieson, 2014), that the
first-year research paper itself bears more responsibility for this state of affairs
than the IL instruction that tries to support it. It is certainly the case that shorter
source-based papers could be used to introduce students to IL practices and
habits of mind; however, it is also the case that the introduction of threshold
concepts in writing pedagogy (Adler-Kassner, Majewsi & Koshnick, 2012) and
in the Framework for IL increases the likelihood that students may gain a "vision
of information literacy as an overarching set of abilities in which students are
consumers and creators of information who can participate successfully in col-
laborative spaces" ("Introduction"). Had the students writing the papers studied
by the Citation Project evidenced the kinds of critical self-reflection described
in the Framework for IL and embedded in the description of what constitutes
IL, it is difficult to believe they could have produced the papers in the sample.
We might hope that with the revised instruction associated with threshold con-
cepts, future papers will show evidence of the "dynamism, flexibility, individual
growth, and community learning" described in the Framework for IL document
("Introduction").

    This optimism is unlikely to bear fruit unless we ask some difficult questions
of IL instruction and the FYW courses where it so frequently becomes ghet-
toized. What is the role of real IL (not bibliographic instruction) in FYW? How
can we ensure that the skills and habits of mind are transferrable to other courses
(and to work, life, etc.)? When included amongst many other elements of a
writing course, how can threshold concepts be introduced without overwhelm-
ing the students--or the course? And if institutions recognize that IL cannot
be "delivered" in one library visit, assignment, or even semester, how can it be
advanced programmatically or throughout a student's education (and beyond
to lifelong learning)? Finally, how can the Framework for IL be introduced to
all faculty--including library faculty, administrators, and students in a way that
will help us all to recognize our shared responsibility for IL and our shared stake
in successful IL pedagogy? Unless these questions are addressed, I fear that the
2019 FYW research papers will not look significantly different from those pro-
duced in 1999 or 2010.

PRELIMINARY PATHS TO
INFORMATION LITERACY:
INTRODUCING RESEARCH
IN CORE COURSES

      Katt Blackwell-Starnes
      Lamar University

Writing faculty multitask teaching information literacy (IL) skills with academic
writing skills through scaffolded assignments that include a formal research
project as an assessment tool. However, results from the Learning Information
Literacy across the Curriculum (LILAC) Project pilot study illustrate that stu-
dents turn to the formal research project requirements rather than IL skills as
they conduct research.1 This formal research assignment holds the students'
focus in such a way they work toward the assignment requirements with rote,
quick, research, an approach that hinders their IL skills. Devoting class time to
assignments that guide preliminary research and reiterate, through grades, the
importance of early research to writing an academic research paper can improve
students IL skills.

    Studies in information-seeking behaviors emphasize students' reliance on
Internet search engines to conduct academic research and indicate a cognitive
rationale for these beginnings. J. Patrick Biddix, Chung Joo Chung, and Han
Woo Park's (2011) 282 respondents report beginning research with a search
engine to construct a source outline and locate initial sources. Twelve of Huri-Li
Lee's (2008) 15 interviewees cite search engines as a convenient starting point.
Patrick Corbett's (2010) respondents assert the Internet is both more depend-
able and effective in terms of time and feedback than library research. Con-
versely, Alison J. Head and Michael Eisenberg's (2009) respondents cite famil-
iarity and habit as their rationale; however, these respondents also indicate they
turn to course textbooks before Internet searches. Research also suggests students
lack engagement with academic research. Randall McClure and Kellian Clink's
(2009) analysis of student source use found 48% of citations in 100 composition
papers were web sources. Sandra Jamieson and Rebecca Moore Howard's (2012)
Citation Project study finds 77% of citations in 174 papers came from the first

Blackwell-Starnes

three pages of sources, regardless of source length (p. 4). Head and Eisenberg's
(2010) research handout study finds that students rely--from the beginning
of a research assignment--on the handout to guide them through how much
time to spend on research and requirements for a passing grade. Taken together,
this research emphasizes students' reliance on quick Internet research, and quick
results from the first few pages of their sources.

    Quick research and lack of source engagement prevents students from acquir-
ing and applying IL skills to academic research. The Association of College and
Research Libraries' (2015) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Edu-
cation reframes IL as six threshold concepts--Scholarship Is a Conversation,
Research as Inquiry, Authority Is Contextual and Constructed, Format as a Pro-
cess, Searching as Exploring, and Information Has Value. These threshold con-
cepts reconceptualize IL for higher education to better prepare students to apply
IL in a broader range of situations. IL does not benefit only academic research,
but professional and personal research as well; therefore, furthering college stu-
dents' IL skills provides crucial learning and critical thinking necessary beyond
the college degree.

SACRIFICING INFORMATION LITERACY FOR FINAL
PRODUCT: FINDINGS FROM THE LILAC PROJECT

The LILAC Project is a multi-institutional study of students' information-­
seeking behaviors. Undergraduate and graduate student participants complete a
two-part research session, responding to survey questions regarding their infor-
mation-seeking training and behaviors and completing a 15-minute research
aloud protocol (RAP) session that records screen capture and voice narration.
The 2012 pilot study included eight first-year students whose results demon-
strate a need for more focused preliminary research instruction in core classes
where major research projects comprise a significant final grade percentage.

    First-year participants' responses to the questionnaires show that these
students perceive their IL skills as above average or exceptional; indeed, 50%
rated their ability to locate information online an 8 on a 1-10 Likert scale. The
remaining first-year participants rated themselves even higher with one partici-
pant ranking herself at 9 and the remaining three ranking themselves at 10. They
were all also confident about their ability to evaluate online information, though
they did not give themselves such high marks. Only one participant assessed
himself at a 10, two participants ranked themselves at a 9, and the remaining six
participants divided evenly between 7 and 8 on a 1-10 scale.

    Understanding student perceptions of their own abilities is pivotal to fur-
thering IL skills in higher education. Students who perceive their abilities to

140
                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

be above average may also perceive library workshops as rudimentary instruc-
tion and opt to either not attend or attend but not pay attention. Hence, it is
essential to understand the differences in IL skills students perceive they possess
and the IL skills they demonstrate when conducting academic research if we
are to develop instruction to meet student IL needs. The second part of the
LILAC Project study, the Research Aloud Protocol (RAP) begins to examine
this gap.

    The LILAC Project's RAP component asks students to conduct a 15-minute
research session using their own research methods. Instructions offer students
the chance to work with a topic for their class or use one of the six suggested top-
ics. In sessions where students use their own topic, they identify the course and
their topic; in sessions where students select from the suggested topics, we asked
that students identify a class for which they might research the topic. Four first-
year participants selected topics to research from the LILAC prompts: Maria2
elected to research diversity issues; Frank, Paul, and Robert selected historical
events; and Jennifer chose healthcare and health issues. The remaining three
first-year participants opted to work with topics for their core courses: Robert
chose his First-Year Experience class paper, a cultural analysis of Ethiopia; Laura
and Heather both selected their composition class research paper topics, obesity
and global warming, respectively. The RAP sessions show that students focus on
the final product requirements and that this may hinder their ability to develop
crucial IL skills, specifically the ability to define and articulate needed informa-
tion and the ability to locate the needed information efficiently.

    Focus on the final product occurs throughout LILAC's first-year partici-
pants' RAP sessions and offers candid insight into the role an assignment plays
in students' research. Frank summarizes his research session in terms of writing
a paper on John Marshall, not in terms of information learned or additional
research questions; he evaluates his 15-minutes session as complete, stating
"depending on how long the paper was, I'd probably get it done based off the
patchwork from these websites." Robert avoids visiting Wikipedia because he
was "dinged in the past" for citing this source. Laura selects specific information
during her search to "use as a quote" in her obesity paper. Melinda concludes
her RAP session by turning to Google Books and then to the university library
databases, articulating her reason for this shift as a quest for the types of sources
"teachers want." Focus on the final product in RAP sessions suggests students
do not engage with early research, and this lack of engagement may continue
throughout the research process if the Citation Project's (2011) initial results
and McClure and Clink's (2009) findings are any indication. This focus may
also determine students' search terms, leaving them to locate quick information
rather than creating effective searches for credible, relevant information.

                                                                                                 141
Blackwell-Starnes

    Focus on the final product removes a critical focus on early research as a
narrowing technique. Participants' research does not include reading and engag-
ing with sources; instead, they skim bullets or bolded headings to determine a
source's usefulness, copy information from websites based on assignment needs,
discard lengthy sources, and avoid visiting websites forbidden in the final prod-
uct. Laura copies and pastes statistics about an increase in obesity among south-
ern states into a Word document, but she does not read this information and
misses an opportunity to consider more focused research. Robert avoids Wiki-
pedia, preventing him from gaining a background understanding of Ethiopia, a
background essential to writing a cultural analysis. Maria discards a book source
simply because it is a book, since books represent more time investment because
of length, especially when the book is not a familiar textbook where students can
quickly locate information from previous readings. Melinda narrows her topic
to global warming and rivers, but she turns to Google Books and the library
databases as a rote shift, not an articulated need. Assessing sources in terms
of the final product does not further students' understanding of why specific
sources are appropriate for academic assignments, nor does this focus help stu-
dents recognize the types of research needed and best methods for accessing the
needed information.

    Focus on the final product by LILAC first-year participants also leads to
rote, superficial searches for information rather than narrowed and advanced
searches to work toward a more narrowed research focus. Google searches for
information begin with participants searching for their topic at large and using
whatever words may appear in that topic. Laura's search for "obesity" returns
345 million results, and Michael's search for "World War 2" returns 136 million.
Participants who begin with more words in their initial searches fare no better;
Frank's search for "the importance of John Marshall's Supreme Court appoint-
ment" yields 3 million, and Robert's search for "cultural analysis of Ethiopia"
yields 1 million. These first-year participants do not acknowledge the numbers
as they begin working with the results and continue with similar search terms
throughout their RAP sessions. Search terms change slightly with new searches,
but not in a way that assists in topic narrowing. For example, Frank's search
terms change to "the effect of John Marshall's Supreme Court" when his first
search does not provide needed information. Robert's search terms change to
"Geert Hoftstede analysis of Ethiopia" for the same reason. Laura shifts her focus
to "obesity statistics" after determining these are necessary for the final paper.
Similar search term changes occur with all first-year participants, and each time
searches return millions of results and the students view only those on the first
pages of Google--a clear indication these students do not even understand, let
alone perceive the need for, more sophisticated search methods.

STARTING ON THE RIGHT PATH: PRELIMINARY
RESEARCH ASSIGNMENTS

Students do not enter college with the scholar's curiosity nor with the schol-
ar's sophisticated research skills; thus, determining the amount of information
needed may very logically seem to require no more than checking the assign-
ment handout. Head and Eisenberg (2010) find students define a situational
context directly from the research assignment. This situational context includes
how much time to devote to research, how to meet assignment expectations,
how to get a good grade, and how to submit the final paper (p. 5). Immediately,
the differences in how students and scholars determine the extent of information
needed for a research project creates a significant gap between student products
and educator expectations. Such distinct differences need addressing. Scholars do
not begin research projects with a formal, final paper in mind, but with a topic
or question and an expectation of devoting copious amount of time to research-
ing. Student research needs a similar focus. Educators need to separate the pre-
liminary research and topic narrowing from the final assignment, encouraging
a research process that narrows an interesting topic, determines the information
needed, and effectively locates needed information. Sandra Jamieson's chapter
in this collection emphasizes the lack of student engagement with sources, and
this lack of engagement is one area the preliminary research sequence presented
in this chapter seeks to address. Beginning instruction with a focus on research,
rather than emphasizing the final research project, provides better opportunities
to talk about the process of research, foster better IL skills, and encourage better
engagement with and comprehension of sources.

    Students need opportunities to internalize preliminary research strategies,
dialogue with other students, and distinguish differences in preliminary research
and research to locate more specific support for an established claim. Separating
the preliminary research from the formal research assignment and introducing
low-risk, graded preliminary research assignments aids students' IL skills while
also opening classroom discussions about the research process--laden with
struggles, hurdles, complications, intrigues, and successes.

    The preliminary research assignment I incorporate involves three short,
graded assignments: preliminary research, focusing research, and source brows-
ing. Together, these assignments comprise 10% of the students' final grades in
research-focused composition courses. Through this recursive sequence, students
locate preliminary sources, reflect on research, and develop new search strategies.
The stepping stones taught in these assignments are common expectations in
composition classes, but students traditionally do not demonstrate proficiency
until they submit their research proposals and/or annotated bibliographies. In

                                                                                                 143
Blackwell-Starnes

contrast, the preliminary research assignment sequence improves IL skills by
removing the focus of research from the formal assignment and placing this
focus on the research. I theme my course around the broad topic of surveil-
lance and mass media because theming the course creates more cohesive class
discussions and collaboration. Prior to the assignment introduction, we read
and discuss Gary T. Marx's (2002) "What's New about the `New Surveillance'?,"
Anders Albrechtslund's (2008) "Online Social Networking as Participatory Sur-
veillance," and excerpts from Michel Foucault's (1975) Discipline and Punish;
these works form the foundation for the preliminary research sequence and the
beginning of class discussions, emphasizing ways to read complex sources, deter-
mine a variety of source types, and articulate relevance to the conversation. From
the syllabus and class discussions, students know that their preliminary research
begins something larger, yet the absence of final project requirements maintains
a focus on the current assignment and the needed research skills rather than the
specific requirements of a formal product.

RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT 1: PRELIMINARY RESEARCH

Students begin their research project with the Preliminary Research assignment
(see Appendix A) designed to get students reading basic information on a broad
topic and thinking about this information. There are no limitations beyond con-
ducting research on surveillance; the research emphasizes reading and thinking,
not locating certain types of sources. Students create a map of their search process,
keep a list of the search terms and websites, and make research notes. Through
note taking, they begin to internalize active research: moving from the passive
skimming of webpage headlines to reading the webpage, following links relevant
to their research topic, and collecting notes from relevant sources. Active research
skills are then reinforced when they turn their notes into an informal two-page
analysis. The analysis paper creates an entry point for discussing new knowledge
about surveillance, problems they encountered, and questions they have about
the topic. At the end of class, I reassign students the same work for researching
mass media. In the next class period, students discuss the information learned and
intersections between surveillance and mass media students find interesting. The
focus on surveillance and mass media leads students to an array of topics, and they
declare they want more research on "Twitter surveillance" or "reality television."
These broad topics open discussions about what happens when these topics enter
Google. As a transition to the next assignment, I google several student suggested
topics and ask how they plan to read all the results before the next class. Discus-
sion turns to what students read--Google's first page--and we problematize this
approach. Students agree the approach is not the best and admit they know no

144
                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

other way. This dialogue begins the introduction to the next assignment as stu-
dents express their need for better search methods.

RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT 2: FOCUSING RESEARCH

The second component of the preliminary research sequence, Focusing Research
(see Appendix B), introduces students to more sophisticated search methods
with Google--skills that create more efficient searches. This assignment struc-
ture follows the pattern set in the Preliminary Research assignment; students
receive no parameters on what they can view or the number and types of sources.
Again, students construct search maps, record their keywords, jot down ques-
tions, and write another two-page analysis of their work for subsequent class
discussions. Students become members of topic-related small groups where they
discuss their interests in the topic and begin to form a more narrowed focus that
combines course theme and student interest. "Reality television" narrows to a
focus on children on reality shows; "Google surveillance" narrows to a focus
on the newest Google gadget. Students leave class to complete the Focusing
Research assignment a second time, using their new topic focus.

    Submitting their second advanced search map and analysis leads students to
a new class discussion focused on developing a single, focused research ques-
tion. I show Paul's LILAC session video, selected because Paul asks several closed
questions of Google. From this video, we begin a dialogue about good research
questions, and we workshop students' developing research questions. The work-
shop begins with students discussing the merits of their own questions, eliminat-
ing closed-ended questions and gathering proposal question feedback from their
small groups. In many instances, students select their research question from peer
group discussion. The weeks we spend on these first two assignments encourage
peer collaboration; students begin their research in the same areas and recognize
the benefits of class discussion to their current and future research. Less viable
research questions receive less discussion, fewer ideas, and do not engage peer
discussion. Students take the weekend and consider the class discussion and their
research questions, returning to class with their tentative research question.

    When students return with their tentative research question, they vocalize
hesitations about how they answer this question. Several students confess to typ-
ing the question into Google and getting nothing helpful, while others express
doubts that anything on the Internet can aid in answering their question. These
confessions and doubts lead to discussion about the academic nature of the ques-
tions and the need for sources that provide insight into the question rather than
an answer. This discussion becomes the introduction to the final component of
their preliminary research sequence.

                                                                                                 145

ASSIGNMENT 3: SOURCE TRAILS

The Source Trails assignment (see Appendix C) comes at a research stage where
students need the bridge from Google to more sophisticated academic research.
Lee (2008) discusses ways research participants use the concept of shelf browsing
in the physical library to locate additional research materials. Participants in his
research study knew "books on similar topics were shelved nearby and browsing
after retrieving one book on a specific topic gave them the opportunity to dis-
cover other books on the same or closely related topics" (p. 214). The concept of
shelf-browsing adapts for online research in a similar way, and the Source Trails
assignment uses a series of workshops to teach techniques for reference brows-
ing. The first workshop for this assignment teaches students to use the bibliog-
raphies of relevant sources to create a list of other relevant materials. Students
generate a list of pseudo-citations that provide abbreviated, necessary informa-
tion (title, author, year, journal) and include the author of the originating source
so students can return to the original reference page when more information is
needed. Students download or print sources to read and annotate, and noting
the location in the pseudo-citation helps them to organize their research. During
the second workshop, students learn the use of the databases' "related articles"
feature, add relevant titles to their bibliography, and locate available sources. In
the third workshop, I introduce Google Scholar, and students search for sources
unavailable through the library using Google's "related" and "cited by" features.
The previous process repeats, and only a few listed sources remain. For these
sources, students learn to use the interlibrary loan feature and make requests for
the remaining sources. Students turn in an in-progress list of their source trails;
I do not give a specified number, though most students submit, on average, 15
sources for this work.

NEXT STEPS

After submitting their source trails, students take part in a class workshop for
library database immersion. Students use the class period to research their topic
while familiarizing themselves with the library databases. The goal is not to locate
further information, though students perceive this as the task; rather, the goal is
for students to discover what they know about the college's library databases and
what they need assistance learning about the college's library databases. I prepare
students for the upcoming library workshop by bringing them to the under-
standing that vast differences exist between Google searches and library database
searches. Students show an improvement in IL skills by beginning this work

                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

using more advanced search terms than just the one or two words connected to
their topic; they employ strategies learned in the Source Trails workshops. Stu-
dents also begin to generate questions for the upcoming library workshop. These
questions better engage students in the upcoming library workshop and help
librarians shape the workshop. At the end of this class period, students submit
the questions they have regarding library research skills, and I pass these along to
the librarian leading the workshop. In turn, this leads to a library workshop that
better develops the students' IL skills.

    The library workshop takes place during the next class period. This workshop
requires a huge commitment from the librarians leading the session; the work-
shop is not a traditional one-shot session, but rather a session focused on just-
in-time instruction, answering student questions and building from knowledge
and obstacles that arose during the class workshop. This does, however, provide
the librarian more insight into where students are struggling with IL skills. Stu-
dents attend this workshop humbled by the experience from the previous days,
and some even admit the college's library database is much more complex than
their high school's database. The workshop is guided by the students' questions
from the previous class period but includes additional information the librarians
know will further expand students' IL skills. For example, one student ques-
tion regarded generating better keywords, which led to the librarian teaching
the class how to read the Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) listed
within an individual result and how to combine and narrow multiple LCSHs
to locate new material. Such a specific area of instruction does not come up in
one-shot library workshops, but proved timely and useful to the students while
also expanding their IL skills and abilities within the databases.

    After the library workshop, I reassign the second and third research assign-
ments, Focusing Research and Source Trails, with a restriction on students only
using the library databases. This not only furthers students' familiarity with the
library databases, but also reiterates the role these two assignments play in recur-
sive research. At the conclusion of these next steps, students have approximately
25 sources beneficial for their research.

    The next steps resemble more traditional composition courses. I present stu-
dents with a hybrid research proposal and annotated bibliography that draws
from materials previously submitted rather than beginning from scratch. They
repurpose and revise in-class short writings for the formal product and present
a bibliography and rhetorical summaries for Internet and library sources. The
bibliography also includes current Source Trails sources, a book reference, and
interlibrary loan requests for unavailable sources. The bibliography and proposal
are the capstone project for the course.

                                                                                                 147

PRELIMINARY IMPROVEMENTS TO
INFORMATION LITERACY

The Preliminary Research sequence succeeds in improving students' IL skills
because it shifts the research focus away from a formal research paper and allows
students to focus on the research as a separate assignment. The sequence rein-
forces steps common to research projects: narrow the topic, create a focused
research question, and use a variety of sources. Taken all at once, this infor-
mation overwhelms students, especially when presented with the assignment
that comprises a significant percentage of the course grade. However, working
through early stages of research as separate assignments improves students' IL
abilities while also helping students learn ways they can conduct more efficient
research for all academic papers.

    The first assignment, Preliminary Research, introduces students to three
of the Framework for IL threshold concepts--Information Creation as a Pro-
cess, Information Has Value, and Authority Is Constructed and Contextual;
simultaneously, this assignment builds the classroom scholar community and
helps students begin to think through semester research topics. Class discus-
sions allow students to take risks and learn that these risks have no grade-related
repercussions.

    For example, one student discusses information learned through Wikipedia,
though he must admit he did not include any of the information in the assign-
ment. Other students admit to the same omission or admit including Wikipedia
but fearing a reduced grade. Class discussions about the role Wikipedia can have
at different stages of academic research encourage students to take the site into
consideration as a resource while understanding why educators frown on its
inclusion in academic papers. The conversations further students' understand-
ing of authority as contextual and information as having value by acknowledg-
ing that Wikipedia does contain helpful knowledge for topic narrowing while
also illustrating the differences in constructing authority in academic writing as
significantly different than Wikipedia's constructed authority. These discussions
build confidence in risk taking and discussing stumbles as well as successes, a
necessary discussion for building IL skills through the subsequent assignments.

    Through the assignment and corresponding class discussions, students
begin to test their own authority, offering suggestions to peers when they have
information related to a peer's early topic. At the early stage of the Preliminary
Research assignment, such information is offered up with the qualifier "I read
somewhere," before peers encourage the student to locate the specific source
and share the information to the collaborative online space students use to share
their research. Such actions are peer-motivated and peer-supported, encouraging

148
                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

students to show how they develop authority on even a single piece of informa-
tion, encouraging peer support through the creation of information and individ-
ual authority, and emphasizing the value of information from specific sources.
This assignment allows for early emphasis on the Framework for IL in ways that
help students to better internalize IL skills without the daunting fear of a final
grade for a lengthy research paper.

    Through the Narrowed Focus and the Source Trails assignments, students
begin to shape their broad topics into focused research questions that guide their
semester research and writing; simultaneously, they work toward internalizing
another American Library Association (ALA) concept--searching is strategic.
Students begin to shape their broad topics into questions that will shape their
semester research. For instance, the topic "medical surveillance" becomes the
question "how does medical surveillance protect us?" Not long into frustrating
Google searches for their questions, students begin to reconsider what, more
specifically, they need to ask Google. Medical surveillance becomes a single
search with over 13 million results; medical surveillance protection becomes a
separate search with over 6.5 million results. These activities take place through
Google because students already use the site for everyday and academic research
and are more receptive to learning how to use Google more efficiently and are
more receptive to advanced strategies on a familiar site.

    Effective Internet search techniques, such as including phrases in quotation
marks and incorporating Boolean Operators to further narrow or broaden results,
parallel those students will learn for library databases, thus the library databases
become less intimidating for students and more risks are taken with library data-
base searches when assignments make this turn. These strategies teach students
how to narrow their topic while also teaching them how to think more critically
and strategically about the questions they need answered and the search terms
that will help them answer these questions, encouraging both brainstorming
for research terms and refining existing search strategies. "Medical surveillance,"
now enclosed in quotation marks to indicate a phrase to Google now returns
under 400,000 results before strategic thinking about the topic narrows the
search terms to "medical surveillance" AND "United States." Though Google
automatically combines search terms, I prefer to encourage students to use this
Boolean Operator with Google to better prepare them for the library databases,
thus helping students understand the benefit of search strategies before applying
them to the unfamiliar and less forgiving library databases.

    Teaching students to use the bibliographies of relevant sources and the
related research aspects of Google Scholar and the library databases adds another
layer that emphasize additional methods for developing effective search strate-
gies and also introduce students to the Framework for IL's threshold concept that

                                                                                                 149
Blackwell-Starnes

scholarship is a conversation. Students relate to this activity often through their
covert use of Wikipedia as a starting point for academic research; knowing they
cannot use Wikipedia, students learn from a peer or are self-taught in the skill
of locating academically acceptable sources through references on a Wikipedia
page. Miriam Laskin and Cynthia R. Haller's chapter in this collection further
emphasizes the need to teach source trails, as junior-level students in their study
still do not engage in this type of research. Thus, students know how the process
works, but the Source Trails assignment makes this process a more sophisticated
research activity that illustrates how and why specific sources are cited. Students
are familiar with the sources they use for the Source Trails assignment through
their readings in the previous assignments; therefore, they have a basic knowl-
edge of how the sources are used in the article's content. When considering
sources for the Source Trail assignment, students give consideration to how the
source relates to their own research as they begin to frame their research in the
scholarly conversation. Understanding the relationship between a source and
their own research leads to interrogating their sources' sources and considering
how their own research enters this larger conversation.

    A student researching police surveillance with an emphasis on the African
American community, is an excellent example of Source Trails at work. A source
she described in her final project as "influential to her project" mentioned a source
that argued the Rodney King case was instrumental to the rise of hip-hop. With no
knowledge of Rodney King, the student identified the source as potentially useful
to her research and, through this additional source and further research about
Rodney King, revised her research question to the role of the Rodney King video in
implementing police car surveillance cameras. The Source Trails assignment illus-
trates how scholarship builds a conversation between scholars and how students
can strategically locate relevant sources through the references contained, which
teaches students to search more effectively and efficiently, thus furthering their
ability to meet the Framework for IL. Further, students are not looking quickly for
the specific number of sources required for a course paper since the paper remains
unassigned, but continue looking for more information on their focused research
questions.Students learning to locate information more efficiently also begin to
expand their ability to meet each IL threshold concept outlined in the Framework
for IL, while engaging with more complex, interest-driven research rather than
seeking sources that assist in meeting assignment guidelines. Students focusing on
research itself, not a specific number of sources for a final paper, spend more time
reading sources relevant to their specific research interest. Students recognize the
Source Trails assignment as work that will help them answer their question, and
they recognize the strategy of following the conversation through cited sources as
a strategy they can implement for other academic research.

150
                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

    Acknowledging that a single source will not answer their question leads stu-
dents to think more critically about the breadth and complexity of information.
They create new searches, repurpose old searches, and discard located and read
sources based on their current research needs. They begin to articulate an under-
standing of research as a process of inquiry--a process motivated by curiosity
when the subject engages them. Sources providing no information relevant to
the research question do not enter the annotated bibliography and are not quote
mined for the final paper. My students are not at a point where they necessarily
articulate a need for theory in their research; however, using Foucault's theory
in class readings and discussions provides an understanding of how theory can
apply to the work. Two students in the pilot implementation of this sequence
located and incorporated the work of Deleuze and Barthes in their research,
works they located through their source trails and recognized, after reading, as
pertinent to their own research.

PRELIMINARY SUCCESS

The preliminary research sequence precedes an annotated bibliography and a
proposal for a more formal research project the students might undertake; these
documents form the capstone project for the semester, thus further emphasizing
the Framework for IL's threshold concepts of Research as Inquiry and Schol-
arship Is a Conversation while simultaneously enhancing the students' critical
thinking skills. The annotated bibliography includes rhetorical summaries for
10 academic sources and 10 Internet sources; also included are the students' 10
most current Source Trails and at least one book reference and one interlibrary
loan request. The proposal includes a brief statement of the students' narrowed
research topics, an analysis of the primary materials for the research topic, and
an explanation of why their research is important to an academic audience. The
proposal does not include requirements for any source use, thus leaving stu-
dents to decide which sources need inclusion based on their research topic, their
understanding of IL skills, and their comprehension of class discussions about
research. The goal for the capstone is to keep the students' focus on research
related to their topic. In the pilot semester (n = 25), 23 students submitted a
proposal that met the assignment guidelines, and an analysis of the sources used
in the proposals illustrates the ways students incorporate research into a formal
assignment following the Preliminary Research sequence.

    Two students (8%) included Wikipedia citations in their paper. The first
included the Wikipedia page for "Syndromic Surveillance," presenting the defi-
nition for her research topic in language more accessible to a broader audience
than the reference on the Center for Disease Control (CDC) webpage. The

                                                                                                 151
Blackwell-Starnes

definition preceding the Wikipedia citation is the student's own work, but
clearly draws more from the Wikipedia language than the more complex lan-
guage on the CDC page, and the student acknowledges this use, risking the
reduced grade for using Wikipedia instead of deceptively citing the CDC page
and not acknowledging knowledge gained from Wikipedia. The second student
included a link to the Wikipedia page for "Computer Surveillance," not as a
component of his analysis, but rather as part of a brief narrative describing how
he used the Wikipedia page to focus this broad topic to his narrowed topic of
Twitter's privacy policy. In each proposal, the selected Wikipedia pages reflect
the discussion during the Preliminary Research sequence about the appropriate
use of Wikipedia and its place in academic work. The use of Wikipedia in both
proposals also illustrates the students' acknowledgement of the Framework for
IL threshold concepts of information as having value and scholarship as a con-
versation. Though the students elect to use Wikipedia for their proposals, their
strategic use and honest citation of the Wikipedia pages illustrates partial success
for teaching IL strategies and the Framework for IL through the Preliminary
Research sequence.

    Four of the students (16%) included at least one source from a scholarly
journal article available through the library databases, and though this number
is significantly smaller than anticipated, these students chose scholarly sources
because of relevance to their paper, not because of assignment requirements.
Two other students (8%), as mentioned earlier, made attempts to apply Deleuze
and Barthes to their primary material analyses. These sources served as theoreti-
cal frameworks in other scholarly articles they used, and the students, recogniz-
ing the potential role the theory might play in their own research, sought out
these works and took the risk of incorporating them into their own research.
These academic and theoretical sources again emphasize the students' increased
understanding of scholarship as a conversation and information as having value.
In each case, the students present information relevant to their research because
of the informational value and the connection to their own research, not because
of the need to meet specific source requirements.

    A final success of the Preliminary Research Sequence is demonstrated through
the way students used common Internet sources in their work. With no source
requirements for the proposal, students' inclusion of sources demonstrated
their critical thinking and their progress with the Framework for IL's threshold
concepts. The semester theme of surveillance and mass media purposely led to
research topics that both engaged students in their research and required more
skillful IL skills since, in the words of one frustrated student, "everybody's ana-
lyzing Beyonce's music, not her Twitter feed!" Thus, class discussions about the

152
                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

relevance of the sources selected, contrasted with the publisher of the sources
selected, anticipated and acknowledged the use of common Internet sources. In
their proposals, five of the students (21%) made use only of Internet sources
that comprised their primary materials--Twitter feeds, YouTube videos, news
stories, and images. In four of these proposals, students also relied heavily on the
class readings and discussions but did not include secondary sources to expand
their argument; only one student used only the primary materials and did not
incorporate any form of secondary materials. Six of the students (24%) incorpo-
rated common Internet sources that supported their argument, but did so with
targeted source selection. For instance, two students writing on search engines
and surveillance both located and used policies from the search engines discussed
in their proposal. In one instance, this included analysis of the differences in
Google, Yahoo, and Bing's privacy policies and results to a common search across
all three search engines. Another student, writing on government surveillance
of Internet searches, located and incorporated Google's transparency report to
use as evidence in his argument. Two students (8%) relied on reliable Internet
sources viable to their topic, such as the FDIC information on phishing scams in
a proposal about advance-fee email fraud scams and an online English translation
of a 1936 internal Soviet memo about the task of the Glavit. In both cases, the
students were able to locate, read, and comprehend the importance and relevance
of these sources to their research; however, neither student was able to incorpo-
rate the source itself beyond a mention and discussion of the importance of the
source.

    Overall, the Preliminary Research sequence did not perfect students' IL skills
and their use of sources in the capstone project; however, the ways students
handled source inclusion without any requirements to guide their decisions
demonstrates a keener understanding of source use in academic scholarship.
Early conversations about Wikipedia, for example, made students more aware
of why the source is less acceptable in their capstone project and students were
able to use more sophisticated sources, whether academic or targeted and spe-
cific Internet sources. The number of students using academic sources in their
capstone projects was smaller than anticipated; however, the greater take-away
from those who did use academic sources is that with better instruction, guided
by the Framework for ILs, these students begin to recognize the role of scholarly
research in academic projects independent of project requirements. In a similar
way, this instruction improves the Internet sources selected for academic projects
as students come to understand the role of sources in their research and learn
to look more critically at the sources they read for preliminary research and the
sources they use for academic writing.

                                                                                                 153

KEYS TO SUCCESS

The assignment sequence presented above is not the only option for incorpo-
rating successful preliminary research into a course. Patrick Corbett's (2010)
"What about the `Google Effect'?" presents a similar approach to focusing stu-
dents on the research task separate from a formal writing task. Corbett incor-
porates more formal writing assignments throughout the semester, but focuses
these on the work completed with the narrowed research. The build up to more
formal research, Corbett reports, allows students "to take chances with their
ideas that they otherwise would not have taken for fear of a harsh evaluation"
(p. 273). The chances Corbett's students willingly take reflect the chances my
own students take during their preliminary research when the current research
assignment, not the final, formal paper is at stake. Other sequences can aid the
teaching of IL and helping students internalize a more robust process that moves
from initial curiosity to narrowed research questions. Rachel Rains Winslow,
Sarah Skripsky and Savannah Kelly's chapter on Zotero in this collection offers
other ways of thinking about source use and offers another layer for teaching
source browsing, specifically. These varied research assignments can each assist
students in taking risks with early research--research that greatly benefits stu-
dents when the final product becomes the later course focus.

    The Preliminary Research Sequence engages student in research separate
from the formal assignment, which furthers students' IL skills by building on
their everyday research skills. Library databases do not need to be the starting
point for academic research; such a new method of research at the beginning
of an academic project can intimidate students, especially those in core classes
conducting academic research for the first time. Preliminary research that begins
with the students' existing IL skills boosts confidence by reassuring them that
they do know how to begin research. Confidence in the research starting point
encourages students to try new things. Similarly, scaffolding the assignments
so that students learn more efficient methods for searching Google well before
beginning any required library research further boosts their confidence, while
also teaching students how to locate information more effectively. Starting with
Google also builds confidence in reading comprehension as students begin with
more general sources and the knowledge they must discuss their findings in
class. The more students internalize information from sources, rather than just
annotating or copying it for later use, the more confident they become in their
research and defining their own next steps.

    The Preliminary Research Sequence also teaches students the recursive nature
of research and strategies for later research. I encourage students who find them-
selves stalled by a portion of their final research assignment to return to the Nar-
rowed Focus and Source Trails looking specifically for information related to this

154
                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

stall. Taking this smaller question through the research helps students locate more
specific information for the paper and further emphasizes their ability to recognize
the need for new information as appropriate in the midst of writing the paper.

CONCLUSION

The academic research paper remains the most common assignment in higher
education and access to more information quickly does not make locating
research easier for students. If anything, the abundance of readily available infor-
mation makes the research process more difficult, adding additional pressure
to the task of writing the 8-10 page assignment with the appropriate number
and type of sources. Delaying the formal assignment and incorporating a series
of preliminary research assignments furthers students IL skills by emphasizing
research as a way to find a narrowed topic and sources from which students
select the most appropriate to their work, not the first few they locate. Alone,
delaying the formal paper does not help students understand the importance of
early research; students also need the work put into this early research to reflect
in their semester grade a percentage that emphasizes the importance educators
place on conducting in-depth research to find the paper topic. As long as edu-
cators emphasize only the final product, both in the classroom and the grading
scheme, students will continue research with that emphasis in mind. Showing
students the importance of preliminary research will not instill in them the
scholar's passion for research, but may, for the duration of the semester, engage
them with a topic narrow and interesting enough to instill in them IL skills ben-
eficial to their academic, professional, and everyday life.

APPENDIX A: PRELIMINARY RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT

    Goal: Locate research on surveillance and write an informal analysis of your
findings.

    Task: Search for sources you would use to discuss the topic of surveillance.
As you search, create a map of your search that includes specific information
on search engines you use, keywords, usefulness of the search, websites visited,
key information learned, questions raised, problems encountered, and any other
information relevant to the search. [You should be able to hand your map to a peer
who can completely retrace your steps and learn the same things you learned.]

    Time frame: Long enough to be able to discuss the topic knowledgeably in
class.

    Task Part 2: Using your search map, write an informal analysis of the infor-
mation search. Your analysis should discuss what you learned, where you learned
the information, effectiveness of keywords, problems encountered, questions

156
                                                                Preliminary Paths to Information Literacy

raised, relevance and credibility of sources, and anything else you found relevant
to your search. This should be approximately 2 pages of text.

    Formatting: Double-spaced, 12 point font. Include a paper heading that
includes your name, my name, the course number and section, date. Use the
assignment number and title for the title of your paper.

    Turn in:
      · A hard copy of your search map
      · A printed copy of your information analysis
      · Final Reminders and Assessment
      · This is your homework and attendance verification for class.
      · To receive an "adequate" rating, your information search must demon-
         strate you completed the search and familiarized yourself with the
         websites in order to write the analysis, but the familiarization and
         analysis are relatively superficial.
      · To receive an "above average" rating, your information search must
         demonstrate that you delved further into the search (e.g., visited links
         beyond the first page of Google) and further explored the links to
         write the analysis.
      · To receive an "outstanding" rating, your information search demon-
         strates a broader search for understanding of surveillance (relying on
         more than just Google for your search) and further research when
         needed (knowing who compiled the page, potential bias of the page,
         etc.) to write your analysis.

APPENDIX B: NARROWED RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT

    Goal: Locate research on a course-related topic of interest and write an infor-
mal analysis.

    Task: Select a topic of interest related to our course theme and use Google's
advanced search options to locate relevant research to your topic. As you search,
create a map of your search that includes specific information on your advanced
searches (e.g. tell me what exact phrases you searched and/or what words you
omitted), usefulness of the search, websites visited, key information learned,
questions raised, problems encountered, and any other information relevant to
the search. [You should be able to hand your map to a peer who can completely
retrace your steps and learn the same things you learned.]

    Time frame: Long enough to be able to discuss your topic knowledgeably in
class.

APPENDIX C: SOURCE TRAILS ASSIGNMENT

    Goal: Learn to read a bibliographic entry, use the library's Interlibrary loan sys-
tem, and expand your research on your specific surveillance and mass media topic.

    Task: You will search for additional scholarly sources related to your research
using four methods: reference pages from current research, the library's book
and journal databases, Google Scholar's "cited by," and Google Scholar's "related
articles." You will locate at least ten new sources, create progressive citations
(author, title, year, search location) from these sources, and request unavailable
articles through Interlibrary Loan.

    Time frame: This week's lab will be a hands on workshop on using the fea-
tures and the Interlibrary loan request page. You will submit your progress on
this assignment at the beginning of class Wednesday and Friday.

    Bibliography Trails: Begin your source trails with the bibliographies for the
research you collected during the library database workshop. You want to use the
sources you've read and rated as helpful to your research. Look through the bib-
liographies and/or notes where the author(s) provide bibliographic information
for their references. Mark all sources that have titles that indicate they may be
helpful to your research, and indicate with your markings whether these sources
are books, scholarly journal articles, or websites. Your focus for this assignment
is on the books and scholarly articles.

    Once you have marked these sources, create a progressive citations bibliog-
raphy, listing the source in which you found the new sources as the location.
Include at least the author's name for the location, but if you have more than one
source from the same article, list the first few words of the title as well.

    Library Searching: Use your progressive citations to locate the sources you
have access through via the university databases. Some of these may be readily
available through the databases, but others will require you to use the library's
search option. When you search, you will sometimes receive a list of scholarly
articles related to your search. If you receive such a list, add relevant articles to
your progressive citations and include related by with the location (article author
and title you were searching).

    Locate everything you can through the library databases. Download the
scholarly articles you can access and add the database name at the end of your
progressive citation. (Do not replace the original location, but add the database
after this location.) Add call numbers for the books you found available through
the university library.

    Google Scholar: [Read the information below on "cited by" and "related arti-
cles" again before beginning this portion of the research. You want to complete
all three of these processes for each article. Working through all three for one
article before moving on to another article will save you significant time.]

    Continue looking for materials from your progressive citation bibliography
on Google Scholar (scholar.google.com). Continue looking for the articles you
have not found. Placing the title in quotation marks should help Google Scholar
locate the article easily. To the right of the entry will be a listing of where the
article is located if you have access. Pay careful attention to whether the article
is available to you, and whether it is available in an HTML or a PDF format. If
the article is available via PDF, download this, and add Google Scholar to the
end of your location. If available in HTML, add Google Scholar, and then the
web address of the actual source.

    Google Scholar Cited by: Beneath the listing for your source, you will have a
"cited by" link. This link will provide you a list of scholarly articles that include
the article you searched in their bibliography. Follow this link and read through

                                                                                                 159

the titles and blurbs provided for the results. Add relevant articles to your pro-
gressive citations using the location format above using the article title/author
you searched and Google Scholar as your location. Be sure to add "Cited by" at
the end of this location and, if you have access to this article, additional infor-
mation listed above.

    Google Scholar Related Articles: Google Scholar listings will include a "related
articles" link beside the "cited by" link. This link will show you other articles
Google determines are related to your source. Read through these results for
your articles and, again, add relevant articles to your progressive citation bibli-
ography using the format above and including "related articles" in the location.

    Interlibrary Loan (ILL) Requests: You should request any remaining scholarly
articles from your bibliography through Interlibrary Loan. Before you make a
request, make certain the article is not available through any means listed above.
The best way to do this (and the most efficient for requesting materials via ILL)
is to search the library databases for the article again. If the database has the
information, it will auto-fill your request. Once you have completed requesting
your remaining articles, log in to ILL system via the Interlibrary loan link on the
library homepage or directly through your web browser. Print a copy of the "Out-
standing Requests" page and submit this with your bibliography. This is the page
that automatically loads when you login to ILL. You may also navigate to this
page by selecting the link under the "View" menu on the left-hand side menu.

    Formatting: Double-spaced, 12 point font. Include a paper heading that
includes your name, my name, the course number and section, date. Use the
assignment number and title for the title of your paper.

APPROXIMATING THE
UNIVERSITY: THE INFORMATION
LITERACY PRACTICES OF
NOVICE RESEARCHERS

Karen Gocsik
University of California-San Diego

Laura R. Braunstein and Cynthia E. Tobery
Dartmouth College

In a seminal essay, David Bartholomae (1985) asserts that novice writers need
to "invent the university by assembling and mimicking its language" (p. 135),
noting that they do so by various "successive approximations" of academic con-
ventions and practices:

         What our beginning students need to learn is to extend them-
         selves, by successive approximations, into the commonplaces,
         set phrases, rituals and gestures, habits of mind, tricks of
         persuasion, obligatory conclusions and necessary connections
         that . . . constitute knowledge within the various branches of
         our academic community. (p. 146)

    Instructors and librarians who work with beginning academic writers con-
firm Bartholomae's assertion. Michelle Simmons (2005) has described how
beginning researchers are outsiders to disciplinary discourse, arguing that tra-
ditional approaches to information literacy (IL), such as the "one-shot" library
instruction session, may put these students at a disadvantage. In Simmons's
view, novice writers need to see research "not as a task of collecting information
but instead as a task of constructing meaning" (p. 299). Simmons argues for crit-
ical IL, which is not merely a matter of acquiring context-independent research
skills, but of "learning . . . discursive practices within the context of an academic
discipline" (p. 299). Our research asks how, precisely, novice writer-researchers
go about inventing the university before they have an understanding of the disci-
plines in which they are asked to work. In other words, through which particular

"successive approximations" do students transform information into meaningful
disciplinary knowledge? Our careful coding of a collaborative wiki project across
several years suggests that novice writers in the first steps of knowledge construc-
tion tend to mimic the structures of knowledge, rather than to create coherent
narratives of understanding. This finding has implications not only for how we
understand student learning, but also for how we teach students to find, make
sense of, and compose knowledge.

CONTEXT AND AIMS

This particular project situates itself within Rolf Norgaard's call to "write infor-
mation literacy"--a call for Writing Studies and IL professionals to co-envision
and co-shape the instructional practices of composition and research (2003).
While presenting his call, Norgaard identifies two key misconceptions about
both writing and IL--first, that IL, like writing, is often viewed as a technical
skill that is merely functional or performative; and second, that IL skills, like
writing skills, are perceived to be lacking among our incoming students when
in fact these students bring rich and complicated practices with them to the
university (Norgaard, 2003). As instructors and researchers, we found ourselves
preoccupied by these problems. Like other scholars (Fister, 2013; Melzer &
Zemliansky, 2003; Fister, 1995) we had long recognized the first-year research
paper as a problematic "performance"--not of knowledge but, as Bartholomae
suggests, of the approximation of knowledge. We also realized that students were
drawing from an established variety of research practices by which they were
(productively or not) inventing their university (see Biddix et al. 2011; Corbett
2010; Head & Eisenberg, 2009; McClure & Clink, 2009). Informed also by the
"think aloud" protocols that had been employed most notably by Linda Flower
and John Hayes (1981), we aimed to develop a project that would help us make
visible the research and compositional decisions of our novice writers, teasing
out their various threads, uncovering what patterns of practice these novices were
employing, and then exploring with them how these practices were facilitating
or obstructing their learning. Bolstered further by the work that the Council of
Writing Program Administrators (WPA) had done in defining its outcomes for
first-year composition in 2000 and 2008, and also by the work that the Associa-
tion of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) had done to develop its IL com-
petency standards (2000), we sought a project that would help us map how our
students work to construct knowledge from information--a project that might
then assist us in reforming our research and writing instruction from the more
traditional product-oriented model to a process model that situated research as
both a generative and rhetorical endeavor.

    Our aspirations were supported and informed by the particular structures of
our institutional environment. While the tensions between the fields of Writing
Studies and IL have been well documented (see Ivey, 2103; Meulemans & Carr,
2013; Kotter, 1999; among others), our work benefitted from an institutional
"Kairos" (Baker & Gladis; Chapter 16, this collection; Norgaard, 2004) afforded
by the fact that our library, our writing program, and our far-reaching teaching
and learning center were aligned in their commitment to developing pedagogies
that positioned writing as inquiry and research as rhetorical. We had in place
the various criteria that Ruth Ivey (2013) acknowledges as central to a working
collaboration: shared, commonly defined goals; trust and respect; competent
partners; and ongoing, institutionally sustained conversation. Though many
classes at our institution still embrace the sort of methods that Norgaard (2003)
describes--where research papers are assigned and assessed as products rather
than by the processes that informed them, and literacy is measured (at least
in part) by how correctly one's sources are cited--we were able to develop our
teaching and research in a climate where Writing Studies and IL colleagues met
regularly, both informally and in regular professional development workshops,
to discuss how our methods and pedagogies might inform each other. This wiki
project--undertaken by a writing instructor, a librarian, and an educational
developer from the teaching and learning center--was an outgrowth of these
conversations about writing, research, and learning.

THE ASSIGNMENT

The aim of the assignment, given to international students in a first-year devel-
opmental writing class, was to chart the successive approximations of disci-
plinary discourse that novices make as they find, assess, and use information
to construct knowledge (see Appendix A). In particular, we were attempting to
discern to what degree students search strategically, practice research as inquiry,
and appropriately contextualize and construct knowledge--three of the six
"threshold concepts" articulated in the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education (ACRL, 2015). To assess these student practices, we asked the
students over the course of a weekend to collaborate on a Wikipedia-style article
on a subject that they knew little about--in this case, the history of Christi-
anity in Early America. We gave them a reading to get them started, and then
instructed them to use any credible source that would help them to build an
article (which we refer to, in the assignment, as a "narrative"). We required only
that they compose collaboratively, using the wiki tool embedded in the course's
learning management system, and that they list the sources they used in a sepa-
rate "sources" file.

                                                                                                 165
Gocsik, Braunstein, and Tobery

    In line with evolving IL practices (see Artman et al. 2010; Jacobs & Jacobs,
2009; Curzon, 2004), ours was not a "one-shot" assignment; rather, it con-
stituted the inaugural step in the course's ongoing, sequenced instruction
in research and writing. As the first, foundational step in that process, the
assignment was also intended as a way that the students, the librarian, and
the instructor might be challenged to re-envision and re-articulate the entire
research process. Pedagogically, the assignment was challenging, deliberately
designed to ask more of students than they would be able to manage. These
first-year students, while intelligent, were at the very start of their academic
careers and had little awareness of the academic practices through which
knowledge is constructed. Moreover, as international students, they were only
beginning to familiarize themselves with American history and culture. In this
light, the assignment was designed to be an exercise in structured failure--an
exercise by which students would confront and then assess the efficacy of the
strategies that they use, or don't use, to construct knowledge. In completing
the assignment and undergoing the subsequent debriefing discussion with both
the instructor and the course's embedded librarian, students would begin to
develop an understanding of research and writing as recursive processes that
mirror and inform each other.

    Over the six years that we ran this assignment (2006-2012), we engaged in
ongoing, informal assessments of the assignment's success. As we did, we noted
intriguing patterns in the ways that students were constructing knowledge.
We ascertained that students were approximating knowledge more than they
were constructing it--that is, while students organized information by creating
headings and sub-headings so that their discussion seemed to cohere (thereby
approximating what one might find in an encyclopedia entry), they were unable
to construct a coherent, knowledgeable summary of the material at hand. We
suspected that the assignment, though too small to enable us to draw definitive
conclusions, could offer us a rich source of data that might illuminate how nov-
ice writers and researchers shape their understanding of an unfamiliar topic. As
we considered the assignments' results collectively, we found ourselves returning
to two important questions:

      · What research and composing practices do student writers draw
         upon when they are engaged in the very first steps of knowledge
         construction?

      · How do novices mask inadequacies in their knowledge as they attempt
         to approximate academic conversations?

    To answer these questions, we decided to investigate further the three capa-
bilities that the assignment was designed to assess: selecting and using sources;

166
                                                                              Approximating the University

assembling knowledge via basic compositional moves; and applying organiza-
tional strategies.

METHODS

In order to quantify the patterns and trends we were seeing in these three areas,
we developed four distinct systems for coding: we coded for selection of sources,
for use of sources, for compositional "moves," and for organizational strategies.
When coding the selection of sources in the sources file, for example, we counted
print sources (albeit few) and enumerated the different types of web sources that
students chose: namely, Wikipedia, online library resources, and commercial,
organizational, and personal websites. When coding students' use of sources in
the collaboratively written wiki article, we were inspired by the Citation Project,
a multi-year, multi-institution research study that is examining sources and cita-
tions in first-year writing (see What is the Citation Project? [n.d.]; Howard et al.,
2010); by Randall McClure and Kellian Clink's study of student research prac-
tices (2008); and by the work of Barbara Fister (1992) and Cynthia Haller (2010),
who employed interviews and speak-aloud protocol in order to conceptualize stu-
dents' research processes. Our coding determined whether students were copying
material directly from a source, with or without attribution; whether they were
paraphrasing source material; or whether they were patchwriting, that is, "repro-
ducing source language with some words deleted or added, some grammatical
structures altered, or some synonyms used" (Howard et al., 2010, p. 181). Studies
similar to ours--in that they employed coding or other forms of critical analysis
to conceptualize novice research practices--are prevalent in this volume, includ-
ing the work of Scheidt et al., who coded research interviews; Wojahn et al., who
coded students' research journals and reflective essays; and Blackwell-Starnes,
who used RAP (Research Aloud Protocol) to determine various elements in a
students' research process, including what role the assignment plays and to what
degree the research process focuses on the final product.

    When coding for compositional moves, we examined the seven discrete wiki
articles, along with all their iterations. The wikis were produced in consecutive
fall terms by new classes of 16 first-year composition students; however, we were
unable to code the wiki produced in the fall of 2007 due to a malfunction of the
course management system. Each wiki went through a number of iterations or
drafts, ranging from 66 to 131 in total, with the average number of drafts being
89 (each student therefore averaging 5.5 contributions). In order to code the
wikis, we looked at every draft, each of which was saved by the course manage-
ment system with changes highlighted by the system. As we coded, we compared
each saved version of the document to the previous version and noted whether

                                                                                                 167
Gocsik, Braunstein, and Tobery

students were constructing knowledge by adding, deleting, moving, or revising
materials. Added materials were then coded more specifically according to type:

      · Content appearing in paragraph form
      · Content appearing in bullet form
      · Headings and subheadings
      · Table of contents
      · New entries in an existing table of contents
      · Transitions
      · Quotations/photos/videos

    The coding categories were chosen after sections were analyzed by different
researchers on the team; notes were then compared to normalize the coding
process. The original coding scheme included subcategories for deletions as well,
but deletions were so uncommon that all types of deletions were combined into
one category during the analysis. All the versions for a given year were coded by
the same person.

    Finally, when coding students' overall organizational strategies, we noted
where students were organizing material via chronology (arranging material
roughly by date but without working to create a coherent narrative), classifica-
tion (arranging material into categories and subcategories), narrative (arranging
material into a coherent story), or analysis (arranging material around a claim,
supported by evidence).

    To better understand the students' attitudes toward their completed work,
we developed for our final group of students an anonymous survey which asked
them to assess the quality of their work according to the standards that Wikipe-
dia uses for feature articles, including whether the article is well-written; focused
and relevant; useful; comprehensive; well-researched; of an appropriate length;
neutral; and appropriately structured (Featured Article Criteria, 2013). We used
the students' assessment of their work as a starting point for the debriefing dis-
cussion that we held in class.

RESULTS AND INTERPRETATION

Finding and Using Information

The original goal of the wiki assignment was to diagnose students' baseline
research skills in order to design library instruction more effectively (see Braun-
stein, 2009). From 2006, when the project was first assigned, the instructor and
the librarian envisioned library research instruction as a collaborative, course-­
integrated process, anticipating recommendations in the literature of both IL

and Writing Studies (see Artman et al., 2010; Barratt et al., 2008; McClure &
Clink, 2008, among others). Given that we deliberately did not schedule a library
instruction session until after the assignment was completed, we were not sur-
prised to find that students relied on the search tools they knew: Google and
Wikipedia. Of more interest to us were the sites the students found and selected
to use as sources, as shown in Table 8.1, and their expressed rationale for doing
so in our post-assignment discussion. (See Appendix B for examples of the source
types. Note that not all material in the document was cited in the source file.)

    What concerned us about these sources was not that students overwhelmingly
used websites rather than library resources (an outcome we expected), but that
they so rarely analyzed the material they found. As McClure and Clink (2008)
also found in their study, our students were adept at finding information, but
struggled to determine its credibility in terms of authority, bias, and relevance. To
address this challenge, students used their own criteria for evaluating a source's
credibility. Two examples demonstrate the mixed success of this approach.

    First, students from several different classes cited a page from Stanford Uni-
versity's archive of the papers of Martin Luther King, Jr. (Figure 8.1). The item
turns out to be a class paper on the Great Awakening that King wrote as a semi-
narian. When questioned regarding this choice during our debriefing discussion,
students replied that they thought any ".edu" website was authoritative, since, to
them, it appeared to have been written by a professor. They were unfamiliar with
the concept of digital archives and other materials being hosted by an academic
institution--or that ".edu" sites could just as likely be authored by students
like themselves. This site seemed authoritative to them for another reason: these
international students came from countries in which Christianity was by no

means a common religious culture. Most had never heard of figures such as Jon-
athan Edwards, nor were they familiar with Protestant sectarianism in colonial
America. But they had heard of Martin Luther King, Jr.

    A second example of students using their own criteria to evaluate sources
involved the persistent (yearly) appearance of a page from Theopedia, on Cal-
vinism (currently the second result in a Google search on "Calvinism") (Figure
8.2). In the years that we were employing this assignment, a striking visual sim-
ilarity existed between Theopedia and Wikipedia--a similarity that springs from
the practice of Wikimedia Foundation, creator of Wikipedia, freely distributing
its engine, MediaWiki, to other groups to create collaborative encyclopedias. But
clicking on "About Theopedia" reveals that the site is an "evangelical encyclopedia
of Biblical Christianity," and that "Editors/Users are required to personally affirm
the entirety of the primary statement of faith," which includes a commitment to
Calvinism ("About Theopedia," n.d.). Students had not investigated this informa-
tion. In fact, they declared in the debriefing discussion that they were unaware
that an "About" link exists on many websites. Accordingly, they were unable to

place this information in its proper context--to understand how it was produced,
by whom, and for what purpose. Together, the frequent appearance of the King
paper and the Theopedia article moved us to consider how a limited understand-
ing of contexts for writing might affect students' basic IL competencies.

    Preliminary results from the Citation Project confirm our finding that first-
year students struggle with context in researched writing, noting that they tend
to copy, paraphrase, and patchwrite, with little or no summary of the sources
they use. In terms of their interaction with sources, the Citation Project found
that students are "not writing from sources; they are writing from sentences selected
from sources" (Howard et al., 2010, p. 187, emphasis in original). Put another
way, students are selecting pieces of information to use as they compose, but
they are not considering that information in terms of the larger argument being
made. The results--at least, in our students' work--included not only a demon-
strated failure to assess a source's credibility and to represent that source fairly,
but also an inability to integrate information gathered from sources into a coher-
ent argument of their own. An analysis of the 2010 assignment (an example rep-
resentative of all years) showed that the students' text was almost entirely copied
or patchwritten from the websites cited in their sources file (see Table 8.2).

    From one perspective, the student writing may appear to be simple plagia-
rism. Yet as Rebecca Moore Howard et al. (2010) suggest in their study of a set

                                                                                                 171

of papers from first-year writing, when faced with a report-style assignment on
an unfamiliar topic in a general composition course, "students might not have
had the vocabulary and background knowledge necessary to do anything but
patchwrite the passages" (p. 188). They may also lack the expert reading strate-
gies that enable them to make sense of the sources that they are working with.
Students do not engage in the "meta-reading" practices that expert readers rou-
tinely engage in. In particular, students are unable not only to position sentences
and other source fragments as part of a larger argument, as Howard suggests,
they are also unable to position a source into a larger and ongoing conversation,
both historical and disciplinary. Nor are they reading with compositional or
rhetorical purposes in mind. Haller (2010, p. 38-39), makes the point that the
rhetorical reader ". . . inhabits his [sic] sources as a rhetorical partner, rather
than simply sampling from them for facts and evidence." As we argue here, first-
year students who are not yet academic or disciplinary insiders make "successive
approximations" in constructing knowledge. Could patchwriting be one step on
the way to developing disciplinary discourse, as Howard et al. suggest? Could
reading rhetorically enable students to inhabit more fully the sources they are
using, thereby encouraging them not only to better understand a source's argu-
ment but also to grasp the ways in which one source informs, responds to, or
otherwise relates to a larger ongoing argument?

Assembling Knowledge via Compositional "Moves"

In addition to the copious patchwriting described above, what struck us imme-
diately about the assignments as artifacts of student writing was how rarely

172

      Figure 8.3. Compositional moves by year, 2006-2012. Note: In 2011 and
   2012, the students were asked to use the Comments field in the wiki to write

              instructions to each other during the composition process.

students revised their work. In order to understand students' composing prac-
tices better, we coded the assignments to quantify two essential aspects of the
composing process: 1) how often students added content, and of what kind,
and 2) how often students edited content, and whether they edited primarily
by deleting, reorganizing, or revising. The numbers demonstrate the students'
compositional practices, in terms of individual classes and collectively (see
Figures 8.3 and 8.4). Clearly these novice writers were adding content far
more often than any other composing activity. Equally interesting is what
students were not doing: overall, they were not revising to make better connec-
tions across information; they were not often deleting irrelevant information;
and they were infrequently reordering information to strengthen coherence.
In sum, they were not restructuring or transforming information into mean-
ingful knowledge.

    This propensity to add--rather than to delete or reorganize or otherwise
revise--is open to several interpretations. One way of understanding this pat-
tern is to embrace Nancy Sommers' understanding that revision is, for nov-
ice writers, an afterthought. Sommers (1980) contends that a key difference
between novice and expert writers is that experts understand revision as part of a
"recursive process" (p. 386) that enables the discovery and creation of meaning,
"finding the form or shape of their argument" (p. 384), while novice writers
understand revision as a final step in a linear process--a last item on their list
of "things to do." Certainly this attitude was in play with our students: when

                                                                                                 173
Gocsik, Braunstein, and Tobery

                Figure 8.4. Compositional moves, all years combined.

revision did occur in the wiki, it tended to happen much later in the composing
process rather than throughout.

    Another possible explanation for this lack of revision is that these students,
as novices, are working at lower levels of critical thinking--in particular, those
defined by Benjamin Bloom in his original taxonomy of Knowledge, Compre-
hension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, and Evaluation (Anderson & Sosniak,
1994, p. 15-25). In other words, students are collecting information, but they
are not comprehending (or analyzing, or synthesizing) their sources. (On the
mapping of information literacy to cognitive skills, see Keene et al., 2010; Reece,
2005.) Without operating on these sources via higher levels of critical thinking,
students will find it difficult to revise their work. Given the students' selection
of sources, we might also question how closely students are evaluating what
sources they find. While deletion may be evidence that students are evaluating
certain parts of the text and deeming them irrelevant, the infrequency of dele-
tion is potentially troubling, suggesting that these novice writer-researchers may
be struggling with self-evaluation.

    One additional (albeit very different) possibility is that students are hesitant
to edit their peers' work. As we examined the collaborative habits of the stu-
dents--chiefly by noting when and how they wrote instructions to one another
in the infrequently used "Comments" section of the learning management sys-
tem's wiki feature--we discovered that when they did address revision, students

174
                                                                              Approximating the University

were more likely to suggest changes for the original writer than to edit the text
themselves. Could unease with collaborative writing and research have hindered
rather than helped the students in their early construction of knowledge?

Organizational Strategies

The final version of the 2008 assignment appears to demonstrate that students
have created a structured, organized, and comprehensive article, as exhibited
by the table of contents (see Figure 8.5). Yet closer examination of this table of
contents reveals inconsistencies and anachronisms. For instance, Revivalism pre-
cedes Puritanism, and the Jesus Seminar, formed in the 1980s (and mentioned
in the initial reading that students were given), is discussed at length. Problems
of this sort appeared each year--students failed to establish any sort of orga-
nizational strategy that would enable them to produce a focused and coherent
structure. An expert in the discipline of religious history (or even a more mature
thinker) may have been able to eliminate these anachronisms, but these novice
writers did not demonstrate that ability. Year after year, the Jesus Seminar (as one
example) remained stubbornly present as students drafted their articles--one
student would remove the section devoted to the Seminar, and another would
put it back in. Perhaps students were responding to the authority of the assigned
reading without determining the relevance of that reading's component parts. In
other words, the reading assigned by the instructor had a powerful hold over the
context in which the students were composing.

    That these students routinely failed to make relevant the information they were
working with was part of a larger failure that we noted earlier: students were unable
to identify or to provide context for the sources they were using or the information
gathered from those sources. While expert writers may use the practice of composing
to discover relevance and create context, these novice writers composed by dropping
information into the article they were writing without any effort to contextualize it.
If, as Simmons (2005) argues, IL is to move beyond the simple gathering of informa-
tion to help students become critically aware participants in disciplinary discourse,
the ability both to identify and to provide context within academic disciplines is cru-
cial, as the Framework for IL (ACRL, 2015) document confirms.

    An examination of how students structured their articles, version by version,
illuminates much about this failure both to identify and to provide context. When
coding students' overall organizational strategies, we were looking to determine
how often students were organizing material using classification (arranging material
into categories and subcategories), chronology (arranging material roughly by date
but without working to create a coherent narrative), narrative (arranging material
into a coherent story), or analysis (arranging material around a claim, supported by

                                                                                                 175
Gocsik, Braunstein, and Tobery

                Figure 8.5. Final assignment, table of contents, 2008.
evidence). We discovered that students began structuring their articles by arranging
information either by classification or chronology, and that these early strategies
determined later structural choices, to the extent that employing principles of nar-
rative or analysis to arrange the information did not occur.

    One early strategy for arranging materials was to employ classification,
beginning with a definition of a single term. Given that the assignment did ask
students to define terms, this was not surprising. However, in some cases the
term students chose at the outset was wildly irrelevant to the topic of Chris-
tianity in Early America, as we saw in the 2008 project, which began with a
definition of the Pharisees. When students began this way, they kept adding
definitions--Pilgrims, Puritans, Jonathan Edwards, Thomas Jefferson--until a
tipping point was reached. At that point, someone would produce a table of
contents, largely based on the definitions that had already been offered. (While
176
                                                                              Approximating the University

the Pharisees didn't make the final version of the article, the term had surprising
tenacity, surviving until halfway through the composing process, when it was
stricken, along with references to Socrates.)

    The students' other beginning strategy was to start with a roughly chrono-
logical table of contents. This strategy determined how the rest of the project
would be organized. In 2010, for example, the first student to create a table
of contents positioned Thomas Jefferson as the key figure through which to
understand Christianity in Early America. The article was essentially divided
into two categories: Christianity before Jefferson, and Christianity as Jefferson
practiced it. They later added a glossary, which accommodated information that
wasn't directly connected to Jefferson. This table of contents did not evolve as
students worked collaboratively on the rest of the article--no one questioned
using Jefferson as the organizing principle; no one substantively revised the table
of contents in order to ensure a more coherent outcome. In both strategies,
classification and chronology, one classmate's initial organizing concept usually
determined the ultimate structure of the project.

    Clearly neither of these two initial strategies was sufficient to ground a coher-
ent final product. This surprised us: we had assumed that students who began
with a table of contents might produce a more coherent article, using that table
of contents as an outline. But this proved not to be the case. As noted earlier,
groups that began with a table of contents often got "stuck," in that one student's
initial structure tended to determine what his or her peers were able to see as rel-
evant. On the other hand, groups that began with definitions, as in 2008, even-
tually developed a table of contents, but one that indicated only a dim grasp of
the topic in that it simply mirrored the (often irrelevant) terms that were already
in place. These strategies of classification and chronology served to mask deeper
problems in the articles' organization of knowledge, offering only the appear-
ance of structure. We wonder if adopting narrative or analysis as organizational
strategies might have yielded more coherent results.

Students' Perspectives on Creating Knowledge

Given our sense of the articles' insufficiencies, we were curious to know whether
or not the students shared our assessment. Prior to the in-class debriefing discus-
sion one year, we surveyed the students, asking them to assess their work based
on criteria adapted from those Wikipedia uses to evaluate its feature articles.
These criteria ask whether or not the article is: well-written; focused and rele-
vant; useful; comprehensive; well-researched; of an appropriate length; neutral;
and appropriately structured ("Featured Article Criteria," 2013). As we can see
from the survey results (Figure 8.6), most students shared our sense that the

                                                                                                 177
Gocsik, Braunstein, and Tobery

                       Figure 8.6. Student survey results, 2010.

articles they produced are not well written, focused, or even useful. But the vast
majority did view the articles as appropriately structured. In our debriefing ses-
sions, we asked students to talk in particular about their organizational strategies
in order to better understand the discrepancy between our assessment of the
articles' structure and theirs. Initially they defended the assessment, citing the
table of contents and the use of headings as evidence that the material was suffi-
ciently organized. We asked them to look more closely at the structure, encour-
aging them in particular to consider how these structures did not yield cohe-
sive discussions of the topic at hand. We further challenged them to consider
why they made almost no effort to integrate information into a narrative even
though the assignment had asked, specifically, that they produce a narrative. We
demonstrated, for instance, how rarely they added transitions between sections.
We noted that we only very occasionally found comments like this one, which
attempts to justify discussing Revivalism before Protestantism: "It is impossible
to understand the religious evolution that led to Revivalism without a very basic
understanding of Protestantism." In the end, students employed transitions only
one percent of the time as a composing strategy.

    In our 2010 debriefing, when we asked the class why they hadn't turned to
narrative as a way of crafting the article, they offered an intriguing response:
they stated that they couldn't create a narrative without having all the knowledge
first. This struck us as a very interesting aspect of the expert/novice divide. As
experts, we regularly rely on narrative as we construct knowledge--shaping nar-
rative helps us determine both what we know and what we need to learn. Our
students, however, were surprised when we asked them why they did not use

178
                                                                              Approximating the University

narration as a knowledge-making tool, declaring that they felt disallowed from
attempting narrative because they didn't know enough yet. Students described
high school courses that relied heavily on the practice of "frontloading," whereby
teachers presented them with information and quizzed them to assess their mas-
tery of that information before asking them (or permitting them) to operate on
that information in any meaningful way. Students had been taught that they
needed to know information before they might comprehend, apply, analyze,
synthesize, or evaluate it (here again we are using the categories from Bloom's
original taxonomy). Students had not yet encountered the idea that applying
information, or analyzing it, or attempting to synthesize it, might be one way of
coming to understand it, to know it.

    We came also to understand from these conversations that these students
had not been taught how to contextualize knowledge, either generally or in the
context of a particular discipline. In high school and even in their introductory
college classes, instructors had done the contextualizing for them, choosing the
works they read and telling them why these works were important. As a result of
their instruction, students had little practice in the sorts of activities that experts
regularly employ, including using narrative and analysis as methods either to
determine relevance to the discussion, or to designate what aspects of a particular
discussion might require more research, evaluation, and inquiry. In the end, this
assignment and its ensuing discussion moved us to consider what aspects of our
own instruction might be binding students to their novice status, keeping them
in a position where they find it difficult to invent the university for themselves.

IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING

While our sample size does not permit us to draw definitive conclusions about
how first-year students construct academic or disciplinary knowledge, our proj-
ect raises intriguing implications for teaching. The assignment not only permit-
ted us to document novice practices, but also helped us better understand the
gap between what our students actually do when they construct knowledge, and
what we expect them to be able to do. In sum, our students looked for information
via search tools like Google. They relied on websites more than they relied on
peer-reviewed articles or books. They used patchwriting to stitch information
loosely together. Perhaps as a result of this patchwriting--composing not from
sources but "from sentences from sources" (Howard et al., 2010, p. 187)--stu-
dents approximated coherent knowledge. In this sense, their "patchwriting"
reflected and perhaps also contributed to a practice of "patchknowing"--another
way of thinking about our students' approximation of knowledge. Students did
not identify or create adequate context for the information they were employing.

                                                                                                 179
Gocsik, Braunstein, and Tobery

Neither did they employ methods of narrative or analysis to stitch together the
patches of information that they had uncovered. They were therefore unable to
develop an internal coherence for their work. In the end, we came to understand
that if first-year students are in fact inventing the university, then that university
is rather tenuously constructed, lacking the disciplinary and cultural contexts
necessary to shape a coherent whole.

    Until they can learn to create knowledge within disciplinary contexts, stu-
dents will remain novices, outsiders to the university and its practices. If they
also lack cultural context, as these students did, then the challenge of coher-
ence becomes even more daunting. As instructors, we must consider how we
can design IL instruction so that students can acquire the tools to understand
and shape (and also revise) knowledge within academic contexts. We might
first consider whether the approximation of knowledge is an important and per-
haps even necessary step in the authentic creation of knowledge. As Howard et
al. (2010) suggest regarding patchwriting, we wonder whether the assembling
of information, even when poorly managed, might offer students an improved
understanding of how knowledge is generated--provided that instructors and
librarians ask students to reflect, collectively, on their practices. Our work also
underscores the observation that Barbara Fister made in her Keynote Address
at the 2013 Library Orientation Exchange (LOEX) conference: research papers
as we've been assigning them in first-year composition classes should be aban-
doned (Fister, 2013). Asking students to enact or perform research prior to the
establishment of disciplinary expertise will prove successful only when, as Fister
notes, that assignment is heavily scaffolded--and, we would add, when one not
only emphasizes process over product but also values failure (which is reflected
upon, analyzed, and collectively discussed) as much as success. Assignments like
ours provide students and instructors the opportunity to make research and
writing practices visible: with instructors and librarians as guides, students can
observe, reflect on, and then assess practices that result in the approximation of
knowledge; instructors and librarians can then guide students to look beyond
these practices, deepening their IL competencies. Instructors can also observe
their own assumptions about student practices, discover any misconceptions
they might have, and revise their instruction accordingly.

    To accomplish this sort of reflective practice among our students, we should
design our research instruction to focus less on what students should know, and
more on how they come to know it. Too often IL instruction focuses on the what--
what search tools and databases to use, what standards we might use to evaluate
a source's credibility, and so on. Focusing our instruction on students' existing
practices, and using these practices as the object of our instruction, is a good
way to initiate a discussion firmly rooted in the how. In this way, our assignment

180
                                                                              Approximating the University

and others like it can encourage students to practice the various "frames" for IL
currently recommended by the ACRL (2015). For instance, through this wiki
exercise students experienced firsthand how resources must be evaluated and
employed based on the context in which the information will be used (Frame
One). Because composing the wiki article is an exercise in structured failure,
students came to understand research as inquiry that depends on "increasingly
complex or new questions whose answers in turn develop additional questions
of lines of inquiry in any field" (Frame Four). Once the assignment was com-
plete, and we had discussed better strategies for finding and composing with
sources, students came to see the search for information as a strategic explora-
tion, realizing that searching for information requires "the evaluation of a range
of . . . sources and the mental flexibility to pursue alternate avenues as new
understanding develops" (Frame Six).

    In sum, as we develop our students' IL practices, we will need to partner in
order to develop ways to help our students move from the methods novices use
to construct knowledge to the methods experts use. We should design assign-
ments that engage students in the kinds of strategies that experts use to contex-
tualize information and to create new knowledge within their fields. We should
demonstrate how experts use information to create questions, or to point to areas
for additional research. We might demonstrate how employing the principles of
narrative helps experts determine what information is relevant or irrelevant to
their investigations. We might also show how employing analysis encourages the
logical connections between bits of information that enhance coherence within
expert writing and research. Whatever assignments we design, our aim should
be to move students from their novice approximation of knowledge, toward the
invention of an authentic university to which they can contribute, and in which
they might thrive.

Following a troubling assessment of a writing course in which fewer than one
third of students proved competent or above in integrating research, compo-
sition instructors and a research librarian created new approaches to teaching
research and initiated a study exploring students' information literacies: what
students understand and what they don't, what works for them, what doesn't.
In part, the study responds to Rebecca Moore Howard, Tanya K. Rodrigue, and
Tricia C. Serviss's (2010) call to gather "more information about what students
are actually doing with the sources they cite" (p. 179). The study also interro-
gates approaches for increasing student information literacy (IL) by providing a
deeper understanding--from the students' own perspectives--of the ways stu-
dents interact with and view sources as they are learning to perform academic
research and writing.

    From a series of studies (e.g., Head & Eisenberg, 2010a; Head & Eisenberg,
2010b; McClure & Clink, 2009; Head, 2008; Head, 2007; Barefoot, 2006;
Byerly, Downey & Ramin, 2006; Caspers & Bernhisel, 2005) as well as our own

practice, we know that students struggle with much more than properly docu-
menting their sources. They are also challenged with finding credible and rele-
vant sources for varied purposes; considering ways to use source material for rhe-
torical aims; knowing how, when, and why to summarize, paraphrase, or quote
while retaining their own voice in their essays; and performing other demanding
practices affiliated with IL. These are tall orders for students required to develop
a sense of the published conversations addressing issues within a given commu-
nity--and then to contribute to that conversation (ACRL, 2015; Bizup, 2008).
Even when we possess relevant expertise, we academics find offering unique con-
tributions to conversations within our disciplines difficult. However, as the new
Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (IL Framework) (ACRL,
2015) suggests, disciplinary faculty and librarians should help students realize
that, by researching, they are seeing published work as people's thoughts and
voices in conversation. This lesson is a first step toward encouraging students
to consider--if not offer--their own thoughts to ideas raised in publications
(ACRL, 2015).

    All of these aspects are a challenge to teach, particularly in first-year compo-
sition courses. With a widespread focus on research in first-year composition,
we still know little about what helps students understand the value and practices
of academic research and writing. As Rafaella Negretti (2012) states, "research
investigating how students learn to write academically has often neglected the
students' own experiences" (p. 145). To begin to explore student experiences
in researching for the purposes of writing their own argumentative essays, our
study first looks at how students consider and discuss issues related to seeking,
evaluating, selecting, and incorporating sources into their own texts in prog-
ress. Toward that end, we first created Research Diary prompts and analyzed
responses from students in two first-year composition sections. These prompts,
created by the research librarian and composition instructors, were aimed at
raising self-awareness as well as scaffolding research processes. Serving as pre-
and post- measures, the first and last diary prompts asked students to report on
research practices, how they select what information to include, and how they
feel about researching.

    We also examined what students in four sections of first-year composition
said about their writing and research processes at the semester's end. In essays
reflecting on their semester-long research-based project, do they identify smaller
research-related activities or other aspects of the course as most useful as they
research and write? What specific processes contributed to their final, research-
based product?

    At a time when national studies are identifying trends in students' use of infor-
mation, we also aimed to see what pedagogical implications and interventions

our findings from the students themselves might suggest. Through our study,
we offer readers an opportunity to see how the deliberate inclusion of reflective
writings can provide a clearer picture of student processes and perceptions, with
implications for a curricular emphasis on critical, reflexive IL--all made possible
at our institution through a collaboration between the university library and the
writing program.

REVIEW OF LITERATURE: LIBRARY AND
COMPOSITION SCHOLARS JOINING FORCES

In this section, we review literature from library and composition scholars work-
ing together to integrate IL while developing curricula, emphasizing rhetorical
purposes for using information from sources, and/or helping students work with
and understand information from sources.

Integrating IL and Composition

Rather than simply focusing on arranging a one-shot library visit for a given
class, librarians and faculty can work in conjunction to extend library instruc-
tion directly into courses across the curriculum (Artman et al., 2010). Research
suggests that faculty can best move beyond treating IL as an "add-on" (see, e.g.,
Artman, Frisicaro-Pawlowski & Monge, 2010; Mounce, 2010; Jacobs, 2008;
Deitering & Jameson, 2008; Brasley, 2008; and Norgaard, 2003) when they tap
into the valuable resources available through librarians in their midst. Librarians
tend to value these targeted opportunities for building alliances across campus
that draw from their IL expertise (ACRL, 2015).

    The new Framework for IL asks librarians to employ their unique expertise
to help faculty build curricula enriched with attention to IL (ACRL, 2015).
One approach growing in popularity involves a librarian and an instructor
working together to develop online "library guides" offering relevant data-
bases and suitable resources for specific courses, a practice already working
well at our institution. Additional methods have been employed at other insti-
tutions (Hutchins, Fister & MacPherson, 2002). For example, incorporating
values of IL explicitly into library sessions through surveys and "learning cir-
cle" reflective activities has proven successful (Holliday & Fagerheim, 2006).
Rhea J. Simmons and Marianne B. Eimer (2004) explain how librarians at
their institution collaborated with faculty to promote students' ownership of
the processes of finding, identifying, and evaluating sources, especially as stu-
dents "teach back" to the instructor what they have learned (p. 1-2). Their
results reveal the importance of helping students articulate and reflect on

                                                                                                 187
Wojahn et al.

the processes by which they integrate sources into their work. Articulating
choices made while researching can help students "begin to recognize the sig-
nificance of the creation process, leading them to increasingly sophisticated
choices when matching information products with their information needs,"
and identifying how the efficacy of particular practices can vary from context

to context (ACRL, 2015).

    Librarians and writing instructors can work together in numerous ways. One
model places an instructor and librarian into a first-year composition course
as co-teachers (Peary & Ernick, 2004). Elsewhere, librarians and Multimedia
Writing and Technical Communication faculty jointly oversee students assigned
to create a library portal (D'Angelo & Maid, 2004). Another model calls for
"course-integrated library instruction" in which class assignments are developed
by an instructor who works with a librarian to incorporate effective IL practices
(Artman et al., 2010, p. 102). Because it allows for a collaborative approach
to integrating the mutually informative processes of writing and research, we
see particular promise in this final method. And it is one that we collabora-
tively drew from as we created small, scaffolding assignments asking students to
engage with specific aspects of research as they wrote.

Focusing on Rhetorical Uses of Information from Sources

A number of researchers focus on helping students learn to use information
from sources rhetorically. Cynthia R. Haller (2010) reports on her case study
of three advanced undergraduate students as they approached their research
projects. In particular, Haller notes the extent to which the students employed
sources to achieve specific purposes for their target audience. Another valu-
able approach included shared course readings, selected primarily to provide
disciplinary-­specific knowledge. Drawing from these readings allowed one stu-
dent to position his own argument in the context of an academic conversation,
one in which knowledge claims can be and are disputed. This approach aligns
with the Framework for IL, which argues the importance of exploring and dis-
puting varied claims as a means to "extend the knowledge in [a field]. Many
times, this process includes points of disagreement where debate and dialogue
work to deepen the conversations around knowledge" (ACRL, 2015). Librarians
and faculty alike can highlight articles offering academic conversations in which
varied positions are explored in a well-argued and reasonable manner, helping
students to understand academic work and research as "open-ended exploration
and engagement with information" (ACRL, 2015).

    Such awareness and consideration is the focus of Joseph Bizup's (2008) work

188
                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

toward a "rhetorical vocabulary" based on four "functional roles" for using sources:
background sources, exhibits, argument sources, and method sources. Helping
students identify specific purposes for sources cited in articles can allow them to
see and then employ various options for using sources in academic writing.

    Including attention to rhetorical reasons for incorporating sources can extend
the call in the Framework for IL for a dynamic and flexible approach to informa-
tion use. It can go beyond understanding the purposes, contexts, and audiences
for given source material and motivate student writers to consider multiple aims
for that source material as it is incorporated for their own purposes into their
own work. We can help students with this by highlighting possible contrasts
between original purposes for information shared in sources and the specific
purposes to which the student writers put that information for their own, per-
haps divergent, purposes.

Helping Students Read from Sources

We can help students improve their IL by employing strategies for optimizing
an array of reading strategies, not just writing strategies. Toward that end,
some researchers focus on student understanding of and engagement with
source texts. Working in this direction, the Citation Project researchers ana-
lyze research-supported essays from across the nation with an eye to describing
students' documentation practices, ultimately aiming to help students more
appropriately work with sources. Citation Project leaders such as Howard,
Rodrigue, and Serviss (2010) found that many students are not in fact doing
what could be described as writing based on sources; instead "they are writing
from sentences selected from sources" (p. 187). Findings such as these make us
question the extent to which we are supporting students in reading and com-
prehending source materials prior to using such sources in their own texts. The
student essays the Citation Project researchers reviewed did not indicate that
many students were getting a "gist" of their source material or the sources' key
arguments. These researchers therefore suggest that we spend more time ensur-
ing that students learn to read, understand, and employ sources for their own
use as writers. Emphasizing academic reading strategies can help address other
issues identified by the Citation Project, such as obstacles in understanding
scholarly sources and tendencies toward surface-level reading (see Jamieson,
Chapter 6, this collection).

    Our own study explores in part some of the issues suggested by the studies
mentioned above. Below, we share the methods employed to better understand
student perspectives on how they learn to engage with source materials.

                                                                                                 189

METHODS FOR EXAMINING STUDENT
PERSPECTIVES ON IL

Following others such as Anne-Marie Deitering and Sara Jameson (2008), Steph-
anie Sterling Brasley (2008), Wendy Holliday and Britt A. Fagerheim (2006),
Alexandria Peary and Linda Ernick (2004), and Rhea J. Simmons and Mari-
anne B. Eimer (2004), we--a librarian and writing instructors--collaborated
to address IL issues in our first-year composition course. To begin our effort,
we worked to develop curricula focused on improving students' understanding
of research practices and strategies for integrating research into their own writ-
ing. Specifically, we hoped that by asking students to explicitly reflect on their
research processes, they--as well as we--could identify misunderstanding or
confusion and address issues as, rather than after, they occurred.

    Among the four instructors participating in our study, two worked closely
with the librarian to develop Research Diary assignments, detailed in the
"Research Diaries" section below. From these two instructors' courses, we col-
lected and analyzed student responses. All four instructors were asked to collect
students' final research-supported essays along with reflective essays in which
students discussed the writing and research reflected in their work.

Research Diaries

Following the work of composition scholars such as Robert Detmering and
Anna Marie Johnson (2012) who argue the value of student reflections, we solic-
ited students' perspectives through what we refer to as Research Diary prompts
in two of the four course sections. Working together, the two instructors and
the librarian established a "loose" class focus: population growth, a theme gen-
eral enough to allow for students to investigate issues from disciplinary perspec-
tives or personal interest. Modules were designed to enhance learning related to
research processes and research-supported writing. For instance, the librarian
selected relevant readings written for the general public such as news articles
(from New York Times and New York Times Room for Debate) and magazine arti-
cles (from National Geographic and New Yorker) that addressed specific concerns
of population growth. We decided in the early stages of the semester not to
use academic peer-reviewed journals because many journal articles are too spe-
cialized or complex for students at large. We preferred more accessible articles
allowing students to concentrate on processes of using material. We agreed that
after students experience reading and responding to these more accessible arti-
cles, they can next focus on finding information from more scholarly, though
less widely accessible, sources.

                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

    The Research Diaries consisted of 10 assignments across a 16-week semester.
Main goals of the prompts included helping students reflect on optimizing key-
words in their searches for information; assessing sources of different types (aca-
demic, popular); reading and understanding shared pieces; citing and annotat-
ing resources; integrating key aspects from shared sources into their own quotes,
paraphrases, and summaries; and linking source material to their own thinking
and writing. Each prompt was a low stakes writing assignment asking students
to engage with information or an information resource. Equally important,
instructors could review students' work as students drafted and revised to iden-
tify how they were interacting with specific types of information.

    To get a baseline picture of students' practices related to academic research, the
first prompt, for example, asked about existing research approaches and attitudes:

      · What is your process for doing research on an academic topic about
         which you know very little?

      · How do you decide what information to trust when you are doing
         research?

      · Do you enjoy the research process? Does it frustrate you? Please dis-
         cuss your answers.

      · These same questions were asked in the final Research Diary module
         so we could identify what, if anything, changed.

    Following Haller (2010), we saw value in asking students to incorporate
sources as a class by working first from shared sources. This approach allows
students to share multiple and appropriate options for working with the same
material. To mimic an organic research inquiry process, we provided articles cov-
ering population-related issues that students might find interesting even outside
of the classroom before prompting them to follow up with relevant articles they
found on their own.

    In addition, Research Diary assignments prepared students to optimize a
library instruction session since students had already begun searching for mate-
rials relevant to the focus of their essays and were able to raise challenges that
they were encountering. Responses to prompts also provided access to students'
individual research-related thoughts and processes so instructors and the librar-
ian could discuss misunderstandings and questions about researching in context.
Instructors and the librarian were able to see where and when the students expe-
rienced misconceptions about the search process; they were also able to see first-
hand what resources students were locating and using to support arguments in
their texts. In short, the Research Diaries provided instructors and the librarian
with information that could assist them in identifying problems with students'
research processes as they occurred, rather than after the assignments were due.

                                                                                                 191

Reflective Essays

    From the 53 reflective essays provided by students who gave informed con-
sent in the four target classes, we analyzed responses to determine what students
reported had been helpful to them in completing their research-supported proj-
ects. After collecting quotations from students' reflections and gaining a general
sense of the data, we identified six themes related to what most helped the stu-
dents in working on research integration.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: STUDENT
PROCESSES AND PERCEPTIONS

Here we report on our analysis of Research Diary responses from the two sec-
tions in which the diary prompts were embedded along with our analysis of the
reflective essays gathered from the four sections of first-year composition.

Research Diaries

While final reflective essays, discussed below, provided insights into students'
views of learning to research and write, Research Diary prompts and assign-
ments focused explicitly on smaller, individual steps, aspects that academic
writers typically take into account when researching. Although prompts were
designed to model and teach strategies and to allow students to practice aspects
of the research process, for the purposes of this chapter we focus on responses to
the pre- and post-semester prompt that provided insight into students' evolving
research processes and perceptions. From students' responses to the open-ended
questions about how they approach finding research on topics about which they
know little and then determine whether to trust the sources they find, we are
able to note a number of changes students made in their research repertoires
from the beginning to the end of the course.

Evaluating Credibility of Sources

We were particularly interested in students' decision-making processes in deter-
mining which information to trust and use. One pre- and post- prompt asked
students how they determine which sources to trust. Figure 9.1 shows a compar-
ison of the frequency with which particular factors were mentioned by students
at the beginning of the semester compared to the frequency of these factors
appearing in their responses at the end of the semester.

    Based on categories established for a previous study analyzing criteria students
used in selecting sources for their essays (Westbrock & Moberly, unpublished

192
                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

mss.), we coded student responses to the prompt asking them to report factors
they consider when determining which information to trust. Students' open-
ended responses were coded using the following categories:

      · Support/Relevance--Signified that retrieved information was rele-
         vant to student's argument.

      · Occurrence--Indicated inclination to trust information appearing on
         multiple sites, regardless of the source.

      · Credibility--Indicated inclination to trust information from sources
         establishing credibility through author's organizational affiliation,
         nature of website, author's professional reputation, or presence of cited
         material.

      · Access--Referred to considering information trustworthy depending
         on where they found it, for instance, in books or through the library,
         or from where they initially accessed it (e.g., through a Google search).

      · Rule--Indicated evaluating information students considered abso-
         lutes, often affiliated with terms such as "always," "never," and "only,"
         such as a stated willingness to "only trust sites that end in .gov" or to
         "never trust Wikipedia."

    Taking these categories into account, the main changes in students' reports
occurred in the categories of "occurrence" and "rule" (see Figure 9.1). At the
beginning of the semester, 21% of students included criteria referring to "occur-
rence." By the end of the semester, only 6% of students showed preference for
selection based primarily on popularity. Of course, using "occurrence" as a cri-
terion is not necessarily ineffective (e.g., we are more likely to trust study results
when multiple, trusted researchers report similar results), we note that students'
mention of occurrence was the primary factor that decreased with extra research
instruction.

    We believe this finding should be problematized and discussed explicitly
with students. It is neither a positive nor negative result but one that invites
discussion of source reliability, purpose, and context. As the Framework for IL
suggests, authority is constructed not solely by expertise but in light of "infor-
mation need and context" among different communities with different values
and purposes (ACRL, 2015). Simply noting that many websites, for instance,
say the same thing, is not enough. We need to help students ask questions.
Connecting the criterion of "occurrence" to questions of authority and context
can help students become more nuanced in their selection of reliable sources.
Students can learn to consider that despite the frequent occurrence of a given
piece of information, they should also apply other criteria such as checking the
credentials and affiliations of those providing information, along with context.

                                                                                                 193

                             beginning and end of semester.

    Students' reported reliance on a "rule" such as "trust only web sources ending
with .gov" decreased just slightly at the semester's end. At the beginning of the
semester, 52% of students referred to a "rule" as key when selecting sources;
somewhat fewer--44%--referenced a "rule" at the end of the semester. We see
an important opportunity to discuss this finding with students in a more com-
plex fashion as well, following the call in the Framework for IL to encourage
students to "monitor the value that is placed upon different types of informa-
tion products in varying contexts" and to see research practices as dynamic,
requiring flexibility and open minds (ACRL, 2015). We see value in exploring
rules students have learned from prior classes, with attempts made to examine
possible rationale for rules they have learned such as not using Wikipedia as a
source. Understanding reasons behind rules that might apply appropriately in
some contexts but not others can allow students to overcome fears about Wiki-
pedia and instead feel free to use it as a starting place, finding leads to relevant
information and to sources cited by named authorities.

    With respect to trustworthiness of sources, students at the beginning as well
as the end of the semester mentioned trying to select sources that were credible
more than they did any other factor. However, rather than simply listing cred-
ibility as a factor, students at the end of the semester tended to mention more
concrete elements related to credibility (such as the professional affiliation of the
author, the presence of cited material, and so on) as factors they consider when
selecting sources. The Framework for IL suggests such elements are useful for

194
                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

novices to learn about, though more experienced researchers learn to take into
account how "authority" can vary by community, context, and need (ACRL,
2015).

    Although at the semester's end somewhat fewer students mentioned "access"
(where they started their searches) as a factor they consider when selecting
sources, students who mentioned access at the semester's end tended to provide
more specific examples of where they began their searches (e.g., Academic Search
Premier, Google, Google Scholar). Similarly, some students mentioned trust-
ing information solely because it appears in a book or through other resources
offered by a university library, a notion that we also hope to dispel. Of course,
library-affiliated search engines such as Academic Search Premier can lead stu-
dents to popular if not questionable sources, and even a general Google search
can yield scholarly materials.

    A reduction in reporting "access" as a factor important to search strategies
isn't necessarily seen as an improvement; however, the specificity in students'
responses related to access is an indication to us that students at the semester's
end might have added more resources as access points to their research toolbox.
Students can also learn that despite starting searches via a library-provided data-
base, results will not necessarily provide more reliable information than would
a general Google search. Nonetheless, we do see library-provided databases as
a good first step in intentionally selected starting points that are perhaps more
nuanced but a little less easy to access than Google. We see promise for future
research that tracks whether students move to more sophisticated sources, more
relevant to specific disciplines, as they enter and move through their majors.

    Overall, the key finding related to evaluating sources is that by the end of the
semester, many students had learned to problematize their evaluation processes,
learning to take multiple factors into account while beginning to understand the
assertion from the Framework for IL that authority is constructed in and depen-
dent on context (ACRL, 2015). But this is only a beginning. The challenge is to
build upon this beginning, which is difficult to achieve in a single composition
course.

    With more explicit discussion and instruction, students can tap into more
finely nuanced and multiple criteria for determining the value of sources for
their own uses. Moreover, as the IL Framework reminds us, students who are
used to free if not relatively easy access to information might think that this
information does not possess value, leaving them confused about the need for
following intellectual property laws or respecting the work it takes "to produce
knowledge" (ACRL, 2015). Students might also not appreciate the potential
value of adding their own thoughts and voices to ongoing conversations through
their own written work.

                                                                                                 195
Wojahn et al.

    Based on what this aspect of our study has taught us, a challenge for com-
position courses is to uncover the strategies for determining selection-processes
already used by students entering the class, to discuss strengths and weaknesses of
various strategies, and to promote new strategies, particularly encouraging stu-
dents to employ a combination of criteria before being persuaded that a source
is reliable or appropriate for their purposes. Leading students to more finely
nuanced objectives can allow students to learn exceptions to general recommen-
dations for researching.

Reporting on Steps in Their Research Processes

When asked, "What is your process for doing research on an academic topic
about which you know very little," students reported using an average of three
steps in their research processes at the start of the semester compared to the 2.4
average at the end. While a number of students reportedly employed some-
what fewer steps in their process, the quality and purpose of the steps tended
to reflect more critical evaluation of source locations and source types as well as
a more cogent rationale for exploring and using particular steps. For instance,
at the start of the semester, students attest to using the library as a way to sim-
ply "locate further information about my topic" or "find sources that grab my
interest." At the beginning of the semester, only 4% even mentioned using the
library for rhetorically rich purposes such as "locating supporting evidence" or
strengthening their arguments to persuade diverse readers. At the semester's end,
however, many refer to more critical decision-making points within the steps
they report, such as the need to "explore reliable sources," "make comparisons
between source types," and "garner credible information." At the end of the
semester, when explaining steps used during the research process, one student
mentioned the need to consider multiple perspectives while another cited the
importance of sufficiently informing herself enough about the topic. The degree
of insight offered by a source as well as its professional affiliations also factor into
the steps students described as part of their seemingly new research repertoire.
When reporting on steps they used in the research process, some students at the
end of the semester also discussed the value and importance of making critical
choices about information they consider relevant to their argument (not just
relevant to their topic) as well as about information to better lend credibility to
the content and nature of their arguments.

    At the end of the semester, many of these students additionally discussed tak-
ing the step of using library resources to examine their topic in depth and help
them sort through "good" and "bad" information (without tending to expand
on how they determined what qualifies for "good" or "bad"). In discussing their
research process steps, a number of students also mentioned beginning to see

196
                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

value in obtaining articles from sources other than websites, and some cited
Google Scholar as a more useful option to a general Google search because of its
emphasis on peer reviewed content.

    These self-reported changes in student thinking and behavior likely explain
the increase in library use they cited as part of their research process: at the
beginning of the semester, only 29% of students include mention of the library
(physical or online) as part of their research process. At the end of the semester,
52% of students include using the library as an aid to their research processes.
Since we aim to encourage students to tap into the resources our university offers
them, we were pleased with this result, which indicated that students reported
being more willing to seek additional help when needed, as the IL Framework
recommends (ACRL, 2015). At the same time, we do not want students to
think that they can only get valuable information from or through a library. The
positive news for us here is that students by the semester's end tended to indicate
a broader repertoire as they worked through their inquiry processes.

Expressing Attitudes toward Researching

By the semester's end, sentiments toward researching reflected some diminishing
student frustration, particularly as a result of, as one student put it, "adequate
guidance, and new and efficient techniques that make research easier and less
frustrating." Overall, 31% of students reported a change in attitudes toward
research, typically because in the end, they reported finding the process less
frustrating or because they found it easier due to the strategies learned. Although
some students reported more frustration in the end because they were more
aware of the complexity of researching (not necessarily a negative finding), more
students mentioned feeling better equipped to navigate through the research
process and attested to enjoying it more because of the potential to discover new
or even "exciting" information. While quite a few students reported positive
changes in their attitude toward research, 22% revealed that in the end they
found the process both enjoyable and frustrating depending on the nature of the
topic and the time it took to locate relevant and credible information.

    Moreover, students at the semester's end reported more willingness to locate
information. Some also mentioned being intrigued by the prospect of learn-
ing about a new topic. Still, students stated that they found it daunting to sift
through information to locate optimal material for advancing their arguments.
Many students mentioned that their interest in the topic, not surprisingly, can
impact their feelings toward research. Twenty-eight percent of students at the
end of the semester mentioned "interest in the topic" as a primary motivator in
their quest for information. Educators have long discussed the value of finding
topics that could interest and engage students (Schraw & Lehman, 2001; Wade,

                                                                                                 197
Wojahn et al.

1992; Dewey, 1913); student responses to the motivation question support its
importance. We hope that learning to appreciate their increasing abilities to
find information they are curious about will motivate students toward what the
IL Framework advocates: "asking increasingly complex or new questions whose
answers in turn develop additional questions or lines of inquiry" (ACRL, 2015).

Students' Reflective Essays

One important goal of this study was to better understand students' per-
ceptions of their own writing and research processes, particularly what they
reported as most helpful to their learning and to their completion of the final
research-supported essay. The reflective essays allowed students--in their
own words--to contribute to our research and our understanding of their IL
practices.

    From our analysis of reflections, following Creswell (2007), who advocates
for allowing themes to emerge (based more on perspectives of participants as
opposed to researchers), we identified six key categories that students described
as helping them develop as researchers: specifically, learning to

      · Interact with source material.
      · Improve general writing processes.
      · Use library resources.
      · Scaffold the research process.
      · Enhance audience and rhetorical awareness.
      · Develop more sound research processes.

    In the following, we describe each theme, report how many final reflective
essays out of 53 mentioned the given theme as helpful to them as developing
researchers, and highlight students' voices through quotations.

Interacting with Source Material

In final reflective essays submitted along with their final research-supported
projects, many students reported valuing instruction in learning to evaluate,
integrate, and cite sources for their academic writing. This theme emerged as
the most often mentioned, noted in 44 of the 53 reflective essays. Students
described as most helpful activities such as learning to identify trustworthy
sources, selecting relevant information, and integrating quotations and sum-
maries into their writing. As one student explained, "[Research-related assign-
ments] have made me read more into the articles/sources so I can understand my
topic more and really pick out what I want to use in my essay. Research, for me,
has been a big improvement and the audiences can trust my work." (In sharing

198
                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

quotes from students, we present them precisely as they were offered in students'
documents.) This quote highlights student awareness of valuing outside sources:
to help a writer learn more about his or her topic, to provide a writer with
key information to strengthen an essay, and to build credibility. The quote also
resonates with the IL Framework statement that "Information possesses several
dimensions of value, including as a commodity, as a means of education, as a
means to influence, and as a means of negotiating and understanding the world"
(ACRL, 2015).

    Another student wrote, "I do pay a lot more attention to how credible my
source is. I used to just worry about the information that I was being given,
but now I look at if they cite their sources and if they have education in the
specific area or if it is biased or not." We see this student as recognizing that
information is not useful merely for being related to one's topic; according to
the IL Framework, information should also come from a reliable source suitable
for a given purpose (ACRL, 2015). Still another student wrote, "I have gone
from just throwing out random facts I have heard to actually researching and
writing down multiple sources then choosing from the most relevant ones."
We see this remark as providing evidence of a student's increased awareness
of the importance of care required in selecting from a range of sources, each
with potential strengths and weaknesses. This student's comments suggest other
practices advocated by the IL Framework, including "monitor[ing] gathered
information and assess[ing] for gaps or weaknesses; organiz[ing] information
in meaningful ways," and "synthesiz[ing] ideas gathered from multiple sources"
(ACRL, 2015).

    Other students mentioned learning to integrate and cite sources as helpful
for displaying multiple perspectives in the midst of their own informed views.
One student explained, "Since I got into [the composition course] I was able
to figure out how to [incorporate an opposing viewpoint into the essay] and
still be able to get my point across and have the readers on my side and not
the opposing side like I feared." Other students also mentioned valuing their
new abilities in presenting an opposing or counterargument without losing an
audience's support. We are encouraged by the learning such comments rep-
resent, comments that connect to themes shared in the IL Framework, which
encourages researchers to "maintain an open mind and critical stance" as well as
"seek[ing] multiple perspectives during information gathering and assessment"
(ACRL, 2015).

    Though not all students commented on this aspect of integrating research,
most students mentioned learning to cite sources as helpful, with some students
able to make connections between learning to cite material and a writer's credi-
bility. As one student stated, "In high school we were never taught to do in text

                                                                                                 199
Wojahn et al.

citations . . . and I never knew how easy it was. With these citations my paper
makes me sound like a more reliable source than just some random person that
thinks they know what they're talking about." This quotation suggests that extra
practice and conversations about citation help to do more than demystify citation
rules; they lead to increased confidence in writing and new awareness of how to
enhance a writer's ethos. Moreover, as the IL Framework suggests, the citations
play a role in academic conversations: "Providing attribution to relevant previous
research is also an obligation of participation in the conversation. It enables the
conversation to move forward and strengthens one's voice in the conversation"
(ACRL, 2015). We appreciate seeing evidence that students can learn to recognize
real purposes for citing, such as nodding to others involved in discussing an issue.

Improving Writing Processes

As the second most common topic to come up in students' responses related to
what helped them develop as researchers, 32 of 53 students discussed benefits
of their writing processes changing during the course. As one student wrote, "I
used to just type it out and do all of the processes within a week and hope that
it was what the teacher wanted, but now I know that it takes much more time."
Our hope is that students making this type of comment will keep this in mind
as they approach academic writing in the future. Another response showed that,
as one student put it, "I learned that [I] have to [do] constant research and do
revisions in order to make my paper better." This student's comment also reflects
growing expertise in researching. As the IL Framework states, "Experts are . . .
inclined to seek out many perspectives, not just the ones with which they are
familiar" (ACRL 2015). The student's response also demonstrates something we
noticed in other reflective essays: discussions of research as it relates to the writ-
ing process and written products, with research prompting more writing and
more writing prompting further research.

Using Library Resources

As the third most popular theme to emerge as an aid to completing the course's
final essay, using library resources encompasses activities such as learning about
new databases for finding sources, gaining practice in using databases, and dis-
cussing purposes of databases and various search engines. Thirty-one of 53 stu-
dents explained that learning about and using databases, search engines, or the
library website aided in their completion of the research-supported, argumen-
tative essay.

    A number of students spoke of their transformation as researchers during
the course of the semester due to increased awareness of resources available to
them. For example, one student wrote, "Before this year, to do my research,

200
                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

I would just type in the topic to Google and then just look and look until I
found what I needed, but what I learned is that there is specific sources (ex.
the . . . library website) that will help you narrow down your search." Another
student explained, "I used to get on Google type what I was looking for then
hit on the first link, but now instead of doing that I go to academic search
premier or CQ researcher those two websites are my favorites to gather infor-
mation." Some students noted that particular databases were useful for specific
reasons, such as finding relevant peer-reviewed articles and providing informa-
tion about an author's credibility. By the end of the course, some reported a
new awareness of the care required to sift through information whether using
academic databases or Google. Many students mentioned appreciating being
explicitly taught how to use academic resources and when and why to use
them as well as knowing that Google was not the only option for finding
information. Other students mentioned the value of noting where a source is
published and with which type of domain (i.e., .com, .edu, .gov, and .org) as
a means to comprehend the context for information presented. At the same
time, some students did not show much awareness of the role or value of
databases, with one such student stating that "information [from databases] is
correct and it will look better on a paper to a teacher verses a Google website."
At the least, students showed that they were beginning to think of research as
inquiry and that seeking information from multiple sources was a useful, if
not desirable, option.

Learning through Scaffolding the Research Process

Twenty-eight of 53 students addressed the value of a sequence of assignments
leading up to the final essay, with one student stating, "Every assignment we did
in class or online was like taking little steps closer to where we needed to be in
writing our final draft." Not only did students regularly mention specific helpful
assignments (such as the annotated bibliography, topic proposal, audience anal-
ysis, and extended outline), but some students mentioned how helpful it was
to have most of the semester to work on a final essay because they didn't "have
to rush last minute to finish a paper." One student responded that "the way the
instructor laid out the assignment and gave us small work to do throughout the
process it made it much easier to write." Not only did students find that the
sequencing and scaffolding of the entire process was beneficial, but by bringing
up assignment sequencing in their responses, these students seemed to follow
the IL Framework's assertion that each small supporting piece of the assignment
informed the essay and allowed them to approach "complex research by break-
ing complex questions into simple ones, limiting the scope of investigations"
(ACRL, 2015).

                                                                                                 201
Wojahn et al.

Enhancing Audience and Rhetorical Awareness

More than 40% of students (23 of 53) mentioned audience or rhetorical aware-
ness as something that helped them during both writing and research processes.
Many students talked about audiences and rhetorical considerations as new
developments in their writing. One student writes, "The most important thing
that I've learned this semester is how to write as a reader; to maintain a constant
consideration of the reader. This has improved my writing process and the writ-
ing itself." As seen above, this increased awareness of audience also impacted
students' research decisions and practices. We believe, as a number of students
reported, that the deliberate inclusion of Research Diary questions about audi-
ence and argumentation within various supporting assignments throughout the
research and writing processes helped students to reach this conclusion.

Developing Sound Research Processes

Overall, many students reflected on changes they had made in their research
and writing processes by the end of the course; many of these students included
statements such as, "Before English 111, I used to . . . but now I . . . " Fif-
teen students discussed how learning more academic strategies aided them as
researchers. Commenting on the usefulness of initially identifying a research
question, one student wrote, "I think having a specific question to be answer
while looking for a source was very helpful. I don't think I ever had a specific
question while looking for a source . . . this was a new method that will improve
my writing if I continued to do it." Although we often assume students know, as
the IL Framework puts it, that "the act of searching often begins with a question
that directs the act of finding needed information" (ACRL, 2015), the reflec-
tions from students indicate that some have not previously been strategic in
locating information but instead have simply collected information that might
have some--any--connection to their topics, and not necessarily searching
information for their purposes for writing, such as persuading readers.

    Learning to make distinctions among source information and types is not an
easy process. One student commented on this in the reflective essay, stating, "I
liked how the [final essay] challenged my research skills to look for more infor-
mation than I had to in the past." The IL Framework emphasizes the benefits of
learning that "first attempts at searching do not always produce adequate results"
along with benefits of observing the "value of browsing" as well as "persist[ing]
in the face of search challenges," knowing when the search task for one's purpose
is complete (ACRL, 2015). Also, mentioning learning, a student writes, "The
research that I did helped me so much in not only to make my paper more
appealing but I learned so much about this topics that I've been trying to learn
about for many years." It seems, then, that slowing down the assignment pacing

202
                                                                         Understanding and Using Sources

and dedicating time to explicit instruction on research (through Research Dia-
ries, class discussions, library instruction, and supporting assignments) helped
students understand research as an opportunity to learn much more about a
topic of interest to them and then to use that information for a purpose. When
we look at students' responses in the writing process and research process catego-
ries, we see students beginning to understand research as a strategic exploration,
with purpose in each iterative step as indicated by the IL Framework (ACRL,
2015). Many students said they found learning to research just as important
or helpful as learning to write as well as a process to invoke throughout writing
projects, not just as something to take part in during the invention or conclud-
ing stages of writing.

    Finally, one of the most surprising results from our analysis of students'
reflective essays is how often students talked about research as a rhetorical act.
Students explained that they now have explicit purposes for selecting sources,
such as becoming knowledgeable about a topic, displaying ethos and appear-
ing credible to their readers, and better understanding others' perspectives and
opposing arguments. In fact, several students mentioned appreciating new abil-
ities to incorporate an opposing or counterargument, rather than ignoring it as
they had in the past. Additionally, students talked about research as a way to
learn about a topic and carefully present a sound argument, rather than simply
a method for "proving a point." In fact, students' reflective essays suggest many
students began to understand research as a complex, iterative process integrated
with writing itself. Since the course was designed with this intent, it was encour-
aging to see students viewing these as joint, recursive processes, equally integral
to the creation of knowledge, a tenet of the IL Framework (ACRL, 2015).

IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSION

One of the most striking aspects of our exploration of students' perspectives on
research-supported writing is that there is so much more to learn about what
is happening "behind the scenes" and that what we stand to learn is worth the
additional effort of tracking students' research processes, beliefs, and attitudes.
All too often, we learn about students' IL exclusively from a final research-­
supported essay. As instructors have long known, however, what students do
in their final products is not necessarily an indication of what they can do. Final
products tell us little of the struggle or the logic behind any problems we might
identify in the research-supported work itself. Yet tracking students' practices
through interim, reflective products, as we did, allowed us to identify patterns,
allowing instructors to know where students experience the most difficulty and
how they gain the most. We suggest this is necessary but not sufficient.

                                                                                                 203

    Research Diary responses indicated great value in providing 1) space for
students to reflect and report on their research practices and 2) interventions
to allow a behind-the-scenes look at students' thinking about research as it is
happening (Ritchhart, Church & Morrison, 2011; Wallace, Flower & Norris,
1994). Participating instructors mentioned throughout the semester how stu-
dent responses helped them gauge where students were succeeding or facing
challenges in researching. And a primary purpose of the Research Diary assign-
ments--supporting students' learning as they researched--was also achieved.
Students reported their perceptions as well as behaviors had changed, largely
toward positive ends, by the semester's end.

    Students' reflective essays also have important pedagogical implications con-
cerning the ways in which we approach IL. First, with respect to assigning large
research-supported essays, we saw reflective evidence for the value of breaking into
steps and scaffolding research processes and assignments. Doing so, our students
indicated, aids them in understanding research and writing as involved processes,
and research and writing as intertwined, recursive processes in keeping with the
IL Framework (ACRL, 2015). Second, students' reflective essays indicate student
interest in learning to use library resources such as databases to locate credible
information and to develop their own ethos as they work toward knowledge-­
making (for more on supporting such work, see Yancey, Chapter 4, this collec-
tion). When offered explanations for finding scholarly sources, students indicate
they will choose to use these resources rather than using Google alone. And some
mentioned that when they do use Google, they will do so more strategically.

    Breaking the research process into intelligible steps also proved useful. Stu-
dents indicated that including smaller assignments, such as those allowed for
in Research Diary or journal entries, proved beneficial. Such assignments can
prompt students to engage with sources, for instance, by reflecting on how they
might use specific source material within their own texts through questioning:
Can the overall argument of the article be used to support or counter a main
claim in the student's own text? Can source material be used to provide back-
ground on the topic? Katt Blackwell-Starnes (Chapter 7, this collection) offers
additional strategies for assignment-sequencing for supporting the research pro-
cess throughout a project.

    Overall, we see much evidence that students are making attempts at inte-
grating sources into their essays but that they struggle to do so, particularly
in recognizing when to cite--and how. Fortunately, the Research Diaries and
reflective essays provide insights into these struggles. Students reported appre-
ciating using a shared text for rehearsing strategies for drawing information out
through summary, paraphrase, and quotes, and for practicing weaving material
from that source into their own writing.

    The shared text approach points to yet another implication: the need to pro-
vide more time in class for students to engage with the sources they are locating
before and as they are writing their research-supported work. There are multiple
ways to do so in addition to those already mentioned (Milloy, 2013). When
students have engaged deeply and rhetorically with source materials, they will
have a greater sense of the conversations concerning their given topics, an aspect
emphasized in the IL Framework (ACRL, 2015). Students can then approach
taking their own stance on a given issue with an informed opinion and with
greater confidence.

    Based on our library and writing program collaboration, we additionally
argue that the importance of library and cross-curricular partnerships cannot
be overemphasized. Considering the theme of this collection--Information
Literacy: Research and Collaboration across Disciplines--we would add that IL
is not just for Writing Studies faculty. As Miriam J. Metzger, Andrew J. Fla-
nagin, and Lara Zwarun (2003) report, students across the curriculum find
most of their research from online sources. We therefore encourage instructors
across the curriculum to work with librarians on finding ways to optimize
that practice (for more on strategies for encouraging all disciplines to improve
informational literacy, see Rolf Norgaard and Caroline Sinkinson, Chapter 1),
this collection.

    As mentioned earlier, when we maintain boundaries between the research
that students do to write and the writing that students do based on research, we
are emphasizing them as distinct practices rather than showing how they can
work together in an integrated process. Librarians working with writing faculty
can strengthen what we can offer students with respect to writing and research-
ing (and researching and writing) and how we offer students access to IL.

    In our case, learning occurred not just among the students but also among
the librarian and instructors. As one instructor put it, "I realized from the results
how much we are asking of students" when we ask them to integrate material
from sources into their texts. This instructor is committed to breaking down
assignments as the participating librarian modeled in the Research Diaries so
that students are able to practice various moves related to research and writing
from sources. The writing program, also, is sharing key results so that first-year
composition instructors know what types of research practices students might
be employing (such as including information because it is simply "on topic"
as opposed to, for instance, being able to support key arguments or provide
necessary background information for target readers). The writing program is
also highlighting other aspects that our study suggests students might find chal-
lenging (such as summarizing), the importance of slowing the writing/research
process down by taking students through specific steps, the advantage of having

                                                                                                 205

students work from common sources, along with emphasizing the value of help-
ing students initially focus on specific databases rather than sending them out
to the online library "cold." Additional benefits of librarians and instructors in
composition and beyond are addressed in this volume (see, for example, Scheidt,
Carpenter, Fitzgerald, Kozma, Middleton & Shields, Chapter 10, this collection;
Winslow, Rains, Skripsky & Kelly, Chapter 14, this collection; and Bensen, Wu,
Woetzel & Hashmi, Chapter 19, this collection).

    Moreover, at our institution, more librarians are now taking our results into
account as they revise library session visits and targeted online guides. They are
also more attuned to the rhetorical purposes to which the information students
seek can be applied and to working more closely with students in considering
how to determine the potential value of sources once found.

    Like James Elmborg (2006), we strongly recommend the practice of reflec-
tion, in this case, reflection occurring as students are conducting research and
writing based on sources. We learned much from student writing prompted in
Research Diaries; we also learned much from reflective essays that were written
after the final research-supported essays were completed. We encourage instruc-
tors to create these types of opportunities to learn more from the students them-
selves the challenges and points of confusion with integrating research into texts.
Doing so can help instructors assist students at the point of need and change the
ways instructors subsequently work with students learning to understand and
use sources.

    Our collaboration demonstrates the mutual benefit of addressing IL as inte-
gral to academic writing generally, and it puts the emphasis on student learning
(Hutchins, Fister & MacPherson, 2002). The mutually informative position
that information literacies and academic literacies are fundamentally inter-
twined leads us to conclude that a reflective posture on the parts of students,
the instructors, and the librarian worked together to garner the insights we have
gathered from our results, insights that allow us to see hard work, confusion, and
confidence as students gain expertise in academic research and writing.

WRITING INFORMATION
LITERACY IN FIRST-
YEAR COMPOSITION: A
COLLABORATION AMONG
FACULTY AND LIBRARIANS

      Donna Scheidt, William Carpenter, Robert Fitzgerald,

      High Point University

As other authors in this collection observe, when librarians and writing faculty
teach students how to plan, conduct, and incorporate research as they write,
they often do so with different working definitions of research and informa-
tion literacy (IL) (e.g., Kissel et al., Chapter 20, this collection, and Norgaard
& Sinkinson, Chapter 1, this collection). When Rolf Norgaard (2003) coined
"writing information literacy," he argued for how our fields might contribute to
one another intellectually and conceptually. Norgaard encourages Writing Stud-
ies faculty and librarians to reconsider certain conceptions of students' research,
specifically as it interfaces with students' writing practices. We call this interface
between writing and research "writing-research," to distinguish students' every-
day practices as writing-researchers from the theoretical ideal of writing infor-
mation literacy (WIL) that Norgaard articulates.1

    All too often, whether in their own instruction or in their assignment of
instruction to others, writing faculty and librarians understand writing-research
as a set of skills or a product, a "generic window" on IL (Lupton & Bruce,
2010). Instead, according to Norgaard, they should consider the "intellectual
and composition processes that precede and underlie that [final written] prod-
uct" (p. 127) as well as appreciate students' "fairly complex (if not always effec-
tive, appropriate or productive)" practices (pp. 126-127). Our conceptions of
research--and those of our students--would benefit, Norgaard insists, from
the ways we understand writing--"as a recursive, goal-oriented, and problem-­
solving activity that involves a complex repertoire of strategies" (p. 127). The
recently adopted Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (ACRL,

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2016.0834.2.10  211
Scheidt et al.

2015) (Framework for IL) reflects this concept of research. By focusing on core
concepts, rather than a set of skills or standards, the Framework for IL represents
IL as having to do with more complex intellectual practices. In light of these
perspectives, it would enhance our collaborations as writing faculty and librar-
ians instructing students on research practice to conceptualize research as we
do writing, as a process that itself can be integrated with writing as a writing-­
research process.

    Conceiving of and studying research as process is hardly a new idea to Library
and Information Science, though researchers have not consistently attended to the
roles of writing in research processes. Since the 1980s, Carol Kuhlthau (1988) has
investigated the research processes of researchers of various ages in diverse settings,
including college undergraduates. Her Information Search Process, developed
out of her empirical work, has had significant influence, sensitive as it is to pat-
terns among writer-researchers' cognitive activities and affective orientations. Yet
Kuhlthau's process model privileges information seeking over meaning construc-
tion (Lupton, 2004, p. 24), and writing is largely absent as a concern. More recent
studies conducted abroad, adopting a process framework (Hongisto & Sormunen,
2010) (Finland) or discovering among students a process orientation to research
(Diehm & Lupton, 2012) (Australia), only tangentially address the role of writing,
as an "end product" (Hongisto & Sormunen, 2010, p. 107), or as one of the "[p]
rocesses for using information" (Diehm & Lupton, 2012, p. 8).

    In a small-scale follow-up to Kuhlthau's work, Barbara Fister (1992) used a
think-aloud protocol to interview 14 undergraduates, from freshman to seniors,
who had successfully completed academic research projects, inquiring about
their research and writing processes. Among her findings, she discovered, con-
sistent with Kuhlthau, that students spent a good deal of time and energy in
developing a focus for their projects. She also discovered, however, that students
readily integrated research and writing, not reserving it for the final stage (as
in Kuhlthau's model): "Few of the students saw any clear distinction between
research and writing; they saw them as aspects of a single activity, concurrent
and integrated" (p. 167). In addition to considering the implications of her find-
ings for research and writing instruction, Fister called for additional research on
research processes, especially those employed by average college students.

    Recent, broad-scale U.S.-based empirical studies by Project Information Liter-
acy (PIL) researchers suggest the importance of helping undergraduates, includ-
ing freshmen, develop research strategies and processes as well as the challenges
of doing so, particularly as integrated with their writing. In a survey of over
8,000 undergraduates at 25 U.S. campuses, they discovered that about half
these students self-reported using processes (what researchers called "routines")
for students' writing-research (Head & Eisenberg, 2010). Of those students

212
                                               Writing Information Literacy in First-Year Composition

employing processes, it was found that "[s]tudents had fewer techniques for
conducting research and finding information than for writing papers" (p. 19).
Also, students' processes were often more oriented to efficiency than inquiry
and learning, or WIL. In a study based on interviews with nearly 2,000 college
freshmen about experiences with research in their first semester, Alison Head
(2013) reports that some students found themselves taking their "high school
research kit"--their set of competencies and strategies--and "retooling it" to
deal with the demands of college research (p.14), though not without difficul-
ties. All too often, students' research strategies and processes are formulaic rather
than responsive to situational specifics, generative of thinking and learning, and
adaptable across assignments. These findings are consistent with Norgaard's call
for greater collaboration in conceptualizing (and ultimately teaching) research
better informed by our conceptualizations of writing, including complex and
elaborated approaches to process. While acknowledging the contributions that
have been made, Norgaard notes in a conversation with Catherine Sinkinson
included in this volume that "we have a ways to go to foster the disciplinary dia-
logue and disciplinary cross-fertilization" anticipated by his earlier work (Chap-
ter 1, this collection).

    Norgaard's (2003) contribution is significant and still timely, yet its prom-
ise for actual collaborations depends on better understanding students' writing-­
research processes--what they are and in what respects they are most productive
(most reflective, that is, of WIL) and most problematic. At this point, however,
little is known empirically, especially about the processes of writer-researchers in
first-year composition (FYC). Mark Emmons and Wanda Martin (2002) assessed
outcomes in a FYC program employing process-oriented, inquiry-based research
instruction, yet their assessment did not specifically examine students' writing-­
research processes. Other studies of undergraduate writing-research have exam-
ined students' activities and processes but have not focused on first-year students
or students enrolled in a composition course (see, e.g., Beyer, Gillmore & Fisher,
2007; Nelson, 1993; Burton & Chadwick, 2000). Recent empirical work high-
lighting connections between undergraduates' research and writing has focused
not on processes but on "categories" of students' orientation to research and writ-
ing (Lupton, 2004) and the extent and nature of students' reading as an attribute
of their written texts (Jamieson & Howard, 2013). The need thus persists to
better understand the processes of students as writer-researchers in FYC.

    This chapter, itself the enactment of a research and pedagogical collaboration
among faculty and librarians involved with FYC, considers how FYC students at a
private comprehensive university perceive their writing-research as well as to what
extent and how those perceptions change over a one-semester composition course.
Specifically, we examine the "activities" that students articulate as making up their

                                                                                                 213
Scheidt et al.

writing-research processes--what those activities are for students as a whole; what
activities students discuss most and least frequently; and how students' emphases
on those activities change over a semester. We also investigate what writing fac-
ulty and librarians value as WIL within those activities. The results of this study
indicate that students arrive at the university with a sense of writing-research as
a process. Yet generally students do not initially articulate activities critical to
college-­level work: working with sources in ways that might conceptually enhance
their development of focus and perspective in response to an assignment. After
a semester of FYC, the same students demonstrate significant gains in how often
they discuss reading and otherwise engaging sources. They also show progress as
far as how they discuss this and certain other activities associated with purposeful
writing-research. Despite these gains, the findings demonstrate little improvement
in the spectrum of other writing-research activities or WIL more generally.

    In sharing our methodology and results, we hope to better understand stu-
dents' writing-research processes and to operationalize what WIL means for stu-
dents, writing faculty, and librarians, thereby enhancing the conceptual grounds
for our own and others' pedagogical collaborations.

METHOD

This chapter reports on a one-semester mixed-methods inquiry into how FYC
students at a private comprehensive university perceive research, specifically as it
interfaces with their writing practices, and whether and how those perceptions
change over a one-semester composition course. The study posed three initial
questions:

    1. What writing-research activities do students articulate in response to a
         research essay prompt?

    2. To what extent and how do students' articulated writing-research
         activities reflect what Norgaard (2003) terms "writing information
         literacy"?

    3. To what extent and how do students' articulated writing-research
         activities change over the course of a semester?

    The study received approval from the university's Institutional Review Board
(IRB) and was begun in August of 2012.

Research Design

Participants

The study was conducted at a private comprehensive university located in central
North Carolina. The university offers a broad range of undergraduate degrees,

214
                                               Writing Information Literacy in First-Year Composition

including those in the traditional liberal arts, business, furniture and interior
design, exercise science, and education. For the academic year 2012-2013, the
university enrolled 3,926 undergraduate students, 1,257 of whom were first-
year students.2

    At the beginning of the fall 2012 semester, 562 students were enrolled across
25 sections of FYC,3 and 408 of these students consented to participate in the
study. Per university IRB policies, students who were not 18 years of age at the
beginning of the semester were unable to participate. Informed written consent
was obtained by individual instructors during the first class session. Students who
elected to participate were asked how they wanted their work cited in the study:
anonymously, with pseudonyms, or with their real names. A program administra-
tive assistant not involved with the research project created a "master spreadsheet"
and assigned every consenting participant a random five-digit numerical code so
that none of the participants' identities would be known to the researchers.

Online IL Modules

Before the beginning of the fall 2012 semester, the librarians created a series of
five online modules in Blackboard, which were piloted in 13 of the fall compo-
sition courses. The modules addressed many of the IL concepts prioritized in
FYC, such as database searches using selective keywords, identifying popular
versus scholarly sources, citation, etc., and enabled the librarians to cover more
content than is possible in one-shot sessions.4

Writing Prompt

All students enrolled in the course responded to the following process narrative
prompt during the first and last weeks of the semester:

         Imagine that you have been assigned a 1500-word essay for
         this course. The essay must develop an argument about a
         current social issue and must use at least three outside sources.
         Explain how you would go about completing this assignment.
         Be as specific and detailed as possible.

    Students were given 20 minutes of in-class time to respond to the prompt
on a computer. They were made aware that the process narratives would not be
assigned a grade. Identical prompts were used at the beginning and end of the
semester.

Sampling Procedures

The process narrative prompts were administered by course instructors and
collected into assignment folders in Blackboard. Instructors then sent these

                                                                                                 215
Scheidt et al.

files to the administrative assistant responsible for the master sheet of students'
identifying codes. A computer program was used to generate a simple random
sample of 60 participants: 30 from the experimental sections (those who used
the online modules) and 30 from control sections. All identifying information
from the process narratives was removed, and they were labeled only with the
students' numbers. The master spreadsheet also indicated which students were
enrolled in the experimental sections. The list of 60 participants yielded 50 pre-
tests and 51 post-tests (not matched in all cases), which were made available
to researchers using Dropbox file-sharing software. Researchers did not know
which students comprised the experimental or control groups until all coding
was finished.

Coding Method

The random sample of process narratives was coded collaboratively by the six
researchers: four tenure-track Writing Studies faculty and two librarians. To
generate initial codes, the researchers first divided into two groups of three--
one group focused on the pre-tests and the other on the post-tests. Each team
included two Writing Studies faculty members and one librarian. Each team
member was assigned 17 pre-test or post-test samples to ensure that all narratives
were evaluated in this initial process.

    After reading through the data individually doing what Johnny Saldaña
(2009) describes as "initial coding" (p. 81)--making notes about patterns and
themes that might offer "analytic leads for further exploration" (p. 81)--each
research team met independently to discuss their results. Based on the initial
coding of the samples, they collaboratively generated a list of potential codes
to be presented to the larger group. All six researchers then met to develop a
common list of codes (see Appendix for Code Log). Using Christopher Hahn's
(2008) suggestions for organizing qualitative coding, the group identified these
codes as "level 1" activities. These activity-oriented codes--a kind of coding Sal-
daña terms "process coding" (p. 77)--describe research-related actions that stu-
dents articulate in their process narratives. Research-related actions were defined
as any step in the research process, from brainstorming to citing. Writing process
activities were not coded unless the activity indicated an act of writing-r­esearch.
Following Saldaña's model, activities were double-coded as different level 1
codes where appropriate.

    Recognizing that the level 1 codes would not alone elucidate evidence of
students' WIL, and that there needed to be some way of conceptualizing the
intellectual work within the students' narratives, the researchers adapted Hahn's
(2008) notion of "level 2" coding (p. 6). In our study, level 2 codes relate to

216
                                               Writing Information Literacy in First-Year Composition

what Saldaña (2009) calls "elaborative coding"--"the process of analyzing tex-
tual data in order to develop theory further" (p. 168). Researchers elaborated
Norgaard's (2003) notion of WIL by teasing out two concepts central to his
theory: invention and inquiry. Norgaard presents these concepts as sites where
Writing Studies and IL can productively overlap (p. 128-9), and researchers
created level 2 codes for these terms (see Appendix). Researchers therefore
agreed to double-code any level 1 activity read as "invent" or "inquire" as a level
2 code. Level 2 codes were applied where students elaborated writing-research
processes meant to discover and create new ideas (invent) or to investigate and
mediate ideas (inquire). For researchers, these sites demonstrated a more con-
ceptual understanding of the activities associated with WIL; students coded for
level 2 had moments when their articulated processes demonstrated an overlap
between Writing Studies and IL.

    After the final code log was complete, the researchers divided into three pairs,
pairing faculty with librarians to the extent possible. Each pair coded pre- and
post-tests for 17 students. Coding involved assigning a level 1 code, capturing
all raw text data indicating the code onto the spreadsheet, and double-coding
for level 2 "invent" or "inquiry" where appropriate. The paired coding process
was designed to ensure that the entire data set was coded by at least two readers.
When a pair of readers could not reach agreement on a code, they presented the
texts in question to the entire group and a consensus was reached.5

RESULTS

Students' Writing-Research Activities and WIL

In their narratives, students discussed 15 distinct writing-research activities, as
summarized in Table 10.1. Individual students typically articulated a number of
writing-research activities in their narratives, averaging 5.19 level one codes on
their pre-tests. Pre-test results indicated that students frequently discussed the
following activities, typically associated with the beginning of the research pro-
cess: brainstorming prior knowledge and beliefs and finding a topic. With respect
to finding and preliminarily working with sources, students frequently discussed
determining what sources were available, gathering sources, and designating
source quality (e.g., by naming resources considered "safe," such as databases).
Frequent later-stage activities included organizing sources (e.g., as part of an
outline) and integrating sources textually (e.g., introducing, quoting/paraphras-
ing/summarizing, or citing). As indicated in Table 10.1, each of these activities
accounted for 8-10% of all codes on the pre-tests.

    Writing-research activities associated with working with sources in concert
with students' own developing views were discussed less frequently in pre-tests.
These less-discussed activities included learning more about a chosen topic,
engaging sources (e.g., reading, notetaking, analyzing), locating support for
claims, acknowledging different views or opinions, and using sources (e.g., as
"facts," "information," or for other more rhetorical purposes). Discussed even
less were the following: understanding the assignment and its tasks, determining
the relevance of sources (e.g., to their topic or other purposes), and taking a
position. Taken together, these activities form a snapshot of what our students
emphasize in the research process as they begin their first semester in college.

    Students' writing-research activities at the beginning of the term reflected
WIL to different extents, as reflected in Tables 10.2 and 10.3.6 By far, the activity
most commonly identified in pre-tests with WIL was brainstorming, because of
its association with discovery and problem-formulation--i.e., invention. Three
other activities were often associated with WIL in pre-tests--not just with inven-
tion but with inquiry (i.e., making and mediating meaning): determining what
sources were available, learning more about a chosen topic, and acknowledging
different views.

    Students rarely articulated certain other activities in a way that suggested to
researchers that they were discovering ideas, problem-solving, or making mean-
ing in their writing-research. These low writing-information-literate activities
included gathering sources, locating support for claims, and organizing sources.

HOW STUDENTS DESCRIBE FINDING A TOPIC AND
DETERMINING THE RELEVANCE OF SOURCES

We now consider how students' articulated writing-research activities reflect
WIL, through in-depth qualitative analysis of two writing-research activities:
finding a topic and determining the relevance of sources. We chose to focus on
finding a topic because, as indicated in Table 10.1, it was the activity that stu-
dents mentioned most often in their narratives, persisting in rates of frequency
from pre- to post-tests. While the activity integrate was coded an equal number
of times overall, topic was double-coded for WIL at a much higher rate than
integrate (see Tables 10.2 and 10.3). Topic was neither especially high nor low
overall with respect to WIL, giving researchers the opportunity to richly com-
pare instances of topic selection judged writing information literate with those
that were not. Also evident in Table 10.1, relevance was a writing-research activ-
ity rarely coded in pre- or post-tests. (That students consider relevance all too
infrequently is a finding similar to results in other studies in this collection [e.g.,
Goscik et al., Chapter 8, this collection; Wojahn et al., Chapter 9, this collec-
tion]). Yet as indicated in Tables 10.2 and 10.3, by the end of the semester topic
and relevance would make notable gains in their association with WIL, being
highly valued by researchers. This made us want to look at what students who
discussed these activities were doing.

Finding a Topic

Students considered to be writing information literate in finding a topic dis-
cussed their multiple steps: investigating, narrowing, and/or choosing. The stu-
dent below first investigates a topic--thinks about or (in this case) researches
possible options--and then narrows the topic, recognizing multiple possible
topics and considering how to select:

         First off, I would spend a decent amount of time researching
         a variety of social issues that have affected not only the United
         States, but the world as well. I would strongly lean toward
         choosing an issue that can be relatable to almost everyone, or
         target a specific group. (A. Jones, pre-test)

220
                                               Writing Information Literacy in First-Year Composition

    Similarly, another student first investigates and then chooses a topic:

         After having the essay assigned, I would immediately start
         searching through news articles for a social issue that interest
         [sic] me. Once I come across the story that has two sides, and
         could be debated, I know my topic. (S. King, post-test)

    These students' descriptions are not elaborate. Yet they differ from those of
many students who, while noting the need to select a topic, did not explain how
they would go about it.

    Students also were judged writing information literate based on the criteria
they articulated for their topic selection, especially when they articulated diverse
or unusual criteria. In general, students turned most often to whether a topic was
interesting, current, or controversial. Additional criteria, mentioned less frequently,
included how much research was available on a topic, the quality of research on
a topic, whether a topic was familiar or specific, whether a topic related to the
assignment, whether a student felt a topic could be developed adequately for the
essay, and whom a topic considered or addressed. These less common criteria were
valued as WIL, particularly in combination with other criteria:

         After that I would then go to the library and find a current
         social issue that I found interesting. After coming up with
         some different social issues that I found most interesting I
         would do a little research on all three to see which one had
         the most information on it. (Anonymous, post-test)

    This student uses a common criterion--interest in a topic--and an unusual
criterion--amount of research available on the topic (i.e., "the most informa-
tion"). (Other students addressing the amount of research on a topic discussed
easily researched topics, or topics with enough research.)

    Finally, some students identified as being writing information literate in their
topic selection articulated multiple kinds of sources. Many students discussed using
sources in their topic selection, with the resource most frequently mentioned
being the Internet. Several students clarified what they were seeking online (e.g.,
news articles, social media, etc.), or combined online resources with other kinds
of research resources, such as magazines, t.v., or even family members.7

    One student text in particular illustrates all three aspects of WIL for topic
selection--multiples steps, diverse criteria, and multiple kinds of sources:

         I would first come up with a relevant topic that would be con-
         sidered a current social issue. To gather possible topics, I would
         first watch the world news and look for anything of interest. I

                                                                                                 221
Scheidt et al.

         would take note of any possible issues for later evaluation. My
         second source would be the local newspaper. This would give
         me a more local perspective on how people in my area may be
         reacting to national events. For the last source I would turn to
         the internet to find issues and conflicts that may have not been
         picked up by the mainstream media. This may include brows-
         ing a few independent news sites, reading through a related
         blog, or viewing specific eyewitness accounts on youtube. After
         compiling a list of possible topics, I would go through and nar-
         row down the choices and find the most interesting, relevant,
         and controversal [sic] topic. (S. King, pre-test)

    Investigating topics, the student turns to different kinds of sources: "the
world news," "a local newspaper," and "the internet." (The student even identifies
the purposes behind these differing sources--global, local, and non-m­ ainstream
coverage.) Narrowing and choosing among topics, the student employs multiple
criteria, considering which topic is "the most interesting, relevant, and contro-
versal [sic]."

Determining Relevance

Researchers regularly identified students' discussions of relevance as writing
information literate, and as highly associated with "persistence." In total, only 16
text segments were coded for relevance codes, making it the second least applied
code behind assignment. Yet six of these were double-coded level 2 code inquire,
prompting a closer look at the relationship between relevance and WIL. In the
examples where level 1 relevance codes were double coded with level 2 inquire
codes, students articulated a need to be persistent in their research in order to
evaluate the appropriateness of their sources in terms of their argument. Several
of the students explain that this later-stage evaluation process often happens
during the writing process. Some examples:

         Then once I have decided what point of view I intend to write
         from I will decide which of the sources would be most helpful
         for me to prove my point in my essay. That way I can keep
         the stronger sources and remove the weak sources. (A. Fortin,
         post-test)

         I tend to add at least two more when I'm revising my essay, or
         I replace sources with ones that are more relevant to my paper.
         (M. Maire, post-test)

222
                                               Writing Information Literacy in First-Year Composition

    These students show a willingness to give up sources already obtained in
order to search for information more appropriate for their purposes. Research-
ers see these students as demonstrating both persistence in the writing-research
process and the ability to evaluate sources in light of the rhetorical situation. In
this way, students coded for relevance and inquire seem to be working squarely
within Norgaard's (2003) conception of WIL.

CHANGES IN WRITING-RESEARCH ACTIVITIES AND WIL

Students averaged 5.88 codes on the post-test, a statistically significant dif-
ference from the beginning of the semester,8 suggesting that students' end-of-­
semester writing-research processes were more elaborated as far as number of
activities reported. However, this quantification of codes is less telling than the
distribution of codes, which can be seen in Table 10.1. In particular, post-test
results indicate that engaging with sources is where the fall 2012 FYC made
the biggest difference in how students experience and understand the writing-­
research process.9

    There was some difference (though not statistically significant) in how often
students' activities were coded for WIL by the end of the semester.10 Even so,
results indicated notable changes from the beginning to the end of the term in
the distribution of certain activities highly associated with WIL. Gains were seen
in level 2 coding (inquire, in particular) with respect to four activities--finding a
topic, engaging sources, determining the relevance of sources, and using sources,
indicating changes possibly associated with FYC (see Tables 10.2 and 10.3).
Other activities remained frequently coded by researchers at level 2: learning
more about a chosen topic, acknowledging different points of view, and brain-
storming prior knowledge or beliefs.11 That these activities persisted as highly
writing information literate is no surprise, given their ready association with
inquiry and invention. Conversely, determining what is available was no lon-
ger highly associated with WIL by the end of the term, possibly suggesting an
opportunity for more emphasis on research planning.

    Activities infrequently associated with WIL at the beginning of the term
remained so by the end of the term, including gathering sources, locating sup-
port for claims, and organizing sources (see Tables 10.2 and 10.3). These results
are consistent with the ways these activities tended to contribute to student
research processes that were routine and inflexible--e.g., finding a certain num-
ber of sources in order to populate an outline devised to bolster pre-formulated
claims about an issue. An additional activity, however, became unexpectedly
associated with low WIL by the end of the semester: understanding the assign-
ment. In other words, by the end of the term, students were less frequently

                                                                                                 223
Scheidt et al.

articulating their efforts to understand their writing-research as rhetorically and
purposefully located in relationship to an assignment.

Engaging Sources

Given the gains made over the term by engage--both in the frequency and qual-
ity of students' articulations--researchers turned their attention to understand-
ing how students conceived of this activity. The code log defines engage in the
following way: "reading, making sense of sources, analyzing, notetaking, anno-
tating; specific to source." However, while any of these activities could be coded
engage, researchers found these activities were differentially valued as level 2
codes, with notetaking and annotating remaining a level 1 code if not accom-
panied by reading or making sense of sources (understanding). Upon review-
ing how students who only received level 1 codes conceived activities coded
engage, researchers found these students tended to emphasize annotating and
note-taking:

         I would find about 5 sources about my current issues and
         actively take notes about each article. (Snake, pre-test)

         After finding the sources I would go through and highlight
         any good information or find any specific quotes I want to
         use. (C. Smith, post-test)

    Working with texts in these ways--highlighting and taking notes--is a
practice associated with active reading. But it is notable that these students
highlight specific information or quotes and take notes without explicitly stat-
ing that they would take the time to first read or understand their sources. This
step of articulating reading or understanding tended to differentiate the engage
codes double-coded for inquiry. Here are some examples of these engage codes
coded level 2:

         I would make sure that I spend a lot of time researching, and
         reading the articles carefully and thoroughly and making sure
         they would fit in well with my essay. (A. Jones, post-test)

         After concluding my research, I would then take the time to
         sit down and fully read and comprehend the articles. I per-
         sonally like to have a paper copy of the sources so that I can
         highlight important information, take notes in the margins,
         and mark the text, this way I know where to look when I
         begin the writing process. (A. Nilan, post-test)

224

    These students present making meaning of their sources--reading and
comprehending them--as an explicit step in their research processes. The first
excerpt from student A. Jones was also double-coded for relevance, giving an
example of our interpretation of particularly complex activities. The student will
"spend a lot of time researching," indicating persistence, then turn to "reading
the articles carefully and thoroughly and making sure they would fit in well
with my essay," articulating the step of reading, understanding, and determining
relevance. Reading and understanding also tended to convert a level 1 engage
code into a level 2 code: 10 of the 15 level 2 engage codes addressed reading
or understanding sources, although these codes were concentrated among only
seven students.

    Among students only assigned level 1 codes, engage also tended to be per-
ceived as "grabbing" information:

         The next step I would take is actually finding those three out-
         side sources and grab all of the details and information I can
         from them. (Anonymous, pre-test)

    While the above example was coded engage, it is typical of many activities
coded gather, which offers a counterpoint to engage-as-inquiry. In these activities,
students often referred to grabbing information and details to use in their essay

DISCUSSION

Contributions and Future Research

This study makes several contributions to what we know about undergraduates'
writing-research activities and processes as well as suggesting areas for further
research. We turned to students' own articulations of their writing-research,
which helped us to better understand writing-research from their perspective,
and we did so on a much larger scale than is typical for such studies (see, e.g., Fis-
ter, 1992; Kuhlthau, 1988; Lupton, 2004; Nelson, 1993). Continued research is
needed employing methods centered on students' perceptions and activities, ide-
ally with larger sample sizes. The challenge of such research is also grounding it
in students' actual writing-research contexts (one limitation of this study, given
its hypothetical prompt). Wojahn et al.'s (Chapter 9, this collection) analysis of
students' reflective essays and research diaries provides an innovative model of
IL research grounded in students' discussions of their research processes related
to specific course assignments.

    The students in the sample reflected our campus's first-year population as
a whole, responding to Fister's (1992) call for study of average undergraduates

                                                                                                 225

as well as exceptional ones. The writing-research activities students articulated
were similar to those described by others. For example, our students frequently
discussed finding a topic, consistent with Kuhlthau's (1988) "selection" stage
and part of what Fister (1992) describes as "formulating a focus for research"--
one of the most time- and energy-intensive activities of the research process
(p. 164). Our close analysis of this activity contributes to what we know about
students' various approaches to topic selection and what it might mean to be
writing information literate in this respect. Determining the relevance of sources
is also an activity consistent with earlier findings. First-year students consider
relevance to be one of the most challenging aspects of research (Head, 2013).
Kuhlthau (1988) describes it as part of "exploration," which she considers to
be the most difficult stage of research, one during which students often give up
(p. 262, 299-300). Interestingly, and responsive to Kuhlthau's observation, we
judged students as writing information literate when they articulated persistence
in determining relevance.

    Unlike earlier studies, ours highlights the importance of students' engage-
ment of sources, thereby contributing to a conversation on how the material
practices of students' reading, notetaking, etc., implicate students' meaning
making (see also Jamieson & Howard, 2013). It comes as no surprise that first-
year students are challenged by reading sources, particularly scholarly sources
(Head, 2013). Our findings on engage are consistent with the Citation Project,
where through content analysis of student writing, researchers are finding that
students focus on sentence-level quotations they can use rather than under-
standing what they read (Howard, et al., 2010; see also Goscik et al., Chapter
8, this collection). The study also traces several activities often deemphasized
or found to be problematic by librarians as writing-research, perhaps because
of their strong association with writing: organize, use (see, e.g., Hongisto &
Sormunen, 2010), and integrate (see, e.g., Head, 2013). Further research
might examine more closely how students articulated these and other activities,
including what counted as WIL.12 (One model of such research is provided
by Karen Goscik and her colleagues in this collection, in their careful analysis
of what it means for first-year international students in a developmental writ-
ing class to organize their writing.) This study--focused primarily on students'
activities--also leaves open questions about how students group such activities,
or order them in their individual writing-research processes. As librarian Cath-
erine Sinkinson (Norgaard and Sinkinson, Chapter 1, this collection) notes the
writing-research process is ideally "one in which information seeking, reading,
and writing are recursive and intertwined," even though we too often "present
a fragmented process to students in which writing and information may appear
vastly disconnected."

226
                                               Writing Information Literacy in First-Year Composition

    The study's assumption that writing and research should be thought of and
studied as blended activities in processes of writing-research is not shared by
some (e.g., Kuhlthau, 1998; Stotksy, 1991). It also was a limitation in speak-
ing to students' use of writing and research techniques, respectively (e.g., Head
& Eisenberg, 2010), and to the extent of students' integration or separation
of writing and research (see Fister, 1992). Nevertheless, similar to Head and
Michael Eisenberg (2010), we generally observed that students' writing-research
activities were more efficient than inquiring, far less articulate and elaborate
than we had hoped. No doubt our generic prompt is partly to blame. And more
research remains to be done analyzing multiple coded text segments for possibly
rich instances of WIL, as well as the activities and processes of students who were
not coded at all for IL as compared with those who were.

Teaching and Faculty/Librarian Partnerships

The study suggests areas of programmatic strength as well as opportunities for
more direct and effective teaching. The pre-tests provide a useful overview of
what activities students are focused on when they enter our classrooms, as well
as their strengths and challenges in regards to WIL. Students initially appear to
be aware of activities related to discovering a topic, finding and considering the
quality of sources, and organizing and integrating those sources in their writing.
They seem less focused on activities associated with making sense of sources
and navigating them conceptually, given the context of an assignment and their
own purposes and views. In light of this overview, faculty can create a balance
between practices that lets students play to their strengths outside of class (brain-
storming, finding sources) and that uses class time to help them build strategies
for reading, analyzing, and otherwise engaging sources.

    Additionally, the study makes clear what was valued by researchers in regards
to students' WIL, suggesting what we might build on as well as change with
respect to our teaching. Adopting Norgaard's (2003) WIL as a framework for
the study, we were disappointed with the lack of change in students' WIL, results
which suggest that the writing program in some ways maintains a view of IL as
the "neutral, technological skill" that Norgaard describes (p. 125)--a "look-up
skill" (p. 126). Many writing-research activities are "outsourced": left to librar-
ians in their 50-75 minute, one-shot sessions. (The online modules were an
attempt to enhance this particular instruction.) While librarians try to deliver
a consistent message to all students in FYC, faculty inevitably take a variety
of approaches to course assignments, and the sessions often reflect the faculty
members' priorities for their assignments. Unfortunately, this is the kind of
"`inoculation' approach to IL" Norgaard speaks of earlier in this collection, an

                                                                                                 227
Scheidt et al.

approach that "tends to obscure how IL ought to be seen as a rich, multifaceted
literacy that is responsive to changing contexts and opportunities" (Chapter 1,
this collection). There may be a mismatch, in other words, between what is val-
ued as WIL and what is taught and how (see Limberg & Sundin, 2006). Such
a divide might be addressed programmatically by moving to a more contextual
("situated" (Lupton & Bruce, 2010)) view of writing-research that locates it
among wider literacies and learning processes (Limberg & Sundin, 2006; Lim-
berg, Alexandersson & Lantz-Andersson, 2008; Talja & Lloyd, 2010).

    It is also likely that faculty and librarians have differing understandings of
research and its role within a given student's writing. As just one example, rele-
vance in terms of information might not equate to relevance in terms of rhetor-
ical strategy and vice versa. A more situated approach to IL education and rele-
vance in particular (e.g., Limberg & Sundin, 2006) might better align these two
perspectives. The study's code log, created through intense discussion among
the faculty and librarians, is an immediately beneficial product of the study that
may help bridge terminological divisions between librarians and faculty noted
so often in this collection. As a framework for recognizing and understanding
the diverse activities within students' writing-research processes, the log provides
faculty and librarians with a common language.

    The Framework for IL provides additional opportunities for future collab-
orative research. The language of frames and threshold concepts used in the
Framework for IL has the potential to promote further dialogue between faculty
and librarians regarding the practices and "habits of mind" (p. 1) that both
groups value in FYC. Several of the frames and their supporting documentation
directly address the research and writing skills explored in our study and even
use some of the same language. For example, Research as Inquiry (p. 9) mirrors
our level two code "inquire." The Framework for IL's emphasis on learning pro-
cesses, rather than a prescribed set of skills, also allows for more flexibility in
developing learning outcomes for FYC. This may enable faculty and librarians
to address the disconnect between what is valued and what is taught.

    Despite the practical and conceptual challenges, our research can help us
and others facilitate students' WIL, by drawing on what students already know
and tell us. We know, for example, that topic choice (and, surely, its teaching)
involves more complexity than students often recognize--multiple steps, cri-
teria, and kinds of sources. We have learned that relevance is about students'
persistence in considering the fit of sources as their projects evolve, supporting
their patience as much as their perspicuity. We are now aware that students'
engaging of sources is a programmatic strength, one to build on by continuing
to move students from information grabbing to purposeful reading and sense
making.

                                               Writing Information Literacy in First-Year Composition

    Our most important work on behalf of improving students' WIL may be
the strengthened collaboration between writing faculty and librarians, facilitated
conceptually and pedagogically by the conversations we share--the "institutional
`sweet spot'" (Norgaard & Sinkinson, Chapter 1, this collection) we have created
for ourselves. If learning is itself a dialogic act, then it can be strengthened by
research activities that prioritize collaboration and promote reflective dialogue.

NOTES

1. This study is the result of a collaboration among librarians and Writing Studies
     faculty at High Point University. When the learning outcome "integrating sources"
     received new emphasis in the first-year writing program, the authors wanted to
     learn more about how student writers perceive research when arriving at college and
     how that perception might change after taking the required one-semester composi-
     tion course. Professor Middleton and Professor Scheidt wish to thank the organizers
     of the Dartmouth Summer Seminar for Composition Research (Summer 2013)
     as well as High Point University for its support of this research through a course
     reduction, University Research Advancement Grant, and Summer Scholar Award.

2. The mean combined SAT score for these first-year students was just over 1100. 79%
     of them came from states other than North Carolina, and 1.3% were international
     students. 37% graduated from private high schools. 83.1% of students identified as
     white; 5.1% as African-American or black; and 2.4% as Latin American, South Amer-
     ican, or Hispanic. The students were predominantly between the ages of 17 and 19.

3. The writing program also offered a "stretch sequence" of freshman composition
     offered across two semesters. Students in the stretch courses did not participate in
     the study.

4. The group had hoped to learn what, if any, effect the modules had on students' pro-
     cesses or information literacy, but the study did not provide a way of identifying or
     measuring any such effects. From the completion data extracted from Blackboard,
     researchers found that the modules were not incorporated consistently in all 13
     courses. Professors did not always use them in the order suggested or assign them a
     grade. In addition, many of the concepts addressed in the modules were also covered
     in one-shot instruction sessions taught by librarians for 21 of the 25 total sections
     of ENG 1103, including both control and experiment sections. Although there is
     anecdotal evidence from faculty that they felt the modules were beneficial, the study
     does not provide enough evidence to claim that the modules did or did not have a
     significant impact on students' research processes or perceptions of research.

5. That is, "intercoder agreement" (or "interpretive convergence") depended on in-
     tensive discussion and, ultimately, consensus as suggested by Saldaña (2008, pp.
     27-28) and Smagorinsky (2008, p. 401).

                                                                                                 229

6. We analyzed students' WIL in two respects, both at the beginning and end of the
     semester: First, we considered the instances of an activity coded for WIL as a per-
     centage of all instances coded for WIL (see Table 10.2). Second, we considered the
     instances of an activity coded for WIL as a percentage of all instances coded for that
     activity (see Table 10.3).

7. Students mentioned other research resources far less frequently, including the li-
     brary, librarians, books, academic databases, and an annotated bibliography provid-
     ed by an instructor. And many students did not specify what kind of research they
     conducted in the process of coming up with a topic.

8. The data (x) were transformed as follows: sqrt(x + 0.5). Results of a paired t-test in R
     on transformed data demonstrate a statistically significant difference (at alpha = .05)
     in the number of times activities were coded in post-tests (t(47) = 2.02, p = .04896).

9. Results of a McNemar test in R demonstrate a statistically significant difference
     in activities coded engage in post-tests (2(1) = 11.25, p = .0007962). In order to
     conduct the analysis, five students' pre- or post-tests were excluded, for lack of a
     matched post- or pre-test, so that n = 48.

10. The data (y) were transformed as follows: sqrt(y + 0.5). Results of a paired t-test
     in R on transformed data demonstrate a trending but not statistically significant
     difference (at alpha = .05) in the number of times activities were coded for WIL in
     post-tests (t(47) = 1.75, p = .08752).

11. While brainstorm is the activity most frequently coded for level 2, it was almost
     always coded for invent.

12. Such research could have significant implications for existing phenomenographic
     research on students' frames for understanding (or ways of experiencing) the use of
     sources (e.g., Bruce et al., 2006; Maybee et al., 2013). Two additional codes of par-
     ticular interest are acknowledging different view or opinions and understanding the
     assignment and its tasks. Kuhlthau (1988) found navigating contrasting perspectives
     to be a significant challenge, yet Fister's (1992) exceptional students welcomed such
     contradictions. Nelson's (1993) case studies point to the provocative hypothesis that
     students' understanding of their assignments and tasks explain the difference be-
     tween "valuable opportunities to extend their knowledge through critical inquiry or
     unchallenging exercises in gathering and reproducing information" (p.116).

UP THE MOUNTAIN WITHOUT
A TRAIL: HELPING STUDENTS
USE SOURCE NETWORKS
TO FIND THEIR WAY

Miriam Laskin

York College, City University of New York

The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) has recently replaced
their Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (IL Stan-
dards) (ACRL, 2000) with the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (Framework for IL) (ACRL, 2015). The Framework for IL shifts the
focus from information literacy (IL) competency standards as delineated in the
IL Standards to a series of six threshold concepts (frames), "each consisting of a
concept central to information literacy" (Framework for IL, p. 2). As noted in its
introduction, "Threshold concepts are those ideas in any discipline that are pas-
sageways or portals to enlarged understanding or ways of thinking and practic-
ing within that discipline" (p. 2). One of the IL threshold concepts, or frames, is
Scholarship as Conversation. Our analysis of Cynthia Haller's students' research
papers points to the necessity of helping students recognize that if they can iden-
tify a source network and the significant authorities in a discipline or field, they
can take advantage of the "scholarly conversation" by using citation trails (i.e.,
source, or knowledge, networks). Three other threshold concepts relevant to our
analysis are Authority Is Constructed and Contextual, Research as Inquiry, and
Searching as Strategic Exploration and we will bring these concepts into our
discussion as appropriate.

    For this chapter, we have examined research papers written by students in
Haller's Fall 2012 and Spring 2013 junior-level course, "Research and Writing
for the Professions," and will describe these more fully in a later section. We
find that students especially have difficulty identifying what we call a "source
network"--also known as a citation trail. We define a source network as a web of

Laskin and Haller

interconnected texts within which a particular text occupies a single node. The
source networks most important to academic research, on which we are focusing
in this chapter, are the "scholarly conversations" described in the new IL frame,
Scholarship as Conversation. However, we envision source networks as poten-
tially expanding beyond the "scholarly conversations" central to disciplinary
knowledge. For instance, a full source network on the neuroscience topic of
memory could potentially include news and magazine articles, fiction and poetry,
Internet blogs, etc. related to memory. We believe it important for students, when
doing scholarly research, not only to identify the "scholarly conversation" sub-
set of the broader source networks relevant to their chosen research topics, but
also to understand how disciplinary knowledge branches out to connect to other
genres and modes of text. The problems students have hooking into source net-
works have not been examined as fully as some of the other major difficulties they
encounter in college-level research/writing, nor have source networks' connection
to finding an appropriate focus and evaluating sources been fully explored.

    To learn more about students' use of source networks, we analyzed nine
students' three scaffolded-research writing assignments: a research proposal,
an annotated bibliography, and a final, formal research paper of 10-12 pages
(see Appendix A). We obtained written permission from these students to use
their texts for research under the condition that they be assigned pseudonyms
as authors. We discovered that none of the students used source networks, as we
are defining them, even those who received the highest grades. While this was a
disappointment, it has given us a chance to reflect on the need for disciplinary
and library faculty to better understand how students actually search for--and
choose--information sources as they do research. We realized, too, that even
though it seems to be much easier to do research in this age of digital collections
(web and databases) because of easy access to a wealth of texts, students are now
floundering in an avalanche of sources that potentially obscure rather than reveal
knowledge networks that might assist them in their research. Thus, the student
research process--always difficult, confusing, even daunting--is complicated by
the staggering number of potential sources available at the click of a mouse.
Those of us who did research before there were databases and the Internet had
a different, time-consuming task: we had to use print sources, and we used
indexes, abstracts, and bibliographies at the end of books and journal articles to
complete our research. We followed the hallowed "citation trails"--the source
networks laid out in our print-based tools.

    To enable our students to identify the scholarly conversations in which we
expect them to participate, we must introduce them to the value of source net-
works, but do so in the context of the Internet and electronic research databases.
It is worth noting here that students today may never have held a print journal

in their hands. Somehow, we need to enable them to find the scholarly conver-
sations, or "tacit knowledge" (Fister, 2013) that faculty possess but which their
students born in 1980 or after may have no clue about because of the sea changes
in how we collect, store, and retrieve information in this online, digital world.
Fortunately, the tools for identifying such networks are present within electronic
tools and venues; however, they must be explicitly brought to students' attention
as they engage in research. Here, we suggest several ways teachers in any disci-
pline who include formal research papers in their course curricula can better
assist students in identifying and capitalizing on source networks. Students are
in need of a digital age strategy for following the citation trail up that mountain
of information sources.

    As we noted, our study indicates that students can best be served through col-
laboration between academic librarians and writing faculty. Academic librarians
and writing faculty, particularly those involved in writing-across-the-curriculum
initiatives and writing centers, describe the problems for students and teachers
alike when teaching writing is relegated to first-year writing courses and research
is left to academic librarians to deal with as a focus of IL. In fact, though, research
and writing should be thought of as part of the same process and not separated.
James Elmborg and Sheril Hook (2005) repeatedly emphasize this point in their
volume of essays on collaborations between libraries and writing centers. Elm-
borg correctly describes the research/writing process as recursive and notes that
it is related in part to the recurring interplay between writing and information.
By segregating the research process from the writing process, we obscure this
fact and thereby impoverish both the writing process and the research process
(Elmborg & Hook, p. 11). By working together, however, librarians and writing
center professionals can enact a "shared practice where research and writing can
be treated as a single holistic process" (p. 1).

    Several Library and Information Science (LIS) scholars have studied and
written about the difficulties undergraduate students face in identifying good
sources for their research (Bodi, 2002; Leckie, 1996; Fister, 1992; among oth-
ers). They make the case for disciplinary faculty becoming more aware of the
gulf between being expert researchers and novices, and what those differences
are. It is worth quoting Gloria Leckie (1996) from her widely read article "Des-
perately Seeking Citations . . . " in which she describes faculty who embody the
"expert researcher model" (p. 202); they have integrated the research process
and know their own fields well. To academic experts, the scholarly conversations
supporting "threshold concepts" in their disciplines have become tacit knowl-
edge; they can be so familiar that experts lose consciousness of the explicit learn-
ing by which they were originally acquired. On the other hand, their students
exemplify the "novice researcher model." They

                                                                                                 239
Laskin and Haller

         . . . have no sense of who might be important in a particular
         field, and find it difficult to build and follow a citation trail.
         They do not have the benefit of knowing anyone who actu-
         ally does research in the discipline (except for their professor)
         and so do not have a notion of something as intangible as the
         informal scholarly network. They have never attended a schol-
         arly conference. Because of their level of cognitive develop-
         ment, ambiguity and non-linearity may be quite threatening.
         They do not think in terms of an information-seeking strat-
         egy, but rather in terms of a coping strategy. Research is con-
         ceptualized as a fuzzy library-based activity which is required
         of them to complete their coursework. In other words, the
         novice is very far from the expert model. (p. 202)

    Clearly, students lack what experts have: a sound information-seeking strategy.
Without an understanding of the scholarly networks that underlie writing within
disciplines, they have difficulty identifying appropriate sources. They are unaware
of how sources are interconnected with one another and do not understand how
to discover and/or mark appropriate citation trails (our "source networks"). This
problem is even more challenging for students today because they do not get the
same clues, or cues, about sources when they find them online as their faculty
were able to get in the print-only world of research. Unfortunately, disciplinary
faculty are not themselves always prepared to help their students with these dif-
ficulties. They may have been schooled prior to the digital age and be unfamiliar
with the extended tools available in electronic library resources. Their knowledge
of source networks relevant to their fields may largely be tacit and thus difficult
to explain unless "props" are used (for example, an actual copy of a print journal).
Some simply may not have reflected upon the challenges their students encounter
and/or have not been prepared to help students with the research/writing process.
In her illuminating article, "Information Literacy from the Trenches: How Do
Humanities and Social Science Majors Conduct Academic Research," Alison J.
Head (2008) describes the results of a Project Information Literacy [PIL] study
that included examining teachers' research assignment handouts. The study found

         a lack of detail and guidance in many research assignment
         handouts. As a whole, the handouts offered little direction
         about: (1) plotting the course for research, (2) crafting a qual-
         ity paper, and (3) preparing a paper that adheres to a grading
         rubric of some kind. Few of the handouts analyzed mentioned
         where students were to look for research resources. (p. 435, italics
         added)

    Head's article also provides insight into many other aspects of students'
research and writing processes and is worth reading to enable better faculty
understanding of student researchers.

    In addition to (and perhaps because of ) their difficulty identifying source
networks, students often have difficulty evaluating sources, or they do not eval-
uate them at all (McClure & Clink, 2009). Academic library faculty teach how
to critically evaluate information sources, but the focus is usually on evaluating
the source per se rather than its location within a larger knowledge network.
In keeping with the IL frame "Authority Is Constructed and Contextual," they
teach how to apply specific criteria to a particular source in order to ascertain
whether the author or creator of the source is an authority and whether the con-
tent is trustworthy and valuable. However, evaluating sources has also become
an issue that should be studied as an integral part of the search process itself. This
point is emphasized by Brett Bodemer (2012) in his article, "The Importance of
Search as Intertextual Practice for Undergraduate Research." He is interested in
the way students search, particularly in the 21st century, when students typically
find an overwhelming number of sources of information both on the web and in
licensed databases. Bodemer asserts that these searches are not "lower order men-
tal activity" (p. 336) and that "the role of search" itself is part of the teaching and
learning matrix, where students should know both how to find "good" sources
but also to exclude sources that are not appropriate for their research (p. 337).

    Bodemer's article articulates an area of the research process that needs more
exploration. As a way of helping students winnow through search results that
can literally number in the millions, disciplinary and library faculty have learned
to urge their students to create search strategies using keywords to find articles.
However, teaching students to narrow searches by manipulating keywords may
not be sufficient for helping them identify networks of sources that are truly
interconnected within specific knowledge networks. After our examination of
Haller's students' reference lists, it is one of our conclusions that her students
seem to have relied on keyword searches in a database and then looked at the
first 5, 10, or maybe even 20 of the resulting articles, choosing whatever num-
ber they felt were sufficient to meet the criteria for the project and to give them
enough information to fill the required number of pages. We will discuss more
fully why this is a concern and how we propose to supplement teaching search
behavior based solely on keyword searches.

    The problem of finding and correctly using sources is discussed from a dif-
ferent angle by Sandra Jamieson, Rebecca Moore Howard, and the other schol-
ars who run The Citation Project (http://citationproject.net). They explore
the question of why teachers seem more concerned with plagiarism than with
other difficulties in the research process. In "Writing from Sources, Writing

                                                                                                 241

from Sentences," Howard, Tricia Serviss, and Tanya K. Rodrigue (2010) note,
"Instead of focusing on students' citation of sources, educators should attend to
the more fundamental question of how well students understand their sources
and whether they are able to write about them without appropriating language
from the source" (177). We agree. However, we would add and emphasize that
understanding a source requires not simply intratextual cognitive work of com-
prehension but also intertextual cognitive work that appropriately connects
individual sources with one another within knowledge networks. Students' ten-
dency to rely on loosely connected sources on their topics--e.g., that first page
of results from a database or Google keyword search--contributes to their writ-
ing problems because they lack a true context and understanding of where their
source material fits within larger landscapes of knowledge.

OUR RESEARCH GOAL AND METHOD OF ANALYSIS

To explore whether and how well students are able to identify, understand, and
capitalize on source networks in their research, we analyzed sources cited in the
research proposals, annotated bibliographies, and final research papers of stu-
dents in an upper-division research writing course taught by Professor Haller.
We received permission from students in her fall 2012 and spring 2013 sections
to examine and publish findings about their research projects, using pseudonyms
so the students would not be identified. We sought to identify where students
ran into problems with source choices and incorporation, and how disciplinary
faculty and academic librarians can collaborate in order to help students be more
successful. We examined nine sets of three interlocking papers that were por-
tions of the scaffolded research assignment: three in each of three grade ranges
(low, mid, and high range). We were most interested in discovering aspects of
how and whether students were able to find and use a "source network" during
the course of their research. Did students indeed discover and use the scholarly
networks Leckie speaks of in the course of doing their research? If not, what
might have gone wrong?

    Haller provided detailed written instructions for each of the interlocking,
scaffolded assignments (see Appendix A), which address the IL Framework's
threshold concepts, Authority Is Constructed and Contextual, Research as
Inquiry and Searching Is Strategic. In her instructions for the 2-3 page pro-
posal, she explained how to start finding a topic and then work on focusing it.
She commented on the cyclical (recursive) nature of this stage, where reading in
sources during the research process would help to focus the topic and in choos-
ing sub-topics--which in turn would help to organize the contents of the final
paper. She also instructed her students what to include in the proposal: why

242
                                                                          Up the Mountain without a Trail

the topic is of interest, who the audience will be, a description of a few of their
sources so far, and what keywords they would use to continue their research. The
result was that most of the students' proposals appeared to be adequate or very
satisfactory as a starting point for the rest of the project. It seems particularly
helpful for students to find subtopics or sub-questions to keep in mind during
the research and then the organization of the final paper.

    The second part of the project was to compile an annotated bibliography of
about 8-10 sources and again, detailed instructions were given. (Web sources
were allowed, but scholarly articles needed to be included too.) The papers we
examined all had satisfactory annotated bibliographies, though not without errors
or problems with the citations themselves. As we mentioned earlier, emphasizing
citation formats too much can be counterproductive, leading students to focus
on bibliographic formatting at the expense of source understanding. However,
these errors point to a problem related to students' understanding of source
networks. Students often have difficulty identifying the types of sources they
are using, making it nearly impossible for them to find correct bibliographic
formatting in their handbooks, which organize this information by source type.
Further, students do not have a clear idea of what a journal article is, and how
it is different from unsigned articles from magazines, or from articles posted on
informational websites and the like. As we have noted, they may never, in fact,
have ever held a copy of a journal in their hands.

    We are neither pining for nor advocating a return to the old days of print
culture; however, it is important to recognize certain limitations electronic
formats place on students' understanding of how sources are situated within
knowledge networks and to compensate for those limitations. Databases collect
articles from all kinds of periodicals and reference books and list them together
when a keyword search is performed. In result lists, source items are embodied
in a uniform format. This doesn't help students understand how information is
created, distributed, and connected; it doesn't help them understand what type
of source each listing represents (e.g., scholarly journal or news article); and it
doesn't help them evaluate a source that appears on a result list. Bodemer makes
an important point on this issue:

         Practice in searching . . . engages students in intertextual
         skills in the larger framework of the undergraduate paper. It
         involves complicated acts of evaluation and decision mak-
         ing. Students who learn to read and navigate the multiple
         points of content representation in databases are engaged in
         grappling with the structure of texts and the organization of
         knowledge at large. (p. 340)

                                                                                                 243
Laskin and Haller

    Over time, digital copies of articles in databases have come to include visual
cues that help students contextualize and evaluate their sources--e.g., actual pic-
tures of publications are sometimes included with the sources, and pdfs repro-
duce the fonts, features, and visual elements of the original. However, to access
these advanced versions of database articles, students must usually move beyond
the results list to discover these features. In addition, material cues in electronic
texts (that is, in HTML format) are only implied, whereas the embodied char-
acter of print publications disallows overlooking such cues as publication covers,
size of the overall publication, and paper quality and size. Finally, paratextual
cues that might help students better apprehend the knowledge networks within
which sources exist are usually entirely absent in electronic formats or require
further searching for discovery: editorial boards, contributor information, tables
of contents, and other texts that accompany a given source text within a publi-
cation are usually absent in the result lists or item record in licensed databases.

    As we compared students' annotated bibliographies with their final papers, we
discovered that of the nine students' work, only one used all of the sources in her
annotated bibliography (but added no new sources in her final paper); one student
used none of the nine sources from his annotated bibliography (he cited 10 new
sources in his final paper); and the remaining seven students used anywhere from
one-half to three-quarters of their annotated bibliography sources and added from
a high of 14 new citations to a low of two new cites in their final papers. This shift
in sources used for the final research paper is to be expected and actually is desir-
able. It indicates that students were not at all finished with the research at the time
they had to complete their annotated bibliographies. It also suggests (or at least we
would like to hope it suggests) that students were using new sources to construct
and reconstruct their understanding of their topics over time.

    We analyzed the students' final research papers by noting, first, which of the
sources included in the annotated bibliographies were also used in the paper and
included in the references cited. We also made it a point to notice when a source
was cited in-text but was left out of the references. The reason why some stu-
dents didn't include some sources used within the paper in their references is not
clear, though it may be a function of not knowing how to deal with material in
a source that quotes and/or cites material from a prior source. Academic experts
encountering this "embedded" material would generally follow up by consulting
the original source and citing the original source if the material is used in their
publications. Students, however, are likely not going back to the original source.
Here is another indication that we are not raising their awareness of how to use
citation trails to enhance their knowledge of their topics.

    Finally, we moved on to the most critical portion of the analysis, looking
at what we call the "intertextual index" for each paper. Specifically, for each

244
                                                                          Up the Mountain without a Trail

of the sources cited, we determined whether that source cited any of the other
sources students used. This method makes use of the idea of degrees of separa-
tion between sources to see how closely students' sources were connected to one
another within knowledge networks. We see the intertextual index as only one
measure of intertextuality, but one that can help to determine whether students
were tapping into source networks. As research has shown, expert researchers do
not simply cite individual sources but also exploit and use entire source ecologies
to build their ethos and develop their lines of argument, as research by Shirley
Rose (1996, 1999) has shown.

    In academics' literature reviews, it is not necessarily a single source cited that
identifies the knowledge network an author seeks to enter, but rather the entire
constellation of sources and how they are connected to one another within larger
systems of meaning--in other words, experts understand the IL frame "Author-
ity Is Constructed and Contextual," while novice researchers have not reached
that point in their understanding of the research process. We spent time looking
up each citation in the list of references for each paper and, after locating it, we
checked whether that source cited other sources as references or works cited at the
end of the article. For even the most successful papers, we often had to struggle to
locate sources because the students were not citing sources correctly, but we did
our best. As we have already noted, not a single student seemed to have found
a source network. Interestingly, some of the students did cite authors whom we
found through our own research to be experts in their field and much cited by
other writers. This finding suggests that students' searches for sources, though less
sophisticated than faculty's, can indeed lead them in the direction of key experts
in a field, at least in some cases. Provided students can recognize when they have
happened on such an expert, they might then be taught to focus more closely on
the bibliographies of these authors to lead them deeper into source networks.

    One such student was Amal, whose paper on artificial intelligence (AI) was
in the high-grade range. He included 10 citations in his reference list, though
only one of those was from his annotated bibliography and the rest were new.
Amal's reference list included two citations to two peer-reviewed articles by the
same two widely published experts on AI, Shane Legg and Marcus Hutter. Upon
examining the two articles by Legg and Hutter cited by Amal, we found that
they cite two other writers who were also included in Amal's reference list--Ray
Kurzweil (perhaps the most widely known and respected authority on AI) and
Linda Gottfredson, a sociologist who writes about intelligence but has nothing
to say about AI. However, the articles by Kurzweil and Gottfredson that Legg
and Hutter cited are not the same articles Amal cited in his own reference list;
thus, it seems likely that the apparent intertextual connections visible in Amal's
cited sources were coincidental.

                                                                                                 245
Laskin and Haller

    Amal also used two articles from a website (http://www.lucidpages.com/) that
has no identified owner or creator. It seems to be a repository created in 2008
by someone who wishes to offer a wide range of unpublished pieces by someone
only identified as "Dak" whose book (no title offered), it is noted, is now out
of print. Thus, though Amal's paper was well-organized, the quality, authority,
and reliability of his sources was very mixed: five were written by acknowledged
scholars or experts in the field of AI; one was an undated, unsigned reference
article on a commercial psychology portal from India; another was from an
online magazine devoted to science (New Scientist). In addition, most of Amal's
sources were published between 1994 and 2008. The only source more recent
was the third (2009) edition of a widely used textbook on AI. Because of the
constant work being done in AI, we believe he should have been finding more
recent materials on AI. A lack of recent source material can be an indication
that a student has plagiarized from an older source rather than performed fresh
searches, which would likely have turned up more recent sources. The possibility
cannot be ruled out; however, we did not identify indications of plagiarism in
Amal's paper.

    Sources used by Lee for his paper on the software patent wars and their
effect on software creation for smart phones makes a good comparison to Amal's
sources. Lee's paper was also in the high range, but there were differences in
the ways they approached their research and in their source choices. As with
Amal, it doesn't seem that Lee tapped into a source network because we couldn't
link together any citations from his list of references. However, there is a good
possibility that Lee found two key sources that guided his research focus and
his subtopics as he described them in his proposal, thereby contributing to the
quality of his paper by connecting it to ongoing scholarly conversations. Lee's
research project was about U.S. laws regarding software patents, with a focus on
how they make the creation of new smart phone software difficult. Two of the
sources he describes in his research proposal (and which he did use for his final
paper) were by well-respected experts in patent law, business and technology.
The first is a book which Lee describes as an overview of the U.S. patent system.
He stresses that reading it made him want to do more research on today's prob-
lematic patent laws. The second source he names in his proposal is a New York
Times article, "The Patent, Used as a Sword," by Charles Duhigg and Steve Lohr,
both prize-winning journalists and writers. The article was part of a series on
the global high tech industry and it won a 2013 Pulitzer Prize. Lee notes in his
proposal that reading the article helped him refine his topic to focus on software
patents. We have only Lee's proposal and the final paper to use to "prove" that
these were key sources and that they helped him to find his focus and refine it,
but his own testimony feels like real evidence. We believe that his paper was one

246
                                                                          Up the Mountain without a Trail

of the best because he found and used two key sources to the best advantage to
focus his research topic.

    As we examined Lee's final list of references, for instance, we noticed that
of the 10 sources in his annotated bibliography, he used only seven in his final
paper and added 14 more. These new sources were almost all newspaper articles
or articles and reports published online by technology, patent and other relevant
organizations, associations or companies. All of these were highly relevant and
timely, suggesting that the early focus he achieved from the Duhigg and Lohr
article may have helped him perform more focused secondary searches later as
he worked on the final report. Lee did, however, go off track and make some
strange choices from the web. They didn't hurt his paper, but they make us want
to know more about how he actually searched for information on his topic on
the web. For example, one of his sources was a Swedish website, from which he
took a definition of "software patent." Another strange choice was a personal
blog entry from which he got a quote from Ben Franklin's autobiography about
how people should not invent new things in order to make money, but rather to
do it for the public good. The blog owner describes his underlying focus as "the
ineffable nature of life!"--hardly a statement attesting to the blogger's expertise
on patents, though his inclusion of Franklin's quote turned out to be fortuitous
for Lee. Alternatively, perhaps Lee had heard or seen the quote elsewhere and
located it online in an Internet search so he could include the source in his ref-
erence list.

WHAT WE LEARNED ABOUT HELPING
STUDENTS FIND SOURCE NETWORKS

We learned from our examination of Haller's students' research papers that we--
disciplinary faculty and librarians--need to focus our teaching more on the actual
search process, and to move beyond simply teaching students to use keywords to
find sources. Today's digital world is both a blessing and a curse for researchers,
especially undergraduate novices. They think they know how to find information
because the entry of a word or two in a rectangular box yields a multitude of
results, whether in Google or in electronic databases. However, using keywords to
generate a results list is rarely sufficient for identifying how sources are intercon-
nected within knowledge networks. Disciplinary faculty need to collaborate with
library instruction faculty to teach students how to find and exploit citation trails.
Because finding information in electronic formats has changed so radically from
finding information in print formats, we need to use a new, modern approach for
researchers, one that concentrates on finding and hooking into digital networks
of related sources. The curse of digital information storage and retrieval is, of

                                                                                                 247
Laskin and Haller

course, that many of our students are absolutely overwhelmed by the mountain
of information they find from a single keyword. This difficulty has been noted
many times by educators who write about the web and the critical skills needed
to find the right kind of sources and be able to evaluate them for relevance and
authority (Calkins & Kelley, 2007). The same "curse" applies to searching with
keywords in research databases. As we have noted, Haller's students' citations
seemed only loosely related to one another. They did not find source networks, in
all probability because no one has taught them how to find these networks, nor
shown them how valuable such networks can be to find the kind of information
they need, from acknowledged experts, on their research subjects.

    As it turns out, however, there are some simple ways to find intertextual con-
nections--source networks and citation trails--both on the web and in some of
the more user-friendly databases. Once a teacher or a student has seen how to do
this online or in a database, they will be able to use it and to pass the techniques
along to others. There are two kinds of citation trails. One is the "backward"
citation trail that is found when one reads a journal article and examines the
references at the end. These are citations to the sources that the writer used and
because they were written before the article that contains them, we call them
"backward citation trails."

    In today's digital information environment, it is quite easy to find these trails,
and even to find the full-text articles, especially in databases owned by Ebsco-
Host that offer links to "Cited References" and "Times Cited in this Database."
Each article record in Ebscohost provides both forward and backward citation
trails, many of which are live links leading to the actual articles, making it rela-
tively easy to hook into a source network that will be useful.

    The source network we call the "forward citation trail" leads from a given
article the researcher likes and plans to use, to articles with more recent publi-
cation dates whose authors cited the given article. The best way to find a source
network that looks forward, however, is not Ebscohost but Google Scholar.
Some students know about Google Scholar, but we think they may be unfamil-
iar with some of its useful tools, especially those that can connect them to source
networks. When Google Scholar is used with a keyword search, the articles in
the result list have the following links underneath each citation and the excerpt
from the abstract:

    Cited by [#] Related articles All [#] versions Cite More

    Clicking the "Cited by [#]" link yields a new list of results--articles or books
that cited that article. In our experience, about half of the results on this list also
offer a link to a PDF or HTML version of the article so that the researcher does
not even have to spend more time tracking down the item. In case she does, the

"More" link offers a "Library Search." Clicking on it brings up WorldCat and
one can choose a nearby library (including the college library if it owns that
work) that owns the item sought. There are more "goodies" available as links
below Google Scholar citations that we haven't described, but we will let our
readers explore them. Katt Blackwell-Starnes (Chapter 7, this collection) also
finds that teaching how to use Google Scholar leads to a better understanding of
the intertext--the source network--and reveals more clearly for students who
the leading experts in a particular subject are, and what the context is for their
research topic:

         Teaching students to use the bibliographies of relevant sources
         and the related research aspects of Google Scholar and the
         library databases adds another layer that emphasize additional
         methods for developing effective search strategies and also
         introduce students to the Framework for IL's threshold con-
         cept that scholarship is a conversation. (pp. 155-156)

    The writing in Haller's students' papers also indicated other issues that
appear to be connected to the students' search for and use of sources. The con-
tent and organization of final papers in the middle and low grade ranges tended
to veer off from their focus and the sub-questions they named in their propos-
als, perhaps because they did not identify source networks of related articles
that spoke to the same topics and issues. Their references often included articles
only loosely (if at all) relevant to their stated central focus. Perhaps they felt they
should discuss the ideas in these off-topic sources since they had taken time to
read them and/or wanted to include them to achieve the required number of
sources, even though the sources did not really belong in the knowledge/source
networks most relevant to their chosen topic. In addition, in the same low- and
middle-range papers, the students often failed to synthesize, or integrate, the
actual ideas and analyses from their source articles. As studies published by the
Citation Project have shown, students who have not been able to compre-
hend an author's work tend to rely on quoting a sentence, or paraphrasing or
patchwriting, and they do not summarize--which essentially points to a lack
of understanding of the ideas in the sources. Our study suggests that this lack
of understanding is further exacerbated by students' inability to contextualize
their sources within knowledge networks.

    Even assignment instruction handouts that include much helpful advice for
students on how to conduct the research and how to organize and format their
papers can lack one or two key aids. Instead of instructing students merely to
use keywords in their database and web searches, it would be of more use to help
them understand how to find the relevant source networks--the citation trails

                                                                                                 249
Laskin and Haller

or the intertextual connections between key sources on their topics. Access to
these networks helps them understand where any particular source they use is
situated within the networks of knowledge about their chosen topics.

    Teaming up with a librarian to show students how to use Google Scholar
or a database like EbscoHost's Academic Search Complete to uncover the source/
knowledge networks, or to see the ongoing "conversation" between scholars and
professionals about their chosen field, would be a significant step for disciplinary
faculty to take. Two other ways that library faculty can collaborate with their
disciplinary faculty colleagues in teaching the research process come to mind.
One is to get a librarian's help in teaching students to understand the types of
periodicals and the usefulness of peer-reviewed journals, since Haller's students'
papers led us to the conclusion that many of them didn't understand the differ-
ences in periodical types. That lack of discernment affected, among other things,
the errors they made in creating their list of citations. Finally, a joint lesson or
two with the teacher and a librarian to teach students why evaluating sources is
important--particularly the authority of a source, whether it is a website or a
digital article, is a good idea.

    Librarians can teach students where to look on websites for information on
the author or site owner, as well as how to apply other evaluative criteria. The
disciplinary faculty member who wants to help her students focus on authority
in sources can require students to include biographical and professional descrip-
tions of authors whose sources they're using in their proposals, annotated bibli-
ographies, or other parts of a scaffolded research project.

APPENDIX A: HALLER'S RESEARCH
ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS

A. Your Research Proposal (due 8th week of class)

    1. Choose a General Research Topic and Read Background Information on the
Topic

    Your research project should be related to an important issue in your major
or professional discipline that is also of interest to you. As you explore possible
topics in a preliminary way, I suggest that you move back and forth between:

    a) topics that interest you, either because you've encountered them in one
         of your courses in your major or because you feel a personal connec-
         tion of some kind; and

    b) what you are able to find by exploring library databases and other
         online sources using keywords derived from your major or professional
         discipline.

    That is, use the topics that you're interested in to drive your initial search
strategy, then REVISE AND REFINE that topic based on what you find during
the research process. This cyclical process will help you to find a topic that is
both of interest to you, relevant to your major, and researchable. It's of no use
to have an interesting research question but then find that there are no materials
relevant to it--maybe you are years ahead of your field! But it's ALSO pointless
to choose a topic that is easily researchable--there are many sources available--
but which bores you to tears. Either of these approaches is a recipe for having a

252
                                                                          Up the Mountain without a Trail

frustrating experience of writing a research paper, either because you can't find
sources or because you are working on a topic that does not intellectually interest
you. The way to avoid these twin dangers is to keep looping back between your
interests and your continuing research. Start with something that intellectually
interests you and is related to your major field. . . . This preliminary research
process will also help you to find out the current issues in your field, including
what is pretty much accepted fact, and which questions remain open and per-
haps controversial. Note: An issue for which you can identify clear controversies
will work best as a research topic. Remember also that you may consider social,
political, economic, philosophical aspects of a particular problem, or the ways in
which research is applied in your field.

    2. Develop a Research Question

    Once you have a general topic, start to narrow it down. To assist you in this
narrowing, read some background on your topic in a specialized encyclopedia,
which will help you determine possible areas you might focus on. Also consider
what materials you are able to find in the databases. Remember that your goal
here is to articulate a research question: a specific question which you do not
know the answer to, but which can be answered through an inspection of the
scholarly literature in your field. This is different from deciding on your general
research topic. [Examples given, deleted here for space]

    After you've been through the cycle of brainstorming/preliminary research
several times, and you're beginning to get a sense of your direction, you're ready
to write your research proposal.

    3. Write your Research Proposal Using the Following Format

       i. Provide a rationale for your research. In your first section, provide
           some background on the topic you are choosing: what is it and why
           is this an important topic to research (consider social and /or medical
           needs). What is generally known about this topic? Who might benefit
           from your work? The rationale paragraph should answer the "so what?"
           question. Why is your topic of intellectual or social significance, and
           what issues are unresolved? You've picked a topic that you care about;
           now make me care!

       ii. Identify your central research question and any subquestions/
           related questions you've identified to guide your research. In this
           section of the proposal, indicate how you have narrowed your over-
           all research topic and what your main research question currently is
           (see "From general topic to research question" above). You should
           also be able to list several sub-questions that will guide you in finding
           the answer to your central question. These sub-questions will lay the

                                                                                                 253
Laskin and Haller

           groundwork for the organization of your paper. To identify sub-ques-
           tions, think about some specific things you will need to find out in
           order to answer your big research question. If you have a logically
           arranged sequence of sub-questions, you are a good distance toward
           organizing your research paper.
       iii. Describe your audience. In this section, provide some information
           about your specific audience and how your paper will help them. Your
           paper should have a natural audience beyond your classmates: who
           will be interested in this topic and why? For instance, "My paper will
           be directed toward a hospital administrator recommending how we
           can revise our patient literature to incorporate cultural diversity." Or
           "My paper will make a recommendation for U.S. governmental policy
           on genetically engineered plants, after considering pros and cons, from
           ecological, ethical, and economic perspectives, of genetically engi-
           neered crops in commercial agriculture. My audience will be my Sen-
           ator and/or Congressman." Or "My paper will report on psychological
           factors contributing to overeating and recommend to counselors at a
           domestic abuse center how to work with overeaters."
       iv. Report of preliminary research: This section should summarize
           information from two useful sources you have located that will help
           you answer your research question. Be very specific: name them, pro-
           vide specific details about what they say, and tell what each one has
           contributed to your thinking about your research question. Plan on
           spending around ½ page summarizing each source.
       v. Explain your search strategy and keywords. List the specific library
           and internet sources [e.g., specific databases, specific scholarly and
           trade journals] that you plan to use to develop your research paper.
           List the keywords and questions you've already employed to identify
           potential sources, along with any new keywords you've learned and
           plan to use. Discuss what you have found out about the types and
           number of sources available for this topic. Will you be able to select
           from many sources, or have you found just a few valuable sources so
           far? What kinds of books and articles are available to you? Remem-
           ber that you should be researching and reading throughout the entire
           research process.

B. Annotated Bibliography (3-5 pages) [Due Week 10]

    An annotated bibliography is a useful way to capture the essence of
the sources you've located. It helps you organize your research as well. In an

254
                                                                          Up the Mountain without a Trail

annotated bibliography, you summarize each of the sources you have chosen to
use, provide evaluative comments on the source, and note any ways it might be
useful to you in answering your research question. The annotated bibliography
thus serves as both a reference guide to the sources you have collected and a
stimulus for how to use those sources in your research paper.

    Prepare full APA documentation for each of the items in your annotated
bibliography as you would for an APA reference list. For each item, write 3-4
lines summarizing and/or evaluating the source. A sample annotated bibliogra-
phy entry can be found in Hacker, The Bedford Handbook, 8th edition, p. 479.

    You will need to create multiple bibliography entries like the Hacker sample,
one for each of your sources. Be sure to put the sources into alphabetical order.
Your Annotated Bibliography should include 8-12 good sources.

C. Drafts and Final Research Paper

    Outline and Draft Section of Research Paper #1 (2-3 pages) [Due Week 11]
    For this assignment, you will submit a full working outline for your paper
and the draft of one section of your research paper.

    Outline and Draft Section of Research Paper #2 (2-3 pages) [Due Week 12]
    For this assignment, you will submit the full working outline for your paper
and the draft of a second section of your research paper. After you submit this
draft, we will hold the REQUIRED peer review sessions. In these sessions, we'll
talk about how to take your draft sections to the next level. How can you develop
your ideas further with examples and/or ideas from your sources? Do you need
to consider adding an additional section or section? Is there another subquestion
you need to address to answer your research question? What information do you
still need to answer your research question effectively and what new sources will
you use to find that information?

    FINAL Research Paper [Due Week 15]
    8-10 pages; minimum of 8 sources, not including background information
sources (e.g., dictionaries, encyclopedias, superficial websites); sources must include a
minimum of three (3) scholarly peer-reviewed journal articles selected from the York
library databases, each of which must be a minimum of six (6) pages long.
    The research paper is the major course assignment. It should be 8-10 pages
long, not including the APA list of references or any figures/tables. While writ-
ings in lower division courses encourage students to develop a thesis and appro-
priately argue its merits by drawing upon appropriate sources, your research
paper in Writing 303 is driven by your research question, not by the thesis.

                                                                                                 255
Laskin and Haller

The paper is a written report which synthesizes research findings to answer the
intellectual problem you've posed for yourself in your research question. It is not
an argument which seeks to persuade readers about a predetermined thesis or
viewpoint. Nor should the paper be a technical report. Rather, it should explore
a question related to a problem arising from the development, social application,
or practice of your major or professional discipline.

    The research paper is based primarily on secondary sources (e.g. books and
articles). You may and are encouraged to use primary sources (e.g., interviews,
etc.), but these may not count toward the 8 required sources required for your
paper. While textbooks and encyclopedias (including Wikipedia) may be used to
get an overview of a particular problem and can be included in your bibliogra-
phy, they also may not be counted as one of the 8 required sources for the paper.
You should draw on at least 8-10 sources representing a balanced mix of books,
journals, both electronic and hard copy, and appropriate, reliable web-based
sources. Sources must include a minimum of three scholarly peer-reviewed jour-
nal articles selected from the York library database, each of which must be a
minimum of 6 pages. The number and exact mix of sources you use will depend
on your topic and question. The quality of your research paper will depend to a
considerable extent on the quality of your sources. I will provide feedback to you
regarding the appropriateness of your sources both informally as you search for
sources and also in my comments on your annotated bibliography assignment.

    Your final research paper will be 8-10 pages long, not including the title
page, the abstract page, and the list of references. You are encouraged to use
graphics that can help you communicate what you want to say to your audience,
but the graphics also DO NOT count toward the required 8-10 pages.

    Your paper should address your research question in an informed, balanced
manner, with consideration given to multiple perspectives regarding your ques-
tion, differences of opinion and controversies, and contradictory information
that you've encountered while reading your sources in relation to your question.
The best research papers effectively incorporate a broad range of quality sources
to support the thesis and provide responses to counterarguments as appropriate.

ETHICS, DISTRIBUTION,
AND CREDIBILITY: USING
AN EMERGING GENRE TO
TEACH INFORMATION
LITERACY CONCEPTS

      Christopher Toth and Hazel McClure
      Grand Valley State University

Currently, society is swept up in an information explosion. Individuals are sub-
ject not just to a plethora of information, but also the accompanying messi-
ness of the landscape as information streams continually from all directions in a
variety of formats, media, and genres. In addition, as information is generated
and distributed, it doesn't move from point a to point b to c to d and so on
(the author's desk to the editor's to the peer reviewer's, back to the editor, to
the printer, to the reader); it's created and published quickly and often infor-
mally and it reaches audiences via a multitude of venues. Outside the traditional
academic peer review process, publication and dissemination are relatively easy
and, as a result, a myriad of information is accessible. This information can
take a variety of forms including, but of course not limited to, Tweets, blogs,
videos, BuzzFeed lists, infographics, and news sound bites. This information
reality is filled with opportunity for discovery and burgeoning conversations
that transcend geographic limitations, but it also leads to an overabundance of
inaccurate, time wasting information that requires a rigorous degree of scrutiny.

    This new landscape puts educators into a difficult situation because we're trying
to teach students to manage all of this information, not just as students, but also
as citizens. There is no overarching rule to indicate whether information is "good"
or "bad." Instead, we need to equip students with the skills to make their own
decisions about how, when, and why to use information. One approach to this
challenge is to give students a starting point by using a genre that they are familiar
with and that has emerged within this new information landscape: infographics.

    As an emerging genre, infographics, or information graphics as they are more
formally known, can be used as a tool to empower instructors with pedagogical

Toth and McClure

opportunities to teach information literacy (IL) skills. Throughout this chapter,
we'll start by defining infographics and go on to show how IL allows for emerg-
ing genres like infographics to be used in educational settings. In addition, we
will describe how the consumption, production, and distribution cycle of info-
graphics relate to IL. We conclude by offering guidance on how instructors can
use this genre to teach IL skills and concepts and allow students to make better,
ethically informed choices.

DEFINING INFOGRAPHICS

A genre that is becoming increasingly present in information landscapes is info-
graphics, whose popularity has exploded with the expansion of social media.
While the genre is not new--it dates back to early cave drawings and Egyptian
hieroglyphics (Smiciklas, 2012; Krum, 2014)--infographics open a window for
teaching IL concepts in the classroom.

    Infographics, as the word itself implies, merge information with graphics.
They communicate by combining words and visual elements in an engaging,
static, cohesive display that attempts to inform, persuade, educate, and/or enter-
tain an audience about a particular issue. While these displays may communicate
numerical or statistical data, this is not a requirement of the genre. Infographics
usually contain images, text, numbers, statistics, drawings, color, linework, or
some combination thereof. They are stand-alone and offer a quick snapshot of
whatever topic or theme they discuss.

    One special caveat of infographics is that they are static rather than dynamic.
Displays that can adjust instantaneously with user input, known as interactive
data displays, are related to but distinct from infographics (Rawlins & Wilson,
in press; Toth, 2013). Both display information, but infographics are not adjust-
able by the audience. This distinction is important because this chapter will
focus on static infographics. In other words, once an infographic is published,
it can no longer be changed, similar to a printed journal article or book chapter.

    Within the last several years, as the genre has become even more popular,
and as how-to books, compilations, and other guides surface (Smiciklas, 2012;
Lankow, Ritchie & Crooks, 2012; Cook, 2013; Krum, 2014), it's becoming
apparent that many people are embracing the genre to communicate about their

    Infographics are so ubiquitous that they exist on nearly every topic imag-
inable, and they can be found almost anywhere: marketing campaigns, annual

reports, social media sites like Twitter, Pinterest, and Facebook, promotional
fliers, etc. They offer packaging that is both fun and engaging in terms of design
and are capable of conveying a relatively large amount of information in a small,
discreet footprint. Because of these features, they are much more readily share-
able than other genres that communicate the same amount of information via
text alone.

INFORMATION IN FLUX

While there are many definitions of IL, for the purposes of this chapter, we'll be
using the current Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) defini-
tion: "Information literacy is a set of abilities requiring individuals to recognize
when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use
effectively the needed information" (ACRL, 2000). This definition emphasizes a
set of skills that an information literate person possesses and uses. This skillset is
applicable not just for students in their roles as students, but also as individuals,
citizens, and professionals.

    In February 2015, ACRL finalized the Framework for Information Literacy for
Higher Education. The approach of this document encourages educators to teach
IL not simply as a set of skills, but also to teach within a framework that empha-
sizes metaliteracy and conceptual understanding of key IL threshold concepts.

    IL, viewed through either a skills-based or conceptual lens, carries with it
an attention and ability to critically think about the information lifecycle and
the ways in which information is created, distributed, and consumed. Much
like writing and research, IL skills are organic and iterative, and they reflect the
rich and complex workings of the information cycle. Information (whether in
the form of a song, a journal article, a painting, a tweet, or an infographic) is
created and then distributed, consumed, shared, discussed, and subsequently
has the potential to give rise to "new" information. The song inspires another
musician, the journal article is cited, the tweet is retweeted, or the infographic
is shared. Understanding how these currents move or might move in different
contexts and under varying influences leads to a critical awareness of sources
of information; an information literate person engages in the rhetorical act of
asking questions about who the creator of any given piece of information is, the
audience for whom it was created, and the purpose, in addition to using the
content of the information.

    The information landscape is undergoing vast changes. The sheer volume of
information available can muddy the waters for students. New discovery tools
mimicking the ostensible simplicity of Google provide students with easy access
to millions of documents with a few taps of the keyboard, sometimes leading

                                                                                                 259

students to think that resource discovery is easy. However, finding a source and
finding a relevant, accurate source are two different things. As more sources
become available, it's more important than ever that students are capable of
critically examining sources. In nonacademic settings, information is constantly
feeding us streams of information--from the billboards on the side of the street,
to the devices in our pockets--about our social, political, and financial worlds.

    Access to this information is in some ways liberating and a boon to democ-
racy. However, there are some complications. Students may be likely to find and
cite information that (rightly or wrongly) simply reaffirms their own beliefs.
For instance, information students find may be influenced by the phenomenon
filter bubbles, where a person's search history influences his or her new search
engine results (Pariser, 2011). In other ways, the vast amount of information
can be frustrating and overwhelming, especially when information found can be
contradictory, obviously biased, or out of date. Also, uncritically assuming that
"free" information is unbiased or uninfluenced by the platforms through which
the information is made available is a mistake. Some would argue that the idea
of the Internet as a public good, or information commons is an illusion. Jeff
Lilburn (2012) insists that "claims that social media has become our new public
space, or new commons, overlook the fact that, unlike a true public square or
commons, many of the most popular social media tools are privately owned
and regulated" (p. 143). Awareness of the financial interests behind creators and
purveyors of information is another component of information fluency.

    Because information dissemination is in flux, educators who teach IL are left
with some challenging questions:

      · How do we prepare our students to be information literate in an
         information-­saturated world?

      · When so much information is constantly being generated, posted,
         reposted, tweeted, retweeted, and regenerated, how do we encourage
         students to slow down and engage with the facets of IL?

      · How do we teach students to contribute to the information lifecycle in
         meaningful, accurate, ethical, information literate ways?

      · How do educators guide students to interact with their source texts,
         analyze them, synthesize them, and then communicate them in their
         own meaningful contributions to the field?

CONSUMPTION

As students consume the information contained in an infographic, ideally,
multiple IL skills are being used. In theory, the students know they have an

260
                                                                      Ethics, Distribution, and Credibility

information need, they seek it out, they evaluate the source and decide whether
the information is reliable, and then they use and attribute it for legal and ethical
reasons. However, the linearity of the process implied by the previous sentence
is rarely the reality for information searches, especially in the realm of info-
graphics. Often people encounter infographics and other information on social
networking sites, and they often don't know that they even had a need for that
particular information. For instance, someone might see an infographic about
the funding of presidential candidates pop up on Twitter--they may not have
known they needed that information, but they may be interested nonetheless.
The discovery process, because of the rapid and informal publication methods of
information, is imbued with elements of serendipity and complexity.

    Another skill is the ability to access information. Access is perhaps the sim-
plest part of the consumption of infographics. Rather than seeking and finding
information in response to a need, people are presented with a continual flow
of information. Individuals hardly have to do anything to encounter a piece of
information. Content from various media washes over consumers like waves. It's
impossible to engage with all of the conversations that are available, and teach-
ing students to pick and choose what they engage with is part of the challenge.
It's also essential to teach students when they need to go further to confirm
information that's presented via infographic. To do this, they may need to check
the sources that are cited in the infographic or track down the information in
other ways that may not be as easily accessible. For instance, an infographic may
illustrate the government's expenditure on a program. Before accepting this at
face value and acting on or using this information, it would be beneficial for the
student to confirm this in the budget or in other documentation. This fact needs
to be sought; it won't present itself in the same ways that an infographic does,
and it may not be easy to find, so there's still a need for educators to address
discovery and access.

    Infographics also present unique challenges because they have the advan-
tage of an immediate rhetorical punch. Using a combination of colors, images,
and linework, an infographic's producer can use design techniques to shape the
audience's reaction about a given topic. As a result, infographics offer audiences
the "illusion of trustworthiness" because of their visual nature and statistical
information (Toth, 2013). People ascribe more credibility to images than text
alone (Kostelnick & Roberts, 2010; Kimball & Hawkins, 2008; Tufte, 2003;
Kienzler, 1997; Schriver, 1997). Images and visuals can be seductive in that
audiences may not question the authority of the data that's conveyed or question
its merit in the same way they might with a book or journal article. Some have
even suggested that infographic producers distort data to make a stronger point
and attract attention to the display (McArdle, 2011). As such, students may be

                                                                                                 261

                   power of a visually designed piece of information.

quick to make snap and superficial decisions about the information, without
fully considering its authority.

    Non-information literate audiences may also be more likely to believe infor-
mation presented in infographics even though source material may be question-
able and/or non-existent. According to Ellen Lupton (1989), "Statistics pro-
mote the objectivity of numbers while suppressing an interest in explanation" (p.
151). For instance, if we say in this chapter that 80% of all academic librarians
are female, most information literate people would want to know the source of
the data. However, if we design that 80% statistic with female and male picto-
grams in an infographic, some people may be less likely to question the data and
focus more on how the data is visually presented. As a demonstration of this,
the statistic in Figure 12.1 is completely fabricated and cites no source informa-
tion whatsoever, but seems viable because of its visual presentation. This exam-
ple illustrates the point that designed "statistics resist the skepticism on which
empirical method is founded, and project an authoritative image of self-evident
factuality" (Lupton, 1989, p. 151).

    Another part of the challenge is teaching and encouraging students to evalu-
ate the information they encounter and gather via infographics. This evaluation
is always an essential skill, regardless of the genre or medium of access. However,
like much of the information that students encounter, there is no formal vetting

262
                                                                      Ethics, Distribution, and Credibility

process, so it's especially important to guide students to ask the essential ques-
tions behind evaluating sources of infographics.

    In some cases, the information used to create the infographic may be incor-
rect or flawed. In other cases, the source of information for the infographic may
be outdated. And while in the minority, some infographics even go as far as
blatantly misleading an audience with the type of information presented either
to advance a cause or sell a product.

    To avoid being misled, some of the questions all information consumers
need to consider are: Who are the authors? What is the purpose? Why does this
piece of information exist? How does the creator of this information support
claims? What interests might the creator be representing or promoting? Whose
financial interests are in play? Who funded this, and who has something to gain
from the distribution of this information? It's only by engaging in this scrutiny
that any consumer can really decide whether to trust a source or not, whether
the source of information in question is a book, a peer-reviewed article, a tweet,
or an infographic.

    The ethical use of information, with attention to economic, legal, and social
issues, is another competency that deserves attention. When students use infor-
mation from infographics, it's essential that they cite them as sources, even
though, because of the information's informality, it may feel free for the taking.
Citing and documenting sources, in addition to being the legal thing to do, also
reminds students that information doesn't exist independently from an indi-
vidual or organization with a set of biases and a particular point of view. Being
aware of this can strengthen the student's attention to evaluation.

PRODUCTION

Students are not just information consumers--they're writers and communi-
cators, so they're information producers as well. While simply consuming info-
graphics requires the use of many of the IL competencies, the production of
infographics raises issues of equal importance. Advances in technology and the
ease of software programs have also made infographic production much easier
for the common user. With the click of a few buttons, even a novice can generate
a simple infographic. And herein lies a problem: If virtually anyone with com-
puter access can create an infographic, there is no way to ensure the products are
reliable, accurate sources of information. What we can do, however, is educate
students in higher education settings to interact with infographics as consumers
and producers in information literate ways.

    To create an infographic, a producer needs to conduct a research process that
any information literate person should undertake. After deciding on a rhetorical

                                                                                                 263
Toth and McClure

strategy of audience, purpose, and topic, the producer needs to determine the
extent of information needed, access source material effectively and efficiently,
evaluate this source material, and appropriate newly researched material for a
specific purpose and audience of the infographic.

    When students shift from consumers to producers, they have to make a large
transition from thinking, analyzing, and using the information as consumers.
They are forced to consider more deeply the rhetorical dimensions of infograph-
ics, including the audience, contexts, and purposes of the documents they create
in the genre. For instance, as a consumer, a student might use an infographic to
decide for whom to vote in an upcoming mayoral election. But as a producer,
the student needs to make a plethora of decisions, including who the target audi-
ence is (i.e., Democratic voters, undecided voters, or Republican voters, senior
citizens, first-time voters, etc.), what information will be relevant for voters (i.e.,
city gun rights regulations, police and fire compensation packages, funding for a
new pedestrian bridge, etc.), why someone might use this information, in what
context will they use this information (i.e., in the voting booth, in informal
conversations, before a debate, etc.), and then present this information in a way
that will allow quick and easy access. As producers of infographics, students also
need to consider how to gather accurate, relevant information to inform their
audience and communicate their sources of information ethically.

    In effective infographics, each design element does rhetorical work so that
the infographic can communicate the desired message effectively. Even though
some infographics may appear as if they are for a general audience, most of them
have a specific purpose and targeted audience in mind. Students are confronted
with research challenges, inherent ethical concerns such as including source
material and minimizing data distortion, while simultaneously deliberating on
design elements of visual persuasion.

    The genre, like all forms of communication, offers the producer a lot of rhe-
torical power. The producer also has a responsibility in terms of their ethical use
of information included on the infographic. For instance, the producer should
include accurate information that is taken from credible and reliable sources.
But without knowledge of IL competencies, it would be easy for the producer
to skew information, omit citations and/or source material, or present material
from overtly biased sources.

DISTRIBUTION/REDISTRIBUTION

Technology, particularly the Internet, document design software, and social
media platforms such as Twitter, Pinterest, and Facebook, has enabled a vir-
tual explosion in the rate and amount of distribution of information. In the

264
                                                                      Ethics, Distribution, and Credibility

past, there were more gatekeepers (editors, copyeditors, publishers, etc.) in place
before the information could reach intended audiences. But now audiences can
receive information without as many filters. The dissemination is much quicker
and easier since individuals can share and publish anything they want simply by
tapping a button on the screen.

    The ease with which individuals can now disseminate information is a double-­
edged sword. Dissemination and communication technologies have allowed
many more people to express themselves and enter various conversations, argu-
ably democratizing conversations in the public sphere to an unprecedented
degree. However, because dissemination is so manageable and attainable by such
a large number of people, there's a plethora of information that may not be high
quality, and as a result, it takes more effort to filter the extraneous or irrelevant
information.

    Looking specifically at the genre of infographics, the power and resources for
almost anyone to produce an infographic presents a huge potential for problems.
If people don't have the IL skills to produce accurate infographics using reliable
(properly cited) sources, the result is a glut of inaccurate, poorly constructed,
misleading infographics that are incredibly easy to distribute. Depending on the
number of followers or friends in social media circles, the distribution of inaccu-
rate information can be far-reaching.

    But the ease of distribution also presents an even more dire compounding
issue: redistribution. Once wrong information is distributed for the first time,
viewers of that information can redistribute the infographic to others who in
turn redistribute it to more followers. Redistribution in social media networks
is unthinkably simple. People can "like" or retweet or "pin" with a single click,
making the spread of information (or misinformation) potentially very speedy.
Because infographics are designed to be stand-alone documents, they can be
emailed, tweeted, or reposted in a variety of virtual places as well. This can be a
boon to public good, because if the information could help people make good
decisions or avoid bad ones individuals can simply and quickly consume that
information and synthesize it with their existing knowledge base. However, if
the information is biased or inaccurate, this poses a problem, especially if con-
sumers of information aren't engaging in healthy evaluation practices. For exam-
ple, even news sources can be susceptible to redistributing inaccurate informa-
tion, as has been shown with celebrity deaths (Decarie, 2012). Celebrities such
as Tony Danza, Justin Bieber, Gordon Lightfoot, and Morgan Freeman have all
at one time been reported as dead when they were, in fact, still alive.

    The other potentially troubling situation is that as a result of redistribution,
information becomes separated from its original context. It can sometimes be
difficult to tell from the infographic itself who the creator is or for what purpose

                                                                                                 265

    Figure 12.2. The diagram on the left shows all parts of the infographic's lifecycle,
while the diagram on the right shows an unaccounted for critical step. While not all

it was created. The product is alienated from its producer, relieving the producer
of the responsibility (and credit) for its creation. An information literate person
can do the work to track down the original source, or try to follow the trail
of posting or reposting, but it sometimes isn't even possible, and many people
wouldn't think to take the time to do this.

    Another issue when considering redistribution is that during the act of shar-
ing, retweeting, or reposting, an individual can easily shift from the role of the
consumer of information to the distributor of information, entirely skipping
the production stage or the role as producer. (See Figure 12.2.) This jump is
problematic ethically because the distributor doesn't consider the rhetorical con-
tingencies that a producer does during the creation of content. This makes dis-
tributing and redistributing incorrect or poorly constructed information easier
and more prevalent.

    In other words, inaccurate infographics, especially catchy ones that capitalize
on emotional responses to issues, can rise to the level of pandemic. Redistribu-
tion in the worst-case scenario can be a combination of poor consumption, bad
production, and quick distribution, resulting in mass communication of bad
information.

AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COLLABORATIVE
TEACHING OF INFOGRAPHICS
With all its difficulties and challenges, the infographic genre is incredibly excit-
ing from an educator's standpoint for several reasons. Infographics are uniquely

266
                                                                      Ethics, Distribution, and Credibility

positioned in relation to the information cycle, involving people at multiple
phases of the cycle. They also offer an engaging way to highlight the rhetori-
cal complexities of communication and allow students to hone their visual and
verbal composition skills. Moreover, infographics provide a practical solution
to a challenge that educators routinely encounter by allowing for the potential
distribution of students' work beyond the walls of academia. Students are thus
empowered to compose for and reach real audiences if they choose.

    If students are allowed to become consumers, producers, distributors (and
redistributors) of information as part of an assignment to create infographics,
their consumption and production of documents in this genre provides a charged
moment of potential where critical awareness can blossom. The students we're
teaching today will be producing information in many formats and genres in the
future, and hopefully the understanding of IL they gain in relation to infograph-
ics will heighten their awareness of these issues in other genres and situations. As
literate navigators of this information landscape, their future decisions and con-
tributions to society-wide conversations will be more well-informed and of higher
quality.

    The genre is also exciting because it encompasses the information life cycle
and allows for a moment of opportunity at which writing or document design
professors and librarians can collaborate to raise student awareness and nurture
skills to both consume and produce information. While a writing or document
design professor's emphasis is on the rhetoric and design involved in the pro-
duction of an infographic, the librarian's concern is more explicitly about the
ways in which people interact with the information and the ethical implications
of that interaction. We have a shared interest in educating students at this par-
ticular moment, and while our vocabularies and viewpoints may have minor
differences, our ultimate goal coincides.

    Recognizing this, we decided, as a writing professor and a librarian at a large,
comprehensive mostly undergraduate liberal arts university, to co-teach sessions
that introduce students to the genre of infographics. An ideal place to do this is
in Visual Rhetoric and Document Design, a course taken by upper-level writing
majors or minors. One of the major units in this course focuses entirely on info-
graphics. Students begin as consumers and then, from the knowledge they gain,
move into the role of producers and potential distributors.

    Before the first day of our unit, we tell the students to begin by first viewing a
sampling of infographics and selecting some that aesthetically appeal to them or
interest them. After answering a series of questions to analyze the visual design
components of their favorite infographics as well as to determine how they are
rhetorically situated, students come to class ready to discuss particular informa-
tion objects and the genre as a whole.

                                                                                                 267
Toth and McClure

    In class, we begin by asking students to simply look for citations on their
selected infographics. After doing this, we engage them in several conversations,
selecting a few of their infographics to show the rest of the class on the overhead
projector. First, we discuss the facts, figures, images, and information that are
not cited. Doing a quick look at many infographics that come across our radars
on any given day will almost inevitably show that many infographics simply
don't cite their sources.

    Next, we discuss the rhetorical implications of creating a document with no
cited sources. What is the effect of making a claim with no source? If any given
consumer considers this issue at all, does she trust the infographic? In our expe-
rience, students notice the damage this does to the infographic's credibility. We
also discuss how in some situations it wouldn't matter, depending on the rhetori-
cal purpose of the infographic. For example, if ABC Corp. creates an infographic
to promote sales of the widgets from the previous quarter, does it really make a
difference that ABC has not cited themselves as the author of this information?
Or, if the sole purpose of an infographic is to entertain, is it important if infor-
mation is incorrect or not factual?

    After discussing uncited facts, we discuss information that is cited on the
infographics they're examining. We ask students to think about whether these are
trusted sources, and why or why not, a similar approach we use for asking students
to assess scholarly sources for a research paper. At this point, students discover that
in some cases, the sources and the citations of can be problematic. For instance,
there may be a citation that points to a URL for a general site that doesn't seem
specific to the fact that is stated (i.e., htpp://www.nytimes.com). In other cases,
there may be citations, but it is not clear to the viewer which citations are sup-
porting which information. Some other sources are from companies with financial
interests at stake, and still others are organizations with political biases.

    We also ask students to pick two "facts" that are displayed on their chosen
infographics and research their accuracy by checking the source materials cited
and/or by doing additional research. Many students find that items presented as
facts on their infographics are, in fact, not actually true or are completely mis-
represented. These moments can allow students, as consumers of information, to
begin to see the rhetorical motivations behind the infographic.

    Beyond the information, we also ask students to find the original contexts
of their favorite infographics. During this task students often find that because
the infographic has been posted and reposted so many times, the origin is com-
pletely obscured. It forces them to think and move beyond the information on
the infographic and act with the understanding of an information literate per-
son, (i.e., someone who is concerned with who created the information and who
is the intellectual owner). In other words, when students think explicitly about

268
                                                                      Ethics, Distribution, and Credibility

the origin of an infographic, it reinforces for them the notions of intellectual
property and responsibility.

    Going forward, the class is assigned to write a research proposal for creating
an infographic, and then actually produce the infographic and reflect on their
product. The purpose of the research proposal is for students to prove that they
have a good grasp of the project by outlining the purpose of their infographic,
the specific targeted audience, and the contexts in which it will function. They
also have to justify their source material choices and why they deserve a place on
their infographic.

    Following approval of their proposals, students create an infographic about
an issue of their choosing. At a minimum, their infographic must contain a
strong title, a display of quantitative information, a display of qualitative infor-
mation, and citations and documentation for all source material. Like any type
of research, students are expected to find credible sources and cite them. The
students can include any shapes, linework, color, or images to produce their final
infographic, as long as all borrowed material is accurately attributed and their
design choices fit within the larger rhetorical situation.

    Finally, after they have constructed their infographic, students write a reflec-
tive memo where they self-assess their infographic based on the rhetorical,
design, and IL issues we discussed throughout this unit. By this point, many
students understand the responsibility they have as producers of information to
create accurate and ethical infographics.

CONCLUSION

If educators empower students using IL principles, then they're empowered to
make better political, financial, and ethical decisions, and effectively help govern
our democracy as literate, critical thinking citizens. Creating assignments that
engage students in thought and conversations about these challenges and work-
ing with educator partners can help prepare students to deal with the onslaught
of information and hopefully help them do better work and contribute to soci-
ety's conversations in meaningful ways.

    Society benefits from an amazing array of information that's accessible in
ways that until recently were unimaginable. There's a tremendous amount of pos-
sibility, but there are also some challenges associated with this access. As a result,
educators need to instruct students to develop and use IL skills and understand-
ing when they encounter new information as well as new forms. Infographics,
and perhaps other emerging genres, allow educators a window to meet students
in a realm where they're comfortable. Since students routinely encounter info-
graphics, educators can use this genre as one of many tangible media with which

                                                                                                 269

to highlight IL competencies. Ideally, the lessons learned about IL from studying
infographics can be applied to other forms of information.

INFORMATION LITERACY
PREPARATION OF PRE-SERVICE
AND GRADUATE EDUCATORS

      Georgia Southern University

With the development and adoption of the Common Core State Standards
(CCSS) for K-12, there has been a shift toward challenging students to demon-
strate higher-order thinking skills. This shift includes specific goals in the area
of information literacy (IL). Recently, however, as one of the authors reviewed
student writing in her undergraduate pre-service and graduate teacher education
classes at a public suburban university, the lack of IL skills exhibited by teacher
candidates at both levels was evident. This is a major concern since these are the
teachers that will be expected to model and teach these skills to K-12 populations.

    A large part of the problem may simply be semantic, of course, but we
believe the lack of a common terminology between and among disciplines is a
critical factor in what we are teaching and how we assess learning of IL skills at
all levels and across disciplines. That is, while a review of standards across disci-
plines demonstrated some level of emphasis on IL skills, the specific terminology
used to address IL varied across disciplines, and without a shared framework
and terminology, the focus on IL in both K-12 and higher education is frag-
mented. This is evident in analysis of IL standards and review of research studies
addressing interventions in pre-service and graduate educator preparation pro-
grams. Thus, the final section of this chapter includes possible solutions to begin
improving IL skills in teacher preparation programs.

TEACHER PREPARATION AND IL

In pre-service undergraduate teacher education programs, the majority of stu-
dents are recent high school graduates. In graduate education programs, serving
both practicing teachers and career changers, there are a wide range of skills

reflecting a wide range of undergraduate preparation. Both the Master of Educa-
tion (M.Ed.) and the Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) candidates come from a
variety of different undergraduate K-12 teacher preparation programs, with the
MAT candidates excluding undergraduate teacher preparation. The common
characteristic of teacher education candidates we discuss in this chapter is a lack
of IL skills acquired in previous educational settings, as also noted by Thomas
Scott Duke and Jennifer Diane Ward (2009). The major focus of this chapter is
to consider some of the factors impacting the IL preparation and skill level of
candidates in teacher education programs and the impact (if any) of the Com-
mon Core State Standards (CCSS) on teacher education.

    The National Forum on Information Literacy (NFIL) (2015) asserts that
"The overarching goal of K-20 education is simple--to produce independent,
self-sufficient, lifelong learners who can successfully navigate the competitive
challenges of post-secondary educational and/or workplace opportunities."
Marjorie M. Warmkassel and Joseph M. McCade (1997) also emphasized the
importance of educator preparation in the area of IL skills to begin development
of these skills before students graduate from high school.

    A study by Kelly L. Heider (2009) addressed the importance of beginning
instruction in IL skills as early as elementary-school years, a premise also supported
by the CCSS (CCSSO, 2010), that begins with the following kindergarten-level
standard: "With prompting and support, ask and answer questions about key
details in a text" (ELACCKRL1 Key Ideas and Details), thereby introducing young
students to the concept of providing support for their ideas, an important foun-
dation of IL. By third grade, students are asked to build on this skill and must be
able to "Use text features and search tools (e.g., key words, sidebars, hyperlinks) to
locate information relevant to a given topic quickly and efficiently" (ELACC3RI5).
By the time students complete high school, then, the expectation is that they can

         Gather relevant information from multiple authoritative
         print and digital sources, using advanced searches effectively;
         assess the usefulness of each source in answering the research
         question; integrate information into the text selectively to
         maintain the flow of ideas, avoiding plagiarism and following
         a standard format for citation. (CCSSO, 2015)

    But how are teachers being prepared to teach these skills?

Teacher Preparation Program Standards

Warren F. Crouse and Kristine Esch Kasbohm (2004) addressed the changes
in education policy that have led to the increased importance of data-driven

272
                                                                          Information Literacy Preparation

accreditation programs. For example, the renewal of the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act reauthorized in 2002, commonly referred to as No Child
Left Behind, focused on accountability in K-12 public education. Schools were
rated based on student performance data. As Gary Olson (2010) proposed, the
focus on accountability in higher education revealed the many layers of data
that could be addressed (e.g. fiscal, disciplinary). By 2013, a bill was proposed in
Congress to hold institutions of higher education accountable for their four year
completion rate data (see HB 1928 (https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-con
gress/house-bill/1928). Although higher education and educator preparation
programs had accreditation programs in place for accreditation purposes, the
emphasis on completion rates and performance after graduation added another
layer of accountability.

    Educator preparation programs prepare for an online and onsite review
every seven years to maintain Council for Accreditation of Educator Prepa-
ration (CAEP) accreditation. As part of the accreditation process, programs
must meet CAEP standards, at least some of which recognize the importance
of IL skills in teacher preparation, for example, "The teacher understands the
demands of accessing and managing information as well as how to evaluate
issues of ethics and quality related to information and its use" (CAEP, 2015).
CAEP (2015) standards, however, focus on judging an institution's educator
preparation program rather than setting standards of performance for indi-
viduals, as evidenced by CAEP Standard 1 which addresses expectations for
the curriculum in educator preparation programs, and CAEP standards 2-5
which address the structures supporting the educator preparation programs
(field experience, candidates, program impact, program capacity). CAEP Stan-
dard 1.1 includes a link to other accreditation standards: "Candidates demon-
strate an understanding of the 10 Interstate Teachers Assessment and Support
Consortium (InTASC) standards at the appropriate progression level(s) [i]
in the following categories: the learner and learning; content; instructional
practice; and professional responsibility" (CAEP, 2015). The Interstate Teach-
ers Assessment and Support Consortium (InTASC) was formed in 1987 "to
reform the licensing, preparation and professional development of teachers"
(CCSO, 2011). The development of these Standards was sponsored by the
Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), the same organization that
was involved in the development of the CCSS. The major links to IL are
found in Standard 5, Application of Content, Essential Knowledge, "The
teacher understands the demands of accessing and managing information as
well as how to evaluate issues of ethics and quality related to information and
its use," and Standard 9, Professional Learning and Ethical Practice, Perfor-
mances, "The teacher advocates, models, and teaches safe, legal, and ethical

                                                                                                 273

use of information and technology including appropriate documentation of
sources and respect for others in the use of social media." CAEP also pro-
vides a second level of accountability: "1.3 Providers ensure that completers
apply content and pedagogical knowledge as reflected in outcome assessments
in response to standards of Specialized Professional Associations (SPA), the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS), states, or other
accrediting bodies (e.g., National Association of Schools of Music--NASM)"
(CAEP, 2015). The relationships between accrediting organizations are repre-
sented in Figure 13.1.

    The National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) includes two relevant
standards, Standards 7 and 8--"Students conduct research on issues and inter-
ests by generating ideas and questions, and by posing problems. They gather,
evaluate, and synthesize data from a variety of sources (e.g., print and non-print
texts, artifacts, people) to communicate their discoveries in ways that suit their
purpose and audience" (std7), and "Students use a variety of technological and
information resources (e.g., libraries, databases, computer networks, video) to
gather and synthesize information and to create and communicate knowledge"
(std8)--which refer to elements of IL as defined in the Framework for Informa-
tion Literacy for Higher Education (Framework for IL) (ACRL, 2015), but do not
provide a structure for how to prepare teacher candidates in IL.

    InTASC Standards (CCSSO, 2011) emphasize technology merely as a tool.
Amanda M. Fairbanks (2013) addressed technology as a critical element in
today's schools; however, her emphasis was on the importance of digital curricula
and digital tools without addressing the value of IL in selection of content and
research. The International Society for Technology and Education (ISTE), the
professional specialty association for technology specialists in schools, addresses
the use of technology as an important component of IL, but still includes the
technology-as-a-tool representation: "Model and facilitate effective use of cur-
rent and emerging digital tools to locate, analyze, evaluate, and use information
resources to support research and learning." As we will show in more detail later
in this chapter, however, the lack of a shared vocabulary can have a constraining
effect on collaboration, especially across disciplines.

INFORMATION LITERACY OF TEACHER
EDUCATION MAJORS AND GRADUATES

Marcia Stockham and Heather Collins (2012), in their report on a survey of
pre-service education majors (juniors and seniors) to self-evaluate their level of
IL skills, note that

274
                                                                Information Literacy Preparation

Figure 13.1. Accreditation structure for teacher preparation programs
 The fifth question [asked of pre-service teachers] was preceded
 by this statement: "Information Literacy Competencies for
 K-12 students (also called Information Power Standards,
                                                                                        275

         Handy 5, Big 6, etc.) include concepts such as: knowing how
         to access, evaluate and use information in order to become
         independent learners that allow them to become socially
         responsible." When asked whether the students were famil-
         iar with these concepts, only 10% indicated they were "very
         familiar." Fifty-one percent indicated they were "somewhat
         familiar" or had "heard of them," while 39% indicated this
         was the first they had heard of them. (p. 65)

    Stockham and Collins (2012) also surveyed school media specialists to elicit
their perceptions of the IL skills of new teachers in their schools. The results of
the survey of school media specialists aligned with the student self-evaluations,
indicating that students and new teachers did not have knowledge of IL skills.
School media specialists' comments illustrate common themes in other studies
as well, such as students' perception that the ability to Google demonstrates
mastery of IL skills. Project Information Literacy (Head, 2013) also reported
this result. Although Google represents an acceptable starting point for locating
information, there was no information provided on students' ability to evaluate
the sources located by a Google search.

    Marlene Asselin and Elizabeth Lee (2002) discuss the common, but incor-
rect, assumption that preservice teachers have acquired IL skills. As they report,
if this lack of IL skill development continues, teachers will not be equipped
to teach their K-12 students. To address this need, they developed a teacher-­
librarian course for pre-service teachers that included lesson plans to develop IL
skills in K-12 classrooms. Their emphasis on teacher-librarian collaboration and
specific tasks (e.g., lesson plan) was recommended for future studies.

    Deborah M. Floyd, Gloria Colvin, and Yasar Bodur (2008) reported on a
study that began when an instructor of a field experience course "designed an
assignment requiring the preservice teachers to identify real classroom prob-
lems in elementary schools and to then use professional literature to research
the problems." So-called "real-world" classroom problems such as this typically
include elements of effective practice by providing pre-service teachers with
the opportunity to analyze student learning and research solutions to problems
they will experience in their future classrooms (Coggshall, Rasmussen, Colton,
Milton & Jacques, 2012). In Floyd, Colvin, and Bodur's (2008) study, the
instructor provided a rubric to help students evaluate the appropriateness of
sources, emphasizing recency, credibility, and relevance. Results indicated that
students demonstrated mastery of addressing the real-world problems they were
presented, but struggled with academic IL skills such as the use of quality pro-
fessional references, especially peer-reviewed journals. This is similar to what

276
                                                                          Information Literacy Preparation

happens in other professional fields, with students succeeding within a specific
discourse community but not transferring the skills and knowledge to different
communities. We expect, however, that part of what may constitute a discourse
community is how it uses (and values) IL skills.

    During the following semester, collaboration with library staff included an
in-class IL session intended to support students in the ability to

         identify the major databases for use in education research
         and to be able to use them efficiently; to distinguish between
         peer-reviewed articles and other resources; to know how to
         locate articles, books, and other appropriate resources, and
         to be able to identify ways in which they could get assistance
         with their research. (Floyd, Colvin & Bodur, 2008)

    Results at the end of the semester with the librarian presentation demon-
strated an increase in peer-reviewed sources in projects. This is an example of
the potential benefits of teacher-librarian collaboration in teacher preparation.

    These studies include librarians as collaborators in development of IL skills.
Librarians, as indicated in the following section, have developed structures and
language to support development of IL skills. The terminology in other educa-
tion fields addressed in this chapter, however, is less focused on a common defi-
nition of IL. How does this lack of a common language impact preparing K-12
teachers to prepare their students in IL skills?

Speaking a Common Language

Although the multiple organizations impacting teacher education all include
some reference to IL skills, it is interesting to note that none of them use the
specific term information literacy. Jordan K. Smith (2013) reported on a qual-
itative study of secondary teachers which revealed that participants were not
familiar with the term or scope of IL. Smith suggested that since the majority of
IL studies were published in library and information studies publications, teach-
ers would not have been exposed to them. The absence of shared terminology is
also evident in the K-12 arena with the Standards for the 21st-Century Learner of
the American Association of School Librarians (AASL), the professional orga-
nization for librarians serving K-12 schools, and the fragmented skills within
the CCSS. If teachers are to be prepared to implement the CCSS related to IL,
the adoption of a common framework or shared vocabulary across disciplines is
essential for communication.

    Given the growth of available information, obsolescence of information, and
lack of screening of information credibility as we moved from an oral to a print

                                                                                                 277
Brown and Walker

and now to a digital culture, an increased emphasis on IL skills in K-12 educa-
tion is essential (Warmkessel & McCade, 1997). The CCSS reflect recognition
of this need to prepare K-12 students with skills for success after high school,
including foundational skills (e.g., reading, and especially critical reading) essen-
tial to IL, and higher-order thinking skills required for success in higher edu-
cation and careers (CCSS, 2015). The emphasis begins in kindergarten: "With
prompting and support, ask and answer questions about key details in a text"
(CCSS, 2015), and continues through high school content literacy standards:
"Integrate and evaluate multiple sources of information presented in diverse for-
mats and media (e.g., quantitative data, video, multimedia) in order to address
a question or solve a problem" (CCSSO, 2015).

    The AASL Task Force on Information Literacy Standards developed a list
of competency standards to be addressed in K-12 education in 2007 that offers

         a vision for teaching and learning to both guide and beckon
         the school library profession as education leaders. The learn-
         ing standards shape the library program and serve as a tool for
         school librarians to use to shape the learning of students in
         the school. (AASL, 2015.)

    Resources, including lesson plans and an alignment, or "crosswalk," with the
CCSS, are published on the AASL website. Although this crosswalk attempts
to address the alignment of global AASL Literacy Standards and linked CCSS
across grade levels, we believe the lack of specificity within the CCSS does not
provide an adequate picture of how IL is addressed.

    One problem with the attempt to connect AASL and CCSS Standards is the
lack of a common terminology across disciplines. For example, as illustrated in
Table 13.1, the AASL reference to an "inquiry-based process" is aligned with the
CCSS standards addressing "Research to Build and Present Knowledge."

    Although the two standards represent a shared vision of inquiry, the lack
of shared terminology can create a barrier to collaboration between school
librarians and classroom teachers. As Maggie Dugan (n.d.) notes, "Every type
of science has a robust language of its own, rife with acronyms and jargon that
make for efficient communication amongst peers within the field but can be
confusing, misleading or off-putting to people from other disciplines."

    The Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) also recognized
the need to address IL in post-secondary education. Table 13.2 highlights simi-
larities and differences between the elements of the definition of IL by the ACRL
(2000) and the CCSS for Literacy in World History Grades 11-12.

    The shared vision of IL is masked behind differences in vocabulary. Dugan
(n.d.) says that "we rely on language to convey meaning, and that if we don't

have a shared understanding, it's harder to work together and collaborate cre-
atively." In other words, although it appears on the surface that educators and
librarians at all levels believe in the importance of a focus on IL, the lack of a
shared language interferes with collaboration in providing effective IL instruc-
tion and support for students at all levels.

    A key source of confusion in reviewing standards is the definition of a stan-
dard. Teacher education accrediting standards are intended to guide the self-­
assessment of educator preparation programs using types of results described by
the Council of Writing Program Administrators (CWPA) (2014) as outcomes,
but the teacher education standards do not provide the precise level of achieve-
ment described as standards by CWPA (2014). Thus aligning standards with
different levels of precision requires subjective assumptions by the reader. With

                                                                                                 279
Brown and Walker

the recent moves by both ACRL and the CWPA to present a framework, rather
than standards, for IL, we argue that teacher education programs and accredit-
ing bodies need to review their own IL standards and consider how they may--
or may not--align.

IMPROVING IL SKILLS

While it may not need saying, we nonetheless argue that in order to teach IL
skills in K-20 settings, teachers must themselves first be information literate.
A common characteristic of many teacher education candidates appears to be
insufficient knowledge of core IL skills, according to Laura Saunders (2012)
who summarized research indicating that college students did not demonstrate
IL competency and university one-shot librarian presentations were not ade-
quate to improve their skills. The lack of effectiveness of one-shot librarian pre-
sentations was also reported by Crouse and Kasbohm (2004). Duke and Ward
(2009), however, report that, "many teacher educators still do not view academic
librarians as collaborative partners who can help them teach information literacy
skills and research strategies to pre-service and in-service teachers" (pp. 1-2). As
a result, perhaps, the one-shot approach to teaching IL skills is all too often still
in evidence.

    As Stockham and Collins (2012) so astutely assert, "Since teachers cannot
teach what they do not know, it is necessary for teacher education programs and
libraries to collaborate in meeting ACRL student learning outcomes for infor-
mation literacy" (p. 59). Targeted interventions have proven helpful in devel-
oping specific skills, but a more structured cross-curricular model is essential to
prepare future educators so they, in turn, can better instruct information literate
students. Els Kuiper, Monique Volman, and Jan Terwell (2005) suggest that

         Research on students' search skills should no longer be
         restricted to the actual search behavior of children but should
         investigate ways for students to learn search skills in an educa-
         tional situation. The research could compare the effects of var-
         ious learning environments on the acquisition of search skills.

    The NFIL (2015) suggests that "Information literacy is a learner centric
instructional template that, if applied strategically, can foster the development of
independent, self-sufficient learners. In fact, information literacy skills instruc-
tion cuts across all disciplines." (See also Feekery, Emerson, and Gillian, Chapter
17, this collection.) To effectively ensure the development of IL skills as part
of a framework, rather than as a set of fragmented skills, then, scaffolding of
instruction is necessary.

    Scaffolding provides support and structure for student learning at the point
of need (see, for example, Douglas Fisher and Nancy Frey's (2010) extensive
review and description of the instructional scaffolding approach). Smith (2013)
also emphasized scaffolding of instruction as a factor for pre-service K-12 teach-
ers and their K-12 students. A structured approach to scaffolding across the
disciplines would need to engage both teachers and librarians in mapping the
points of need at each level. For example, in college settings, students report
their first-year composition instructors and librarians are key supporters in their
development of early IL skills (Head, 2013). However, Asselin and Lee (2002)
note that assumptions about student prior acquisition of IL skills can also be a
barrier to effective IL instruction.

    Effective collaboration between a college field experience instructor and
librarian resulted in improved IL skill development of teacher education stu-
dents in a job-embedded research project (Floyd, Colvin & Bodur, 2008). Sim-
ilar results were reported in an early education study by Heider (2009), who
found that teacher-librarian collaboration supported student IL skill develop-
ment, but that a single intervention was not sufficient for continued growth.
And, in a study by Angela Feekery, Lisa Emerson, and Gillian Skyrme (Chapter
17, this collection), the collaborative model was a contributing factor for stu-
dent acquisition of IL skills. Asselin and Lee's (2002) research also provided a
model for collaboration and relevancy in teacher education programs. Duke and
Ward (2009), however, assert that

         It is not enough to simply strengthen the information literacy
         skills of preservice teachers; in order to prepare teachers to
         effectively integrate information literacy into the P-12 curric-
         ulum, teacher educators and academic librarians must model
         and teach information literacy pedagogy; teacher educators
         and academic librarians must also model and teach the collab-
         oration necessary to support such integration. (p. 251).

    Further research needs to address the impact of scaffolding IL skill instruction
across the curriculum. In the NCTE Council Chronicle, Lorna Collier (2013)
discussed the potential for the CCSS to support writing across the curriculum
efforts if writing is included in content assessment. AASL Standards provide
alignment with the K-12 CCSS and could serve as a first step, and collaboration
between teachers and librarians is essential (Crouse & Kasbohm, 2004). Align-
ment of the ACRL Framework for IL with discipline-specific programs could
also provide guidance for increased collaboration at the college level.

    However, as Feekery, Emerson, and Skyrme (Chapter 17) acknowledge,
there is a problem of ownership of IL skill development. This is also seen in

                                                                                                 281

conclusions drawn by Sharon A. Weiner (2014) after a survey of discipline fac-
ulty that addressed the importance of understanding the assumptions discipline
faculty have regarding prerequisite IL skills they assume undergraduate students
have already mastered. Librarians could work with faculty to develop methods
to assess the level of individual IL skills that students have mastered as a pre-test
to inform faculty of gaps in IL skills that would require intervention. The assess-
ment model used by Feekery, Emerson, and Skyrme is an example of providing
this kind of data for point of need interventions.

CONCLUSION

A common theme in research reviewed for this chapter is the lack of a com-
mon vocabulary. This interferes with communication and thus, potentially at
least, with effective cross-disciplinary collaboration and continues to reinforce
the development of splinter skills rather than effective IL skills. Collaboration
between librarians and teachers in K-12 and higher education settings is essen-
tial. The ACRL Framework for IL can serve as a starting point for discussion
across disciplines.

    Mark Emmons et al. (2009) reported on a project that included align-
ment of ACRL's IL Standards (2000) with structured teacher/student/librar-
ian activities and assessment across courses in an undergraduate program for
dual special education/general education preparation. Although the sample size
was too small to demonstrate statistical evidence, the qualitative data provide a
basis for future research. An interesting outcome was the increase in rigor and
expectations throughout the program. These results are in concert with Crouse
and Kasbohm (2004) when they describe the natural link between library and
teacher education goals, "to transfer to education department graduates the
commitment to take the goals, objectives, strategies, methods, and results to
their students" (p. 48).

    Common vocabulary can contribute to the collaboration across disciplines
that have been reported to support IL skill development. The cross-curricular
model requires collaboration based on ownership of student IL skill development
by all participants. The role of the teacher-librarian is essential at both the K-12
and post-secondary levels. Providing a model of collaboration for pre-­service
teachers is essential for their collaboration with librarians in their practice at the
K-12 level. Developing a program-specific plan for scaffolding IL instruction
with targeted assessment at each level could assist in providing point-of-need
instruction, or what Feekery, Emerson, and Skyrme refer to as learner-centered
pedagogy. Including a focus on real-world applications, as Floyd, Colvin, and
Bodur have shown, can also contribute to preparation of teachers who are ready

to promote higher-order thinking through problem-based learning, including
IL skills as a basis for growth in their K-12 students.

    Success in learner-centered and campus-specific research models can promote
discussion to align with the ACRL Framework for IL, as described by Barbara J.
D'Angelo and Barry Maid (Chapter 2, this collection), as a flexible model that
can address individual program context. Future research into the separate and
combined implementation of scaffolded, cross-disciplinary, teacher-­librarian
collaborative interventions based on shared ownership of student acquisition of
IL skills within a shared framework are necessary.

NOT JUST FOR CITATIONS:
ASSESSING ZOTERO WHILE
REASSESSING RESEARCH

Rachel Rains Winslow, Sarah L. Skripsky, and
Savannah L. Kelly
Westmont College

This chapter explores the benefits of Zotero for post-secondary education.
Zotero is a digital research tool that assists users in collecting and formatting
sources for bibliographies and notes. Existing research on Zotero reflects its
influence as an efficient tool for personal research (Clark & Stierman, 2009;
Croxall, 2011; Muldrow & Yoder, 2009) but has made only limited links to
its use as an instructional technology for post-secondary teaching (Kim, 2011;
Takats, 2009). Our study illustrates how the fruitful alliance of an instructional
services librarian (Savannah), an English instructor (Sarah), and a social science
instructor in sociology and history (Rachel) at Westmont College, a liberal arts
college of approximately 1,200 students, has led to innovative applications of
Zotero beyond its typical use as a citation aid. Our research-pedagogy partner-
ship shows how students gain when librarians and instructors share responsibil-
ity for information literacy (IL). Rather than using IL-savvy colleagues primarily
as one-shot trainers, faculty can invite them to partner in using reference man-
agers (RMs) to reframe "research" and to interact with students' RM-accessible
research choices.

    Using Zotero-based research instruction in four different social science
and humanities courses with 49 students total (Table 14.1), our study illus-
trates multiple benefits of Zotero-aided research for students' IL development.
Benefits include improving students' source evaluation and annotation skills;
enabling a transparent research process for peer and instructor review; offer-
ing a platform for collaboration among instructors; and creating student rela-
tionships across courses, including interdisciplinary connections that foster
attention to discourse communities. Zotero's ability to showcase students' in-­
progress research choices allows for responses ranging from peer critique to peer
emulation to instructor coaching to final evaluation. Even with such meaning-
ful pedagogical benefits, instructors can struggle to achieve student "buy-in" if

a new technique does not streamline workload. Because Zotero offers students
increased citation efficiency, however, students are more willing to use it. As
our study suggests, applying more of Zotero's features than just its citation aids
can make a substantive difference in students' research practices. Indeed, our
Zotero-aided collaboration reveals how teaching "traditional research methods"
does not accurately reflect how students locate and interact with sources in the
twenty-first century.

    Why did we choose to implement Zotero in the classroom, as compared
to other reference management systems? Though commonly used as an open-
source citation tool analogous to EasyBib, Zotero is a more extensive reference
manager (RM) that assists users in collecting, organizing, annotating, and shar-
ing sources. Zotero captures in-depth bibliographic information beyond cita-
tion needs and allows users to revisit texts in their digital environments. These
functions exceed those of EasyBib, which students use to cut and paste citations
without capturing texts' contexts. Zotero's features mimic those of costly com-
petitors Endnote, Papers, and RefWorks. The free RM Mendeley approximates
Zotero's features, but a comparative study of four RMs (Gilmour & Cobus-
Kuo, 2011) ranks Zotero higher than Mendeley in terms of fewer errors (e.g.,
capitalization) per citation--1.3 vs. 1.51 respectively (see Table 14.2). The same
study rates these two free RMs higher in overall performance than the for-profit
RefWorks (see Table 14.3). Ongoing development of Zotero and other free RMs
bears watching, given their performance quality and accessibility.

    George Mason University's Center for History and New Media launched
Zotero in 2006 as an extension of the web browser Firefox. In 2011, Zotero
developers offered a standalone version that extends its compatibility to Safari
and Google Chrome. Zotero's browser-centric design allows researchers to grab
source citations, full-text portable document files (PDFs), uniform resource
locators (URLs), digital object identifiers (DOIs), and publisher-provided
annotations while browsing (see Figure 14.1). Zotero's origin within browsers
suggests assumptions about the importance of online sources in 21st-century
research, and its user-friendly display mimics that of the familiar iTunes. Using
rhetoric not unlike Apple's, Zotero's website stresses the connection between
desired resources and everyday technology habits; its quick guide promotes
Zotero as a tool that "lives right where you do your work--in the web browser
itself " (Ray Rosenzweig Center, para. 1, n.d.). Once sources are gathered via
browsers, Zotero gives users stable source access through a data cloud--a process
that mimics not only iTunes but also Pinterest. Allowing users to tag and "relate"
sources, add Notes, form groups, share research library collections, and conduct
advanced internal searches, Zotero can be used as a works-in-progress portfolio
for student research as well as a common platform for group projects. Zotero

          Figure 14.1. A blog entry from Zotero co-director Takats (2009),

serves as a potential venue for relating multiple users, course sections, or even
fields of study. Indeed, Zotero's features demonstrate that the value of a citation
lies not just in its format, but also as an important rhetorical device "central
to the social context of persuasion" (Hyland, 1999, p. 342). As linguist Ken
Hyland has found in examining citation patterns in the humanities and social
sciences, scholars use citations not only to insert themselves into debates but also
to construct knowledge by stressing some debates over others. Thus, citations
are principally about "elaborating a context" that provides a basis for arguments
situated in particular discursive frameworks.

    In addition to shaping researchers' relationships to sources and peers, RMs
such as Zotero are influencing academic journals and databases. For instance,
the journal PS: Political Science and Politics started publishing abstracts in 2009
in response to RMs' emphasis on short article descriptions. Cambridge Uni-
versity Press has also made their journals' metadata more accessible for link-
ing references to other articles (Muldrow & Yoder, 2009). Such developments
emphasize how the research process itself is mutable; technological innovations
and social context continually reshape research practices. As discussed by Katt
Blackwell-Starnes in this collection, even Google searches can be applied and
refined as part of a scaffolded pedagogy. Using Google to bridge students' cur-
rent practices with more information-literate research attentive to source trails
resembles our use and assessment of Zotero.

                                                   Review

    Our assessment of Zotero extended to four classes in the fall semester of
2012 (Table 14.1), which fit into three pedagogical categories: Writing Across
the Curriculum (WAC), a parallel component we term Research Across the Dis-
ciplines (RAD), and Research and Writing in the Disciplines (RID/WID). Our
selection of these four courses was strategic. First, we wanted to apply Zotero in
research-intensive courses with bibliography and literature review assignments
engaging in scholarly conversations. Second, we wanted to test Zotero's online
sharing features with peer review exercises and group projects. Third, we wanted
to do a case study in interdisciplinary collaboration. Thus, we paired the English
087 and Sociology 110 courses via a key assignment in each context (Table
14.1). To assess Zotero's impact, we used a variety of methods including student
surveys, quantitative annotation data, and assignment reflections. Our assess-
ment suggests that Zotero can serve as both a general education aid for RAD/
WAC and a catalyst for sustained RID/WID pedagogical progress--giving stu-
dents the tools necessary to become web-savvy researchers and pursue long-term
interdisciplinarity through personal citation libraries.

EVOLVING CONCEPTS OF IL IN THE CLASSROOM

Conceptions of IL have evolved over the past decade, not only at Westmont, but
nationwide as academic librarians have transitioned from a library-centric to an
information-centric pedagogy. For many years, Westmont librarians perceived
IL as a twofold process: help students identify library resources (e.g., books, arti-
cles) and online websites for source-based assignments, and assist students with
citing sources. An "information literate" student at our institution was someone
who demonstrated technological competence in navigating digital content and
differentiated between MLA and APA guidelines. Librarians maintained respon-
sibility for explicating database interfaces and search engines, but spent less time,
if any, introducing sources as rhetorical artifacts and exploring how such sources
were used in academic argumentation.

    Central to this tools-focused teaching philosophy were the 2000 Informa-
tion Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (IL Standards) set forth
by the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL). The IL Standards
defined IL as an individual's capability to "recognize when information is needed
and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the needed informa-
tion." The IL Standards sought to clarify the role of IL in higher education, but
the accompanying performance indicators and outcomes were often too specific
(e.g., "Constructs a search strategy using appropriate commands for the informa-
tion retrieval system selected [e.g., Boolean operators, truncation, and proximity
for search engines; internal organizers such as indexes for books]" 2.2.d ), or
broad (e.g., "Draws conclusions based upon information gathered" 3.4.c). Dif-
ficulties resulting from the IL Standards allowed librarians to cast IL as primarily
concerned with students' searching behaviors. This well-intentioned but lim-
ited understanding of the IL Standards facilitated a reliance on tools-based (e.g.,
JSTOR, Google, EBSCO) IL instruction at our institution for over a decade.

    The alliance between students' information-seeking behavior and tools-based
instruction informed Westmont IL practices in the classroom as librarians used
technology as the primary means to identify resources and manage citations.
More complex IL processes--developing research questions and incorporating
source material--were rarely discussed during IL sessions. Although we advo-
cate using technology in this chapter, Zotero is not introduced as another tech-
nological competency for students to master, but as a portal through which
students gain an understanding of IL as rhetorically oriented and reflective of
genuine research practices.

    Academic librarians may have placed too much emphasis on IL as tools-
based instruction, but classroom faculty compound the problem when they
teach dated models of the research process and source credibility: e.g., requiring

                                                                                                 291

students to format bibliographies manually and limiting the use of web-based
sources, even if reliable. It concerns us that such teaching habits can mean devot-
ing valuable time to teaching students the minutiae of varied citation styles,
especially when few may retain or reuse that information. Such citation-based
pedagogy seems equally misguided in light of our own reliance on RMs as
researchers. Indeed, citation-based pedagogy (and related plagiarism panic) can
send a dangerous message: if you cite a source correctly, you are a good researcher.
This reductive definition of research resembles the current-traditional model of
American education that reduced "good writing" primarily to matters of style,
namely clarity and correctness (Berlin, 1987; Connors, 1997). Privileging style
over substance obscures the cognitive and social aspects of research and writing,
and it limits students' ability to engage in both as crafts.

    Whereas good writing is not simply a composite of stylistic expertise, likewise
IL is not limited to technological competencies and citation mechanics. Scholars
from varying disciplines have proffered alternatives to this conventional under-
standing of IL. Rolf Norgaard's (2003) conception of IL as "shaped by writing"
(i.e., "writing information literacy") (p. 125) served as an alternate frame of
reference for faculty and librarians who struggled to identify a more compel-
ling illustration to the IL Standards. As a rhetorician, Norgaard has argued for
a literacy in which texts are understood in their cultural contexts, research and
writing are process-oriented, and IL extends beyond source acquisition. In this
volume, Norgaard, along with librarian Caroline Sinkinson (Chapter 1, this col-
lection), extends the conversation by critically evaluating the academic reception
of his previous call to redefine IL and increase collaboration between writing
instructors and librarians. Although progress is noted, Norgaard and Sinkinson
acknowledge the continuing challenges of achieving campus-wide IL develop-
ment and argue for broader administrative support, a redefinition of librarians'
and writing teachers' roles, and an extension of IL concepts beyond the academy
and into the public sphere.

    In early 2012, Westmont library instruction program outcomes were revised
to align with Norgaard's (2003) IL perspective--writing information literacy.
The decision to embrace Norgaard in lieu of the IL Standards was welcomed by
librarians at our institution and provided an alternative model for advancing IL
on our campus. An example outcome was that "students assess the quality of
each source through a rhetorical framework (audience, purpose, genre) and eval-
uate its relevance to their research claim" (Westmont College Voskuyl Library,
2013). This conceptual shift improved IL communication between faculty and
librarians and resonated with students across disciplines.

    Whether academic communities embraced the traditional IL Standards or
alternative interpretations of IL, change was imminent: as early as June 2012, an

292
                                                                                       Not Just for Citations

ACRL Task Force recommended revising the IL Standards. A second task force,
officially charged with updating the document, followed in 2013. The result-
ing outcome was the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education
(Framework for IL) (ACRL, 2015) which was presented to the ACRL commu-
nity throughout 2014. After several iterations, the ACRL Board approved the
Framework for IL early 2015. The Framework for IL challenges traditional notions
of IL by proffering six broad frames based on "threshold concepts," which are
"ideas in any discipline that are passageways or portals to enlarged understand-
ing or ways of thinking and practicing within that discipline" (ACRL, 2015).
These frames--Scholarship as Conversation; Research as Inquiry; Information
Creation as a Process; Authority is Constructed and Contextual; Information
Has Value; and Searching as Strategic Exploration--are highly contextualized,
emphasizing students' participation in knowledge creation over knowledge con-
sumption (ACRL, 2015).

    The Framework for IL emphasizes the necessary collaboration between fac-
ulty and librarians in advancing IL in the classroom. Since we instructors pre-
viously aligned our conception of IL as contextual and rhetorically oriented,
the shift from our 2012 Norgaard-inspired outcomes to the Framework for IL
is welcomed and will continue to support our use of Zotero in the classroom.

    When we teach Zotero, we host conversations about gauging the reliabil-
ity of sources and can model those evaluative practices in real time--all while
demonstrating the ease of access that students have come to crave. We encourage
students to consider the rhetorical choices surrounding source citation without
bogging them down in details such as whether and where to include an issue
number. We emphasize source selection in relation to students' research claims
and have them classify texts according to BEAM (i.e., background, evidence,
argument, or method source) criteria (Bizup, 2008). Such source selection, how-
ever, is still challenging in an online environment where students must learn to
sift through information and extract credible evidence, e.g., separating peer-­
reviewed sources on racial profiling from the unrefereed, hastily formed opin-
ions widely available. In fact, compositionists Rebecca Moore Howard, Tricia
Serviss, and Tanya K. Rodrigue (2010) highlight significant problems in under-
graduate source evaluation. Their analysis suggests that students rarely summa-
rize cited sources and that most write from sentences within sources rather than
writing from sources more holistically read and evaluated--i.e., they often quote
or paraphrase at the sentence level without assessing a source's main claims.
Students' sentence-level engagement with sources suggests that ease of access
to quotable text may be the key criterion in their evaluative process, if such can
even be deemed evaluative. Howard et al.'s concerns were pursued on a larger
scale in the cross-institutional Citation Project study of U.S. college students'

                                                                                                 293

source-based writing habits. Drawing on Citation Project data, Sandra Jamie-
son, in this collection, claims that most students engage sources shallowly even
when they have selected suitable sources.

    When taught in combination with suitable writing assignments such as scaf-
folded research projects (Bean, 2011), Zotero can nurture students' rhetorical sen-
sitivity about the nature of sources, conversations among sources, and opportu-
nities for source integration in writing. In a study of engineering research papers,
Kobra Mansourizadeh and Ummul K. Ahmad (2011) discovered that differences
in how expert and novice writers employed citations signaled a need for targeted
pedagogies. Without the experts' "breadth of cumulative knowledge," novices
require explicit instruction on the different purposes and "rhetorical functions of
citations" (pp. 152-161). For novices to advance, they must identify a context
for their "interpretive knowledge" and make the epistemological leap from writ-
ing for themselves to writing for others in a discourse community. Gerald Graff
and Cathy Birkenstein's popular textbook They Say, I Say (2009) helps novices
make this leap beyond self; yet even with effective instruction, this transition is
difficult. As argued by John C. Bean (2011), both conceptual and procedural
difficulties with research can lead to a vicious cycle of misperception and dread
for students and instructors alike (pp. 227-229). Zotero supports novices' devel-
opment both conceptually and procedurally. It gives them a central platform for
building their own "cumulative knowledge." Further, in redirecting time from
formatting source citations to source selection, purpose, and rhetorical integra-
tion, Zotero refocuses novices' energies from style to substance.

PERSONALIZED CITATION LIBRARIES AND
INTERDISCIPLINARITY IN RESEARCH INSTRUCTION

By helping students retrieve and organize sources in individual or group libraries,
Zotero sustains source accessibility and productive research habits across typical
course structures. A study of undergraduates who used Zotero in a Chemical
Literature course revealed that students embraced the creation of "personalized
citation libraries" that strengthened their understanding of scientific literature
(Kim, 2011). These libraries function as e-portfolios of research that benefit
students in terms of source capture, organization, and evaluation as well as allow
others to assess their choices. For example, in Savannah's RAD course (IS 001),
asking first-year students to develop Zotero libraries facilitated research orga-
nization, opportunities to name and develop their academic interests, a stable
record of scholarship, and pursuit of topical inquiries across courses. In terms of
support, requiring first-year students to set up Zotero libraries typically means
that instructors or other partners must address first-time user challenges--e.g.,

294
                                                                                       Not Just for Citations

browser compatibility, user errors, and Zotero library syncing. Planning to sup-
port "learning curve" pitfalls increases the likelihood that first-year students will
use and benefit from Zotero throughout college.

    Over time, as a mechanism for personalized citation libraries with space for
shared folders, Zotero orients undergraduates toward interdisciplinary innova-
tion. Students can relate back to archived sources when starting new projects.
For instance, one student in our study kept a record of books that she did not
use for her sociology paper because she thought they could be useful for a reli-
gious studies project. As instructors, we emphasize the value of saving tags and
notes for future projects that explore similar themes. Since Zotero's Notes are
keyword searchable, we point out that students can use them to develop research
across semesters. Once students chose topics such as immigration or foster care,
we encouraged them to pursue those lines of inquiry not only in journalism but
also in future social science courses.

    For our paired ENG 087 and SOC 110 courses, Zotero file sharing enabled
interdisciplinary peer review as well as students' self-reflection on projects' var-
ied aims and need for evidence. The dual-course group library, Social Problems
Research Topics, was accessed by 24 users--two course instructors (Sarah and
Rachel), a supporting instructor (Savannah), 13 journalism students, and eight
sociology students. As library co-administrators, we established group folders
for umbrella research topics: adoption, foster care, hate movements, immigra-
tion, and incarceration. We then "salted" the folders with a few sources: first, to
model Zotero file sharing for students and, second, to generate topical teaching
conversations. Without a particular requirement for the number of sources to
gather, the 24 users contributed a total of 112 sources to the group library, i.e.,
an average of 4.7 sources per user.

    We also assisted students in developing subfolders with relevant subtopics
for focusing their projects (Figure 14.2). After sociology students noticed that
the journalism students were mainly posting popular media articles, Rachel dis-
cussed with students why a media account would not provide enough evidence
for a policy paper. Though not all shared sources were suitable for all projects,
Rachel told the sociology students that perusing relevant media could be useful,
especially in reframing their research questions and linking policy narratives to
current events. In a project on cyberbullying, a student drew on Zotero library
sources related to social media to complicate her initial research questions. In
turn, journalism students benefitted from reviewing academic journal arti-
cles posted by sociology students whose familiarity with social problems was
grounded in months of instruction in those content areas.

    Despite the benefits of such interdisciplinary collaboration, we observed
several limitations. When reviewing the shared Zotero library, we noticed

                                                                                                 295

that fewer journalism than sociology students were participating. In part,
this imbalance is consistent with the varied development of those in an intro-
ductory versus an upper-level course. In retrospect, however, the journalism
assignment (writing a feature story related to social problems) was not a natural
fit for Zotero use. Since one of Zotero's virtues is quick capture of secondary
sources from databases, its limitations in collecting primary sources (e.g., the
interviews conducted by journalism students and statistical data on govern-
ment websites) likely contributed to journalism students' limited Zotero use.
These source-capture constraints suggest that Zotero, especially when used in
groups, is better suited for assignments such as literature reviews for which
secondary sources are essential. A revised version of the ENG 087 feature story
assignment asks students to prepare for interviews by creating annotated bib-
liographies of relevant secondary literature. Such scaffolding prompts source
use more suitable for Zotero and writing of more astute interview questions.
This revision promotes a dialogic model of research and enhances WID devel-
opment for journalists.
    Notably, students initiated interdisciplinary connections we did not
require. Of the 23 students introduced to Zotero in the two sociology classes,
13 (or 56.5%) used the program in other classes that semester without any

296
                                                                                       Not Just for Citations

such coaching, and 20 students (or 86.9%) said they planned to use Zotero
in future classes. Many students organized their personal folders by topic,
rather than class, suggesting that they could envision those topics crossing
disciplinary boundaries. Such activity is encouraging in a liberal arts context.
A junior reported that he had created Zotero folders for anticipated projects
on sexuality, family formation, and civil liberties. Equipping students for sus-
tained topical inquiry prepares them for a range of future endeavors, including
graduate school research and contributing to conversations within and beyond
the academy.

WATCHING RESEARCH UNFOLD: TRANSPARENCY
IN ZOTERO-AIDED PEDAGOGY

Zotero group libraries make research trails visible to faculty instructors, part-
ner librarians, and students' peers, thus, enabling a review process in multi-
ple moments and models of instruction. Although some process-oriented fac-
ulty may require the creation of research logs or writers' memos to accompany
source-based assignments, few use RMs such as Zotero for research evalua-
tion. In contrast to a traditional log or memo, limited to student self-report,
Zotero group libraries publicize students' research choices and afford access to
the sources as well. Research choices may be reviewed in an instructor's office
hours when a student feels stalled; together, they can troubleshoot those choices
without relying solely on the student's memory of what has already been tried.
Rather, by double-clicking on sources stored in Zotero, they can retrace existing
research trails and also pursue new ones (e.g., by using peer choices as samples
or by modeling strategies left untried). In effect, Zotero libraries offer an archive
of student research choices that, with instructor interaction, fosters IL develop-
ment. Instructor-librarian teaching partners can share access to Zotero libraries
as they mentor students in IL concepts and choices. Shared IL instruction can
benefit teaching faculty, instructional librarians, and students alike, and Zotero
helps facilitate these opportunities by offering efficient resource management
and communication tools. Zotero's file sharing does not eliminate the need for
capable research instruction. Rather, its ability to survey student researchers in
motion (as demonstrated in Figures 14.3, 14.4, and 14.5) can redefine the IL
roles of librarians and instructors, from one-shot source locators and citation
doctors to research observers and coaches. This redefinition reflects our pro-
cess orientation in IL instruction and supports the approach envisioned by the
Framework for IL.

    Through Zotero, students collect enough information to revisit where
a source was accessed, and instructors can use this research-trail feature to

                                                                                                 297
Winslow, Skripsky, and Kelly

introduce the idea of discourse communities. We can then reassess Zotero-gath-
ered sources as "conversation pieces" among authors rather than static docu-
ments. We encourage this rhetorical perspective on sources by teaching Zotero's
tags and "related" features, which prompt students to trace relationships among
sources. For students to develop as researchers, they must tailor source selection
to their rhetorical purposes. We asked students to use Zotero's Notes feature to
explore these source relations and applications via annotation writing.

    Annotating sources via Zotero's Notes feature may be formal and stan-
dardized (responding to instructor-provided heuristics) or more informal and
organic (arising from students' inclinations). Two teaching procedures illustrate
the value of instructor-guided evaluation and annotation; a later analysis of
a RAD student's extra annotations (Figure 14.6, Student I) will show a more
organic response with a split evaluation strategy. After explaining concepts like
"peer-reviewed" and "refereed" in reference to source credibility, Rachel gave
sociology students 30 minutes to collect sources in Zotero under her supervision
and to begin the work of annotation. For annotation, she introduced a writing
template from They Say, I Say (Graff & Birkenstein, 2009) in which a writer
summarizes what relevant sources argue (i.e., what "they say") and then adds his
or her voice to the conversation (i.e., what "I say" in response). Once students
each completed a Zotero Note, they tagged it with relevant keywords linking it
to related sources. Thus, Rachel introduced students to Zotero-aided annotation
with a They Say, I Say protocol suited to literature review writing.

    With a related teaching model, Savannah required that each RAD student
upload ten sources to a Zotero folder for an annotated bibliography project. Stu-
dents were asked to classify and annotate according to Bizup's (2008) BEAM cri-
teria, which evaluates how a source functions in the context of an argument; i.e.,
a source may supply background (B) information, provide evidence (E) accept-
able to a particular discipline, propose a nuanced argument (A), or advance the-
oretical or methodological considerations (M). BEAM-based annotations not
only encouraged students to relate sources to research questions, but also allowed
for comparisons across sources, but within Zotero folders. In both annotation
exercises, deliberative processes stress that "research" means participating in an
ongoing conversation. Via its Notes feature (shown in Figures 14.3, 14.4, and
14.5), Zotero offers a consistent platform not only for organizing sources but
also for assessing them with imbedded annotation. When synced consistently
with the Zotero.org website via a group folder, such Notes are accessible both to
the individual researcher and to peers to use as a model.

    Our content analysis of the RAD students' Zotero-based annotations
reflects their varied quality; yet overall, these students demonstrate attention to
source summary and rhetorical contexts. While the weakest annotations simply

reproduce source quotations (reflecting Howard et. al.'s 2010 analysis of stu-
dents' habitual, sentence-level source use), satisfactory annotations include accu-
rate summaries of sources' claims. More advanced annotations not only provide
summaries but also attend to BEAM criteria or appropriateness for a student's
argument. Exceptional annotations offer summaries as well as references to both
the BEAM criteria and the student's argument. Such annotation writing redi-
rects citation anxieties and helps students to resist "writing from sentences" hab-
its. Students are then able to invest in summary writing and rhetorically sensitive
evaluation related to their writing goals.

    Quantitative data related to the 14 RAD students' source gathering and anno-
tation writing (Figure 14.6) show promising effects for Zotero-aided research.
Nearly 86% of RAD students used Zotero to complete their required annota-
tions, while two students asked permission to write annotations in Microsoft

                                                                                                 299

Word. (This request reflected technological literacy difficulties in adopting
Zotero.) Over two-thirds of students (71.4%) met the requirement of annotat-
ing at least 10 sources. Only two students failed to annotate at least five sources.
One-third of students exceeded requirements, either gathering or annotating
more than ten sources.

    Atypical results merit consideration. The five RAD students who exceeded
requirements in source gathering, annotation writing, or both were using Zotero.
This correlation suggests that Zotero's ease of source capture and note writing is
related to a productive research process. In addition, Student I added a total of
17 annotations to only 11 gathered sources. In dividing Notes by type--either
as "background," "evidence," and/or "argument" or, alternately, as "QUOTES"
(i.e., direct quotations)--this user independently distinguishes between holistic
source evaluation and source excerpts useful for quotation or paraphrase. Stu-
dent I's divided Notes method could be taught to others to reinforce this useful
distinction. Overall, the RAD class data links Zotero use to more sustained,
holistic, and evaluative research behaviors than those typical of undergraduates,

                                                                                       Not Just for Citations

as characterized by Howard et al. (2010) and Jamieson (Chapter 6, this col-
lection). The results summarized in Figure 14.6 suggest that Zotero facilitates
students' research processes so that they gather more sources, annotate more
sources, and craft higher quality annotations.

    After students gather and annotate sources, how can peers review their
choices profitably? In all four courses we taught for this assessment, our review
activities were facilitated via Zotero group libraries' shared folders, which
allow students to view the research choices, tags, and source notes of their
peers. When a student performed any of these actions within a group library,
that action became public to course participants. While emphasizing the need
for rigorous source evaluation, we used Zotero-aided peer review to promote
a culture of mutual encouragement and accountability. In Savannah's RAD
course, paired students exchanged feedback on source selection and shared anno-
tation techniques. Additionally, students described how each source would
support a research argument. Although these exercises were informal, students
provided suggestions and affirmations about the relationships between sources
and peer-research goals--reinforcing the contexts of research choices. Sarah
offered a variation on Zotero-aided peer review in an introductory composi-
tion course in spring 2013. She provided a research review handout for each
student to complete first as a researcher (noting research choices and con-
texts), then exchange with a partner, and next complete as an evaluator of
the partner's research choices (offering at least one suggestion). During this
session, reviewers had access to shared Zotero folders in order to evaluate the
peers' chosen sources, not just their annotations' account of the sources (a lim-
itation common in annotated bibliography reviewing). Once handouts were
returned, partners discussed research choices and exited class with action plans
for improved research. Such Zotero-aided peer review activities prompt stu-
dent researchers to identify relevant contexts, to evaluate others' choices, and
even to mentor their peers.

    Though we did not directly assess students' research motivations, our results
suggest that motivation may increase with Zotero-aided collaboration and peer
review. Students learn to identify quality sources while considering what would
be accepted by peers and instructors. As Betsy Palmer and Claire Howell Major
(2008) contend, peer review can increase motivation, research development, and
writing quality. In Sarah's journalism class, a student who failed to complete
most course assignments earned an "A" on the only assignment for which stu-
dents shared sources with Zotero. This student's atypical performance implies a
potential relationship between Zotero-based collaboration and student motiva-
tion. Further study of this relationship bears consideration.

                                                                                                 301

IMPLICATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS

As our pilot study reflects, maximizing Zotero's use in IL instruction requires
strategic assignments, interdisciplinary collaboration, rigorous peer review,
and strong partnerships between instructors and librarians. In our experience,
Zotero-aided instruction works best in RID/RAD contexts in which students
see immediate benefits for literature review annotations and source evaluation.
Course and assignment suitability enhances initial buy-in to using Zotero. While
it can certainly work in WAC/WID classes, Zotero pairs best with assignments
that rely on secondary sources, as Sarah's mixed experience with the ENG 087
feature assignment revealed.

    Students' class standings and disciplinary identities also matter when con-
sidering placement of Zotero-aided instruction. Indeed, sophomore- or junior-
level students, most of whom had declared a major, could more readily identify
the program's potential for capstone projects and appreciate its usefulness. While
seniors grasped Zotero's benefits more quickly, they also saw fewer opportuni-
ties to use it as undergraduates. When instructing seniors with Zotero, faculty
should seek ways to help students invest, e.g., coaching them about graduate
school uses for their personal citation libraries. With first-year students, such
as those in Savannah's RAD class, the instructor may need to work harder to
achieve buy-in: undergraduates with little disciplinary experience may lack
vision for Zotero's value.

    RMs such as Zotero offer faculty and librarians a platform for productive,
interdisciplinary collaboration. Partnering as teachers has shaped our assign-
ments and the types of sources we read and teach. Our study illustrates not only
our fruitful alliance but also how students win when librarians and instructors
share responsibility for IL. Rather than using IL-savvy colleagues primarily as
one-shot trainers, faculty can invite them to partner in using RMs to reframe
research and to interact with students' RM-accessible research choices. When
instructors teach alongside librarians in the classroom, IL is reinforced as par-
ticipatory and highly contextualized. Admittedly, our small liberal arts college
(SLAC) context has been hospitable to such collaboration. As noted by Jill M.
Gladstein and Dara Rossman Regaignon (2012), SLAC writing programs tend
to be flexible and dynamic. Our local partnerships are indeed flexible enough for
innovation; suitable for the liberal arts' interdisciplinary, writing-rich curricu-
lum; and conducive to program development with buy-in from few stakeholders.

    Still, our assessment of Zotero-assisted IL instruction indicates that such
work can enrich multiple curricular contexts. Zotero can help teaching part-
ners link course sections and even academic disciplines. We suggest that it be
tested further in varied program initiatives such as first-year seminars, clustered

courses, learning communities, and research-intensive capstones. Regardless of
context, students benefit from our IL partnerships when we make their research
processes more central to instruction and connect students with experts to coach
them into scholarly conversations. Yet instructors may profit most of all. Shared
IL responsibility relieves faculty from carrying the full load of research instruc-
tion and reorients such instruction significantly. As we engage students in the
rigors of the new Framework for IL, Zotero-based collaboration offers sustained
access to IL partners and refocuses instruction on substance over style and pro-
cess over tools.

QUANTITATIVE REASONING
AND INFORMATION
LITERACY IN ECONOMICS

      Diego Méndez-Carbajo
      Illinois Wesleyan University

INTRODUCTION

The Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Framework for
Information Literacy for Higher Education (Framework for IL) (2015) defines
information literacy (IL) as a "spectrum of abilities, practices, and habits of
mind." Articulating IL as a framework--as opposed to a set of standards or
learning outcomes--ACRL articulates six different frames. Each frame identi-
fies a threshold concept central to IL and includes learner-based recommended
knowledge practices ("demonstrations of understanding") and aspirational dis-
positions (e.g., attitudes and values). As ACRL emphasizes "flexible options for
implementation" of the Framework for IL, it effectively outlines an open-ended
learning process while providing abundant reference checkpoints.

    My 17 years of teaching undergraduate economics has led me to interpret
and articulate ACRL's Framework for IL along pedagogical lines that closely over-
lap several of the literacy categories created by Jeremy J. Shapiro and Shelley K.
Hughes (1996) as well as the streamlined IL process outlined by Tom W. Goad
(2002). In addition, the central role that statistical data plays in the discipline
of economics makes the concept of quantitative literacy, or numeracy, very rele-
vant for our students. The National Numeracy Network (NNN) (2015) defines
quantitative literacy as the "comfort, competency, and `habit of mind' in work-
ing with numerical data," and the skill of IL is a critical means to achieve this
kind of numeracy in economics.

    Three frames in the Framework for IL are central to the education of eco-
nomics majors: Searching Is Strategic emphasizes research as a process; Informa-
tion Has Value underlines the social and historical context of information; and
Research as Inquiry highlights the management and synthesis of information.
ACRL (2009) references the work of Shapiro and Hughes (1996) in order to

communicate the "substance and breadth of information literacy" to faculty and
administrators, and I find it useful to borrow their language in order to relate the
Framework for IL to the undergraduate instruction of economics. Shapiro and
Hughes list a series of desirable characteristics in an IL curriculum, namely: tool
literacy, resource literacy, social-structural literacy, research literacy, publishing
literacy, emerging technology literacy, and critical literacy.

    Given that the ACRL Instruction Section Information Literacy in the Disci-
plines Committee (ACRL IS) (2012) reports that it "is not aware of information
literacy standards in this area," I propose adopting the dimensions of literacy put
forward by Shapiro and Hughes (1996). Desirable as they all are in an "enlight-
ened" liberal arts curriculum, three are particularly relevant in the context of
the social sciences curriculum in general and of that of economics in particu-
lar. Describing resource literacy as "the ability to understand the form, format,
location and access methods of information resources," these authors speak to
the use of both text/qualitative information and data/quantitative information
that students and researchers must employ in their work. Closely related to this
dimension of literacy is that of social-structural literacy, described as "knowing
that and how information is socially situated and produced." The difference
between for-pay (i.e., proprietary) and public-access information, for example,
becomes critical when attempting to operationalize a research project in eco-
nomics. Finally, research literacy, described as "the ability to understand and
use the Information Technology (IT)-based tools relevant to the work of today's
researcher and scholar" specifically references "computer software for quantita-
tive analysis." At the undergraduate educational level this quantitative analysis is
frequently performed through the use of spreadsheets.

    These particular dimensions of literacy underpin the "information literacy
strategy" outlined by Goad (2002, p. 36) through a series of sequential tasks.
These are: (i) formulating a question, (ii) pinpointing what you really want to
know, (iii) organizing information, (iv) planning a search for relevant informa-
tion, and (v) evaluating the appropriateness of materials. As the work of Goad
(2002) fully articulates the connection between IL and workplace performance,
I will argue that the multi-step information search and analysis process that he
describes closely overlaps several of the desirable learning goals of the econom-
ics curriculum. Encapsulated in the phrase coined by John J. Siegfried et al.
(1991) "thinking like an economist," these goals include "acquiring and using
knowledge that cuts across disciplinary boundaries" and include--among oth-
ers--the threshold concepts of "knowing something about the measurement
of economic variables (methods of data collection, reliability, etc.)" and "being
able to organize, work with, and manipulate data for purposes of comparison"
(Siegfried et al., 1991, p. 216). Moreover, "the use of analytical methods to

306
                                                            Quantitative Reasoning and IL in Economics

utilize information" is identified by Dale Cyphert and Stanley P. Lyle (Chap-
ter 3, this collection) as one of the skill gaps of greatest concern to employers.
For an in-depth discussion of the expected proficiencies of the economics aca-
demic major I direct the reader to the seminal work of W. Lee Hansen (1986).
His influence in shaping the contemporary effort to "educate economists" is
explicitly stated in the collected works edited by David Colander and KimMarie
McGoldrick (2009). In sum, the instructional challenge lies in designing course
assignments that help students develop the aforementioned intellectual profi-
ciencies, relating numeracy to information literacy.

    The pedagogical approach that I propose is based on the educational tax-
onomy originally proposed by Benjamin Bloom (1956) and it employs case
method teaching in an intermediate macroeconomic theory course. The work
of Lorin W. Anderson and Lauren A. Sosniak (1994) provides a helpful 40-year
retrospective on the impact of Bloom's taxonomy on a wide-range of pedagogical
issues and practices. Along those lines, I will posit that the use of quantitative
case studies as a pedagogical resource in intermediate macroeconomics helps
students analyze and evaluate theoretical constructs in economics. Specifically,
the collection, manipulation and analysis of data compiled by different statisti-
cal agencies illustrate for students the connection between the theoretical and
empirical dimensions of this particular social science. I believe that the process
of building such a connection relies heavily on the parallel development of a
basic set of IL skills.

    From the course instructor's perspective, the overall goal of the proposed
pedagogical strategy is to move students from Bloom's (1956) lower-order cog-
nitive processes of knowledge, comprehension and application of intermediate
macroeconomic abstract formal thinking to the higher-order cognitive processes
of analysis, synthesis and evaluation of this mode of thinking. In the discipline
of economics, as in almost all social sciences, the analysis and evaluation of
theoretical constructs are based upon the statistical manipulation of data. In
economics, these data are generally quantitative (rather than qualitative) and,
depending on the topic of study, may have been generated by the researcher
(e.g., surveys) or collected from public agencies such as statistical agencies. In the
sub-field of macroeconomics all the data are generated and collected by public
agencies.

    In order to bridge the cognitive gap between the discussion of theoretical
concepts and the manipulation and evaluation of these concepts I propose
to borrow from the case method teaching pedagogy. As described by Mel-
vin Copeland (1954), it was originally created in a business and management
learning environment whereas, nowadays, Geoff Easton (1983) and James A.
Erskin, Michiel R. Leenders, and Louise A. Mauffette-Leenders (1998) show

                                                                                                 307
Méndez-Carbajo

the case method spread to many other disciplines. In essence, cases are con-
text-rich real world stories that students, usually working in groups, analyze
in order to answer a question or solve a problem. These cases provide students
with quantitative information but unlike problem sets or examples they do not
have a unique "correct" answer. The case method teaching pedagogy has three
main components: the case itself, the students' preparation for the case, and
the discussion that takes place in the classroom. It is the collaborative nature,
both outside and inside of the classroom, of this evidence-based exercise that
improves the grasp of theoretical concepts and their application to real-world
situations. Katt Blackwell-Starnes (Chapter 7, this collection), provides a dis-
cussion of course assignment design in relation to IL. Blackwell-Starnes' study
of IL skills applied to undergraduate research leads her to endorse assignment
design. In the course activity that I describe in the following sections, students
apply a series of economic concepts to sketch the actual macroeconomic pro-
file of a country.

    Although many teaching faculty members will argue that there is "no room
in the syllabus" for the inclusion of explicit IL goals in a standard course
in intermediate macroeconomic theory I envision--as discussed above--the
proposed pedagogical strategy to be closely aligned with several frames in the
Framework for IL. Later on in their academic and professional careers, when
students develop independent research projects showcasing their "thinking
like an economist" skills, they are likely to be savvier gatherers and users of
information.

    The work of Pam McKinney (2013) summarizing the lessons learned from
a multi-year, multi-disciplinary curriculum development effort gives credence
to the usefulness of "inquiry-based" learning to the development of IL skills.
For a complete discussion of how to teach IL for inquiry-based learning I direct
the reader to Mark Hepworth and Geoff Walton (2009). By presenting stu-
dents with a series of questions to answer and argue, the quantitative case study
method that I propose exposes students to what McKinney describes as "collab-
orative inquiry." The kind of longitudinal data that she analyzes offers evidence
of how inquiry-based learning increases student appreciation of IL competen-
cies. Unfortunately, I currently lack her ability to track student skills as they
move through our curriculum.

    In what follows, I will outline the challenge that motivates my particular ped-
agogical approach, assess its impact on exam performance, and relate its imple-
mentation to the development of numeracy, resource literacy, social-­structural
literacy, and research literacy among students of Intermediate Macroeconomics.

leyan University on December 3rd, 2012.

THE PROBLEM

In the course sequence for a minor or a major in economics, students at my
institution start with an Introduction to Economics (ECON 100) course. Fre-
quently, the content of this course is split into two separate courses, Introduc-
tion to Microeconomics and Introduction to Macroeconomics, which exposes
students to a wide spectrum of microeconomic and macroeconomic concepts.
Whether in a single course or in a two-course sequence the purpose of this
introduction is widely acknowledged to be the initiation of students into what is
commonly referred to as "economic thinking": an analytical comparison of costs
and benefits of different choices regarding the allocation of scarce resources.
This course is mostly devoid of mathematics and only makes superficial use of
abstract thinking through algebra. Graphical analysis is limited to supply and
demand diagrams and to the plotting of time series data in order to illustrate
either trends or relative values.

    After completing the introductory course, a student at my institution interested
in economics as a major field of study is required to complete two courses covering
intermediate-level economic theory: Intermediate Microeconomics (ECON 201)
and Intermediate Macroeconomics (ECON 202). As outlined by David Colander
and KimMarie McGoldrick (2009), in these units of the standard disciplinary cur-
riculum the focus turns to the theories and identities underpinning the basic con-
cepts discussed in the introductory course (p. 29-30). Two examples would serve
to illustrate this point. The introductory discussion of economic growth is now
enriched through the articulation of the Solow growth model where Robert Solow
(1956) provides a theoretical model of economic growth that has become the basic
framework for research since. Also, the interplay between nominal and real vari-
ables is now presented through the stylized fact of the Phillips Curve where Wil-
liam A. Phillips (1958) argues that there is a secular negative relationship between
the inflation rate (a nominal variable) and the unemployment rate (a real variable).
His work was subsequently replicated by Milton Friedman (1968) and Edmund
Phelps (1970) and sparked a fierce intellectual debate in the discipline. (For a sum-
mary of both economic concepts, please see the Palgrave Dictionary of Economics
online.) In order to develop these theoretical concepts an Intermediate Macro-
economics course makes frequent use of algebra--for purposes of manipulating
concepts in symbolic form--and may even employ calculus to derive the different
equations that compose the Solow growth model. Graphical analysis is also more
complex, employing diagrams with multiple lines and curves intersecting at dif-
ferent points, as well as plotting time series data in order to illustrate cycles. For a
discussion of statistical data visualization pedagogy I direct the reader to my article
on data visualization and the FRED database (Méndez-Carbajo, 2015).

                                                                                                 309
Méndez-Carbajo

    My experience has been that students tend to struggle when confronted with
the sequential tasks of learning the economic theories and concepts, applying
these theories and concepts to specific problems, and using evidence to discuss
the limitations of the theories and the applicability of the concepts. The work
of Ann D. Velenchik (1995) discusses these issues in detail. The aforementioned
learning tasks are more demanding of our students than those they were faced
with in ECON 100, not only because they employ more formal mathematical
analysis but also because their application is more fluid and less clear-cut. For
example, the discussion of historical shifts of the Phillips Curve requires refer-
encing a historical context usually external to the course content and potentially
controversial in and of itself. In addition, students are faced with the need to
develop a new vocabulary, that of quantitative information. Continuing with
the example of the Phillips Curve, students learn about how U.S. inflation
increased three-fold in the 1970s and are expected to compare that figure with
a doubling of the unemployment rate during the same period. In other words,
students need to learn to evaluate issues of magnitude and proportion.

    Finally, there is, the challenge of "thinking in macroeconomic terms"--as
opposed to "thinking in microeconomic terms." In an introductory course we
as instructors undertake considerable efforts to make the course material rele-
vant and engaging through the use of examples and illustrations close to the
students' "micro" reality, for example, discussing opportunity cost in terms of
hours of sleep versus hours of study. Because students are familiar with these
kinds of information they tend to find "thinking in microeconomic terms"
rather easy and, to an extent, intuitive. At the same time, I would argue there
is a large information deficit when it comes to the "macro" reality that the stu-
dents live in. In my experience, beginning-of-the-semester student surveys on
current inflation or GDP growth rates reveal great gaps in students' familiarity
with macroeconomic information. I would argue that this degree of information
ignorance makes the task of "thinking in macroeconomic terms" more difficult.
In the detailed introduction to their book, Colander and McGoldrick (2009)
discuss the traditional lack of "context" in the teaching of intermediate macro-
economic theory. Describing this information deficit as pervasive they argue for
improved pedagogical practices that "enhance the use of context and applica-
tion" (Colander & McGoldrick, 2009, p. 33)

THE ACTIVITY

The ECON 202 course where I implemented this pedagogical innovation is
organized around four units of content: (1) Introduction (4 class periods), (2)
Long-Run Economic Performance (6 class periods), (3) Business Cycles and

310
                                                            Quantitative Reasoning and IL in Economics

Macroeconomic Policy (8 class periods), and (4) Macroeconomic Policy (6 class
periods). There are bi-weekly online quizzes and two in-class partial exams, week
6 and week 12, as well as a comprehensive final exam, week 16. As a voluntary
activity for extra credit, during the last week of classes students can deliver a
group presentation on the macroeconomic conditions of the country that they
are assigned to at the beginning of the semester.

    During the first class period of the semester the students meet the academic
librarian who serves as the liaison with the Economics Department for a research
instruction session at the library's computer lab. There, the students are intro-
duced to the database that they will use to gather the data for the quantitative
case studies and are assigned to one of four different work groups. The academic
librarian focuses on the area of resource IL, discussing with the students the
means of access, the forms, and the formats of quantitative information relevant
to this course. At this point, the Framework for IL's "Searching Is Strategic" frame
is most prominently highlighted. This research instruction session also serves to
introduce the academic librarian to the students in order to encourage them to
seek her/his assistance with database needs throughout the semester. See also
Alison S. Gregory and Betty L. McCall's (Chapter 18, this collection) discussion
of a teaching faculty/librarian collaborative approach to teaching IL skills in the
context of a sociology capstone course.

    The library subscribes to the International Financial Statistics (IFS) online
database maintained by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and I have
found this resource very convenient for the purposes of my course. In order
to keep the data analysis and the size of the work groups manageable each
semester I identify four or five different countries for the students to study. I
purposely select countries at varied stages of economic development in order
to highlight socio-structural differences in economic performance. During the
research instruction session at the library all students work on gathering data
on the GDP components for the U.S., also becoming familiar with the online
teaching platform Moodle, locating the discussion questions for the quantitative
case studies, and importing their data into Microsoft Excel for purposes of anal-
ysis. This first quantitative case study, and all that follow, is structured around
a one-page handout that I distribute in class. Table 1 in Appendix A contains a
list of the topics of study, the variables that students extract from the database,
the manipulations that students must perform on the series, and the discussion
questions that they need to answer based on the graphical representation of their
data. I will discuss these tasks in sequence.

    Currently, I have incorporated a quantitative case study component for each
of the following seven topics in a standard intermediate macroeconomics course:
(1) GDP components, (2) Uses of Saving, (3) Productivity, (4) Growth, (5)

                                                                                                 311

                             Figure 15.1. Sample data plots
Inflation, (6) Interest Rates, and (7) the Phillips Curve. Each of these concepts
and topics are first presented from a conventional theoretical perspective and
immediately compared against their historical record in the United States. I then
direct students to compile, after class, the relevant data from the IFS database
and to plot those data into Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Figure 15.1 presents a
sample of those plots.

    Depending on the topic, students are asked to compute ratios between vari-
ables (topic 1), rates of growth (topics 2, 3, and 5), sums or subtractions (topics
2, 4 and 6), or to generate a scatter plot (topic 7). The use of spreadsheets for
data manipulation and plotting is common practice in the discipline and this
element of the activity contributes to the development of research literacy skills.
At this point, the Framework for IL's Research as Inquiry frame is most prom-
inently highlighted. Also, it is usually at this stage when students begin to be
aware of matters germane to social-structural IL. For example, changes in the
methodology of data collection, or even a change in the definition of the object
of study (e.g., Germany pre-and-post 1990), result in discontinuities in the
series--or even gaps. In a similar light, time periods when the variables are very
large in magnitude (e.g., Brazil's hyper-inflation in the 1990s) dwarf the rest
312
                                                            Quantitative Reasoning and IL in Economics

of the data, making their visual interpretation much more difficult. Although
these data-related issues are sometimes frustrating to some students, they are
excellent educational opportunities to develop a historical context to the study
of macroeconomics.

    After the data is plotted, students use the graphs they have generated to
answer a series of discussion questions highlighting how quantitative evidence
validates--and sometimes challenges--the theoretical relationships focus of the
course. Table 2 in Appendix A contains the list of discussion questions per topic.
These questions are posted on an online discussion forum hosted on the Moodle
teaching platform. Only students registered in the course have access to these
questions and the forum is set up in a "Q&A" format, which prevents individual
students from seeing their peers' answers to the common set of questions until
they have posted their own work. Students have no less than 48 hours to com-
plete the data collection, plotting, and analysis before the submission of their
answers is blocked. In other words, their work must be completed and uploaded
to Moodle by the time the class convenes the following day. The discussion ques-
tions associated with each quantitative case study cover a range of issues. Some
questions ask the students to describe visual aspects of the data (e.g., "which
GDP component is the largest?") and aim to be prompts for discussion of eco-
nomic structures when different countries' data are compared. Some questions
(e.g., "Is the country a net lender or a net borrower?") require the application of
theoretical concepts discussed in class to the changing reality of different econ-
omies. Finally, some other questions (e.g., "Do the growth rate of labor produc-
tivity and the unemployment rate move in the same direction? Why not?") aim
to bring to the fore the theoretical relationships object of the course.

    During the class period when the quantitative case studies are discussed the
students' work--both their data plots and their answer to the discussion ques-
tions--are projected on video screens. Over the last three semesters I have made
use of a technology-intensive classroom setup with multiple video projectors and
a digital whiteboard. Those are not essential components of this activity but they
facilitate the visualization of trends, cycles, and degrees of association between vari-
ables. Moreover, I believe the fact that students see their work projected for every-
body else to see serves to produce a certain degree of peer pressure that marginally
improves the average quality of their work. It is during the class period when the
case studies are discussed that quantitative literacy, or numeracy, becomes cen-
tral to the course. As the students work through their individual discussion ques-
tions they gain confidence in reading and interpreting the data associated with
the assignment. Also, as the same discussion question is addressed across different
countries students are able to observe different orders of magnitude, proportion,
and signs of macroeconomic magnitudes under study, effectively developing a true

                                                                                                 313

context for their theoretical study of economics. At this point, Framework for IL's
Information Has Value frame is most prominently highlighted.

ASSESSMENT

For the purpose of this chapter I will focus on the challenges associated with the
discussion of a standard production function, the derivation of the concept of
labor productivity, its connection to the demand for labor, and, finally, to the
concept of the unemployment rate. This is the quantitative case study number 3
summarized in Table 1 in Appendix A.

    Over the years, most of my in-class exams have included questions on these
concepts. The phrasing of the questions has evolved but the focus remains on
the same issue: economic theory teaches us that as productivity increases, other
things being equal, the unemployment rate decreases. In my experience, stu-
dents tend to struggle with the notion that as workers become more productive
the demand for their labor increases. Their "micro" thinking, discussed earlier
in this chapter, leads them to conclude that employers demand fewer workers
once these workers become more productive.

    In the fall semesters of 2008 and 2009, prior to the inclusion of quanti-
tative case studies in the course, I asked students to identify in a diagram the
impact of an increase in total factor productivity on output and on the mar-
ginal productivity of labor. Although, in general terms, the students displayed
their knowledge of the concepts at stake through a proficient replication of the
graphs discussed in class, they struggled when confronted with the task of eval-
uating a reporter's statement contradicting intermediate macroeconomic theory.
In fact, as the students were asked to analyze information, rather than to repli-
cate material covered in lectures, the average scores on these specific questions
dropped from 75% to 34% and their standard deviations increased from 0.15
to 0.25 with population sizes (N) of 8 in both semesters. Due to the small size
of the populations under study I will not attempt to draw conclusions about the
statistical robustness of these figures. Nevertheless, one could argue that as stu-
dents were pushed up the skill pyramid representing Bloom's (1956) taxonomy
of learning objectives they faltered at the more demanding task.

    In the fall semesters of 2011 and 2012, after the inclusion of quantitative
case studies in the course, I asked students to identify in the same sets of dia-
grams the impact of decreases in either capital expenditure or in total factor
productivity on output, the marginal productivity of labor, and the unemploy-
ment rate. The phrasing of the questions was more specific than in previous
tests but it also demanded that students relate changes in production and in
labor productivity to changes in the unemployment rate. The average scores on

these questions were 57% in 2011 and 62% in 2012, with associated standard
deviations of 0.41 and 0.29. Population sizes (N ) were 14 and 17, respectively.
Notice that although the standard deviations of the post-quantitative case study
test scores have increased relative to the pre-quantitative case study test scores,
the 2009 and 2012 values are very similar.

    Student reflections on the use of quantitative case studies have been over-
whelmingly positive. Quoting from the university's standard anonymous course
evaluations, students state that: "I feel using real data to help support economic
theories was extremely useful," "I also liked the discussion questions because
they helped apply and reinforce ideas," "Learning how to analyze graphs and
data and how to properly interpret that data were valuable skills to learn," and "I
feel like putting the effort to read notes and work on the IMF forums [i.e., the
discussion questions on the IFS-IMF data-based quantitative case studies] paid
off and led me to learn/understand more about macroeconomics." In the form
of suggestions, some students state their desire for "more in-class activities or
assignments along the way" or notice how the course was "more lecture-oriented
rather than discussion-oriented." I believe that at this point in time it would be
very difficult to introduce more of these activities without substantially impact-
ing the primary goal of the course (i.e., the mastering of intermediate macro-
economic theory). Having said that, the benefits of addressing Framework for IL
threshold concepts through this particular pedagogical strategy are observable
through the student's appreciation of the intellectual tasks of "understanding"
rather than memorizing, "interpreting" rather than mimicking, and "analyzing"
rather than replicating.

DISCUSSION

The goal of introducing elements of case method teaching into an intermediate
macroeconomic theory course has been to make student thinking more sophis-
ticated and context-rich. The design of activities where students collect, manip-
ulate, and analyze data also contributes to develop critical IL skills. Replacing
many of the exercises aimed at rote replication of the content of lectures, the
activities organized around quantitative case studies require from students a
more extended and sophisticated engagement with the material. Thus, I will
argue, students more effectively apply theories and concepts to specific problems
and are more capable at using quantitative evidence to discuss the limitations of
the economic theories. Moreover, the nature of the case method and its use of
real data allow the instructor to present students with the fact that macroeco-
nomic concepts and theories are frequently dynamic and thus mutable. Finally,
I believe that the continued exposure to macroeconomic data, their sources,

                                                                                                 315

and even orders of magnitude, builds a framework of reference for students that
help them start to develop the desirable quality of "thinking in macroeconomic
terms."

    Although it is not listed as an explicit learning goal of the course I consider
the described quantitative case studies a solid pedagogical strategy in the educa-
tion of my students in matters of IL in the discipline: by providing instruction
on the form, format, location, and access of quantitative data as a central part of
the course assignments my students develop resource literacy; by discussing the
process of creating and organizing statistical information and knowledge across
countries and across time my students develop socio-structural literacy; and by
understanding and using spreadsheets to perform quantitative analysis of the
statistical information that they have collected my students develop research
literacy. These literacy skills are not presented as ends by themselves, yet they
become--in my opinion--critical means to develop quantitative literacy, or
numeracy, among the students. Finally, as the students locate and use effectively
the quantitative information that they need to evaluate intermediate macroeco-
nomic concepts, they are in effect developing the connection between theories
and empirical evidence that underpins the social science of economics.

    In future iterations of the course I will consider highlighting explicit issues of
social-structural literacy, creating discussion questions specific to the social situ-
ation and production of the data of each assignment. These questions may ask
students to identify the agency compiling the data, the highest frequency that the
data are available, and potential reasons for changes in collection methodology.
By doing so I hope to draw student attention to the fact that social groups create
and organize information as I continue to teach the students how to manipu-
late and interpret that information. Also looking forward, I hope to develop, in
collaboration with the academic librarian liaison to the Department and as part
of the multi-year assessment effort of our student learning goals, a rubric for IL
outcomes in our program. Since we already enjoy a long history of collaboration
in the delivery of instructional sessions on locating, evaluating, and using text/
qualitative information as part of the capstone (i.e., senior-level) course, I believe
our academic library liaison to be a key partner in this effort. As a first step I will
suggest borrowing from the ACRL-guided work in other social sciences, such as
political science, to develop a research competency guide for our discipline.

MOVING AHEAD BY
LOOKING BACK: CRAFTING
A FRAMEWORK FOR
SUSTAINABLE, INSTITUTIONAL
INFORMATION LITERACY

      Lori Baker and Pam Gladis
      Southwest Minnesota State University

Infusing information literacy (IL) into the curriculum is long, hard, and often
frustrating work. At our small, public liberal arts university, faculty have been
crafting the pieces of an IL initiative for the past 10 years. Moving from the
theoretical ideal of IL to an on-the-ground working reality takes much thought,
time, and effort. Through trial and error, reflection and research, our campus is
slowly moving forward toward what we would term an "institutional" model of
IL appropriate for our university.

    What we are finding is that this process is one of starts and stops, slowly
shifting the culture to recognize the roles that all university stakeholders have
in IL. Though we have not fully integrated IL, we are, we believe, building a
framework that supports institutional IL, one that meshes well with the new
Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL) Framework for Informa-
tion Literacy for Higher Education (Framework for IL) (2015) and will enable our
institution to adapt as the process on our campus moves forward.

    We have found two key factors associated with this move to an institu-
tional model: 1) a required shift in perspective about agency connected with
IL; in other words, who is responsible for what, who does the work of IL and
in what form; and 2) the importance of kairos, a Greek term often translated
as "opportune moment," and the factors that helped lead our university to its
opportune "moment" to take on institutional IL. These two reflective frames
are useful even as the guidelines for IL shift, for they are not dependent on
the model of IL in place but rather serve as heuristic lenses enabling us to
identify any blind spots. Reflecting on these issues of agency and kairos has
helped us to recognize the cultural factors related to IL at our institution that

Baker and Gladis

have influenced our work so far and how we can advance those efforts. At our
university, a rural, regional school of nearly 3000 on-campus students with a
strong union presence and orientation towards shared governance, that means
shaping an institutional IL initiative that is driven by the faculty and integrated
throughout the curriculum.

    In this chapter we will describe what we mean by "institutional" IL, overview
the issues of agency related to IL, and describe the exigencies leading to our insti-
tution's focus on IL. We will examine how these practical and theoretical consid-
erations relevant to our institution's perspective ultimately led to the curriculum
model our university adopted. Finally, we will describe the lessons learned and
next steps in pursuing an IL initiative at our university.

RECOGNIZING AN "INSTITUTIONAL" MODEL OF IL

At many universities, currently including ours, a standard model for IL often
consists of the on-demand (Curzon, 2004), one-shot "inoculation" (Jacobs &
Jacobs, 2009, p. 75) approach, or what William Badke (2010) terms "short-term
remedial" (p. 130). This approach, while helpful to individual faculty, students,
and classes, does not lead to fully developed IL skills and understanding. As
Barbara Fister (2008) asserts, the one-shot model makes it "difficult to build
a systematic program for developing sophisticated information literacy skills"
(p. 94). Describing findings from a case study of a Quality Enhancement Plan
(QEP) project centered on IL at Trinity College, Anne E. Zald and Michelle
Millett (2012) also draw this conclusion: "Ultimately, a library instruction pro-
gram built entirely upon course-level partnerships is not sustainable and cannot
support consistent student achievement of institutional learning outcomes" (p.
127). While we do not discount the value of individual or course-level collabo-
rations, the goal of producing information literate students cannot be sustained
by that model alone.

    Recognizing the limitations of the one-shot model, Susan Carol Curzon
(2004) and Stephanie Sterling Brasley (2008) describe eight additional models
for delivering IL ranging from an introduction model, in which baseline IL
skills are taught in perhaps several sessions, to credit-bearing courses taught by
librarians. A model often illustrated in the literature involves programs work-
ing with librarians to develop program-specific IL (see examples in Brasley,
2008; D'Angelo & Maid, 2004a, 2004b; Peele, Keith & Seely, 2013; Winter-
man, Donovan & Slough, 2011). Exemplifying an approach that helps students
to develop foundational skills within their discipline, Alison S. Gregory and
Betty L. McCall McClain's chapter in this collection (2016) describes the ver-
tical curriculum in the Sociology-Anthropology program at their institution.

Programmatic IL efforts such as this are important endeavors that contribute to
the broader work of developing IL.

    As Curzon (2004) notes, a comprehensive IL initiative would consist of
several models of IL blended together (p. 43) in order to ensure that all stu-
dents are meeting IL outcomes at all stages of their higher education experience.
We call this an "institutional" model of IL. This institutional model approach
would build from the four qualities necessary, according to Patricia Senn Breivik
(2004), for developing a successful IL initiative:

      · sharing responsibility for IL learning across faculty and beyond the
         library;

      · close working relationships between faculty and librarians at the cur-
         riculum design and delivery levels;

      · assessing IL based on "campus-determined" IL outcomes;
      · and ensuring that IL is "institutionalized across the curriculum"

         through "departmental or college-wide planning for strategic integra-
         tion of learning initiatives." (p. xiii)

    Much like the matrix model described by William Miller and Steven Bell
(2005), an institutional model, then, includes existing collaborations but moves
beyond individual faculty or program collaboration to take a university-wide,
collective approach of embedding and assessing IL throughout the curriculum.
This institutional model thus aligns with the Framework for IL. The Frame-
work for IL acknowledges the "information ecosystem" in which IL should be
grounded. It advocates that IL should be contextualized to an institution and
"developmentally and systematically integrated into the student's academic pro-
gram at various levels" (2015, p. 10).

THE NEED FOR COLLECTIVE IL AGENCY

Moving to an institutional model of collaboration requires acknowledging and,
likely, challenging existing notions of agency and ownership of IL found on a
campus. Historically, librarians have been the traditional agents in the IL move-
ment, an outgrowth from their work in bibliographic instruction that took root
in the 1960s (Hardesty, 1995, p. 340). A review of the literature indicates that
the majority of IL writing and research is published in the realm of library pub-
lications. As Badke (2010) notes, the limited publication of IL-related material
outside of a library audience creates a "library silo" effect (p. 138), making it
more difficult to raise awareness of IL and to influence other academic areas'
practices.

    Broader faculty culture also contributes to the traditional view of librarian

                                                                                                 327
Baker and Gladis

ownership of IL. Larry Hardesty's (1995) study about bibliographic instruc-
tion indicated limited faculty acceptance of library instruction sessions. Curzon
(2004) notes that because IL seems basic to faculty and "so much a part of the
fabric of their academic life that they take it for granted" (pp. 32-33), that
they often do not recognize or prioritize the need to participate in institutional
IL efforts. Even within Rhetoric and Writing Studies, a discipline that has a
marked interest in IL, faculty do not usually take an institutional perspective
as they address IL within their programs. For example, Margaret Artman, Erica
Frisicaro-Pawlowski, and Robert Monge (2010) note that within first-year writ-
ing programs, "it is still common practice to either disregard the expertise our
librarian colleagues may lend to IL instruction or, conversely, to `farm out' les-
sons in IL to one-shot library instruction sessions" (p. 96). These studies and
comments indicate a reluctance to include librarians in a systematic way with IL
skills instruction. In broad terms, faculty either teach it, don't think they need to
teach it, or won't give the time (Van Cleave, 2007, p. 179).

    Librarian culture certainly plays a role in limiting the expansion of IL as
well, as numerous researchers have shown and as Rolf Norgaard and Caroline
Sinkinson discuss in this collection (Chapter 1). Courtney Bruch and Carroll
Wetzel Wilkinson (2012) explain how some librarians are caught "between the
traditional librarian dharma emphasizing service preeminence, and new librar-
ian dharma emphasizing educator responsibilities" (p. 17). Breivik (2004) and
Kendra Van Cleave (2007) state that it may be difficult for librarians to share
responsibility or collaborate. Nancy H. Seamans (2012), writing to librarians,
notes "one of the most important components of sustaining an information lit-
eracy initiative is also one that we find most difficult, and that is the willingness
to give primary responsibility to others if that's what will ensure the program's
success " (p. 227). Even when librarians attempt to lead institutional IL efforts,
they often have difficulty making headway due to traditional academic hierar-
chies and structures, such as the lack of faculty status or teaching department
or program structure, which can keep librarians from having a direct impact on
curriculum development (D'Angelo & Maid, 2004b).

    What we have found in trying to move to an institutional model of IL is
that these traditional concepts and structures related to IL agency constrict
what might be possible to achieve. Van Cleave noted the same roadblock in
2007, stating that "Often the biggest stumbling blocks are a lack of an insti-
tution-wide focus on information literacy, as well as territorialism over curric-
ulum and classroom control" (p. 179). Francia Kissel et al. (Chapter 20, this
collection) further explore the issues related to faculty-librarian collaboration
in their chapter in this collection. Ultimately, librarians and faculty "must
have a mutual interest . . . and see a mutual benefit" to IL (Curzon, 2004,

                                                                           Moving Ahead by Looking Back

p. 29). When IL is seen only as the purview of the library and librarians, or
when faculty are dismissive of working with IL, it is more difficult to attain
an institutional model of IL. What is needed instead is a collective IL agency,
one in which both the faculty and librarians have a full understanding of IL
and how it is infused in the curriculum. Faculty and librarians act in concert;
they understand what IL is, where it is in the curriculum, how it can be taught,
who will teach it, and how it will be assessed. This collective version of IL
agency can only succeed if aided by a structural framework that supports it.
This is similar to what Zald and Millett (2012) term "curricular integration"
(p. 127). Such integration can only happen when IL becomes the responsibil-
ity of faculty as well as librarians, and not only within courses or programs,
but across the institution. A collective sense of purpose and ownership of IL
extends beyond individuals who might be in charge and resonates throughout
the faculty and curriculum.

    Examples of institutional IL do exist and more are emerging, with some
being published beyond traditional library literature and in interdisciplinary
venues (see Black, Crest & Volland, 2001; Brasley's 2008 description of Wart-
burg College; Lindstrom & Shonrock, 2006; Winterman, Donovan & Slough,
2011; Zald & Millett, 2012). The shifting perspective on agency can also be
found in the LILAC Project's research design involving faculty, librarians, and
students (Walker & Cox, 2013) as well as the revision process of the ACRL
standards, which began in 2011 in an effort to update the standards first pub-
lished in 2000. The organization reached beyond library professionals to include
"non-librarians from university departments, higher education organizations,
and an accreditor" as task force members (Bell, 2013, para. 5).

    While "the autonomous culture of academia can enable resistance to collab-
oration," (Van Cleave, 2007, p. 179), institutions need to consider how agency
and ownership of IL is structured or implicit on their campus. At our univer-
sity, we are moving away from traditional, library-only ownership to a collective
agency. Through a series of events, we are beginning to craft an institutional
framework that infuses IL into the curriculum, regardless of who teaches it.

ACKNOWLEDGING KAIROS IN THE
MOVE TO INSTITUTIONAL IL

Moving to an institutional IL approach, however, has not come easily or quickly,
and, looking back, could not have even been put in motion without the key
mix of elements and timing that occurred. Rhetoricians refer to the blend of
circumstances and timing as kairos, "a situational kind of time" (Crowley &
Hawhee, 2004, p. 37) that creates an advantageous moment in which to act.

                                                                                                 329
Baker and Gladis

When we consider how changes occur in academic institutions, usually they
do not come unexpectedly but are in response to some kind of initial stimulus
or dialogue. These might be national trends, accreditation criteria, professional
organizations' push for different practices, or research studies which provide a
rationale for change, which could be espoused by accreditors or new adminis-
trators or faculty; all of these factors take place in a given time and context that
come together to create the opportunity for change. This unique blend of time,
place, and influences produces a kairotic moment.

    However, we must keep in mind that kairos is not the same as chronological
time: "the temporal dimension of kairos can indicate anything from a lengthy
time to a brief, fleeting moment" (Crowley & Hawhee, 2004, p. 37). On a uni-
versity campus, a kairotic moment might happen when, for example, a new pro-
vost institutes an innovative program and provides a strategic and well-funded
immediate plan of action. However, many university initiatives are not that neat
and tidy, and the kairotic moment is not so much a single moment in chrono-
logical time as a series of moments, each contributing to the overall attainment
of a larger goal.

    This is particularly true of institutional IL movements, which take ongoing
effort. For example, the creation of a community of practice as described in
Kissel et al. (Chapter 20, this collection) in this collection started with a fac-
ulty member's concern about students' IL needs. The chapter describes how the
resulting dialogue and partnerships are contributing to enhanced awareness of
IL. Austin Booth and Carole Ann Fabian (2002) highlight the kairotic blend
of factors and time that it takes to move an IL program forward, stating, "Ini-
tiation of campus-wide curriculum-based information literacy programs is a
multi-­layered, incremental, repetitive process" (p. 127). While something might
occur to spark an institutional IL movement, persistence is needed to ensure that
the full IL initiative comes into being. In other words, the larger kairotic event
culminating in institutional IL might actually consist of a number of smaller
kairotic moments spread over time.

    Recognizing these moments can aid an institution in moving its efforts for-
ward. By identifying the factors and moments that have been key in bringing IL
into focus, institutions can ensure that the IL initiatives do not drop off or fade
away. In other words, it is useful to look back in order to move ahead. In Eleanor
Mitchell's (2007) chapter entitled "Readiness and Rhythm: Timing for Infor-
mation Literacy," she reviews the kinds of external and institutional factors and
"rhythms and pulses" (p. 77) that must be considered in planning a successful
IL program. While Mitchell is generally focused on identifying the best time to
"launch" a program, attention to timing is useful in reflecting back on the prog-
ress of IL at an institution. We see different kairotic points that have led to the

place we are today; this helps us become aware of how those kairotic moments
are taking shape now, so that we can refine the processes and framework needed
to sustain institutional IL at our university.

CREATING AN INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK
FOR IL: LOOKING BACK TO MOVE AHEAD

A kairotic lens helps us to identify the convergences of who was involved and
what circumstances or influential moments have shaped our institution's IL
efforts. Our university's engagement with institutional IL began in 2004 when
an external accreditation review indicated our Liberal Arts Curriculum (LAC),
our general education equivalent, required an overhaul. IL itself was not directly
noted in the accreditation review; however, the general education revision pro-
cess provided the opening for IL to take root. In retrospect, the natural fit of IL
coming into the process at this time makes sense. As noted by Ilene F. Rockman
(2004), the national IL movement, having kicked off in 1989, had established
itself with the 2000 release of the Association of College and Research Libraries'
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (IL Standards);
this was followed in 2004 by Rockman's prominent publication titled Integrating
Information Literacy into the Higher Education Curriculum. At the time of our
accreditation review, IL was certainly on the minds of our librarians, who were
by then aware of the new standards. Together with the IL Standards coming
into being, an "instruction paradigm" shifted to a "learning paradigm" in librar-
ies (Bruch & Wilkinson, 2012, pp. 5-6). This paradigm shift was occurring at
the same time that accrediting agencies were emphasizing learning outcomes
and assessment. The need to focus on learning outcomes and develop an LAC
assessment plan based on those outcomes was paramount in our institution's
accreditation review. Our university, though reaffirmed for 10 more years of
accreditation, had to submit a progress report regarding general education to the
accrediting agency.

    This required our union-oriented faculty to closely examine and revamp the
core of our institution's educational programming. Our institution is known for
its strong faculty presence and the faculty's insistence, per the union contract,
on being responsible for curriculum matters. The administration offered support
but did not dictate any part of the process. As Lynn D. Lampert (2007) notes,
"the curricular reform typically involved in overhauling general education pro-
grams is messy business fraught with campus politics and academic departments
jockeying for position within the structure of course offerings to guarantee neces-
sary enrollment levels" (p. 106). Our college's experience affirms that statement.
The revision of the LAC was set up in stages, beginning with identification of

                                                                                                 331

liberal education outcomes, followed by objectives for each. A broad curriculum
design was then initially established, and finally creation and approval of courses
that met the outcomes took place. The initial process of developing and agree-
ing upon the outcomes and objectives spanned over a five-year timeframe with
numerous meetings, brainstorming sessions, and discussions among faculty. It
was time-consuming and at times exhausting work, but the faculty took the
charge to revise the curriculum seriously.

    An early step in the process was the establishment of a LAC Transforma-
tion Committee. The nine-member committee was comprised of seven faculty
members, a staff member who belonged to a different union of "administrative
and service faculty" representing student services, and the associate provost
assigned to represent the administration and charged with writing the fol-
low-up progress report to the accrediting agency. Of the seven faculty mem-
bers, one was a faculty librarian. At our institution, a faculty librarian (4-5
full-time faculty librarians were on staff during this time out of approximately
130 full-time university faculty) has historically served on all of the major
committees on campus. Having a librarian on this high-profile, high-impact
committee was the first step in IL gaining a foothold in the new curriculum.
As noted in Lampert's quote above, politics and departmental jockeying can
greatly impact the institutional dialogue; however, the librarian on the com-
mittee held an institutional view rather than a territorial perspective on pro-
tecting credits and courses. She was able to prompt conversations about IL
within the committee, as well as at departmental meetings, to ensure others
were on board and the topic of IL did not remain only in the library realm;
she was actively pursuing buy-in. As Curzon (2004) indicates, "Most informa-
tion literacy programs fail because they are parochial and eventually come to
be seen as only a library effort. To prevent this, savvy librarians will deploy a
strategy that makes the information literacy program part of the educational
strategy of the university, not just part of the service program of the library"
(p. 35). We have little doubt that the strong and consistent library voice on
the committee made an impact on the development of the revised outcomes.

    That being said, the librarian on the committee was not solely responsible
for the inclusion of IL concepts in the new outcomes. While the librarian was
carrying forward the ACRL IL Standards, fortuitously, a number of depart-
ments on campus were also working with IL concepts, though they would not
necessarily have called them that by name: 1) The English Department had
been conceptualizing a new first-year writing program in order to align with
the Council of Writing Program Administrators' Outcomes Statement for First
Year Composition, first published in 1999 and formally adopted by Council
in 2000. Several of the outcomes shared commonalities with the IL Standards

332
                                                                           Moving Ahead by Looking Back

(see Corso, Weiss & McGregor, 2010, for a description of the overlaps). 2)
Faculty in the sciences had identified a lack of research and writing skills in
their senior students and had revised their lower-level curriculum to address
this concern. 3) During both the outcomes development phase as well as later
during the curriculum design phase, the Philosophy Department engaged
the faculty community in a consideration of the national dialogue on critical
thinking and the best approach for representing it in the curriculum. All of
these various efforts were ongoing at the same time as the general education
program revision and in essence represent shared concerns about IL. This insti-
tutional conversation filtered back to the transformation committee, which
was itself engaged in researching national standards, including partnering with
the Center of Inquiry in the Liberal Arts at Wabash College. Together, these
concurrent efforts were focused on helping our students develop IL skills, even
though the different entities involved might not have labeled them as such.
Looking back, we see how IL was starting to shift from the focus of the library
to departments and across the institution as the transformation committee
developed the first draft of what came to be called the Liberal Education Pro-
gram (LEP) outcomes.

    Throughout the LEP revision process, the transformation committee was
vigilant in reporting to the full faculty body at union meetings. (Our union
meetings replace a traditional faculty senate structure found elsewhere; our fac-
ulty union is responsible for all curriculum decisions as well as the kind of labor
considerations more typically associated with union governance.) A majority of
the full faculty were equally vigilant in attending open forums, drafting compo-
nents of the new LEP outcomes and objectives, and commenting on proposed
curriculum design.

    Ten LEP outcomes were approved by faculty in 2007. Another year was
spent developing the specific objectives to support each outcome. Along the
way, faculty agreed that IL was an important component; they included IL-­
related objectives within two of the LEP outcomes, accepted an IL rubric, and
listed IL as one of three core skills (along with communication and critical
thinking) common to all areas of the LEP (see Table 16.1 SMSU Core Skills,
LEP Outcomes, and Related IL Objectives). Because of union processes and
transparency, the majority of faculty were thus involved in the inclusion of IL
in the new LEP. Though the concept of IL was initially led by a librarian, by the
conclusion of the revision of the LEP outcomes and objectives, all faculty had
been exposed to and agreed to the importance of IL. In this manner, our faculty
demonstrated their collective belief that "developing students' IL is an important
aspect of their school's academic mission and programs," a factor emphasized by
Arthur H. Sterngold (2008, p. 86) as vital to IL success.

                                                                                                 333

material accurately and correctly.                ulum did not change.

    Following the passage of the outcomes and objectives, the difficult work
of actually constructing a curriculum took place over the next academic year.
Again, looking back, we see a number of factors that affected the eventual cur-
ricular design. While requiring credit-bearing IL courses is a model that some
universities employ, this was not an option. During the curriculum design pro-
cess, the state had decreed that all universities must reduce the number of credit
hours to graduate from 128 to 120. This put pressure on several programs whose
members lobbied that the LEP not grow much beyond 40 credits. In addition,
there simply were not enough faculty librarians to handle such a load, and ten-
sions already existed on campus regarding hires in other areas during difficult
budget years. Other factors that possibly affected the curriculum design related
to library personnel issues. Regrettably, shortly before the course design phase,
the University Librarian unexpectedly passed away. During the design phase
another instruction librarian retired and her position was not immediately filled.
These factors, though not all explicitly discussed in the faculty debate about

334
                                                                           Moving Ahead by Looking Back

curriculum design, can in retrospect be understood as having affected the form
IL took in the revised curriculum.

    Over the course of the discussion about outcomes and objectives, the fac-
ulty had determined that the new LEP should guide our students over the
full four years at the university, and not only for the first two years of general
education. The result was the creation of interdisciplinary first and senior year
LEP classes, both of which are to incorporate IL as one of the core skills. IL
is also designated in the curriculum as one of the core skills to be revisited
in a required sophomore-level or above writing-focused course and in a core
skills course that each major program has to designate in their requirements.
(See Table 16.2 SMSU LEP Curriculum Framework.) This aligns with an
underpinning of the IL Standards (ACRL, 2000): "Achieving competency in
information literacy requires an understanding that this cluster of abilities is
not extraneous to the curriculum but is woven into the curriculum's content,
structure, and sequence" (p. 5). The new LEP design thus provides a curric-
ular framework upon which institutional IL can be built. Further, although
unknown at the time of its initial development, the scaffolded design should
align well with the newer Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Edu-
cation (ACRL, 2015) model based on threshold concepts and moving indi-
viduals from novice to expert. The scaffolded design allows for students to
develop IL skills over the whole of their time at the university, a developmen-
tal approach akin to "the way many other knowledge-based skills develop--
from a combination of instruction and practice over a period of time" (Badke,
2010, p. 132).

    The foundation of our redesigned framework is the first year LEP course,
First Year Seminar (FYS):"The purpose of FYS is to encourage critical thinking,
introduce information literacy, and involve students in the SMSU Liberal Edu-
cation Program" (Southwest, 2013, p. 2). This course, then, was designed to
introduce IL as one learning outcome of the class. FYS, a theme-based course, is
taught by faculty from all disciplines with the understanding that they will work
to meet the course objectives, including an introduction to IL. Requiring IL in
FYS provides an exigency for librarians and faculty to identify together how to
meet the IL learning outcome. For us, "[l]ibrarians would create the foundation
that supports faculty, and enables them to integrate information literacy effec-
tively into their own courses" (Miller & Bell, 2005, p. 3). In addition, having
faculty from all areas addressing IL in FYS also makes them more conscious of
integrating IL in their major courses. The FYS course requirement is a foun-
dational element of our institutional Framework for IL, and the joint work of
the librarians and faculty furthers the collective agency necessary for sustainable
institutional IL.

ADVANCING INSTITUTIONAL IL:
REFINING ONGOING EFFORTS

Even though we approved a curriculum in 2008, teasing out the IL pieces has
continued to be that "multi-layered, incremental, repetitive process" that Booth
and Fabian described (2007, p. 127). At the time FYS was approved through
our faculty assembly, the emphasis during the faculty assembly debate had cen-
tered on the critical thinking portion of the class, leaving the IL component an
assumption. The other courses besides FYS that are to feature IL in the LEP
(ENG 151, COMM 110, sophomore level-or-above writing course, course in
the major emphasizing core skills, and LEP 400) have been created or identified;
course proposals were vetted by the LEP Committee. However, the IL compo-
nent in this process was included broadly, requiring only a description of what
research and writing would be incorporated in the course. Different instructors
and programs have approached the inclusion of IL in a variety of ways. Look-
ing back, we can see that while the verbiage of IL had been inserted into the
outcomes and core skills language for the LEP, there was not enough specificity
provided for how it should be addressed or assessed.

    Although IL is named as a core skill and ostensibly taught by faculty from
across campus, we continue to define and identify exactly how that is or should
be done. After the new LEP curriculum was in place for two years, the LEP
Committee reviewed how well LEP 100 FYS was meeting its objectives. Results
from a pilot critical thinking assessment and questions from the student senate
about the FYS class created the impetus for the review. The committee decided
that more specific training in critical thinking as well as a more standardized
approach to introducing IL was needed.

    The result was an opportunity to address IL in FYS as one component of a
workshop held with the course instructors. Prior to the spring 2013 workshop,
the three teaching librarians determined that a set of seven IL Standards out-
comes would be most appropriate to address in the FYS course. The librarians
recognized that in the previous semesters not all FYS faculty had chosen to bring
their class to even one library session. However, the librarians described their
desire to maintain a presence in the course in order to make contact with stu-
dents early in their college experience. At the workshop, the librarian from the
LEP committee led a session on IL outlining the library skills and specifically the
seven IL outcomes to be introduced in FYS (see Appendix A). This introduction
was meant to both introduce faculty to the described IL skills as well as foster a
librarian and FYS faculty opportunity to "have a shared responsibility in inject-
ing IL into their curriculum," but "do so meaningfully in close collaboration
with the experts in the library" (D'Angelo & Maid, 2004b, p. 216).

    The workshop session was a first step in continuing to systematize and scaf-
fold how IL is being delivered. In the first year following the workshop the
majority of the faculty teaching FYS preferred to have a librarian lead the IL ses-
sions. However, that could morph as the instructors and librarians continue to
develop ways to integrate those baseline IL skills into the course, and further as
the institution works to adopt the new threshold concepts and Framework for IL.

    Applying our kairotic lens, we now recognize additional avenues for con-
tinuing to emphasize and scaffold IL at the university. Assessment and account-
ability imperatives primarily driven by reaccreditation requirements present an
exigency as well as a means for identifying and refining institutional IL efforts.
The task at hand is to include IL assessment within the relevant LEP outcomes
assessment, which will entail making certain that IL objectives related to criti-
cal thinking, communication, and creative thinking are clearly identified, mea-
sured, and reported. In addition, several programs have identified gaps between
the introductory work done in LEP core classes and the new LEP upper-division
communication requirement in their majors. A number of major programs are
adding sophomore-level "introduction to the discipline" requirements, includ-
ing research and writing components. These courses present another platform
for scaffolding IL requirements from the LEP through the majors. Further, a
faculty-­wide conversation regarding academic freedom, assessment, and the con-
tractual limits of standardized curriculum has emerged from the general educa-
tion assessment team's initial undertakings; the discussion provides yet another
possible kairotic moment to move the collective faculty forward in recognizing
the importance and place of IL across the curriculum. We recognize that a kai-
rotic moment is shaping right now; these assessment and curriculum initiatives,
as well as integrating the new Framework for IL, provide key opportunities for
faculty and librarians to continue their collective IL work.

    Looking forward, we can see a number of steps yet to accomplish in order to
fully frame out and operationalize institutional IL:

      · educating the faculty about the ACRL threshold concepts
      · identifying how the concepts are being addressed and developed in courses
      · ascertaining which course- and program-specific learning outcomes

         align with the threshold concepts
      · distinguishing how the assessment of those learning objectives might

         inform the assessment of IL, and
      · ensuring that we are not only building "horizontally (across the curric-

         ulum)" but also "vertically (with the major)" (Curzon, 2004, p. 17),
         with the goal of helping to move students from novices to experts over
         their time at the university.

    Having looked back at the kairotic moments that have shaped our univer-
sity's efforts so far, we recognize that the embedding of IL concepts within key
courses' learning objectives, scaffolded across the curriculum, creates the possi-
bility of a much more sustainable approach to IL than the on-demand collabo-
rations with individual faculty. We know that moving forward is only likely to
happen if librarians and faculty continue to work together, through our union
processes and collective recognition of the importance of the efforts.

CONCLUSION

As has become evident, our institutional approach to IL builds largely upon a
blend of the introduction, general education, learning outcomes, and faculty
focus models described by Curzon (2004, pp. 38-41). At other universities,
an institutional approach might include the use of different models such as an
entrance requirement model that Curzon describes or credit-bearing courses
(see for example Eland, 2008; Mackey & Jacobson, 2007). Our move away
from on-demand, one-shot IL to institutional IL is dependent on our faculty
continuing to recognize and embrace their roles in sharing responsibility for
IL with the library. Even though we are not approaching IL from the criti-
cal literacy standpoint described by James Elmborg (2012), we agree with his
description of IL not as a "thing" but as something we "do" (p. 78); ultimately,
we want IL to become a natural extension of "what we do here," a part of what
faculty and librarians together expect to and do address, rather than an add-
ed-on component or dismissed altogether. As Curzon (2004) asserts, and we
believe, "Regardless of the model or models that are chosen to teach informa-
tion literacy, librarians and faculty must partner to teach students information
literacy skills" (p. 44).

    Creating an institutional approach to IL is not an activity that can take place
in the vacuum of the library; it requires "a complete paradigm shift" . . . in order
to "foster sustainable consistency and alignment throughout the curriculum"
(Bruch & Wilkinson, 2012, pp. 13-14). It has taken our university nearly a
decade to recognize, institute, and begin to refine IL. As we look back at how
our university has arrived at the place where it is today, we do not see failures
or missed opportunities; we see steady progress, dependent on large and small
kairotic moments that kept IL in the picture and moved it forward. Perhaps a
dearth of published accounts of institutionally based IL is because institutional
IL tends to continually evolve and is simply not attainable quickly; it takes time,
and not only chronological time, but an understanding of institutional time, the
kind of time involved when we view institutional IL from a kairotic perspective.
Though we know our experience at our small, public university with a strong

                                                                                                 339

faculty union influence will be different from other institutions' journeys, view-
ing IL through the lenses of agency and kairos is helping us to be purposeful as
we move forward with our institutional approach to IL and perhaps could prove
a useful approach for other institutions working to implement the ACRL Frame-
work for IL and threshold concepts.

APPENDIX A

    During the May 2013 all-day workshop for the faculty teaching the First
Year Seminar (FYS) course, the instruction librarian presented the following
information literacy skills as the minimum to be addressed in the course.

    The instruction librarian requested that faculty focus on three primary
library/information literacy areas that cover seven of the ACRL outcomes as
part of the IL aspect of the course. The broad coverage areas of these three ses-
sions include Article Databases, Online Catalog/Finding Materials, and Source
Evaluation. It was explained the session goals were twofold:

    1. Concrete skills
              a. Introducing seven (7) outcomes from three (3) of the Infor-
                   mation Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education

    2. Intangibles
              a. Relationship building with librarians
              b. Comfort level using the aspects of both the online and physi-
                   cal library and asking for assistance

    The librarian provided a demonstration of an active learning component
for each session. Each instructor could decide whether to offer each session as
librarian-led, instructor-led, or as a flipped classroom.

    The ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Educa-
tion introduced in FYS:

Standard One: The information literate student determines
the nature and extent of the information needed.

    Performance Indicator 1: The information literate student defines and articu-
lates the need for information.

    Outcome c. Explores general information sources to increase familiarity with
the topic.

    Performance Indicator 2: The information literate student identifies a variety of
types and formats of potential sources for information.

    Outcome c. Identifies the value and differences of potential resources in a vari-
ety of formats (e.g., multimedia, database, website, data set, audio/visual, book).

Standard Two: The information literate student accesses
needed information effectively and efficiently.

    Performance Indicator 3: The information literate student retrieves informa-
tion online or in person using a variety of methods.

                                                                                                 343
Baker and Gladis

    Outcome a. Uses various search systems to retrieve information in a variety
of formats.

    Outcome b. Uses various classification schemes and other systems (e.g., call
number systems or indexes) to locate information resources within the library or
to identify specific sites for physical exploration.

    Performance Indicator 5: The information literate student extracts, records,
and manages the information and its sources.

    Outcome c. Differentiates between the types of sources cited and understands
the elements and correct syntax of a citation for a wide range of resources.

    Outcome d. Records all pertinent citation information for future reference.
Standard Three: The information literate student evaluates

information and its sources critically and incorporates selected

information into his or her knowledge base and value system.
    Performance Indicator 2: The information literate student articulates and

applies initial criteria for evaluating both the information and its sources.
    Outcome a. Examines and compares information from various sources in

order to evaluate reliability, validity, accuracy, authority, timeliness, and point
of view or bias.

INFORMATION LITERACY IN NEW ZEALAND

Information literacy (IL) is recognized by librarians and IL advocates as a cor-
nerstone of learning and research in higher education (Association of College
and Research Libraries (ACRL), 2000; Bruce, 2008; Lupton, 2004; Secker &
Coonan, 2011a, 2011b). However, the importance of explicit IL instruction is
largely unacknowledged outside the library: while faculty support IL as a con-
cept, many--if not most--teachers tend to believe responsibility for developing
IL lies elsewhere. IL instruction, therefore, remains on the periphery of univer-
sity curricula (Markless & Streatfield, 2007; Webber & Johnston, 2000). This
chapter extends the conversation on embedding IL into the disciplines into the
New Zealand (NZ) tertiary context. Prior to this research, little was known about
how IL is perceived and taught by NZ faculty. Through participatory action
research (PAR), our research addresses this gap by capturing unique insights into
faculty's lived experiences as they adapted curricula and assessments to support
students' IL development and learning in the New Zealand university context.
Like much of the post-2000 literature, our research focuses on making stronger
connections between IL and learning, and adopts learner-focused pedagogies
that encourage reflective, experiential, and collaborative learning. We aimed
to shift IL beyond the library by drawing on literature from library research,
writing across the curriculum, transition to tertiary study, socio-cultural and
constructivist teaching theories and pedagogy, and research connecting IL to
learning. We explore IL development from a faculty perspective, and consider

Feekery, Emerson, and Skyrme

pedagogical and curriculum factors which both support and hinder embedding
IL across an undergraduate degree.

    In this chapter, then, we raise themes of concern to tertiary educators in
NZ, and internationally: our study highlights the importance of IL in stu-
dents' research, writing, and learning processes, examines key issues in ter-
tiary teaching and student learning, and outlines successes and challenges in
collaborating with and supporting academics to embed IL development into
disciplinary courses.

PARTICIPATING PROGRAM

The participating program for this research was the Bachelor of Resource and
Environmental Planning (BRP), an accredited professional degree in a NZ uni-
versity. Program leaders had been challenged by an accreditation review which
outlined short-comings in graduate capabilities, including IL competencies.
Consequently, BRP faculty identified a need to implement change within peda-
gogy and curriculum design to support students' IL development.

    The BRP is cohort-based and therefore presented a structure that would sup-
port scaffolded IL instruction systematically over the four-year degree. Partici-
pants in this research included five participating faculty, students, two librarians
and the research team. Students were invited to be part of the conversation
because, as Mills (2007) argues, "an obvious condition for doing action research
and effecting educational change is that the outcome of any change effort must
benefit students" (p. 158).

DEVELOPING A RESEARCH CONTEXT

The tertiary education sector in NZ (broadly defined as a single sector encom-
passing all post-school education) caters to over half a million (predominantly
domestic) students, a third of whom are enrolled in one of eight national research
universities (Goedegebuure et al., 2008; Ministry of Education, 2012a). Univer-
sity entrance requirements are determined by National Certificate of Educa-
tional Achievement (NCEA) credits in approved subject areas, including literacy
(Ministry of Education, 2012b; NZQA, 2013), although any NZ or Australian
citizen aged 20 or over can gain special admission without an entrance qualifica-
tion (Healey & Gunby, 2012; Universities New Zealand, 2013). New Zealand
university degrees are typically three-year programs (though vocationally focused
degrees may take 4-6 years) and most have no general education component or
foundation year to transition students into academic literacy (Universities New
Zealand, 2013).

                                                                       Supporting Academics to Embed IL

    In recent years, NZ universities have changed in similar ways to those reported
in the US (Weimer, 2003), UK (Angier & Palmer, 2006; Biggs & Tang, 2011;
Secker, Price & Boden, 2007), and Australia (Brabazon, 2007; Devereux & Wil-
son, 2008), namely changing teaching practices, widening participation, and
increasing concerns over student readiness. Successive governments over the last
30 years have taken proactive steps towards widening participation for under-­
represented groups, including Mori and Pasifika (Goedegebuure et al. 2008).
The perceived widening gap between high school and university is also a feature
of discourse around university preparedness in NZ (Ladbrook & Probert, 2011;
Jansen & van der Meer, 2012), suggesting non-traditional students may struggle
to transition into university successfully (Healey & Gunby, 2012; Jansen & van
der Meer, 2012).

SITUATING IL IN THE RESEARCH

Recent literature on IL shows a shift to holistic views of IL and stronger con-
nections between IL and learning (Andretta, 2005; Bruce, 2008; Martin, 2013).
These views recognize a range of behavioral and cognitive competencies that
characterize an information literate individual engaged in tertiary study (Secker
& Coonan, 2011a; Hepworth & Walton, 2009).

    Two key studies in this shift to a holistic model are the informed learn-
ing agenda (Bruce, 2008) and the "A New Curriculum for Information Liter-
acy" (ANCIL) framework (Coonan & Secker, 2011a, 2011b, 2013). Christine
Bruce's (2008) holistic concept of "informed learning" emphasizes interaction
with, and use of, information in learning. Through informed learning, effective
engagement with information is evolving and transferable, and information use
and learning are inseparable (Bruce, 2008; Bruce, Hughes & Somerville, 2012).
Bruce (2008, p. 183) describes informed learning as "both an approach to learn-
ing and the experience of learning through information use."

    The ANCIL framework (Secker, 2011; Secker & Coonan, 2013) was designed
as a practical IL curriculum to meet the needs of undergraduate students and
reconceptualizes IL as central to academic disciplines (Secker & Coonan, 2011a,
2013). The ANCIL model (Figure 17.1) represents the importance of extending
IL beyond information retrieval and towards key competencies fundamental to
using information to learn. Central and unique to the model is transition, both
into university and the workplace, and from dependent to independent learning
(Martin, 2013; Secker & Coonan, 2011a, 2013).

    Both ANCIL and Bruce's model position the learner at the center of the
learning process, in alignment with the Association of College and Research
Libraries' (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education (2015).

                                                                                                 347
Feekery, Emerson, and Skyrme

      Figure 17.1. The ANCIL framework. Source: Secker & Coonan (2013).

These models take a broader holistic view of IL and recognize the joint respon-
sibility for students, faculty, and librarians to engage in the "dynamic and often
uncertain information ecosystem" (para. 1) that underpins learning in the
digital age. Both ANCIL and Bruce's models informed our focus on learner-
focused pedagogy as a means of embedding IL development into the BRP.
Learner-focused Pedagogy
Throughout western universities, there has been an observable movement away
from traditional transmission modes of education toward a more learner-­focused
pedagogy (for example, in the US, Huba & Freed, 2002, and Weimer, 2003;
in the UK, Biggs & Tang, 2011, and Secker et al., 2007; in Australia, Bruce,
2004, and Lupton, 2004, and in NZ, Zepke, Leach & Prebble, 2006). This
same movement towards a learner-centered focus is also manifest at lower levels
of NZ education. The Ministry of Education (MOE) promotes learner-focused

tor and the student. Learner-focused approaches are promoted at the secondary
school level by the MOE's Te Kete Ipurangi1 (TKI) guidelines:

         The success of teaching and learning is founded on the quality
         of the relationship built between the teacher and the student.
         The teacher manages the motivational climate of the classroom
         to foster a learning-focused relationship with students, with a
         shared ownership of and responsibility for learning. This pro-
         vides students with the maximum opportunity to build their
         own motivation to learn. (Ministry of Education, (n.d.).

    Learning as collaboration connects to the Mori concept of ako, effective and
reciprocal teaching and learning:

         The concept of ako describes a teaching and learning relation-
         ship, where the educator is also learning from the student and
         where educators' practices are informed by the latest research and
         are both deliberate and reflective. Ako is grounded in the princi-
         ple of reciprocity. (K Hikitia2, Ministry of Education, 2009)

    Despite this policy shift towards learner-focused pedagogy, in some NZ
institutions including the one in which this study took place, a transmission
style of lecturing prevails. Our research promoted a shift to pedagogies which
adopt constructivist, experiential, reflective, and socially constructed views of
learning to enhance students' IL development at university.

    A key constructivist learning principle drawn on in this research sees reflec-
tion as an essential part of the learning process in higher education and profes-
sional practices (Moon, 2001; Wang, 2007). Reflection promotes higher-order
thinking skills, including problem-solving, evaluation and critical analysis, syn-
thesis of ideas, and meaning making (Burns, Dimock & Martinez, 2000), key
aspects of IL within the ANCIL framework.

    In adopting learner-focused pedagogy, we also needed to consider the impact
of assessment on learning. Because assessment is a central focus for students
(Dolan & Martorella, 2003), formative "assessment for learning" is a key to pro-
moting learning and can be designed to help students learn by identifying errors
and reinforcing correct understanding (Dolan & Martorella, 2003). Encourag-
ing a focus on process through formative assessments can help students identify
the stages in the research and writing process. This was a key consideration in the
interventions designed for our research and runs parallel with Rolf Norgaard
and Caroline Sinkinson`s observation (Chapter 1, this collection), that effective
IL development requires a process-oriented approach rather than focusing solely
on product.

    Effectively embedding and implementing IL across the curriculum requires
collaboration between faculty, librarians, and wider university administrative
bodies (ACRL, 2000; Secker & Coonan, 2013; Turner & Fisher, 2002). Many

                                                                                                 349
Feekery, Emerson, and Skyrme

IL researchers promote collaboration to ensure that IL is spread throughout the
courses and consistently reinforced across the full degree (McCartin & Feid,
2001; Secker, 2011). Lori Baker and Pam Gladis (Chapter 16, this collection)
refer to such collaboration as "collective agency," namely the collective under-
standing by faculty and librarians of what IL is within each discipline and how
it can be fully integrated into curriculum design.

Participatory Action Research

PAR (McNiff & Whitehead, 2011; Seymour-Rolls & Hughes, 2000; Wad-
sworth, 1998) was identified as a suitable methodology for this research because
a desired outcome was to collaboratively implement a necessary change within
pedagogy and curriculum design. Participatory action researchers are commit-
ted to defining problems and informing, evaluating and changing both their
own and others' behaviors and practices (McNiff & Whitehead, 2011), lead-
ing to lasting impact on practice (Burns, 2005). In this research, PAR enabled
non-threatening, open discussion and reflection on all aspects of teaching and
learning, and helped bridge the gap in librarians' and faculty understanding of
and approaches to IL.

    An initial review of action research definitions in various studies (Avison,
Lau, Myers & Nielsen, 1999; Bunning, 1994; Creswell, 2005; Herr & Ander-
son, 2005; Kemmis & McTaggart, 1988; McKay & Marshall, 2001; McKer-
nan, 1996; McNiff, 2002; McNiff & Whitehead, 2011; Oja & Smulyan, 1989;
Selener, 1997; Seymour-Rolls & Hughes, 2000) led to the identification of six
key characteristics (the "6 Cs") of PAR central to this research: Cyclical, Collab-
orative, Context-specific, Combining theory and practice, Critically reflective,
and Change-focused (Feekery, 2014). The 6 Cs supported this research by rec-
ognizing the uniqueness of the context, allowing changes within the BRP to be
monitored over 2 cycles, supporting collaboration and engaging in conversation
that encouraged critically reflective practice, and promoting pedagogical change
supported by educational theory and local data.

    Data collection took place over four semesters, July 2010--June 2012. Data
were collected through a range of qualitative and quantitative means drawing on
techniques outlined in Mills' (2007, p. 73) taxonomy of action research qualita-
tive data collection techniques, including:

      · Experiencing: through class observations and meeting notes,
      · Enquiring: the researcher asking questions via faculty interviews,

         reflective feedback and meeting notes, and student focus groups and
         surveys, and

350
                                                                       Supporting Academics to Embed IL

      · Examining: using and making records via instructor and student
         reflective journals and document analysis of course outlines, websites
         and handouts, and student assessments.

    Data collected from participants captured attitudes, assumptions and
responses to change throughout the research. Data were thematically analyzed
and manually coded (Mills, 2007) for common patterns, meanings, or themes.
The themes identified were guided by semi-structured interview, focus group
and journal questions, and additional themes emerging through conversations.
Triangulation (McNiff & Whitehead, 2011) combined the perspectives of all
those involved and provided a coherent frame on which to evaluate evidence
and draw conclusions.

    Drawing on Judy McKay and Peter Marshall's (2001) dual-focus action
research model, the complete data set was used for two purposes:

      · The Action Focus: to identify the key successes and changes needed
         for subsequent modification of the interventions during, between, and
         after each cycle.

      · The Research Focus: to analyze the data for a deeper sense of the
         research process and interventions. This included identifying shifting
         faculty attitudes and understandings of IL and their role in supporting
         students' IL development.

THE ACTION FOCUS OR "WHAT WE DID"

The process of working with BRP faculty revealed key factors impacting on the
level of change they were willing and able to facilitate. Thus, a key aspect of this
research was to understand participants' expectations and concerns around stu-
dent performance and learning, views of teaching and learning, attitudes towards
supporting IL development, and expectations of students' independence.

    Participating faculty collaborated with the librarians and researchers to inte-
grate IL development across the four-year degree. The interventions took two
forms: library workshops and assessments.

Library Workshops.

Prior to our research, a review of student outcomes revealed that existing library
sessions had failed to provide an in-depth introduction to effective information
search strategies. Furthermore, IL competencies were not consistently extended
within the four-year BRP program. We recognized that the first-year library
lecture needed to be developed into interactive workshops that would allow
students to attempt searches connected to assessment tasks with support from

                                                                                                 351

librarians and faculty. Additional library workshops were added at the third and
fourth years of the program (Courses 3-1 & 4-D) to ensure that IL competencies
were revisited and extended as research demands on students increased.

    Table 17.1 indicates the interventions developed, trialed, and modified over
two semesters per course in Cycle One and Two.

    The refocused library workshops offered throughout the BRP aimed to:

   1. Encourage greater student interaction and engagement in the sessions. Com-
       mon approaches to increasing interactivity include creating opportunities
       for learning by doing (conducting live searches as part of the session) and
       reflecting (Biggs & Tang, 2011, Diehm & Lupton, 2012, McCartin &
       Feid, 2001).

   2. Connect more closely to discipline-specific sources and immediate task require-
       ments. We tailored library interventions to the specific assessment tasks
       for each course and delivered them at point of need (Macklin, 2001).

   3. Increase input by participating faculty. When faculty attend library sessions
       students value the session more (Turner & Fisher, 2002). Furthermore,
       faculty can offer advice to students on content-specific enquiries.

   4. Increase focus on evaluating source quality and relevance. Students had been
       encouraged to identify credibility indicators and evaluate source quality
       using criteria commonly found in evaluation checklists. However, many
       checklist style evaluation tools ask questions students may lack the knowl-
       edge to answer (Meola, 2004; Metzger, 2007), and as Gocsik, Braunstein,
       and Tober (Chapter 8, this collection), also recognized, many students
       struggle to effectively evaluate sources. Therefore, we helped students
       conduct effective source evaluation by stressing the value of information
       to their discipline and connecting to the "research as conversation" meta-
       phor (Fister, 2011; Gaipa, 2004; McMillen & Hill, 2005).

Assessments

Participating faculty brought a range of teaching approaches and experiences to
the collaborative process and were willing to explore ways to adapt curriculum
and assessments to support IL development within their content courses. All
BRP faculty had concerns about student performance across the program but
had limited understanding of how academic skills were being developed across
the program. Therefore, the focus for each participant was to identify key com-
petencies being developed and assessed within their own courses.

    To consolidate skills introduced in the library workshops, a series of assess-
ment tasks were created in each course to help students further develop IL within
the research and writing process. All participating faculty changed their assess-
ments to support the development of IL and reflective learning. The assessment
interventions (Table 17.1, A-G) were designed to:

      · increase awareness of IL competencies,
      · focus on the research and writing process,
      · provide opportunities for formative feedback,
      · scaffold the development of IL competencies across the four year program,
      · encourage wider and deeper reading of quality sources,
      · promote the importance of clear, concise academic writing,
      · encourage increased reflection on learning,
      · create opportunities for collaborative learning.

    It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss all the interventions, but
three examples illustrate the innovative approaches developed to support stu-
dents' academic and information literacy.

    The first-year source justification task in Course 1-1 (see Appendix C) required
students to select five key sources for their essay, identify key points relevant to the
assignment question, and justify the selection of the source using quality indicators

                                                                                                 353
Feekery, Emerson, and Skyrme

such as credibility, currency, and authority. The task required students to reflect on
both source selection and personal learning. Students commented:

         I think that finally being assessed on your selection actually
         helped because it made me think that I am actually looking at
         the right material. (Focus Group, Course 1-1, 2011)

         No other lecturers have ever asked us to think about the
         sources we are using before. (Focus Group, Course 1-1, 2012)

    To reinforce the importance of selecting quality information and to encour-
age students to make connections between sources in the first year of study, the
information map (or imap--Emerson, Stevens & Muirhead, 2008; Walden &
Peacock, 2006) was added into Course 1-2 (see Appendix D and Figure 17.2).
The imap focused on key stages of the research process students often bypassed
in last-minute assignment completion and encouraged them to reflect on their
research process, thereby increasing students' awareness of IL competencies.

    Students identified significant values from the imap:

         For me what [the imap] does, I can improve my timings,
         because if I can do that for every assignment I can see where
         I spend quite a lot of time. . . . [and] maybe I can improve
         through time. At least for me it was really really useful because
         at the end what I saw from that was that I should have writ-
         ten about this, this, and this, and I thought actually I didn't.
         (Focus Group, Course 1-2, 2010)

    The second-year Professional Reading and Learning Log (see Appendix E)
then extended the importance of critical evaluation by requiring students to
find, read, and reflect on discipline-related aspects evident in their information
sources to connect classroom learning with real-world situations and research.
Students recognized the value of this task:

         It made me read more to do with Planning instead of just
         reading something and go, "Oh, that had Planning issues."
         [We have] to actually go, "What was the Planning issue? Tell
         me, explain it to me, give it to me in depth." So, I found that
         really helpful for understanding. (Focus Group, Course 2-2,
         2011)

    Faculty viewed the interventions as a valuable addition to the curriculum,
and they continue to modify and create new interventions to ensure students
have the opportunity to develop IL and engage with reflective learning.

         (Faculty Reflective Feedback, 2012)
    Student responses to the formative assessments were also largely positive;
they developed greater awareness of their research and writing processes and
valued the scaffolded support.
         There's probably so many things you do that are just a process
         and you can go through the motions without really thinking
         about it. But this does make you go back and kind of analyse
         it and what you are doing, so it has been helpful. (S1, Focus
         Group, Course 1-1, 2012)
         I think I am open to spending more time on research. I'm
         viewing it as more like and experience of something to gain,
         rather than, you know, bamming through it to write an essay.

The Research Focus or "What We Learned"

PAR was central to achieving change within the BRP and allowed participat-
ing faculty and the research team to learn from both successes and challenges
(McNiff, 2002), particularly when ideas that seemed ideal in theory were more
challenging to apply in practice. Throughout the research, we saw a significant
shift in the way participating faculty viewed their roles in developing key IL and
academic competencies:

         I hadn't consciously thought about [my responsibility to
         develop students' IL competencies] before becoming involved
         in the research and now I see that I have quite a clear respon-
         sibility in terms of their learning to teach them about IL, and
         how to be information literate, and how to actively incorpo-
         rate that into the lectures. (Faculty Meeting Notes, 2010)

    Although all participants engaged with the notion of learner-focused peda-
gogy (the ideal) as a result of our conversations, the constraints of faculty work-
loads, and the impact these have on faculty pedagogical development (the real-
ity), were apparent.

         The challenge for me . . . is to manage the demands on our time
         from changes to our courses to allow for new IL skills develop-
         ment. Aside from the initial "start-up" costs of the time involved in
         . . . re-design of assessment packages, there is the more significant
         demand associated with new, more labour-intensive forms of assess-
         ment. Any instructor has a finite amount of time for professional
         development, for marking, for delivery of course material. If more
         time is needed for IL skills development, even with "economies"
         that come from the use of technology, then other aspects of teach-
         ing may be compromised. (Faculty Reflective Feedback, 2011)

    As the research progressed, the value of conversation in facilitating change
led to the emergence of a 7th C of PAR--Conversation-driven. Conversation is
recognized as a valid method of data collection in PAR (Feldman, 1999; McNiff,
2002). However, in this research, it was the catalyst for initiating, promoting,
and facilitating the change we achieved, and was thus elevated beyond a data col-
lection method. If faculty had participated in solitary reflection characterized by
journal writing, the depth of negotiation, debate, and understanding inherent in
our conversations may not have occurred.

    Conversations in this research served numerous functions. Recorded conver-
sations during scheduled meetings about how IL instruction was perceived to be

356
                                                                       Supporting Academics to Embed IL

taking place were used to reflect on actions and design assessment modifications.
They helped identify ways faculty could amend their pedagogy or assessment
towards learner-focused pedagogies. Through conversation and observation,
problems identified by faculty provided opportunities for further investigation.
An example of this is the debate around the provision of course readings con-
nected to student independence:

         I refuse to provide [readings] in paper. . . . I say explicitly
         say it in my reading guide that these are what I have found
         is useful. While you are going through trying to find these
         things you just might actually find something even better or
         even more interesting on the way. And for God's sake at this
         stage it's 3rd and 4th year--we should be well past the nappy
         changing and spoon feeding stage. (Faculty Interview, 2011)

    Following this initial conversation, the participating instructor and the lead
researcher regularly debated the nature of independent learning and scaffolded
learning support, making reflection on effective teaching and learning a greater
part of the research.

    Each faculty member chose whether to adapt their teaching in response to
the conversations and reflection. If they chose to trial a new teaching style for
example, discussion of the outcomes helped determine if the intervention had
been successful. Informal conversations were important for relationship building
and further exploration of ideas around teaching and learning. Finally, conversa-
tions with students in focus groups helped determine the value of the interven-
tions in enhancing their IL competencies.

    Conversations revealed a lack of understanding of how students learn at uni-
versity and mismatches between faculty assumptions and the realities of student
experience. One significant mismatch concerned participating faculty's desire
for students to learn academic competencies independently by using university
learning support services, and students' limited use of such services.

         Instructor: I tend to think that students need to take more
         responsibility for using these generic services which I feel
         provide appropriate support for students from professionals.
         That leaves me free to focus on the course content. (Faculty
         Reflective Journal, Course 1-1, 2011)

         Student: I don't really go and get help. . . . I maybe look at
         [the text] a little bit and then [the online resources] but that
         would be it. I don't really go and ask other people. (Focus
         Group, Course 1-1, 2011)

IMPLICATIONS

Several implications identified in this research may contribute to the wider
understanding of effective ways to enhance students' IL development and sup-
port them to become informed learners.

    First, this research confirmed the notion that supporting students' IL devel-
opment relies on how faculty promote and develop IL within their curriculum.
Adopting learner-focused pedagogy may actively focus students on the research
process. Providing embedded IL development into content courses via formative
assessments may help students succeed in their transition into academic literacy
and understand how disciplinary knowledge is created. As the gap between high
school and university appears to be widening and more students seem unprepared
for the demands of higher education (Brabazon, 2007; Secker, 2011, van der Meer,
Jansen & Torenbeek, 2010), it is essential to provide explicit opportunities to sup-
port university transition into IL (Jansen & van der Meer, 2012; Weimer, 2003).

    Second, this research found that faculty who are introduced to holistic views
of IL can perceive a role for themselves in the development of disciplinary-­
focused IL development for their students. Furthermore, when explicit support
in designing learning tasks and assessments that facilitate IL development is
provided, student engagement in IL is improved.

    Third, this research confirmed collaboration as an effective means of teaching
IL. When faculty are pro-active in driving IL development, and embed IL devel-
opment with the support of librarians, students developed essential academic com-
petencies. While initial library instruction was important, further development
continued under the participating faculty's guidance, with a focus on the evaluation
of sources and their value to the discipline. This extended beyond first year as the
curriculum became more complex and specialized. To support faculty to actively
engage in designing IL initiatives, they needed to become aware of the centrality of
IL in learning and then be more pro-active in initiating collaboration with librar-
ians. They also benefitted from professional development around learner-focused
pedagogy to identify how IL could be effectively embedded into existing curricula.

    Finally, faculty need professional development to facilitate IL development
within the curriculum and assessment. In this research, such support was pro-
vided through building trusting relationships that facilitated in-depth conversa-
tion and reflection, and through research-focused professional development. We
saw a significant shift in the way faculty viewed their role in developing IL and
other essential academic competencies as they created explicit, developmental,
active-learning opportunities. This change in focus needs to be widely encour-
aged in higher education to enable students to become information literate in
a world of ever expanding information. To enable such a change, participating

faculty suggested more time is needed within workload allocations for profes-
sional development on teaching academic competencies alongside content.

    This research resulted in IL development being integrated into each year
of the BRP, but we recognize that supporting students' learning is an ongoing
process and more work remains to fully embed IL development throughout the
whole program. One year since the research phase ended, the interventions have
been maintained and modified as faculty become more confident in support-
ing IL development. Our conversations are ongoing as we continue to explore
effective ways to support students towards IL and informed, reflective learning.

What does 1.1  1/2-2/S210  43-46  First year I found them just like what you were
IL mean?                          talking about before, I was finding them like
(continued )                      the first kind of 5 things that were semi-related
                                  to the topic. But then through this year I have
                                  started to use more books but I still find article
                                  searching real tricky on the Massey website.

               3/2-2/S211  20-22  Yeah, yeah, I think you've covered it pretty
                                  well there; just searching for information
                                  and finding out what's relevant and how you
                                  incorporate that into you own academic work
                                  or yeah--that's what I sort of--you had a really
                                  long definition of it last time!

               4/2-2/S211  18-27  F: I guess how we make use of information
                                  researching--yeah, research how [ ] in journals
                                  and [ ] library yes?
                                  M: How support classes work, like that report
                                  writing one? I thought that was good.
                                  F: How we gather our resources for our projects
                                  and assignments and that sort of thing.
                                  M: Yeah, I've got nothing to add to that
                                  unfortunately.

How have 1.2   3/2-2/S211  31-36  Yeah, I tend to use journals like it's been
you learned                       accumulating a lot more that my use of journals
it so far?                        and my really specific academic literature has
                                  increased and it was quite noticeable and I
                                  find it's because like, it's you know I feel more
                                  comfortable being able to extract the informa-
                                  tion and use it properly rather than going `oh
                                  oh what does this actually mean?' and I'll stick
                                  to the basics. So I don't know, feeling more
                                  comfortable and stepping out and using the
                                  stuff like bigger range and everything.

               3/2-2/S211  66-69  I find that I get a bit of that in the feedback
                                  from the work we do and we're being told to
                                  evaluate sources--or that's implied--but there
                                  hasn't been any instruction really or anything
                                  to say `heh, for example, look at these two
                                  sources--how are they different' and stuff, not
                                  really--it hasn't really been driven home.

APPENDIX C: COURSE 1-1-SOURCE
JUSTIFICATION TASK INSTRUCTIONS

    You need to be able to justify why you chose to use or reject particular sources
for your essay, and show that you are starting to make connections between the
different types of sources you are using.

    You will need to choose 5 of your sources to complete this assessment, but
you should be considering all of your sources carefully.

    Pick one of each of the following source types to review:

      · Scholarly source
      · Government report/paper
      · News item
      · Popular source
      · Rejected source (of any of the source types above or other sources you

         may find)

    Sources 1 and 2 should be ones that you have selected to definitely use in
your essay. For 3 and 4, you may choose to use or reject the source, and explain
why. 5 is a source that you have definitely rejected for this essay.

    After you have done your search, I am also asking you to reflect on your
search process, and some of the successes and challenges you faced when finding
and evaluating your sources. This kind of thoughtful reflection is what helps you
learn and become a more successful student at university.

    REMEMBER: It is important that you always think carefully about the sources
you choose to use in your assessments at university.

    Reflecting on the Research Process

 a. What have you learned about the information searching process?
 Think about what you knew about searching before you came to university, and what you
 know now after having the library session and completing this assessment. You may have also
 had other experiences in other courses that have impacted on the way you think about infor-
 mation that you can mention here too.
 b. Describe your information search process for this essay assignment
 For example, where did you start; what different search tools did you use; how did you extend
 your search; where did you find your best sources? Did you go to Wikipedia to understand the
 topic and find some PDFs there? I want to see here how you searched and if there is a method
 to the madness!

                                                                                                 365

 c. What was the greatest challenge for you in finding and evaluating information sources
 to use in this essay?
 The challenges in searching are what we have to overcome to help make the process easier. For
 some of these challenges you can try to find solutions for yourself, but for others, you may
 need to get support from the librarians. The better you get at searching in first year, the easier
 life will be for the rest of your degree. These are skills that develop through trial and error and
 support. Knowing what challenges you have is the first step to overcoming them.

APPENDIX D: COURSE 1-1--IMAP INSTRUCTIONS

    In addition to the essay, you will also need to produce an imap. An imap "is
a way of recording the research stages of a project, focusing on the information
handling process. An imap logs such things as finding sources, reading and eval-
uating them, taking ownership of ideas, formulating a response or argument,
evaluating sources where appropriate, and building a bibliography, in a visual
account of the process" (Waldon and Peacock, 2008, p. 142, cited in Emerson,
Stevens and Muirhead, 2010). Information about the imap is on the following
page. Further instructions will also be given in class.

    The imap--An information map (imap) is a way of visually representing the
process of gathering information and developing ideas for any piece of writing.
It is a work in progress and should be created as you go, not at the end of the
process retrospectively.

    The imap will help you develop your IL skills. Making an imap will help you:

      · Distinguish between different types of sources
      · Identify the quality of your sources
      · Create a PROCESS for doing research (the process may not be lin-

         ear--you plan and revise and this is depicted in your imap)

    Your imap is your own creation. It should contain:
      · An early brainstorm--before the literature search
      · A description of your search process
      · A detailed description of your thoughts as you analyse your sources.
      · Your thesis statement ( may or may not include early and revised

APPENDIX E: COURSE 2-2--PROFESSIONAL
READING AND LEARNING LOG INSTRUCTIONS

    1. ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES
      · To enhance your ability to identify and evaluate planning information.
      · To increase your understanding of the relationship between informa-
         tion and the development of knowledge.

    2. THE PROFESSIONAL READING & LEARNING LOG
    The aim of the Log is to get you into the habit of reading not only the
material supplied as part of the course, but the many other sources of plan-
ning information. It is vital when you become a practicing planner that you
read the newspaper, either in print form or on the web, as this is an important
means of staying in touch with the community you are planning for. It also helps
you identify what their present concerns are. While books and articles are vital
information sources, radio and websites can also provide you with material on
a whole range of planning and planning-related issues. I have provided some
sources to get you started, but I do expect to see clear evidence that you have
located some sources yourself. Letters to the Editor and cartoons are also inter-
esting commentaries on planning issues.
    I will look at your Logs half way through the process to identify if you (as
an individual or the class as a whole) are having any problems with constructing
good thoughtful Logs. This should ensure that everyone `stays on task', has the
opportunity to get the best grade possible and is developing the skills and knowl-
edge that we hope you will gain from this exercise. Half of your marks will come
from the first assessment and half from the second.

                                                                                                 367

    3. THE TASK--A READING & WRITING LOG--PART I

    You are to assess 5 pieces of writing or oral productions that address a plan-
ning issue. These five pieces will include the following:

   1. An article from an academic journal which must not be an article which
       has been used on any other university paper you have completed or are
       presently enrolled on.

   2. A newspaper article selected from the list of articles that will be posted
       on Stream.

   3. An article from an edition of Planning Quarterly published between 2009
       and 2011.

   4. An item of your own choice provided it does not fall in the `Sources not
       to use' category.

   5. The interview of the Prime Minster John Key on the BBC programme
       Hard Talk. The You Tube link will be provided on Stream.

    With each of the articles or sources you have selected you must assess as
follows:

   1. Full, accurate APA reference
   2. A concise 5 line summary (in at least a 12 point font) highlighting the

       issues discussed in the text or programme.
   3. An identification of the planning issues that are being discussed,

        a. how and why these are planning issues and
        b. how plans and planners might respond to these issues.
   4. What you have written must be presented in well-constructed paragraphs
       and not in bullet points.

    PART II
    You are to assess 5 pieces of writing or oral productions that address a plan-
ning issue that you have not used in Part I. These five pieces will include the
following:

   1. Your choice from the three academic/professional articles and chapters
       that will be posted on Stream for your use.

   2. A newspaper article selected from the list of articles that will be posted
       on Steam.

   3. An article from an edition of Planning Quarterly published between 2009
       and 2011.

BUILDING CRITICAL
RESEARCHERS AND WRITERS
INCREMENTALLY: VITAL
PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN
FACULTY AND LIBRARIANS

      Alison S. Gregory and Betty L. McCall
      Lycoming College

INTRODUCTION

In the spring semester of 1988, a soon-to-be college graduate stared with fright at
her syllabus for the "Sociology Methods" course. It required a 25-30 page paper
on a topic of her choice. Nowhere in her college career had she been prepared
for such a task. Some 20 years later that same student found herself teaching a
sociology methods course at Lycoming College, a small, private, liberal arts and
sciences college, and looking for ways to prepare her soon-to-be college gradu-
ates for writing a similar paper, but in profoundly better ways. Thankfully, in the
intervening decades, a nationwide movement toward information literacy (IL)
had ensued. In 2000, the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL)
adopted the Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (IL
Standards). Through the IL Standards, IL is defined as the ability to recognize
and satisfy information needs efficiently, effectively, and ethically; while the IL
Standards were designed for higher education, they ultimately enabled the infor-
mation literate individual to be a lifelong learner.

    At Lycoming College, where the once-bewildered student became a profes-
sor, there was a distinct shift in the college's approach to IL. Instead of requir-
ing students to master the research methods of a discipline in one course, in
most disciplines, IL development began to occur progressively throughout the
sequences of courses leading up to the capstone requirements. The work to meet
the capstone methods requirements no longer begins in the eighth semester of
college; it begins in the first semester and builds skills along the way across all

Gregory and McCall

courses to ensure the development of IL. As Katt Blackwell-Starnes (Chapter 7,
this collection) notes, students are best served by developing IL proficiencies in
the preliminary research assignments of lower level courses that will better pre-
pare them for the formal research assignment in their capstone courses.

DEVELOPING IL PROFICIENCIES

Information literacy is best learned incrementally, moving from the relatively
straightforward ability to locate the full text of an article to the increasingly
subjective ability to evaluate sources for quality and relevance. The discovery
of a relevant research article for a paper is often the stopping point for many
students; they are satisfied with their research once they have the requisite num-
ber of sources in hand. Understanding how to critique the research, to evalu-
ate its appropriateness and quality, to utilize it to support or warrant further
research, and to include it appropriately in a paper is not learned (or taught) in
one fell swoop. Both librarians and faculty need to be cognizant of the fact that
information-­seeking and evaluation abilities need to "be developed over time
and [are] not a simple content or procedure that can be handed to students
during their first year and then neglected" (Gowler, 1995, p. 392).

    At the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, the library worked to scale
IL "sessions throughout the four year degree" in hopes of helping students to uti-
lize "their maturing education to developing more advanced IL skills over time"
(Harrison & Rourke, 2006, p. 602). This model allows IL to be more easily
"embedded into the curriculum" and allows the library to introduce "concepts
repeatedly and at an increasingly sophisticated level" over the course of the degree
(Harrison & Rourke, 2006, p. 602). At York University, also in Ontario, Can-
ada, Robert Kenedy and Vivienne Monty (2008) noted that not only should the
learning outcomes for library sessions progress incrementally with the students'
experience levels, but it is also important to teach the concepts of information
seeking, and not just the tools, with an emphasis on easily transferable skills.

A VERTICAL CURRICULUM--SCAFFOLDING IL

Because these abilities are best learned incrementally, including them vertically
throughout the curriculum is a logical step. While a horizontal curriculum indi-
cates the various academic subject areas a student takes during a given school
year, the vertical curriculum indicates the upward climb of skills, subject com-
prehension, and improved application of abilities that come with each new
step of the course or discipline. A vertical curriculum is deliberately designed
to increase mastery through small steps, with students encountering increasing

372
                                               Building Critical Researchers and Writers Incrementally

difficulty at each new level. Each step in the process, through repeated practice,
allows for refinement of the learner's knowledge. As students build expertise,
they broaden their aptitude for more intensive work.

    Another term for educational elements that conspicuously move students
from an entry level to an expert level is that of "scaffolding." Scaffolding can
be thought of as a "learning sequence" that can "help the student climb to
the desired educational goal or behavior," wherein the teacher "fades from the
learning situation" as the student climbs to ever higher levels of mastery (Calli-
son, 2001, p. 37). Librarians and faculty are the underlying structures working
together to support the construction of adeptness at IL, moving learners toward
stronger overall research skills. Well-designed scaffolding can help students to
see how a previously learned skill can be applied to new situations without
explicit instruction, making the student a more active participant in his or her
own learning (Callison, 2001). Including research competencies "gradually and
cumulatively" gives students a logical way of understanding library resources,
while providing them a view of research as "relevant and potentially useful in
other situations" (Gowler, 1995, p. 396). Rolf Norgaard and Caroline Sinkinson
(Chapter 1, this collection) note the importance of avoiding the "skills-oriented
`inoculation' approach to IL" because it can remove or obscure the contextual
basis for IL applications beyond the classroom. Norgaard and Sinkinson (Chap-
ter 1, this collection) also emphasize the importance of imparting IL abilities
broadly so that learners identify information competencies as being both trans-
ferable and relevant in contexts outside of academia.

IL CHALLENGES

The IL Standards, developed by the Association of College and Research Librar-
ies (ACRL) in 2000, have been the guiding principles for IL in colleges through-
out the country. Although the IL Standards provide a solid basis for the kinds of
information-seeking skills that undergraduate students ought to master, the IL
Standards were written by, and are almost exclusively used by, professional librar-
ians. One risk in discussing IL is the jargon the IL Standards use, which can limit
the appeal to educators outside of the library. Another risk is a confusion of what
computer or technology literacy is and what IL is--the two are not the same
and a student can be highly computer literate whilst being wholly "information
illiterate" (Kenedy & Monty, 2008, p. 91). Adopted in early 2015, the ACRL
Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education (Framework for IL),
seeks to address some of these challenges through threshold concepts that reflect
students' roles in knowledge creation, the increasingly complex dynamics of the
infosphere, and a growing emphasis on information ethics. The Framework for

                                                                                                 373
Gregory and McCall

IL allows for more individualized implementation of concepts, rather than using
fixed standards or skill sets.

    Concerning the first risk, that of terminology, a number of groups have
addressed the breadth and jargon typically associated with IL in an attempt to
make the concepts more accessible, and some accrediting bodies and state higher
education associations have created their own language and plans for incorporating
IL into higher education. The state of New Jersey, as an outgrowth of the Lampitt
Law that regulates requirements for students transferring from county community
colleges to four-year colleges and universities, created a task force of librarians to
develop a plan to standardize the information-seeking abilities that would accom-
pany the standardized transfer obligations; the resultant Information Literacy Pro-
gression Standards provide a two-tiered approach for the introductory/novice level
of skills and the gateway/developing level of skills (DaCosta & Dubicki, 2012).
New Jersey's Progression Standards, which align well with the new Framework
for IL language regarding novice learners and experts, are intended to denote "an
ongoing process" that are not "too context-specific" and can "be elaborated on
and further customized" (DaCosta & Dubicki, 2012, p. 619). Jacqui Weetman
DaCosta and Eleonora Dubicki concluded that, as a result of the collaboration
between librarians, faculty, and administrators, students not only have stronger IL
competencies for their academic work, but also that these "information seeking
and handling skills" better prepare them for the workplace (2012, p. 628).

    Addressing the second risk, that of confusing computer literacy with IL,
speaks to the need to teach students to use familiar technologies to identify
resources and to also apply IL proficiencies. Computer literacy commonly refers
to the ability to use a computer effectively for problem solving, to distinguish
between hardware and software, to use software programs, and to use the Internet
for information-g­ athering (Kershner, 2003). Because so many research resources
are available through online platforms, it is necessary to have some computer and
technological savvy in order to use the systems and databases for information
retrieval, and it is tempting to think that because "everything" is available online,
being able to access a web-based database and to retrieve the full-text of the source
is the equivalent of IL. College-level research, however, necessitates going beyond
the ability to retrieve search results. Information competencies are needed to eval-
uate search results, to determine which resources will best satisfy the information
need, and to use the sources ethically, appropriately, and intellectually.

COLLABORATING AND CUSTOMIZING IL

These risks of discussing and implementing IL become lessened to a great degree
with collaboration between librarians and faculty to establish consistent and

374
                                               Building Critical Researchers and Writers Incrementally

effective development of IL. Students benefit from building long-term relation-
ships with the library's human resources (Gowler, 1995) by way of working with a
librarian throughout the entire course of the major. The liberal arts college where
this particular collaboration took place is committed to excellence in teaching and
supports a strong collaborative library instruction program. Faculty are encour-
aged to work with librarians to design research and writing assignments that will
foster transferable lifelong abilities such as the ability to communicate effectively
and to think critically, and the ability to be research- and information-competent.

    To counteract the library-centric feel to the IL Standards, and to custom-
ize IL as we see it in a liberal arts environment, an ad hoc subcommittee of
the Faculty Library Advisory Committee (FLAC) at Lycoming College set forth
in 2006 to rearticulate the skills and abilities of the IL Standards into a more
faculty-friendly version. FLAC, comprised of seven faculty members, the pro-
vost, the chief information officer, and the director of library services, assists and
advises in the formulation of library policies and evaluation of services. Com-
mittee members promote better understanding of library concerns and needs
to other constituencies within the college. The ad hoc committee that created
the college's information standards was comprised of faculty members, guided
by documents the librarians provided, but the end result was written by and for
faculty members. The resultant guiding document of Research and Information
Competencies (RICs) was approved by the faculty in 2007 (see Appendix A);
since that time, individual academic departments have adapted the RICs to suit
their disciplinary research needs and goals.

    As is the case at North Harris College, a public community college, we want
students to leave library research sessions with "transferable strategies for finding
information" rather than situationally specific tasks, and we want students to
"think critically about the information" they discover (Dodgen et al., 2003, p.
28). In his description of the library's role in the general studies program at Berea
College, a small liberal arts college, Steve Gowler (1995) noted that an approach
of teaching transferable research capabilities allows librarians to be very targeted
in the library sessions because there is no need to "try to tell students everything
they need to know about the library in each class session" (p. 397). The Lycoming
College RICs statement, as included in the college's faculty handbook and noted
below, makes clear the campus expectation of incorporating these practices and
behaviors throughout the curriculum, both in the general education courses and
in the major-specific classes, building transferable information-seeking abilities
that lead to overall mastery without specifying the tools or resources.

         The Faculty of Lycoming College endorses a research and
         information competency commitment across the curriculum

                                                                                                 375

         that will enable Lycoming students to master the following
         skills: formulate and refine questions; acquire basic knowledge
         of where to begin the discovery process; know how, when and
         what kind of information defines effective research; synthe-
         size, format, cite and reconcile diverse information; evaluate
         the quality and sustainability of information; and differentiate
         between types of sources and the relevance of each. (Lycoming
         College, 2007)

IL WITHIN THE CURRICULUM

One academic department at Lycoming College that has worked to deliberately
incorporate the research and information competencies in an incremental and
progressive way into its curriculum is that of sociology-anthropology. The depart-
ment has devised its own learning outcomes related to information-s­ eeking skills
and behaviors, not dissimilar from the "Information Literacy Standards for
Anthropology and Sociology Students" from ALA/ACRL's Anthropology and
Sociology Section (2008), but written at a micro-level specific to the curriculum
and goals of the department.

    The focus of IL in sociology and anthropology is similar to other disciplines.
As established by the Anthropology and Sociology Section of ACRL, in collabo-
ration with the American Sociological Association, the disciplines have four spe-
cific standards: to know what kind of information is needed; to access needed
information effectively, efficiently, and ethically; to evaluate information and its
sources critically and incorporate selected information into knowledge base and
value system; and to use information effectively and ethically to accomplish a
specific purpose (ALA/ACRL/ANSS, 2008). The ability to create a plan for col-
lecting, synthesizing, and analyzing data is strongly tied to Lycoming College's
RICs statement and utilizes critical thinking skills to connect basic research com-
petencies to the original research students need to conduct through their course
sequence, and the information literacies are best learned incrementally, using
"sequential mastery of tasks from an elementary to an advanced level" (Proc-
tor, Wartho & Anderson, 2005, p. 159). The research competencies that stu-
dents need to be successful in the sociology-anthropology majors and minors are
mapped to specific course levels, and then are articulated within the individual
courses at each level, matching where possible to the department's learning goals.

    The sociology-anthropology department at Lycoming College offers a major
in sociology-anthropology, with concentrations in either anthropology or sociol-
ogy, as well as a major in medical sociology; it also offers three minors: sociol-
ogy, anthropology, and human services. All majors within the department must

376
                                               Building Critical Researchers and Writers Incrementally

take SOC 330 "Research Methods I" and SOC 430 "Research Methods II" as
their capstone experience. The end goal is for the students to conduct and write
about original research. The capstone project includes conducting a review of
the literature, selecting and describing at least one methodology, conducting the
research, describing the findings, and documenting the sources. The department
has explicit learning goals for its graduates:

      · Understand how race, class, gender and its intersection influences peo-
         ples' experiences within larger social institutions and across cultures.

      · Articulate empirical research questions and hypotheses and develop a
         logical plan of data collection and analyses to address such questions
         and hypotheses.

      · Create and deliver a professional presentation designed for a profes-
         sional audience using oral, written, and visual formats.

      · Hone effective critical thinking skills. (Lycoming College, n.d.)

    Based on these departmental goals, sociology professor Betty McCall created
scaffolded RICs goals for her courses and worked collaboratively with librarian
Alison Gregory to implement them:

      · 100-level courses: Find peer-reviewed articles; Identify components of
         research articles; Provide appropriate citation

      · 200-level courses: Evaluate appropriateness and quality of research
         articles; Effectively synthesize research articles to support or warrant
         further research

      · 300-level courses: Identify within research articles the connection
         between questions and theory; Develop unique and measurable
         research questions

      · 400-level courses: Synthesize a research question with appropriate
         methodology and theory to produce original research

APPLYING IL WITHIN COURSES

As part of the collaborative culture of the library, the faculty librarians at
Lycoming College offer a series of workshops in January of each year, just prior
to the beginning of the spring semester. Topics for the workshops vary, but in
2008, Alison Gregory, librarian, offered one such workshop on IL as related to
the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, as the college was in the
early stages of a reaccreditation process, and Betty McCall, sociology profes-
sor, attended the workshop. While the two had already been paired together

                                                                                                 377
Gregory and McCall

in library instruction sessions, this workshop was the beginning of a stronger
working relationship wherein a more deliberate approach to connecting content
learning goals to research competencies goals began, an outgrowth of the dis-
cussion IL related to Middle States and assessment. The partnership played to
the strengths of each--as a faculty member, McCall could be the subject expert
guide who could help students become more knowledgeable and independent
researchers, while as a librarian, Gregory could mentor students as they honed
their research abilities.

    Better integrating information-seeking competencies was one goal of the col-
laboration between McCall and Gregory. Another goal was to improve students'
critical thinking skills. While the two--information literacy and critical think-
ing--have a number of things in common, they are not identical. Evaluating
information and developing strong search strategies are "higher level cognitive
activities" built on critical thinking, and without those abilities a student's infor-
mation competencies will be limited (Albitz, 2007, p. 100). Because informa-
tion is reasonably tangible, IL is often taught as skills-based, while "reason, logic,
and assumptions are abstract concepts" and are categorized as the more theoret-
ical critical thinking abilities (Albitz, 2007, p. 101). The relationship between
the two is symbiotic, though; one cannot be information literate without critical
thinking skills, but one does not have to employ IL to think critically. This "dis-
connect between the definitions . . . foreshadows the differing opinions" over
whether it is the librarian or the faculty member who should be teaching these
"overlapping skill sets" (Albitz, 2007, p. 101), as is addressed by Lori Baker and
Pam Gladis (Chapter 16, this collection), through the term of "agency" in deter-
mining responsibility for teaching IL.

    In the experiences of McCall and Gregory, both faculty and librarians are
responsible for the meaningful inclusion of IL in higher education. This echoes
the experiences of Meggan D. Smith and Amy B. Dailey (2013) of Gettysburg
College (a small private college committed to the liberal arts), who found in
their faculty-librarian collaboration that students' IL expertise was significantly
improved by Smith and Dailey's careful joint planning, deliberate incorporation
of specific IL objectives, and the gradual introduction of the skills throughout
the semester. Joyce Lindstrom and Diana D. Shonrock (2006) also noted the
importance of bringing faculty and librarians together to integrate IL into pro-
grams in ways that truly bolster student learning and the development.

    McCall recognized the lack of information competencies within her stu-
dents not only at the introductory level, but also at the upper level courses.
The Lycoming College sociology-anthropology department has a two-course
research methods series that is the capstone experience. The first of the courses
(SOC 330) is utilized to teach students how to write a literature review and

378
                                               Building Critical Researchers and Writers Incrementally

to understand statistical analysis while the second methods course (SOC 430)
has students conducting their own original research. After several years of this
approach, student papers still demonstrated a lack of skills in finding good infor-
mation, and showed an inability to clearly address a research question while
considering the previous work in the field. Similar to what Karen Gocsik, Laura
R. Braunstein, and Cynthia E. Tobery (Chapter 8, this collection) note, though
students could organize the material to make it appear they knew what they were
writing about, it was clear that they were not able to create truly coherent knowl-
edge about their topics. McCall and Gregory determined that the best way to
assure that students were properly prepared for the methods course sequence
was to implement a vertical curriculum focusing on research and information
competencies across other courses within the major.

    Scaffolding assumes that one course leads into the next with a simple review
in the higher level course of the skills previously learned. The dilemma, however,
is that few of the 200- and 300- level sociology and anthropology courses have
prerequisites. In fact, a majority of the students in these courses have not had any
other sociology or anthropology course. So, to scaffold IL learning it almost had
to be done from the starting point for each course. McCall faced in her courses
what Gregory faced in her library sessions, teaching the same foundation mate-
rial for every class while attempting to build transferable research competencies.

    The collaborative efforts began in SOC 110 "Introduction to Sociology," the
gateway class into the major; enrollment is open to any student and the majority
of the students are non-sociology majors. The collaboration began by working
with the course assignments that McCall already had in place, but it left Gregory
trying to teach too many subject-specific databases during a single hour in the
library. The library workshops incorporated active learning whenever possible,
but the sessions were still very tool-oriented and did little to ask students to
think about source quality or how the resources they were finding fit together.
McCall and Gregory began to hone the assignments to bring in one element at
a time and developed an incremental project that required students to first deci-
pher a provided article to identify the common elements of a research article in
sociology. This exercise was completed, evaluated, and returned to the students
prior to a library session. For the library workshop, students identified a topic
of interest and were given basic instruction on how to obtain one research piece
on that topic. The assignment required students to "dissect" this article that they
located on their own, identifying and labeling the research article elements. On
the article deciphering worksheet (see Appendix B), students also had to cite
the articles using the American Sociological Association (ASA) style. There was
a hands-on activity during the library session to introduce students to the ASA
citation style, as none of the students had used this citation style previously.

                                                                                                 379
Gregory and McCall

    In stages, McCall and Gregory were able to move students from understand-
ing the basic elements of a research article, to being able to efficiently locate a
peer-­reviewed research piece, to noting the specifics of the research conducted in
the published piece, to properly attributing the source. Students were required to
identify the major components of the research article, including the author(s),
title, journal name, specific cited works in the article's literature review, research
question, methodology, dependent variable(s), key independent variables, statis-
tical analysis, findings, limitations, and conclusions. The students had to be able
to delineate qualitative and quantitative research. By focusing their attention (and
ours) on one or two elements of IL, rather than trying to cover everything a student
might need in the sociology major, we were able to make more meaningful con-
nections for the students as they took incremental steps toward becoming infor-
mation literate undergraduate students. By the end of the assignment, students
were able to locate peer-reviewed articles and identify specific components of the
research articles that would be the stepping stones for them to be able to include in
a literature review in later coursework. While McCall and Gregory's work was in
sociology classes, the practice of breaking research articles down into key elements
can be applied to any discipline, and is indeed similar to the experiences of Donna
Scheidt et al. (Chapter 10, this collection) who found in their collaborative work
with a first-year composition study that it is important to deliberately move learn-
ers from "information grabbing to purposeful reading and sense making," which
will improve the overall engagement with sources and thus one element of IL.

    Building on the article deciphering assignment, McCall's 200-level courses
require a short literature review. (Courses at the 200-level include "Introduction
to Human Services," "Race, Class, Gender and Sexuality," "Mental Health and Ill-
ness," and "Sociology of Aging.") Students are provided with a worksheet on iden-
tifying components of research articles and are encouraged to turn in the worksheet
with at least one of their selected articles for their literature review. The challenges
here are three-fold: students in the 200-level courses are not required to take the
100-level introductory course, the majority of the students taking these courses
are not sociology-anthropology majors, and, in order to provide the opportunity
for a wider array of students, there is no prerequisite in place. As a result, many of
the students taking the course have not yet mastered the IL know-how acquired
by those students who took the "Introduction to Sociology" course. The research
and library instruction by Gregory has some overlap, with the additional goal of
assisting students in finding information that is relevant to their topic and can
be synthesized well into a literature review. More often than not, in the authors'
experiences, students do not write a well-synthesized literature review because they
do not fully understand the research they have gathered for the review. McCall
and Gregory have found that asking students to master an understanding of the

380
                                               Building Critical Researchers and Writers Incrementally

components of the research piece helps them to better integrate the articles into
a well-designed literature review. For the 200-level courses, the outcome of the
students' work is a short 4-5 page literature review on a topic of their interest that
effectively integrates their new understandings of research competencies within
their writing. McCall has found that those students who have completed the
worksheet perform much better on the literature review. Students in any discipline
could benefit from practice in identifying elements of published research articles,
as these articles can then serve as models for students' own academic writing.

    This specific writing requirement is replicated in the 300-level course with an
additional caveat: students must develop an original research question as part of
their paper. This fits the Research as Inquiry element of the Framework for IL, as
students begin to develop the ability to identify research gaps and develop ques-
tions of appropriate scope. In the 200-level courses, the assignment is simply to
write a short literature review on a topic of their choice, so students find articles
that address that topic but do not necessarily answer a question they pose about
the topic. In the 300-level courses, which include "Medical Sociology" as well as
"American Immigration," students work to understand how to develop research
questions. The library workshop with Gregory is similar to the earlier sessions,
but the endeavor becomes very specific toward helping the students focus on
how researchers ask questions and how students can ask their own questions.
Students first complete the article deciphering worksheet for at least one arti-
cle of interest to them, then they are provided 10 articles selected by McCall
and Gregory; for each of these articles they must identify the research question.
These are confirmed in a classroom discussion and then the students work in
groups to brainstorm to generate other ideas for research questions that could
be asked given the topics of the articles. Students then create their own research
questions and write a short literature review based on that specific question.

    All of these individual course-specific assignments are aimed at building
research and information seeking abilities in order to successfully complete the
senior-level capstone course. The ultimate goal of the capstone course is for stu-
dents to be able to construct a research question, decipher what other research has
determined about that question, and then devise and implement a plan that allows
them to conduct their own research addressing their research question. This brings
students into the scholarly dialogue by asking them to contribute to the discipline
through these studies, which is one of the Framework for IL elements--"Scholar-
ship Is a Conversation"--wherein learners recognize the ongoing nature of schol-
arly research and also learn to contribute to it at an appropriate level. The work
involved in this endeavor is impossible to learn in one methods course; instead,
it is best to teach the steps of the process progressively throughout the earlier
departmental requirements. The partnership between the faculty and the library is

                                                                                                 381

essential for imparting IL skills in a manageable way. The collaborative approach,
between librarian and teaching faculty, works well in large part because "the faculty
member defines the assignments and the librarian fits and molds the resources into
the research process so that those assignments can be carried out, producing the
best possible results, performance is improved" (Kenedy & Monty, 2008, p. 96).
Regardless of subject matter, students can benefit from an incremental approach
to building their research and information-seeking competencies.

CONCLUSION

Improvement of student learning and performance was one of the goals of creat-
ing the IL Standards in 2000. The Framework for IL, with its conceptual "inter-
connected core concepts, with flexible options for implementation," will likely
impact how information literacies are integrated at this liberal arts college. The
Lycoming College's Faculty Library Advisory Committee will be tasked with revis-
iting the college's Research and Information Competencies statement to see if it
still aligns its goals with the broader aims of ACRL and with the core concepts of
the Framework for IL, and making revisions to the RICs statement as appropriate.
The Framework for IL places value on contextualization of authority, knowledge
creation, and research as an iterative process; this will align well with Lycoming
College's mission and philosophy of building a foundation through the liberal arts
that will lead to informed lives, and with the library's mission of fostering lifelong
learners. The sociology-anthropology department will also continue to look anew
at how the Framework for IL and the RICs can be best incorporated into its depart-
mental goals, and McCall and Gregory will continually reevaluate research-related
assignments to best meet the goals of both the department and the college.

    Through their collaboration, McCall and Gregory hoped to impart both the
broad concepts needed for thinking about information needs as well as the more
narrow skills specific to the discipline of sociology. Ever a work in progress, this
collaboration and the information competencies it strives to impart through a
vertical curriculum or scaffolding approach has allowed for more targeted infor-
mation literacy sessions, for immediate applicability to students' work, and for
stronger lifelong learning and information seeking abilities.

APPENDIX A: LYCOMING COLLEGE RESEARCH
AND INFORMATION COMPETENCIES

    The Faculty of Lycoming College endorses a research and information com-
petency commitment across the curriculum that will enable Lycoming students
to master the following skills:

         formulate and refine questions; acquire basic knowledge of
         where to begin the discovery process; know how, when and
         what kind of information defines effective research; synthe-
         size, format, cite and reconcile diverse information; evaluate
         the quality and sustainability of information; and differentiate
         between types of sources and the relevance of each.

    The goals of this curriculum-wide implementation of research and informa-
tion competencies are to develop students who do the following:

      · INQUIRE--Formulating and refining questions is a fundamental
         research skill. As a student's research advances, by adapting queries
         students can assess information more efficiently and effectively. Know-
         ing how to frame inquiries is critical to pursuing information with the
         appropriate resources.

      · NAVIGATE--Beyond the Internet and the World Wide Web,
         students should acquire some basic knowledge of where to begin the
         discovery process. Students should be able to employ a variety of
         information resources such as catalogs, indexes, and bibliographies in
         electronic and print formats.

                                               Building Critical Researchers and Writers Incrementally

      · FIND--Knowing how and when to access information defines effec-
         tive research. Often the inability to find data can be as frustrating as
         the overwhelming number of resources available.

      · ORGANIZE--Appropriately synthesizing, formatting, citing and
         reconciling diverse information is logically an essential step in the
         research process. Students should be vigilant in avoiding plagiarism.

      · REVIEW--Evaluating the quality and the suitability of information
         is what distinguishes legitimate research information competency.
         Students should be able to identify the place, context, and time in
         which the information was produced, the reliability and biases of the
         original source of the information, and whether the information has
         been reviewed by trustworthy referees.

      · MAKE DISTINCTIONS--Students should be able to differenti-
         ate between primary, secondary and tertiary literature and know the
         relevance of each. Aware of various print and electronic formats of
         information, students should be able to see the difference between
         peer-reviewed and popular literature. Students should be able to iden-
         tify trustworthy sources.

    The Faculty Library Advisory Committee (FLAC) is charged with gathering
information and assessing progress in implementing research and information
competencies.

INTRODUCTION

In the late 1990s, the Governor of Virginia charged a Blue Ribbon Commission
on Higher Education to make recommendations for the future of Virginia's pub-
lic four-year and two-year post-secondary institutions, with the goals of improv-
ing quality, affordability, and accountability. In its final report released in 2000,
the Commission recommended that the State Council of Higher Education for
Virginia (SCHEV) implement a Quality Assurance Plan that would define and
assess the core competencies that "every graduate of every Virginia college or
university regardless of major, can be expected to know and be able to do" and
that the core competencies should include "at least written communication,
mathematical analysis, scientific literacy, critical thinking, oral communication,
and technology" (Governor's Blue Ribbon Commission, 2000, p. 51).

    In response, the Chancellor of the Virginia Community College System
(VCCS) formed the VCCS Task Force on Assessing Core Competencies in
2002. The task force decided to define technology in terms of information liter-
acy (IL) "because of the long-standing emphasis at the colleges on assessing com-
puter competencies" (Virginia Community College System, 2002, p. 6). The
task force adopted the Association of College and Research Libraries' (ACRL)
Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (IL Standards)
(2000) and defined IL as "a set of abilities requiring individuals to recognize
when information is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use
effectively the needed information" (Association of College and Research Librar-
ies, 2000). This chapter's primary focus is on the IL Standards and does not
address the ACRL (2015) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Edu-
cation (Framework for IL). The Framework for IL was filed in its final form in

February 2015. In spring 2015 Reynolds librarians began review and discussion
of developing learning outcomes tied to the six IL frames.

    However, in the mid-1990s James Madison University (JMU) began devel-
opment of a Web-based platform for IL instruction titled Information-Seeking
Skills Test (ISST) (Cameron, Wise & Lottridge, 2007, p. 230). Also in the 1990s,
JMU began development of another Web-based IL application, Go for the Gold
(Cameron & Evans, n.d.). Both platforms were built on ACRL IL Standards. Go
for the Gold is composed of eight self-instruction modules with online exercises
that teach students to identify and locate library services and collection, employ
efficient search techniques with a variety of information sources, evaluate and
cite information sources, and apply appropriate ethical guidelines to the use of
the information. ISST is a Web-based test that is composed of 54 questions to
assess student information competencies as instructed in Go for the Gold. All
first year students at JMU were required to take both Go for the Gold and ISST
as part of the general education requirements (James Madison University Librar-
ies, n.d., para. 1). JMU used the assessment results in the Southern Association
of Colleges and Schools accreditation review and to meet system-wide goals set
by SCHEV (Cameron, Wise & Lottridge, 2007, p. 231).

    Because the information competencies assessed by JMU's ISST match that
of ACRL IL Standards, VCCS licensed ISST to comply with SCHEV's man-
date to assess IL competencies in 2003. VCCS established a score of 37 (out of
54) as indicating overall competency and 42 as highly competent. Each of the
23 VCCS community colleges developed their own testing plan. Nine colleges
chose to test graduates, six chose students in ENG 112, and eight chose one
or another of their courses that would involve students from varied programs.
System wide, a total of 3,678 students completed ISST. Among the test takers,
53.18% of VCCS-wide students and only 26.42% Reynolds students met or
exceeded the required standard (a score of 37 out of 54). Although VCCS devel-
oped a tutorial titled Connect for Success based on Go for the Gold to prepare
students for the test, most of Reynolds instructors and students were not aware
of the tutorial. Institutional librarians were not involved in the test planning
and implementation and there was no collaboration or communication between
faculty and librarians. These less-than-desirable results confirmed the fact that
the statewide charge for the IL competency assessment was not balanced by a
corresponding institutional mandate on how to develop, provide, and assess IL
competencies within the standard general education curriculum.

    Prior to 2003, only a handful of Reynolds faculty requested library instruc-
tion; these requests could not be made electronically and were limited to one
50-75 minute class period, with little room for student engagement. With
no uniform instructional guidelines available to them, librarians provided

                                                                           Impacting Information Literacy

instruction without guarantee of consistency among themselves. Additionally,
with no assessment activities in place, the efficacy of instruction could not be
appropriately evaluated. Reynolds students' low scores on the ISST assessment
coupled with inconsistency in IL instructional methods signaled the urgent need
to adopt a number of remedying measures. The measures included the following:

      · Development of library instruction packages based upon ACRL's IL
         Standards.

      · Dissemination of an online library instruction request form that
         included a list of packages and skill sets, allowing faculty to tailor
         instruction to their research assignments and also serving as a guide-
         line for consistency among librarians.

      · Training of librarians on the delivery of effective library instruction
      · Publication of a new marketing plan pertaining to the IL program:

         librarians presented at campus-wide meetings, emailed information to
         faculty, and used social networking media such as Facebook, Twitter,
         and blogs.
      · Implementation of assessment activities, such as multiple-choice
         quizzes within Blackboard and various student worksheets, enabling
         librarians and faculty to better evaluate student learning
      · Creation of research guides tailored to specific assignments, courses
         and subjects first through PBwiki in 2005 and then through Spring-
         share's LibGuides in 2009. Librarians used these guides during instruc-
         tion sessions and linked them to individual Blackboard course sites.
      · Development of a variety of open session workshops, enabling stu-
         dents to register and attend sessions on their own time.
      · Creation of an online tutorial in the form of seven modules based
         upon ACRL's IL Standards and titled Research at Reynolds Library
         (2015). This tutorial guides students through a complete research
         process from exploring topics and finding resources to evaluating and
         citing resources. Faculty choose to integrate all seven modules or select
         specific ones for their courses. Each module is accompanied by ten
         self-assessment questions, with the exception of Module Five, which
         includes seven questions.
      · Dedication of computer labs at two of the college's three libraries in
         which students receive hands-on experience during IL sessions.

    Although these remedies continue to evolve, most of the steps listed above
began to take effect in 2005 and remain in place. However, despite these many
efforts, Reynolds librarians still faced the same essential concerns: the absence of
a college mandate for the effective delivery of IL skills, the mapping of these skills

                                                                                                 389

within the general education curriculum, and the assessment of student learn-
ing. Complicating matters was the lack of coordinated collaboration between
librarians and faculty to align instructional resources with essential course out-
comes within specific areas of the general education curriculum.

Regional accrediting agency mandates to assess core IL skills (Saunders, 2007,
pp. 317-318; Saunders, 2008, p. 305), as well as academic institutions' con-
tinuing focus on assessment, presents libraries with an opportunity to play a
greater role in campus-wide assessment activities and contribute to student
success (Lewis, 2010, p. 74; Saunders, 2011, p. 21). Librarians that connect
their assessment plans to the mission and goals of their institution will be more
effective in presenting and communicating their achievements in the area of IL
(White & Blankenship, 2007, p. 108). According to Patricia Davitt Maughan
(2001), several critical reasons for assessing students' IL skills include developing
a core set of learning outcomes as a foundation for the IL program, assessing
the effectiveness of instructional methods, measuring student success within the
program, and communicating data results to faculty (p. 74).

    One way to address outcomes is to focus on existing outcomes as developed
by the Council of Writing Program Administrators (WPA). The WPA Out-
comes Statement for First-Year Composition (WPA OS), first published in 2000
and amended in 2008, includes five sections: Rhetorical Knowledge; Critical
Thinking, Reading, and Writing; Processes; Knowledge of Conventions; and
Composing in Electronic Environments. The most recent version of the WPA
OS was published in 2014; however, the English Department relevant to this
study developed Reynolds ENG 112 learning outcomes based on the amended
2008 version. This discussion will focus on the amended 2008 version with the
knowledge that a more recent version exists. For the purposes of this discussion,
the two sections on which we will focus are Critical Thinking, Reading, and
Writing (CTRW) and Composing in Electronic Environments (CEE). Both
of these sections address IL skills, with CTRW suggesting that students may
develop the following skills:

      · Use writing and reading for inquiry, learning, thinking, and
         communicating.

      · Understand a writing assignment as a series of tasks, including find-
         ing, evaluating, analyzing, and synthesizing appropriate primary and
         secondary sources.

      · Integrate their own ideas with those of others.
      · Understand the relationships among language, knowledge, and power.

    CEE suggests that students will develop the following skills:

      · Use electronic environments for drafting, reviewing, revising, editing,
         and sharing texts.

      · Locate, evaluate, organize, and use research material collected from
         electronic sources, including scholarly library databases; other official
         databases (e.g., federal government databases); and informal electronic
         networks and internet sources.

      · Understand and exploit the differences in the rhetorical strategies and
         in the affordances available for both print and electronic composing
         processes and texts. (WPA Outcomes Statement, 2008).

    Of importance here are the statements that focus on IL skills such as "find-
ing, evaluating, analyzing, and synthesizing appropriate primary and secondary
sources" and "[l]ocate, evaluate, organize, and use research material collected
from electronic sources, including scholarly library databases; other official data-
bases (e.g., federal government databases); and informal electronic networks and
internet sources" (WPA Outcomes Statement, 2008). As this literature review
establishes, existing research supports collaboration among librarians and faculty
when teaching IL skills, but a more specific approach that recognizes the value
of outcomes-based assessment will also integrate the WPA OS. For example, as
early as 1989 the University of Dayton revised its general education program to
include IL as part of its competency program (Wilhoit, 2013, pp. 124-125).
Outside of the U. S., the University of Sydney adopted the WPA OS to its
writing program, including IL as one of the five clusters on which it focused to
encourage growth and learning (Thomas, 2013, p. 170). The program estab-
lished three graduate attributes to include "scholarship, lifelong learning, and
global citizenship," breaking these down to five clusters to include "research and
inquiry; communication; information literacy; ethical, social and professional
understandings; and personal and intellectual autonomy" (Thomas, 2013, p.
170). Eastern Michigan University (EMU) also identified a need to connect
outcomes with IL. EMU developed a plan to integrate first-year composition
(FYC) outcomes with the IL Standards (ACRL, 2000), recognizing the need to
integrate key IL concepts with the research process into their first-year writing
program's research courses (Dunn, et al., 2013, pp. 218-220).

    Outcomes-based assessment is an effective means for evaluating writing pro-
grams; however, when planning for IL assessment, criteria guidelines should
weigh both the reliability and validity of a tool as well as the ease of administering

                                                                                                 391

the assessment (Walsh, 2009, p. 19). Megan Oakleaf (2008) provides a thorough
overview of three popular assessment methods including fixed-choice assess-
ments, performance assessments, and rubrics, and then charts the advantages
and disadvantages of each approach (pp. 233-253). For the purposes of this dis-
cussion, we will focus on fixed-choice assessments. The benefits of fixed-choice
assessments in the form of multiple-choice tests include ease of administration
and scoring, the ability to compare an individual's pre- and post-test results, and
the ability to evaluate results over time; however, one limitation of this method
is the difficulty in measuring higher level critical thinking skills (Oakleaf, 2008,
p. 236; Williams, 2000, p. 333). Another benefit is that pre- and post-test data
results can identify both student mastery of material covered in an instruction
session as well as areas of student weakness (Burkhardt, 2007, p. 25, 31). Addi-
tionally, pre- and post-test data can be compared over time to further refine
the library and IL curriculum (Burkhardt, 2007, p. 25, 28). Although bene-
fits to fixed-choice assessments are numerous, Kate Zoellner, Sue Samson, and
Samantha Hines' (2008) claims pertaining to pre- and post-a­ ssessment projects
suggest that there is little or no statistical difference or significance in assess-
ment results, which makes evident the need for continuing this "method to
strengthen its reliability as an assessment tool" (p. 371). For example, Brooklyn
College Library developed and administered pre- and post-quizzes within Black-
board for students in an introductory first-year composition course. Learning
management systems such as Blackboard have been adopted by most academic
institutions for well over a decade and have been used by many libraries as a
delivery platform for IL modules and assessments. Some of the advantages of
using Blackboard for IL include faculty and student familiarity with the system,
convenient 24/7 access for both on and off campus students, ease of creating
and revising assessment questions, automatic grading for faculty, and immedi-
ate assessment scoring and feedback for students (DaCosta & Jones, 2007, pp.
17-18; Henrich & Atterbury, 2012, pp. 167, 173; Knecht & Reid, 2009, pp.
2-3; Smale & Regalado, 2009, p. 146, 151). All students in this course attended
a library instruction session and completed a research paper assignment. Stu-
dents completed the pre-quiz before attending a library instruction session and
prior to completing their research paper assignment. Pre- and post-quiz results
revealed that although scores ranged widely, the majority of students improved
their scores on the post-quiz (Smale & Regalado, 2009, pp. 148-149).

    An important aspect of IL assessment is the level of faculty support and par-
ticipation in these efforts. Brooklyn College Library's positive outcomes confirm
collaboration is crucial to the success of library instruction programs and can
lead to a greater number of more effective programs (Buchanan, Luck & Jones,
2002, pp. 148-149; Fiegen, Cherry & Watson, 2002, pp. 308-309, 314-316;

392
                                                                           Impacting Information Literacy

Guillot, Stahr & Plaisance, 2005, pp. 242, 245). Over the years, academic
librarians have consistently discussed the important role they can play by part-
nering with teaching faculty to integrate library instruction programs into the
curriculum (Breivik & Gee, 1989; Mounce, 2010; Rader, 1975). However, an
effective cross-departmental collaboration requires that college administrators
and interdisciplinary committees communicate the importance of curricular
inclusion and implementation of IL (See Norgaard and Sinkinson in this collec-
tion). ACRL also recognizes collaboration as a major component in exemplary
IL programs (ACRL Best Practices, Category 6: Collaboration section, 2012).
As noted by Katherine Branch and Debra Gilchrist (1996), community college
libraries in particular "have a rich tradition of instructing students in library
use with the goal of increasing information literacy and lifelong learning" (p.
476). Librarians at J. Sargeant Reynolds Community College (Reynolds) have
long embraced this tradition, and over the years, have identified collaboration
between librarians and teaching faculty as the key element of a successful IL
program. Joan Lippincott (2000) notes that there are a variety of factors that
encourage success in cross-sector collaborative teams, including an eagerness
to work together to develop a common mission, an interest in learning more
about each other's expertise, and an appreciation for each other's professional
differences (p. 23). Many consider integrating IL into specific courses through
faculty-librarian collaboration the most effective way of improving the IL skills
of students (Arp, Woodard, Lindstrom & Shonrock, 2006, p. 20; Black, Crest
& Volland, 2001, p. 216; D'Angelo & Maid, 2004, p. 214, 216). While many
publications exist on collaborative IL instruction, examples of collaborative IL
assessment projects are limited (Jacobson & Mackey, 2007). However, the num-
ber of collaborative assessment case studies is growing, including Carol Perruso
Brown and Barbara Kingsley-Wilson (2010), Thomas P. Mackey and Trudi E.
Jacobsen (2010), Megan Oakleaf, Michelle S. Millet, and Leah Kraus (2011),
and Maureen J. Reed, Don Kinder, and Cecile Farnum (2007).

    Developing a curricular program that integrates IL skills suggests the potential
exists for students to retain these skills successfully. Evidence also exists to support
the targeting of first-year composition courses as an effective means for incorpo-
rating IL into the curriculum partly because first-year composition is traditionally
taken by all students (Barclay & Barclay, 1994, pp. 213-214). Michael Mounce
(2010) similarly focuses on IL collaboration, arguing that in the humanities,
librarians collaborate most frequently with writing instructors to integrate IL into
composition courses (p. 313). Additionally, Sue Samson and Kim Granath (2004)
describe a collaboration among librarians, writing instructors, and teaching assis-
tants at the University of Montana-Missoula. This collaborative effort focused
on integrating a library research component into randomly selected sections of

                                                                                                 393

first-year composition. Assessment results from the participating sections mod-
eled on a "teach the teacher" plan, confirm that writing instructors and teaching
assistants were effective in delivering IL instruction, with the added benefit of
familiarizing graduate students with the IL resources available to them (p. 150).

    Existing research on IL assessment efforts further substantiates faculty-­
librarian collaboration as critical to successfully integrating IL into the curric-
ulum. The literature also reveals that although IL assessment is important for
measuring students' skills, there is no consensus on the best assessment methods
or instruments to implement. The academic institutions examined in the liter-
ature pertaining to IL assessment developed unique assessment plans tailored
to their specific situation and student population. These examples establish the
framework for this study and from which Reynolds based its IL assessment prac-
tices. The following discussion of Reynolds' IL project serves as a model for
other institutions and expands the literature on IL assessment and collaboration
practices by examining the impact of embedding IL modules and assessments
into 22 first-year composition classes during the spring 2012 semester.

BREAKTHROUGHS IN COLLABORATION

Although instructional collaboration existed between librarians and faculty at
Reynolds prior to the assessment, it took the form of an informal and individu-
alized process. A major breakthrough in the development of a structured collab-
orative process occurred in 2008 when Reynolds developed and implemented a
campus-wide Quality Enhancement Plan (QEP) as a part of its accreditation reaf-
firmation process with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commis-
sion on Colleges (SACSCOC). While not directly related to the SCHEV Quality
Assurance Plan mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, the QEP expanded
the work the SCHEV plan began in 2000. The QEP targeted the improvement of
student success in online learning as its primary focus. The QEP's concentration on
faculty development and student support was designed to have a broad reach and
to impact student learning outcomes throughout the college. Because the college
does not have a discrete population of students and faculty involved only in online
learning, the designers of the plan were confident of its expanded impact; most
Reynolds students and faculty combine online learning with on-campus classes,
and thus resources migrate easily between the various course delivery options. Fur-
ther, the QEP Team identified IL, as well as other core student learning outcomes
for assessment within its broader plan to bridge multiple disciplines, including
Writing Studies, Information Technologies, and Student Development. Members
of the QEP Team, including librarians, college administrators, and faculty began
to discuss how to align IL instructional materials with identified course outcomes

                                                                           Impacting Information Literacy

with the following courses: College Composition, Information Technology Essen-
tials, and Student Development. With this impetus as its starting point, the college
has witnessed active, interdisciplinary collaboration in the area of IL instruction
and assessment; college librarians are no longer simply dependent upon individual
faculty requests for instruction and one-shot sessions.

    Within the Student Learning Outcomes Assessments (SLOA) subcommittee
of the QEP, librarians collaborated with both Writing Studies and Computer
Science faculty to incorporate the Research at Reynolds Library (2015) modules
into high-reach, high-impact courses within these disciplines. The modules con-
sist of the following sections: "Topics," "Types of Information," "Find Books,"
"Find Articles," "Use the Internet," "Evaluate Sources," and "Cite Sources."
In Information Technology Essentials (ITE) 115: Introduction to Computer
Applications and Concepts, faculty incorporated three of the seven modules into
all class sections: "Types of Information," "Find Articles," and "Use the Inter-
net." Librarians also began discussions with writing instructors on the inclusion
of all seven modules within first-year composition courses.

Development of the Collaborative
Instructional and Assessment Project

During many discussions focused upon IL assessment activities, Reynolds librar-
ians identified key guidelines for the development and delivery of content: 1) the
modules should cover core IL competency skills as identified by the ACRL and
SCHEV; 2) they should be comprehensive enough to cover a complete research
process and be flexible enough for instructors to disaggregate the modules and
incorporate them into different stages of their courses or their curricula; 3) the
research guides should be easy to evaluate by instructors and easy to revise by
librarians; 4) the modules should be delivered online in order to serve both
on-campus and online students; and finally, 5) the evaluation process should
offer ease in the administration of assessments and in the collection of data.
Reynolds librarians concurred that the seven Research at Reynolds Library (2015)
IL modules, along with their corresponding assessments, should be delivered
through Blackboard in order to meet these articulated guidelines. Blackboard
provided an efficient portal for all instructors and students to reach the modules
directly through their established course sites.

    With these essential guidelines in place, the Research at Reynolds Library
(2015) modules were developed using Springshare's LibGuides, a Web-based
content management system dedicated to improving students' learning experi-
ences. Skill sets covered in each of the seven modules are based on ACRL's IL
Standards, SCHEV standards, and the VCCS core competency standards for IL.

                                                                                                 395
Bensen, Woetzel, Wu, and Hashmi

Because of the features provided by the LibGuides technology, the new mod-
ules are much more dynamic and interactive than the ones they replaced. These
modules now include embedded videos, self-assessment activities, and user feed-
back options. Further, Reynolds librarians have found that they can create and
update the modules' content with great efficiency and that these modules receive
positive and enthusiastic responses from faculty. The modules cover the entire
research process and contain a number of tutorials to walk students through the
IL process. The content for each module is as follows:

   1. Module 1: "Topics" offers an overview of the research process and devel-
       oping a concept map to narrow focus for a research topic.

   2. Module 2: "Types of Information" includes videos and links that explain
       and describe the information cycle and types of sources and the differ-
       ences between scholarly and popular periodicals. Module 2 also clarifies
       publication dates to ensure currency and timeliness of sources.

   3. Module 3: "Find Books" offers tutorials in both video and alphabetic
       texts on how to find books using Reynolds' online library catalog and
       using electronic sources such as ebooks on EBSCOhost (formerly known
       as NetLibrary) and Safari. Module 3 also addresses how to request titles
       using WorldCat and Interlibrary Loan.

   4. Module 4: "Find Articles" includes videos that provide a general overview
       of how to search in library databases and a more specific tutorial of how
       to find articles in EBSCOhost databases. Module 4 also clarifies Boolean
       searching and locating full-text articles when Reynolds does not subscribe
       to a journal or does not have the full-text of an article. Additionally, Mod-
       ule 4 explains how to access databases when off-campus.

   5. Module 5: "Use the Internet" is a comprehensive discussion about search-
       ing via the World Wide Web and briefly addresses evaluating sources. It
       also makes a distinction between using subscription databases and the
       Internet when conducting scholarly research. Module 5 includes an effec-
       tive video that further discusses using search engines.

   6. Module 6: "Evaluate Sources" includes a video on evaluating sources and
       a helpful checklist for students to follow when evaluating sources--the
       checklist can easily be adapted to a handout. Module 6 also addresses
       Wikipedia, including an instructional video and a satirical view of wikis.

   7. Module 7: "Cite Sources" defines and clarifies what plagiarism is and
       the consequences of plagiarizing. Module 7 includes an instructional
       video and tips for avoiding plagiarism. Module 7's "Cite Sources" page
       addresses how to cite in MLA and APA, with helpful links, handouts, and
       worksheets on documentation and citing.

    As the discussion of consistent IL instruction within college composition
courses progressed, the SLOA subcommittee reached critical points of consen-
sus, agreeing that 1) the Research at Reynolds Library (2015) modules (rather
than other modules created outside of the college) were the ideal instructional
resource for Reynolds students; and 2) ENG 112 (the second semester college
composition course) was the ideal site for this instruction because the course
guides students through the research process and thus provides an effective cor-
responding context for the IL modules. The committee agreed that all seven
modules would be integrated within the composition course.

    Librarians developed a variety of multiple choice, true/false, and matching
questions that align with each module's content and that can be graded auto-
matically through Blackboard's testing tools. Librarians from both within and
outside of Reynolds reviewed all seven modules and each module's assessment
questions to provide feedback and evaluation. The modules and questions were
revised based upon these initial reviews. In addition to the assessment questions,
satisfaction survey questions were developed for each of the seven modules to
glean information on each module's user-friendliness and to improve the mod-
ules. Delivered through Google Docs, these satisfaction surveys are embedded
in each module and provide useful feedback from the perspectives of the student
users. Finally, a screencast video was developed using TechSmith's Camtasia Stu-
dio software, providing students with a welcome message that outlines the scope
and purpose of the Research at Reynolds Library (2015) modules; sharing with
them how to begin, navigate, and complete the modules; and encouraging them
to engage actively, rather than passively, with the various resources in order to
gain essential and useful skills in IL.

METHODS: COLLABORATIVE OVERVIEW

As the previous discussion establishes, Reynolds librarians and faculty worked
closely to improve the instruction of IL skills across the curriculum and within
disciplines, and have made great strides in providing an online platform to
deliver the Research at Reynolds Library (2015) modules to both on-campus and
online students. IL skills have indeed improved at Reynolds, yet challenges exist,
as Edward Freeman and Eileen Lynd-Balta (2010) confirm: "[p]roviding stu-
dents with meaningful opportunities to develop [IL] skills is a challenge across
disciplines" (p. 111). Despite this challenge, it is clear that providing sound IL
instruction occurs in the first-year composition classroom because such instruc-
tion is determined to be a vital component to general education (Freeman &
Lind-Balta, 2010, p.109). Collaborative efforts among Reynolds faculty and
staff further confirm that achieving a common set of goals "goes beyond the

                                                                                                 397

roles of our librarians, English professors, and writing center staff; therefore,
campus initiatives aimed at fostering information literacy collaboration are
imperative" (Freeman & Lynd-Balta, 2010, p. 111). Although not specifically a
campus-wide initiative, the Reynolds English Department has worked toward
developing learning outcomes for ENG 112 based on the WPA OS (2008). The
WPA OS suggests guidelines for implementing sound writing and composing
practices in the FYC classroom. The Reynolds IL study focused on developing
skills pertaining to "locat[ing], evaluat[ing], organiz[ing], and us[ing] research
material collected from electronic sources, including scholarly library databases;
other official databases (e.g., federal government databases); and informal elec-
tronic networks and internet sources" (WPA Outcomes Statement, 2008). These
skills are essential not only to the writing classroom but also to other disciplines
that expect students to arrive in their classrooms possessing skills to conduct
research with little assistance.

    During the fall 2011 semester, the English Department's assessment commit-
tee was charged with assessing how effectively ENG 112 aligns with the teaching
of IL. The QEP subcommittee recruited faculty from the writing Assessment
Committee to review the modules and offer feedback from a pedagogical per-
spective. The writing Assessment Committee chair mapped the seven modules
into the ENG 112 curriculum to provide participating faculty with guidance.
Additionally, the librarians asked a number of writing instructors to review the
seven library modules and to take the assessments from the perspective of a
current instructor for the purposes of preparing the modules for a pilot study
conducted in spring 2012. After offering feedback to Reynolds librarians and
after revising the modules, the QEP subcommittee also recruited students who
had successfully completed ENG 112 to review and pilot-test the modules and
provide feedback. Nine students agreed to participate, and six completed the
intense reviews of all seven modules successfully. Student volunteers evaluated
the modules on the information and materials in each module and then com-
pleted the self-assessments to see how well they had learned the material. They
then completed the feedback/satisfaction survey embedded at the end of each
module. Student feedback proved to be valuable, as they offered critical reviews
of the modules and the accompanying assessments from a student's perspective.

    After the initial review, receipt of feedback on the modules and consequent
revision process, the project organizers recruited a sufficient number of faculty
teaching ENG 112 to offer a broad spectrum of course delivery options across
three campuses. The committee determined the need for a treatment group that
agreed to integrate all seven modules and assessments into the course design and
a control group that did not integrate the modules in any way. The composition
of delivery formats for the treatment group is as follows:

398
                                                                           Impacting Information Literacy

      · Thirteen face-to-face sections
      · Two online sections
      · Four dual enrollment sections (college-level courses taught to high

         school students in a high school setting)
      · Three eight-week hybrid sections
      · Nine control sections

    In order to participate in the study, the treatment group faculty agreed to
integrate all seven modules and have students complete the pre- and post-tests
and the assessments associated with each module. In addition to a variety of
course delivery formats, the study included a wide representation across Reyn-
olds campuses to include 12 course sections on a suburban campus, four course
sections on an urban campus, two course sections on a rural campus, two course
sections in a virtual setting, and four course sections in a high school setting.

    The break-down of delivery for the control group included sections from the
urban and suburban campuses. The control group instructors agreed to admin-
ister the pre- and post-test assessments without integrating the seven modules.
They taught IL skills as they normally would to their individual sections. One
instructor within the control group integrated one face-to-face library instruc-
tional session for her course. The primary point to keep in mind is that the con-
trol group differed dramatically from the treatment group in that they did not
take advantage of the online library research guides; this distinguishing factor
becomes significant when comparing the results between the two groups.

    After recruiting study participants, extensive communications occurred to
introduce the project to faculty and to encourage continued participation, from
initial agreement to the project's completion. The committee provided support
and resources for:

      · understanding the ENG 112 Learning Outcomes;
      · revising course schedules to demonstrate effective integration of the modules;
      · raising awareness of which chapters and sections of the two textbooks

         in use at the time of the study corresponded with the Research at Reyn-
         olds Library (2015) modules;
      · understanding the technologies of how to integrate the IL Blackboard
         course into existing sections of ENG 112; and
      · submitting pre- and post-assessment scores to the QEP coordinator.

    Each participating instructor was enrolled in the Blackboard course "ENG
112 Information Literacy Project." Specific Blackboard training included:

      · Integration of pre- and post-tests
      · Integration of all seven modules

                                                                                                 399
Bensen, Woetzel, Wu, and Hashmi

      · Integration of all seven assessments
      · Integration of results into Blackboard's grade book

    Although most faculty at Reynolds have experience with Blackboard, the
more advanced functions in the grade book or the completion of a course copy
are often not familiar to all of them. Providing initial and ongoing technical sup-
port proved to be beneficial to the study and minimized frustration that often
occurs with technology. In-depth training within Blackboard's components and
specifically for the grade book was important to encourage accurate sharing of
data for analysis purposes.

DATA ANALYSIS: RESULTS OF THE ASSESSMENT

The collaborative effort on the part of writing instructors and librarians in both
instruction and assessment resulted in several important findings. Apart from
the research results themselves, however, the collaboration emphasized efficiency
and effectiveness in the broader assessment process. The development of clear
and specific course learning outcomes, combined with well-developed instruc-
tional resources and a solid, guided assessment process, resulted in impact upon
student learning. In significant ways, the assessment project highlighted essential
outcomes for both the librarian and faculty researchers: effectively communi-
cated strategies of assessment and a well-designed collaboration among a team
of researchers were critical to the development, implementation, and assessment
of teaching and learning.

    On a fundamental basis, the assessment confirmed that the second semester
composition course is an appropriate site for the instruction of IL skills. That
is, students of the institution enter ENG 112 with enough foundational knowl-
edge to serve as a building block upon which to develop their skills. At the same
time, they are not yet proficient enough in research skills to meet the challenge
of conducting and completing independent researched writing. Thus the insti-
tution's efforts in mapping its general education curricula within the areas of
IL were reinforced by the assessment; the results demonstrated that ENG 112
was an appropriate location for the introduction, development, and application
of research and research-supported learning activities. Within this foundational
course, students gain skills upon which subsequent courses and programs of
study can build and strengthen research and IL skills. Further, assessment results
also indicate that ENG 112 instructors are having solid and effective impact
upon student learning in the area of researched writing.

    Integration of the online Research at Reynolds Library (2015) modules proved
to be quite successful; results indicated a significant rise in scores from pre-test

to post-test in both the treatment and control groups. For example, Figure 19.1
depicts the rise in scores for a face-to-face class in which fifteen of the twenty-one
students enrolled in the course showed improvement between the pre- and post-
tests. Only three students showed little-to-no improvement and three others did
not take the post-test. Zero scores are indicative of students who either remained
in the class but did not take the post-test or students who took the pre-test but
withdrew from the class prior to taking the post-test.

    Although not quite as dramatic, Figures 19.2 and 19.3 also depict a marked
improvement from pre-test to post-test in an additional face-to-face section of
ENG 112 and in a distance learning section of the same course. In Figure 19.2,
nine students improved their rest results from pre-to post-test: One student
achieved the same results on both assessments, and four students attained lower
scores.

    Figure 19.3 highlights similar improvement in learning for distance learning stu-
dents. These results indicate that the IL modules impact student learning regardless
of the course delivery method. Although this course section experienced a lower
rate of post-test completion than the face-to face sections, the 14 students who did
complete the post-test all achieved scores that were higher than their pre-test results.

    Although the two summer sessions of ENG 112 that were incorporated within
the study had fewer students, the post-test results indicate that the majority of stu-
dents achieved higher results in the post-test, with only one scoring below his or her
pre-test results and six students achieving the same results on the pre- and post-tests.
Figures 19.4 and 19.5 illustrate the increase in scores between pre- and post-tests.

                                                                                                 401

    Figures 19.1 through 19.5 focus upon results within individual courses that

students in the control group also demonstrated improvement between the pre-
and the post-assessments. However, the students who had the added benefit
of the seven online modules demonstrated a greater impact upon their learn-
ing outcomes. These students, regardless of the course delivery format of ENG
112 (online, hybrid, dual, or traditional), experienced much higher results
within their post-assessment scores. Thus, while instructor-led efforts in the
areas of research strategies and IL certainly impacted student learning, student

engagement with the online, self-guided research modules yielded overall higher
post-test scores. These results indicate that the students within the treatment
group had developed research skills and identified effective research strategies
at a rate exceeding their counterparts within the control sections. Figure 19.6
highlights this attainment of learning for both groups of students:

    At pre-test time, the average scores of students in the control sections ver-
sus the treatment sections demonstrated no reliable difference between the two
groups. The students in the control group began at approximately the same level
as those in the treatment group. Overall, students scored an average of 93.41
points (SD=21.21 points). This score represents a typical score of about 62%
correct responses on the assessment survey. By the time of the post-test assess-
ment, both the treatment group and the control group had made significant
progress:

                      Figure 19.7. Results according to ethnicity.

      · The control group improved by 7.30 points, on average.
      · The treatment group improved by 20.15 points, on average.
    In other words, at the time of the post-test, the treatment group achieved a
solid level of competency in research skills, with an average score of 76% within
the post-assessment. The control group neared "competency," averaging 66% of
correct responses on the post-assessment.
    An unanticipated outcome of the assessment was the significant impact that
the African-American students within the assessment group. Figure 19.7 indi-
cates that at pre-test time, African-American students scored significantly lower
than White students. (The average scores of students self-classified as "Other"
indicate no reliable difference between "Other and White," or "Other and African-­
American.") By post-test time, however, African-American students' scores were
commensurate with the scores of "Other" students. The slope of learning repre-
senting the African-American students is steeper than the slope of the other two
groups. Further, the difference noted in slopes representing the learning and the
attainment of skills of the African-American students and the White students is
statistically significant.

                                                                                                 405

    African-American students began the semester scoring at an average of 55%
correct responses. By post-test, however, they were scoring approximately 69%
correct, which is commensurate with the 74% correct average for White stu-
dents and the 68% correct average for other students. By the end of the course,
all ethnicities within the assessed ENG 112 classes had made progress, but Afri-
can-American students had compensated for a significant initial disadvantage.
The results attest to the finding that a combination of instruction within ENG
112 and the online Research at Reynolds Library (2015) modules are helping to
level the playing field for African-American students, at least in terms of IL skills.

    In its final evaluation, the assessment results yielded several useful elements
of information:

      · ENG112 is having a direct and significant impact on student learning
         outcomes in the area of IL.

      · The integration of online library research guides within ENG 112
         results in even more significant gains for students in research skills.

      · African-American students begin ENG 112 with IL skills that are at
         a disadvantage when compared to White students and to students
         classified as "Other." However, African-American students make the
         most significant gain in learning by the end of a semester, surpass the
         "Other" category, and reach very close to "competency" level by time
         of post-test.

CONCLUDING COMMENTS

The study concluded at the end of the summer 2012 session with faculty sub-
mitting spreadsheets, indicating scores on both the pre- and post-tests from both
the spring 2012 semester and the summer 2012 session. Full integration of the
seven online modules along with assessment of each module reinforces twenty-f­irst
century IL skills based on the ACRL's IL Standards and that also conform to the
VCCS core competency standards. The results of the IL assessment at Reynolds
demonstrate that students who might initially be underperforming as they enter
ENG 112, will perform at equivalent or higher levels than their classmates. Not
only do such positive results suggest the success of the Research at Reynolds Library
(2015) modules, but they also suggest great potential for students to be success-
ful in upper-level courses within the community college system and in four-year
college and university systems. Although the data collected for this study do not
extend to students beyond a two-year college, researchers can conclude that stu-
dents who successfully complete the seven online library modules are more likely
to persist in college to achieve greater success in 200 level courses requiring the use
of IL skills based on 21st-century literacy practices. Clearly, reinforcing IL skills

is relevant to the first-year undergraduate curriculum because "[t]he ideal way to
produce fully capable graduates is to embed academic skills in the first-year cur-
riculum, then continue their application, reinforcement and further development
through the degree programme" (Gunn, Hearne & Sibthorpe, 2011, p. 1). These
same skills are likely to remain with them as they transfer to four-year colleges and
universities. The primary goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of
the online modules, but a perhaps secondary goal to be studied further is to deter-
mine how well students retain IL skills acquired through Reynolds as they move
on to 200 level courses within the community college system and beyond.

COLLABORATION IN A
FACULTY AND LIBRARIAN
COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE ON
INFORMATION LITERACY

INTRODUCTION

Why do students perform poorly on research assignments? How can librari-
ans and faculty best help their students develop confidence and competence
in finding and using information? Concerns like these led a number of faculty
and librarians at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI)
to form a community of practice, a voluntary group which met regularly to
investigate issues in effective teaching of information literacy (IL) and to pro-
pose solutions. Members began with disparate and sometimes conflicting ideas
about how to accomplish this goal, including how to quantify the goal in the
first place. Does student success equal accurate citation, use of scholarly sources,
or expeditious searches in academic databases? Or is it something more amor-
phous: that through practice and recursive steps, students finally get it and are
able to select and use disciplinary knowledge in ways that disciplinary experts
recognize as valid?

    The community members' struggles to understand each other and find com-
mon ground exemplify the larger problem that IL practitioners and stakeholders
are facing: reconciling one view, that IL is composed of discrete skills and com-
petencies with measurable outcomes, with an alternate view, that IL is comprised
of interconnected threshold concepts, where success is more difficult to identify.
To IL practitioners, these two points of view are represented by the Information

Kissel et al.

Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education (IL Standards) (ACRL,
2000), standards which are being superseded by the Framework for Information
Literacy for Higher Education (Framework for IL) (ACRL, 2015). Although the
IL Standards and the Framework for IL are familiar to most academic librarians,
faculty may find that defining, teaching, and assessing IL is puzzling or even
futile. Even if librarians thoroughly adopt the Framework for IL itself, "Each
library and its partners on campus will need to deploy [the] frames to best fit
their own situation" (ACRL, 2015). As a result, faculty/librarian cooperation in
teaching and promoting IL at the university level is crucial for student success.

    Collaboration is difficult, the members of the community of practice discov-
ered, as they worked through misunderstandings, assumptions, and territoriality
described in the case study presented later in this chapter. Individual faculty and
librarians, nonetheless, grew into a community by discussing their preconceived
notions, clarifying shared language, and agreeing to use assessment to investigate
current knowledge and to strategize future initiatives. The community of prac-
tice has forged a mutually supportive partnership promoting IL on the campus.
They have worked together to initiate assessments to discover the campus cli-
mate in relation to taking responsibility for IL, and they have sponsored profes-
sional development for both faculty and librarians at their home institution and
from other institutions across the state.

    The work of the community of practice is not yet complete. But this work
has opened a new conversation shared by librarians, faculty, and administra-
tion on the campus level, a conversation that will help lead students to become
confident users of the complicated contemporary world of information. The
experience of the community of practice at IUPUI demonstrates ways other
institutions can form campus-wide partnerships in order to embed IL into the
curriculum. Adding to previous literature about librarian and faculty collabora-
tion, this example of a community of practice model is useful because it shows
ways that faculty can partner with librarians in the teaching of IL.

LITERATURE REVIEW

How can librarian/faculty collaboration be bolstered, overcoming the barri-
ers and providing concerted action to improve IL acquisition for all students?
Although librarians may be familiar with the literature on student development
in IL concepts, many college faculty are not, since much of the IL literature comes
from library-related articles and presentations (Artman, Frisicaro-Pawlowski &
Monge, 2010, p. 95, and as noted by Norgaard & Sinkinson in this collection).
Faculty may not have heard about recent research describing students' actual
research practices, librarian-led assessments based on national standards, or even

debates about the place of IL in the curriculum. Faculty are also unlikely to
know that librarians sometimes see them as barriers impeding students' oppor-
tunities to learn appropriate IL practices. If collaboration between faculty and
librarians is crucial, significant collaboration may well mean reading each other's
literature in order to unpack assumptions and see more integral relationships
between disciplines and their dependence on IL.

    The IUPUI community of practice began meeting with most members
unaware of the concept of "community of practice" beyond its use on campus
as an organizing and naming tool. They also did not share the record of two
important literatures: studies of the attempts to bridge the librarian-faculty gap
and studies of the gap between students' perceptions of IL and the sense shared
among faculty and librarians that students don't practice IL very well. A brief
review will help to set the context for how the IUPUI community of practice
sought to address some of the issues that emerge in that record.

The Gap between Student Self-perception
and Faculty/Librarian Views

Faculty often observe that students have less developed research skills than they
need for success in college courses, and recent research investigates why. In sum,
students do find and use information, but they do not engage in the ways they
are using it to make meaning, with the result that they are overconfident in their
work, both in the context of courses and their imagined futures.

    Project Information Literacy, over a series of six national studies beginning in
2008, found that students brought high school research practices to college, and
that many continued to use the same routines and the same limited resources for
paper after paper (Head, 2013, p. 475). Not only do college students have dif-
ficulty finding manageable topics and locating and evaluating resources (Head,
2013, p. 474), they often don't use the resources effectively. For example, the
Citation Project examined papers of first-year writing students and found that
most writing from the sample failed to engage source texts in meaningful ways,
with 70% of the citations derived from the first two pages of a source and most
sources cited only once per paper (Jamieson & Howard, 2011). This superfi-
cial use of sources indicates the students may not understand the source ideas
well enough to integrate them within their own work. Similarly, the chapters
by Katt Blackwell-Starnes and by Miriam Laskin and Cynthia Haller (Chapter
11) describe how students tend to focus on the final product requirement for
a minimum number of references, using Google's first page results mechani-
cally to fulfill this requirement without knowing how to gauge the relationship
between the sources they cite or knowing how to fit them into ongoing scholarly

                                                                                                 413

discourse. They seem to be operating under the assumption that when IL mat-
ters, it will be evaluated only for its representation of a set of discreet skills.

    Adding to student confusion about finding and using sources is the increas-
ing amount of information available to students from the Internet. Students may
think they can evaluate web resources for reliability and authority, but another
study reveals participants used arbitrary and "highly subjective evaluation crite-
ria" (Wang & Arturo, 2005, as cited in Badke, 2012, p. 35). Furthermore, less
proficient students have high confidence in their own research skills (Gross &
Latham, 2009, p. 336, and in this collection, Blackwell-Starnes). College gradu-
ates who bring inexpert research skills to the workplace can frustrate employers
(Head, 2013, p. 476). The 2013 LEAP poll of employers conducted by Hart
Research Associates found that 70% of employers surveyed wanted universities
to place more emphasis on IL knowledge, including "evaluation of information
from multiple sources." Job skills which depend on finding and using informa-
tion have changed with the proliferation of media technology, as has the very
nature of information (Andretta, 2012, pp. 57-58).

    The independent, sophisticated, and ethical use of information marks college
students and graduates as competent and fluent, even if they are only emerging
as experts in a field. The issue that remains undecided in many institutions is
when, how, and from whom students are to learn the range of knowledge and
practices they need. Students like those interviewed by Melissa Gross and Don
Latham (2009, p. 344), who enter college with very little training, often regard
themselves as self-taught. Students also learn from peers, including those with
whom they have a prior relationship, and "from strangers who appear available
to talk and approachable" (Gross & Latham, 2009, p. 343). Some faculty may
think student self-instruction is sufficient, or that undergraduates should be able
to learn research skills and habits in the process of an assignment, with advice
from supervising faculty (McGuinness, 2006, p. 577). However, students who
actually do learn the research skills contained within the context of one assign-
ment may not see the transferability of those skills to another course (Saunders,
2013, p. 139).

    Where do the information professionals--librarians--fit in this picture?
Project Information Literacy found that students do not turn to libraries and
librarians very often (Head, 2013, p. 475). These findings point to several gaps:
the gap between student self-perception of their skills versus their actual abili-
ties, the gap between faculty goals for student accomplishment in research and
lack of faculty instruction to support that accomplishment, and the gap between
the availability of research knowledge from librarians and students' reluctance
to call upon librarians for assistance. These gaps lead to the questions of who
should teach IL and how it should be taught.

The Gap between Librarians and Faculty

Examples of partnerships between librarians and discipline faculty in library
journals to address those gaps are inspiring, but the successful ones are often the
work of pairs or small teams. Barbara D'Angelo and Barry Maid (2004) com-
ment that these efforts "are not sustainable" on a wider scale (p. 213). Examples
of campus-wide initiatives, on the other hand, like the IL assessment at Trinity
College (Oakleaf, Millet & Kraus, 2011), enjoy administrative support and wide
faculty buy-in, but these examples are much more rare. William Badke (2005)
summarizes: "The fact is, and the vast literature confirms it, effective [librari-
an-faculty] collaboration is simply not the norm" (p. 68). The conviction that
librarians and faculty share the responsibility for teaching IL is wide-spread,
arising from the common-sense idea that the best instruction occurs when stu-
dents put new knowledge and skills into repeated practice for relevant purposes.
However, real collaboration on IL instruction can be difficult to achieve because
of two persistent tensions.

    First, language can be an impediment to collaboration (Anthony, 2010, p.
84); even the term information literacy may confuse the uninitiated. Rolf Nor-
gaard and Caroline Sinkinson, in this collection, stress that a shared definition
of IL is "a prerequisite" to conversations between cross-disciplinary colleagues.
Norgaard has been pointing to this fundamental barrier to collaboration since
his two seminal articles in 2003 and 2004. In them, specifically referring to
the fields of IL and Writing Studies, he argues that the lack of familiarity of
one another's disciplines can result in misidentifying theoretical connections
and lead some to settle for seeing IL the same way that students seem to, as
a "neutral, discrete, context-free skill" (p. 125), where success is measured by
products, such as successful information searches and correct citation. Instead,
Norgaard defines IL in terms of practices that should be an integral part of the
writing process, helping writers to solve problems and make meaning through
their writing (p. 127). Similarly, Badke (2012) stresses the need for faculty to
teach research processes, so that students understand how disciplines identify
and use knowledge, learning "to do higher education disciplines, rather than
acquiring just what constitutes a discipline's knowledge base" (p. 93). To "do"
a discipline, he suggests, students must not merely parrot scholarly discourse,
but learn to participate in a scholarly conversation in the discipline. Faculty-­
librarian collaboration can help merge content and process within instruction
so that students learn how to think in their discipline and recognize themselves
as creators of knowledge and not merely consumers. The shift from viewing IL
as skill to viewing it as practice is unsettling for librarians and faculty, as well as
for the students they share.

                                                                                                 415
Kissel et al.

    Second, surveys of both faculty and librarians list some common and con-
flicting assumptions about each other's roles that impede effective instructional
partnerships. Librarians at times have perceived that faculty apathy, time con-
straints, or culture contribute to difficulties of collaboration. For example, librar-
ians may see faculty as territorial about their classes, limiting librarian access to
students (Julien & Given, 2003 and 2005, as cited in McGuinness, 2006, p.
574). On the other hand, faculty may view librarians themselves as territorial,
wishing "to retain ownership of information literacy" (Saunders, 2012, p. 227).
A related issue is status: Librarians may be suspicious of faculty who encroach
or miss the target when faculty seek to "integrate our [librarian] standardized
skills into their curriculum" (Gullikson, 2006, p. 584). In addition, some fac-
ulty may not want librarians to teach, thinking that librarians are not trained to
instruct, while other faculty may not see themselves as having any responsibility
for teaching IL (Saunders, 2013, p. 137).

A Model of Collaboration for Bridging the Gaps

Faculty and librarians alike desire to narrow the gap between their shared percep-
tion of students' IL and students' commonly held self-perception. The problem
that librarians and faculty both want to solve together is, however, embedded in
the problems of their relationship--partly caused by differences in language and
focus and partly created by their roles in the institution.

    One potential solution to overcome impediments to collaboration in an
institution is the community of practice model, which can develop from the
grass-roots level and can encourage wide-spread teamwork. The "Community of
Practice Design Guide" defines the term: "A community of practice is a group
of people who share a common concern, a set of problems, or interest in a
topic and who come together to fulfill both individual and group goals" (Cam-
bridge, Kaplan & Suter, 2005, p. 1). Communities of practice are used in busi-
nesses, government units, and other policy-driven endeavors, as well as in higher
education.

    A campus community of practice can cross disciplinary boundaries, expand
to include several members, operate on a small budget, and result in wide-spread
effects. Ongoing meetings help participants build trust as they discuss com-
mon concerns, create new knowledge about the focusing issue, and take action
through projects or products (Cambridge, Kaplan & Suter, 2005, p. 3). Natu-
rally there are negatives as well; interest in a community's work may wax and
wane, depending on the energy of individual members and the quality of the
volunteer leadership (Wenger, McDermott & Snyder, 2001). Communities also
have life cycles; sometimes the work sputters or a community disbands. How-
ever, a vital and growing community of practice can call campus-wide attention

to an issue and begin conversations to investigate causes, enlist other stakehold-
ers, and propose solutions. Such has been the experience of the Community of
Practice on Information Literacy at IUPUI.

COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE ON
INFORMATION LITERACY AT IUPUI

Background

IUPUI is a large, mostly non-residential, research university located in the heart
of Indianapolis. IUPUI has a high undergraduate enrollment (21,000 students)
as well as graduate and professional schools (8,000 students). The campus's com-
mitment to IL is explicitly incorporated in its foundational Principles of Under-
graduate Learning, which were adopted by faculty in 1998 and are consistently
used on syllabi across campus. The Principles are similar to the more recent
Essential Learning Outcomes of the Association of American Colleges and Uni-
versity's Liberal Education and America's Promise initiative. One outcome of the
first principle, Core Communication and Quantitative Skills, is that students
will be able to "make effective use of information resources and technology"
(Office of Student Data, Analysis, and Evaluation, 2008). As part of the campus
commitment to IL, a librarian is assigned to the instructional team of each first-
year seminar, reaching 90% of incoming first-time, full-time students in recent
years. However, nearly 40% of students earning bachelor degrees are transfer
students (Hansen, 2014), and no campus-wide program introduces them to
the library or to a librarian. Moreover, the university library does not offer a
centralized IL program. Responsibility for IL instruction often falls to individual
faculty and librarians, some of whom proactively work to instruct students in
research skills on an as-needed basis. However, even with the success of these
individual efforts, a needs assessment survey distributed in 2011 to faculty
teaching Gateway courses--those courses identified as having the highest num-
bers of first-time, full-time students--resulted in 95% of respondents agreeing
that IL and an introduction to the resources of the academic library were among
the most critical needs for their students (University College, 2012).

    Communities of practice have been used at IUPUI since 2000 (Chism, Lees
& Evenbeck, 2002, p. 39). IUPUI's communities of practice are organizational
structures used to emphasize collaborative learning and problem-solving and
to capitalize on the small group's work for the sake of the university's mission.
Other IUPUI communities have focused on concerns like retention of first-
year students, multicultural teaching, and critical thinking. These groups have
served as leaders and change agents at IUPUI, bringing attention to campus
needs, providing forums for public discussion, studying aspects of an identified

                                                                                                 417

problem, advocating best practices for solutions, and presenting and publishing
their findings.

    Currently, most campus community of practice groups are supported by the
Gateway to Graduation Program, which provides a small budget for materials or
speaker fees. Communities which receive Gateway support are expected to hold
regular discussion meetings focused on an issue pertinent to students in first-
year and gateway courses and to develop scholarly projects that enlarge the body
of knowledge about their central question, which then leads to development and
dissemination of best practices. The three aspects of the community of practice
model--discussion within the group, emphasis on scholarly inquiry, and dis-
semination of best practices--have been crucial to the formation and work of
the IUPUI Community of Practice on Information Literacy.

Development of the Community of Practice
on Information Literacy

One faculty member's search to address student needs led to the formation of the
Community of Practice on Information Literacy. Realizing that some of the best
seniors in her sociology capstone course lacked sufficient skills to find sources for
a final paper, Professor Patricia Wittberg was searching for solutions when she
attended a conference workshop called "Information Literacy: The Partnership
of Sociology Faculty and Social Science Librarians" (Caravello, Kain, Macicak,
Kuchi & Weiss, 2007). Wittberg then approached the campus director of writ-
ing, urging an "Information Literacy across the Curriculum" program. Prior
campus successes with communities of practice led the director to suggest that
Wittberg form a group focused on IL. The two solicited members, including
both faculty and librarians, and began meetings.

    One initiative undertaken by the community of practice in 2008 and 2009
was a pilot assessment of faculty teaching practices in courses that required
research assignments. The focus of this limited study was to identify classroom
strategies used to foster IL and to judge the relative success of the pedagogical
efforts. To that end, teachers of 14 classes in liberal arts, science, and business
disciplines who regularly included IL instruction in their classes were enlisted;
those instructors administered an in-class IL pre-test to their students. The pre-
test, which consisted of open-ended questions asking them to describe their
prior research experience, their methods of topic selection and development,
and their processes for finding and evaluating sources, was taken by 478 under-
graduate students. Results of the initial in-class surveys were coded by criteria
arranged in a matrix to measure levels of student success in research processes.
After evaluating the pre-tests, the researchers discovered that students' skills were

418
                                                                                           Bridging the Gaps

poorer than expected, with fewer than 25% reporting practices determined ade-
quate on the matrix. For example, 77% reported minimal, linear steps in topic
selection: "Pick topic, research, write paper." In naming the first source(s) they
used in research, 58% said they went to "the internet," "Google," "magazines,"
or the like, with no further elaboration. When asked how they judged the credi-
bility of online sources or of journal articles, fewer than one-fifth of the students
surveyed gave answers to these questions that were evaluated on the matrix as
"good." The pre-test was coded so that it could be matched with a post-test using
the same questions. The hope was that by comparing each student's answers at
the beginning and end of the semester, the researchers could identify promis-
ing pedagogical methods for teaching IL. However, the post-test results were
as abysmal as the pre-test scores; only the students enrolled in six sections of a
researched argument course showed any improvement, but their gains were not
statistically significant.

    Although the survey results were disappointing, these early efforts were
important, both for the development of the group as a cohesive community
and for campus partnerships about IL. Beginning with a community of prac-
tice model, the group developed a librarian-faculty collaboration different from
those seen on campus and in the literature. One of the differences was that faculty
initiated the outreach to librarians, and in so doing affirmed the value of IL as a
central issue to academics on our campus. Another difference was the size of the
group, which involved several faculty and librarians working together--small-
team relationships are the norm for faculty-librarian collaboration on the IUPUI
campus and in much of the IL literature. The initial foray into assessment was
also critical, as it shaped the group's understanding of inquiry as a process of
discovering how to ask the right questions. Therefore, the group committed to
further study and development of more effective pedagogical strategies, which
built the foundation for the next iteration of the community of practice.

Commitment to Dialogue, Scholarly Inquiry, and Dissemination

Because life cycles of communities of practice wax and wane, new members were
solicited to the community of practice in 2012 to reinvigorate the work of the
group. Those who answered the call for members included an equal number of
librarians and faculty. An interest survey indicated that participants were eager
to investigate a variety of issues, including their own IL pedagogy, teaching of
research practices in other disciplines across the curriculum, current and planned
library-sponsored initiatives, students' understanding of ethical use of intel-
lectual property, and ways faculty were currently collaborating with librarians
and using library services. Respondents also mentioned some hesitation about

                                                                                                 419

joining, with one librarian wondering why faculty were leading the group, and
an instructor admitting to fears that faculty voices would be lost with so many
librarian participants. Fifteen committed to the community of practice goals of
dialogue, emphasis on scholarly inquiry, and dissemination of best practices.

Dialogue

Although members found they had much in common in their desires to help
students achieve competence in IL, it is not surprising that fault lines began to
show up in early meetings. In fact, participants' discussions sometimes echoed
the barriers to collaboration mentioned in the library literature: who owns
IL? Who is responsible for teaching it? Why won't faculty give librarians more
access to their students? Why do librarians want to come to class? Are librarians
trained to teach? What use is a one-time library session, when IL needs stretch
across the semester? Facing these barriers with honest discussion was a positive
development for the community, as it helped members uncover assumptions.
Rhetorician Kenneth Bruffee "advises that partners undergo an examination of
assumptions. . .to avoid misperceptions, misunderstandings, and the like" (Bras-
ley, 2008, p. 73). Working through the assumptions and questions that caused
barriers, participants soon agreed on a foundational principle: all own IL and all
bear responsibility to teach it, with the goal of helping students to be successful
information users while they are learners at IUPUI and later, in their careers.

    As the group moved toward articulating common objectives and a plan of
work, they found that language was also a barrier. Bruffee's work emphasizes
"'shared language' as an essential part of the collaborative process in order to com-
municate fully and reach consensus" (Brasley, 2008, p. 73). To begin with, mem-
bers needed to figure out what all meant by the term information literacy. To do
so, they focused on the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL)
definition of IL as "a set of abilities requiring individuals to `recognize when infor-
mation is needed and have the ability to locate, evaluate, and use effectively the
needed information'" (ACRL, 2013). However, faculty from different disciplines
interpreted the phrase information literacy differently. What some found difficult
in that discussion was the meaning of literacy as part of the term. Is IL a set of skills
or a set of practices? These were differently problematized depending upon the role
each thought they played in relation to the ACRL definition--whether one asked
students to do something or taught them how to do it. Inevitably, members also
asked, "What is information?" How has technology changed the nature of infor-
mation and transformed information users and producers? Although the group
did not fully resolve the definition questions, they felt confident that a shared
understanding of what was at stake could now lead them toward learning what
they wanted to assess and to share with colleagues across the campus.

Self-assessment

To further solidify their shared understanding of the ACRL's conceptualization
of IL, both librarians and faculty agreed to participate in a pilot assessment
intended to ultimately shape questions and procedures for a campus-wide assess-
ment. In the process, faculty grappled with the five IL Standards, as well as
the 22 performance indicators and 87 student learning outcomes supporting
the standards. This study, an environmental scan led by the university library's
Instructional Services Council, asked participants to carefully examine one of
their courses by looking at all 87 outcomes. Faculty were asked to determine
whether they teach each outcome (i.e., in class, online, through assigned read-
ing, or through some other approach); whether the faculty member assesses the
outcome (either by direct or indirect measures); whether a librarian teaches or
assesses the outcome for that specific course; whether no one addresses it; or if
the outcome does not apply to the course. Since each outcome was included on
the survey instrument, taking the survey was time-intensive, a barrier to faculty
participation also noted by Gullikson (2008, p. 585), which ultimately led to a
more streamlined faculty survey instrument.

    The value of participation in the pilot study for faculty in the community
of practice was that the instrument forced reflection on their teaching practices,
which led to a clearer understanding of the scope of the ACRL IL Standards
and the interconnectedness of the IL practices with their own curriculum. The
actual results of the survey were controversial in group discussion. Faculty taught
or assessed 59.5% of the 87 outcomes, while librarians taught 2.5%. Was this
difference the result of faculty territoriality, denying librarians access to their stu-
dents? Were faculty teaching effectively? Were the IL Standards an effective way to
describe or to measure IL, or would the Framework for IL, then in draft mode, be
more helpful in understanding IL learning for IUPUI's students? The discussion
ultimately led to a greater development of trust within the community of prac-
tice, as it affirmed the importance of librarians' responsibility to teach the teachers
as well as the students--preparing faculty to address IL concerns in their own
courses. In fact, through dialogue, the community of practice became a support
system for one another with meetings as a safe place to share ideas and goals.

Campus-level Assessment

The pilot study using the ACRL IL Standards was part of a much broader ini-
tiative conducted by the library's Instructional Services Council and funded by
a grant from the campus Program Review and Assessment Committee. This
initiative intended to gather information on faculty collaboration, student
learning, and adherence to campus-wide assessment and evaluation initiatives

                                                                                                 421

because little historical information is available at the campus level. The purpose
of the initial assessments, according to the Instructional Services Council, was
to shape a more intentional IL instruction program at IUPUI and engage in
deeper, meaningful conversations about student learning outcomes and goals at
the class, course, and departmental levels.

    As previous researchers have discovered (Latham & Gross, 2012, p. 580,
and Blackwell-Starnes in this collection), students tend to rate their abilities to
find and evaluate information as higher than they really are. To conduct a cam-
pus-wide assessment of student perceptions of their IL knowledge, the library's
Instructional Services Council worked with IUPUI's Office of Institutional
Research to add questions to a biennial cross-campus assessment called the Con-
tinuing Student Satisfaction and Priorities Survey. Previous student surveys had
included minimal references to IL skills; for example, respondents were asked
how effective they felt they were at reading and understanding books, articles,
and instruction manuals, or how effectively they believed they could recognize
which ideas or materials need to be fully acknowledged to avoid plagiarizing
(Institutional Research Office, 2012).

    The expanded student survey was administered in spring 2013 to a ran-
domly selected group of IUPUI undergraduates, 22% of whom responded. Stu-
dent self-satisfaction with their IL abilities was high: about 9 out of 10 rated
themselves as effective or very effective at identifying sources of information
most appropriate for a project and at knowing how to acknowledge sources
to avoid plagiarism (Graunke, 2013, p. 2). More than 80% were confident in
their ability to distinguish between popular and scholarly sources, to choose
and evaluate relevant information for a specific assignment, and to use reference
materials appropriate to the discipline. Interestingly, although 92% claimed to
have visited the library, only 33% of respondents had attended a class taught
by librarians, only 21% had attended a library workshop, and fewer than 16%
had made an appointment with a librarian. Despite the lack of interaction with
actual librarians, 65% thought they were effective or very effective at finding
contact information for a subject librarian (Graunke, 2013, p. 3). These data,
although limited because they represent student self-ratings rather than actual
measurement of student knowledge, are valuable because understanding student
self-perception can shape new pedagogical approaches to improving informa-
tion use in papers and projects.

    Another campus-wide assessment collected data about faculty efforts to teach
IL by adding items to a faculty satisfaction survey. Agreeing that data collection
about faculty teaching of IL concepts was important, the Institutional Research
Office assisted community of practice members to select and refine questions,
which were then added to the 2015 version of the survey instrument. Although

the IL items on the faculty survey were companion items to those on the student
survey, faculty were asked, not about student competence, but about concepts
they teach in a typical class. The survey was sent to all campus faculty and had
an overall response rate of 43%. Results from the 795 respondents (excluding
teaching librarians from this analysis) showed that the majority do intentionally
teach IL concepts. The highest ranked items in the faculty survey were selecting
appropriate sources of information for a topic or question (67%) and recog-
nizing what constitutes plagiarism and how to avoid it (63%) (S. Lowe, per-
sonal communication, April 28, 2015). These items correspond with the highest
ranked items on the student self-satisfaction survey, at approximately 90% each
(Graunke, 2013, p. 2). The correlation suggests that students may be learn-
ing about IL concepts from faculty efforts. On the other hand, when students
reported the helpfulness of various entities in their development of IL, their
most helpful means of developing IL skills was self-instruction, a finding that is
widely echoed in library literature. On the campus level, this gap between what
faculty think they teach and how students believe they learn might be usefully
examined from an instructional design standpoint to uncover new practices.

    One of the benefits of the inclusion of IL concepts in both campus-wide
surveys is increased visibility of the need for IL instruction across departments
and schools. The survey also indicates a receptive attitude toward IL at the
institutional level; administrators are aware of the work and very interested
in the outcomes. Universities are feeling pressure from multiple stakeholders,
including state legislators and employers, to strengthen students' lifelong uses
of information. These goals are also emphasized in the Lumina Foundation's
Degree Qualifications Profile, in the Liberal Education and America's Prom-
ise campaign of the Association of American Colleges and Universities, and by
accrediting associations, including the Middle States Commission on Higher
Education (Mounce, 2010, p. 306). These documents are opening up new dis-
cussions about the shared work of educating citizens and about the conflicts,
not dissimilar to the conflicts faced by the community of practice at the outset,
that continue to call all stakeholders to negotiate the meanings of degrees and of
higher education itself.

Dissemination

Discussion within the community of practice about assessment resulted in an
action plan to increase student empowerment in the information world by enlist-
ing other faculty and librarians in this important endeavor. Two campus-wide
workshops have brought IL experts to IUPUI to share useful and relevant strat-
egies. After all, any plans created collaboratively by librarians and faculty must
still be operationalized in classrooms and course work, using measurable learning

                                                                                                 423

outcomes. Building those learning outcomes and incorporating IL pedagogy
in actual classroom work became the focus of the first hands-on workshop, led
by Anne Zald, Head of Educational Initiatives at the University of Las Vegas
libraries. Zald led a series of exercises scaffolded to allow participants to identify
IL learning outcomes in an assignment or activity, then to identify the criteria
for successful student work, and then to scale the criteria for grading. This first
workshop was a turning point for the community of practice, bringing increased
interest and energy from the campus to the community's work. Hosting a large
group of librarians and faculty in the same room, all using the same language and
sharing the same concerns, was remarkable, showing the inherent value of the
community of practice. The workshop was also a good recruitment tool, bringing
more members, which prompted a new phase in the community life cycle to con-
tinue the collaborative work of improving IL instruction across the curriculum.

    A second workshop in 2014 featuring William Badke, author of Teach-
ing Research Processes: The Faculty Role in the Development of Skilled Researchers
(2012), drew participants from six institutions in central and southern Indi-
ana. Badke's presentation emphasized that threshold concepts in a particular
discipline include its research processes, which should be taught as centrally as
the content of the discipline. Badke helped participants to understand the lit-
eracy issue inherent in the term information literacy, pointing out that the term
denotes more than just stand-alone skills--students must be brought into the
academic culture and into the cultures of their disciplines in order to learn the
habits of mind and practices that constitute information literacy. This second
workshop continued the transformative work of the community of practice,
bringing faculty and librarians together to investigate strategies to improve stu-
dents' command of research processes.

NEXT STEPS

Both workshops, Badke's and Zald's, while seemingly focused on the two dif-
ferent views of IL--the IL Standards view and the Framework for IL view--
shape the next steps for the Community of Practice on Information Literacy. As
Megan Oakleaf (2014) affirms in "A Roadmap for Assessing Student Learning
Using the New Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education,"
the threshold concepts identified as critical at the local level need to be "trans-
form[ed]" into learning outcomes so that the learning can be assessed (p. 512).
Oakleaf recommends that librarians seek agreement on outcomes with all stake-
holders involved in the particular learning situation (p. 512). For example, if a
librarian designs an IL outcome on the program level, those who administer and
instruct in the program should also agree on the outcome. IUPUI librarians and

faculty in the community of practice are eager to explore the potential for the
Framework for IL to shape new understandings of teaching and learning IL in
Indianapolis.

    Another next step for the community of practice is analysis and dissemina-
tion of the student and faculty survey results. For the first time, the IUPUI cam-
pus has data about student perceptions of their own skills at finding, evaluating,
using, and citing sources, and corresponding data about faculty efforts to teach
IL. This collected data should be shared with stakeholders and followed up with
more targeted inquiry as the community of practice pursues its inquiry into
best pedagogical practices. Another plan for dissemination is to add to an exist-
ing online collection of sample assignments and teaching strategies that have
worked well on IUPUI's campus.

    At IUPUI, the Community of Practice on Information Literacy brought
librarians, faculty, and administrators together to promote IL engagement.
While the work is far from finished, the community continues to evolve, adding
points of focus as individual members bring their own classroom experiences
and research interests into the collaboration. Perhaps the most valuable benefit
of the community of practice is the transformation of the pedagogy of individual
members who, with increasing confidence, can facilitate real growth in students'
information-using behaviors.

CONCLUSION

Other chapters in this volume have highlighted the need for conversation
between librarians and disciplinary faculty, conversations that can lead to col-
laboration for the benefit of students. (See Scheidt et al., Norgaard & Sinkin-
son, Feekery, Emerson & Skyrme, and Bensen, Woetzel, Wu & Hashmi in this
collection, for examples.) The community of practice model could be valuable
for other institutions, helping to open up conversations about students' needs,
instructional roles, and strategies for learning. Since group members determine
the work to be conducted, the community of practice model can fit varying local
situations. A community of practice can jump-start ideas, turning them into
action, and it can lead the way to real discovery and real professional develop-
ment, in the end, closing instructional gaps and benefitting students.

AFTERWORD

      Trudi E. Jacobson
      University at Albany

I am honored to have been asked to write the afterword for this important
volume. We are at a time when the world of information possibilities has
exploded--not just the resources available to us, which are overwhelming and
often daunting, but also the roles each one of us can play in creating, collabo-
rating, sharing, and disseminating information. As academics, these roles tend
to come naturally. Our facility in engaging with information in our own fields
coincides with our abilities to create and share other forms of information, and
to use less traditional modes of dissemination. We may write letters to the editors
of periodicals. We may contribute reflective posts on social media, be it tweets
or via professional or personal-interest blogs, or contribute reviews--product,
hotel, or restaurant--to help others. We understand the need for varying for-
mats of information creation and modes of information dissemination to suit
specific purposes and to reach varying audiences.

    The variety of information-related roles is outlined in the outer ring of Figure
A.1.

Figure A.1. The Metaliterate Learner (Mackey & Jacobson, 2014).

    These roles are now open to almost everyone, but many do not see them-
selves as information producers and distributors nor as teachers or translators of
information. Even if our students are actually engaging in these activities, they
may not recognize the full potential of what they are able to do.

    When students post online, for example, they don't see this as a reflection,
often a lasting one, of themselves. Rather than understanding that they are
shaping an online persona, they might see their utterances as disconnected and
effect-neutral. And for those who do not feel comfortable participating, it leads
to a loss of unique voices and perspectives in online communities. Educators
have the opportunity, indeed duty, to introduce these roles to our students, and
information literacy (IL) is a powerful player in these conversations.

    As this collaborative collection epitomizes, IL is a shared responsibility. No
longer do we consider IL to be a simple set of discrete skills connected with
finding and evaluating information. Two of the themes discussed in this vol-
ume, metaliteracy and the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy for Higher
Education (Framework for IL) (which was itself influenced by metaliteracy) are
extending beyond and opening new vistas in the field. While the ideas encom-
passed by both of these constructs are not entirely new, each provides its own
cohesive lens that opens up exciting opportunities for thinking about and teach-
ing IL. The overlap between metaliteracy and the Framework for IL allows them
to support and enhance each other.

    Both metaliteracy and the Framework for IL address multiple domains
(metacognitive, cognitive, behavioral, and affective), providing a rich scope for
learning activities. As reflected in the chapters in this collection, educators are
identifying potent opportunities to empower learners, and in the process, we
also learn from our students. The fertile ground provided by this environment is
reflected in the chapters you have just read. As you did so, you probably imag-
ined how you might alter this piece, and tweak that, and add a dash of this, and
end up with something very exciting to try out on your own campus.

    As educators, we may be animated by the possibilities, but crucially, how
do students respond? Section IV's chapters describe collaborative pedagogical
techniques used by their author teams. The frame Scholarship as Conversation
is highlighted in the first chapter in Section III, Miriam Laskin's and Cyn-
thia Haller's "Up the Mountain without a Trail: Helping Students Use Source
Networks to Find Their Way." In my own classroom I have seen that concepts
critical to IL, such as this one, engage students once they understand how they
relate to their academic and non-academic needs. In one of my upper-level
undergraduate courses, teams of students wrestled with Scholarship as Con-
versation individually and through discussion, including reflecting on associ-
ated dispositions. In order to assess their grasp of the core ideas, a team-based

culminating project asked them to develop a lesson plan to introduce low-
er-level undergraduates to this frame. The lesson plan needed to include an
activity and a final project for these hypothetical students to complete. I was
amazed with the teams' responses to this challenge, which included a 30-min-
ute deadline. Their work indicated that they had grasped the core ideas con-
tained within the frame. In addition, the students saw themselves in new roles:
those of information producer and teacher. These outcomes highlight the fun-
damental difference between teaching students basic skills and introducing
them to core concepts in the field. But teaching on this higher level requires
more than just the one class period often allotted to a librarian. Collaboration
in this endeavor is crucial.

    The discussion about who is responsible for IL instruction is long-standing
and ongoing. When the topic of the instruction was library research skills, it
was clear that librarians played the key role. But IL goes far beyond library
research, as is evident in the chapters in this volume. Its scope is expansive; the
need permeates life, both on campus and off, as well as on and off the job. With
the conceptions of IL as a metaliteracy, and the core concepts espoused by the
Framework for IL, it becomes clear that teaching and modeling information-­
literate competencies is a challenge that needs to be undertaken by all educators.

    I applaud the vision expressed in the Introduction: "we hoped that a collec-
tion that bridged the disciplinary divide would advance the notion of shared
responsibility and accountability for IL." Conversations such as the ones that this
book will initiate are vital in making IL a strong component of higher education.
Give and take will be important: librarians and disciplinary faculty members will
each have contributions to share, and things to learn. The terms and framing
may differ, but there will be much common ground. As Caroline Sinkinson says
in her chapter with Rolf Norgaard, citing Barabara Fister: we "need to trust one
another and have a sense of shared ownership." Norgaard and Sinkinson are dis-
cussing collaborations between librarians and Rhetoric and Writing Instructors,
but Fister's advice is pertinent for all such initiatives. The issue of language and
ownership are addressed in Susan Brown and Janice R. Walker's "Information
Literacy Preparation of Pre-Service and Graduate Educators" (chapter 13).

    The material in this book has engaged you with the new ideas, new theories,
and new terminology, introduced through metaliteracy and the Framework for
IL, and also through the collaborations described in some of the chapters. This
willingness to grapple with the new is critical in moving IL forward, and I call
upon you to serve as advocates for these new theories and ideas. Your adapta-
tion of these concepts will in turn motivate and inspire others both in your
own field, as well as outside it. Please share your enthusiasms, your insights,
and your experiences.

                                                                                                 431
Jacobson

    And please do so with your students as well. Provide the scaffolding they
might need, but let them struggle with the nuances of the ideas and understand-
ings that lead to the concepts and the resulting competencies.

    I was struck by something that Barbara Fister said during her keynote pre-
sentation for librarians at the 2015 Librarian's Information Literacy Annual
Conference (LILAC) in Newcastle, UK. She talked about the liminal space
that precedes crossing the threshold for each concept in the Framework for IL,
and the worry that librarians, in desiring to be helpful, will attempt to move
learners over the threshold without their having a chance to really wrestle with
the understandings they need to master. Let them flounder a bit--we all did
when we first encountered these key concepts. The nature of threshold concepts
is that it is hard to remember what or how we thought before we crossed the
threshold. This is what I took away from one of her points during her talk. In
looking for the source, to make sure my memory was accurate, I found her
exact wording:

         What really caught my imagination was their focus on identi-
         fying those moments when students make a significant break-
         through in their understanding, a breakthrough that changes
         the relationship they have with information. If we know what
         those moments are, we can think about how our teaching
         practices can either help students work toward those moments
         of insight or perhaps inadvertently hinder them by describing
         a simple step by step process that defuses troublesomeness to
         make it more manageable (Fister, 2015).

    Fister was referring to a 2013 Library Orientation Exchange (LOEX) pre-
sentation by Lori Townsend and Amy Hofer (see http://www.loexconference.
org/2013/sessions.html#townsend). Not coincidentally, Townsend was a mem-
ber of the ACRL task force that developed the new Framework for IL.

    I highly encourage you to read the text of Fister's talk, "The Liminal Library,"
which she has generously provided online (Fister, 2015) She touches on many
of the themes included in this collection, including students, collaboration,
language, the changing nature and definition of IL including metaliteracy, the
movement from the IL Standards to the Framework for IL, and more.

    This is an exciting time to explore and to teach information literacy/metaliter-
acy. The authors whose work is collected in this volume have conveyed that energy.
It is now your turn to add to the increasing dynamism in the field. And wouldn't
you like to share that excitement with a partner from another discipline?

INFORMATION LITERACY

This collection brings together scholarship and pedagogy from multiple perspec-
tives and disciplines, offering nuanced and complex perspectives on Information
Literacy in the second decade of the 21st century. Taking as a starting point the
concerns that prompted the Association of College & Research Libraries (ACRL)
to review the Information Literacy Standards for Higher Education and develop
the Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education (2015), the chap-
ters in this collection consider six frameworks that place students in the role of
both consumer and producer of information within today's collaborative infor-
mation environments. Contributors respond directly or indirectly to the work of
the ACRL, providing a bridge between past/current knowledge and the future
and advancing the notion that faculty, librarians, administrators, and external
stakeholders share responsibility and accountability for the teaching, learning,
and research of Information Literacy.

Barbara J. D'Angelo is Clinical Associate Professor of Technical Communication
at Arizona State University and Graduate Advisor for the MS in Technical Com-
munication Program. Sandra Jamieson is Professor of English and Director of
Writing Across the Curriculum at Drew University, where she teaches first-year
writing and writing studies and pedagogy courses at the undergraduate and grad-
uate level. Barry Maid is Professor and Founding Head of the Technical Com-
munication Program at Arizona State University. Janice R. Walker is Professor of
Writing and Linguistics and Chair of the Institutional Review Board at Georgia
Southern University.
