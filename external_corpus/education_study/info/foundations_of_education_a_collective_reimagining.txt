Introduction

   Dear students, colleagues, and readers,
   As we delve into the pages of this comprehensive history of education textbook, we are honored to introduce
a work that not only chronicles the evolution of educational systems but also sheds light on the contemporary
challenges that our students confront. Our journey through the annals of education is not just a recounting of
facts, but an exploration of the transformative power of knowledge and the intricacies of a system that shapes
societies and individuals alike.
   Education has always been a dynamic force, adapting to the changing needs of societies and the aspirations
of individuals. In the pursuit of knowledge, students have always been at the center, eager to unravel the
mysteries of the world and better themselves in the process. However, the modern landscape of education
presents us with both opportunities and obstacles that warrant thoughtful consideration.
   One pressing concern faced by our students today is the soaring cost of textbooks. As educators, we recognize
that the availability of resources is vital to the learning process. The burden imposed by exorbitant textbook
prices can hinder students' ability to access essential learning materials, potentially limiting their academic
success. This textbook, in its digital form, aims to contribute to the solution by embracing electronic formats
that are more accessible and affordable. Through this choice, we hope to ease the financial strain on our
students and foster a more inclusive learning environment. We must be mindful that the digital divide still
persists, and not all students have equal access to technology. As we celebrate the advantages of e-books, let
us also advocate for equitable distribution of resources, ensuring that all students can harness the potential of
digital learning.
   Our exploration of the history of education would be incomplete without addressing the disparities that
plague the American educational landscape. The United States, a land of diversity and opportunity, has
unfortunately witnessed the perpetuation of inequities within its education system. The disparities in funding,
resources, and educational quality have deep-rooted implications, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage that
hinder social mobility. It is incumbent upon us, as educators and scholars, to raise awareness of these issues and
advocate for meaningful reforms that strive for a more just and equitable education system for all.
   Furthermore, the restriction of curriculum in certain states within the U.S. is a topic that cannot be ignored.
Education, often considered a pillar of societal progress, should encourage critical thinking, diverse
perspectives, and open discourse. Yet, the imposition of rigid curricular limitations stifles creativity and narrows
the educational experience. This textbook serves as a testament to the importance of exploring a broad range
of topics, fostering intellectual curiosity, and nurturing a generation of learners who are unafraid to question
and explore.
   This textbook is not a mere compilation of historical facts, but an invitation to critically examine the
multifaceted dimensions of education. As we turn its pages, let us reflect on the challenges our students face,
from financial burdens to the digital divide and educational inequalities. Let us acknowledge the immense
potential of electronic resources while advocating for their widespread accessibility. And let us remain steadfast
in our commitment to a more inclusive, equitable, and intellectually enriching education system.
   This has not been a small undertaking- and while we did not write this text from scratch, we spent hundreds
of hours across a two-year period to create an open and applicable textbook which we hope better meets the
needs of our students. Creating an Open Educational Resource (OER) text is a fluid process, involving many
months of writing and re-writing, and critical collaboration amongst colleagues.
   We are especially grateful to the following OER Foundations of Education textbooks for their original work in
the following texts:

                                                                                                                                                                    Introduction | 1

We recognize the enormous amount of work that went into these OER texts. Thanks to their having created
the original OER texts, we had the great privilege to build on their work and offer newer texts for our students.
Other future authors may additionally recreate a text for their students as this is the iterative process of creating
OER texts and for this open creative academic process, we are immensely grateful.

   We also wish to acknowledge Amy Hofer, Jen Klaudinyi, and all the library staff across the state who support
and promote OER through workshops and grants. This is a critical equity initiative which increases access for all,
and notably historically-underserved communities across the state. It also allows everyday teachers and faculty
to engage in textbook creation, and this is no small feat.

   We could not have published this OER if it was not for our amazing readers: Andreina Velasco, Dot McElhone,
Nadia Raza, Hugo Nava- Sanchez, Gabe Hunter-Bernstein, Lorraine Adams and Pam Morse. We are grateful
for their thoughtful comments during the writing and rewriting process. Last, but not least, a huge thanks to
Jennifer Margolis for reviewing the entire text at the end. Your thoughtful feedback helped us to make this a
better textbook!

   Sincerely,
   Tanya, Kanoe, Lisa and Ceci

1. Why Teach?

          "One of the lessons that I grew up with was to always stay true to yourself and never let what
       somebody else says distracts you from your goals. And so when I hear about negative and false
       attacks, I really don't invest any energy in them, because I know who I am."

          Michelle Obama (personal communication, May 31, 2017)

          · Understand the role of reflection in teaching practice

In this chapter, we will begin to peer behind the scenes of what it means to be a teacher in the United States.
We'll walk through a day in the life of a teacher, break down what is involved to become a teacher, and close
with characteristics of effective teachers.

1.1 A Day in the Life

To get started, let's drop into four different classrooms to get a feel for a day in the life of an elementary teacher,
a secondary (high school) teacher, a special education teacher and an immersion/bilingual teacher. In the
following situations, imagine what it might be like to be a teacher in each setting.

Elementary Perspective

   The school doors open at 7 AM, and you greet
children as they enter the cafeteria for breakfast.
Once morning duty is over, you hurry to your
classroom to await the 25 students that will come
filing in momentarily. You make sure materials and
directions for tasks are ready and calming music is
playing. As students enter, you gather signed forms
and respond to notes from families, help students
with their morning activities, take attendance, and
hold a morning meeting. The rest of the day, you are
simultaneously teaching the content areas-English,
math, science and social studies-and social skills as
students navigate group work and friendships. Image 1.2
Various other educators drop in throughout the day:
the reading specialist to work with a group of readers who need extra support, the occupational therapist to
help a student with some motor skills still developing, the speech pathologist to help students with articulation
and language development, the instructional coach and sometimes the principal to give you feedback on your
instruction.

   A day in the life of an elementary educator could involve students collaborating to create products of learning.
   Pauses throughout the day from the busy pace of classroom life include related arts, where students go to
learn about music, visual art, library, P.E., and more while you meet with your grade level for team planning; and
lunch and recess, which involve scarfing down your lunch while getting your students through the lunch line,
figuring out who changed their lunch choice or left their lunch at home, opening mustard packets, reminding
students to eat while they talk with friends, and hopefully scuttling off to check your school mailbox and take a
bathroom break. After a post-recess water break, you return to classroom instruction, with a few interruptions
for students leaving early for doctor's appointments, a student needing to go to the nurse's office, another
teacher popping in to borrow a book, or sometimes even a whole-school assembly for a class play or anti-
bullying program.

4 | Why Teach?
   When it is time to pack up for the day at 2:30, you make sure all students know how they are getting home
that day, have their materials packed and ready to go, and then you bid them farewell at the door with a hug,
high-five, or handshake as they head to their dismissal area. Once your room is empty, you go to monitor a
dismissal area to make sure everyone is safe. After school, you might have a faculty meeting, a debrief with
an instructional coach based on today's observation, or time to prepare tomorrow's instructional materials. You
marvel at how quickly yet another day has passed in the life of an elementary school teacher.

Bilingual - Immersion Perspective

                                         You are a Kindergarten Spanish immersion teacher.

                                         The model you follow in your school is called 90/10

                                         which means you teach 90% of the day in Spanish

                                         and 10% of the day in English. This model includes

                                         students who are native Spanish speakers and

                                         students who speak other languages. As a

                                         kindergarten teacher you would like to develop units

                                         of study ahead of time and plan the steps students

                                         will follow to achieve their learning goal. This will allow

                                         you to be prepared and for students to have a

                                         predictable routine and learning structures. You will

                                         also like to start early in the morning so that you can

Image 1.3                                work and focus on your lessons before staff and
                                         students arrive. The reason behind this is that after a

day with kindergarteners, you will be exhausted and will not have the energy to plan and prepare for the

following day. Therefore, think about this time for you to be on track and get ready for the day.

Students arrive and get their breakfast in the cafeteria where you pick them up. Since this is your first contact

with students, you can greet them, and their families, and ask questions such as "how was your afternoon

yesterday?" and maybe follow up on stories they have told you the day before. Students enjoy telling you stories,

so this time is very valuable as you get to develop relationships with them. All of these conversations are held in

Spanish as this is the target language.

Once students are done with their breakfast, they clean up their tables, they go to the restroom and line up

to go to the classroom and start the learning. While students take turns going to the restroom, students play

games, such as riddles; students are encouraged to bring their own riddles. This is a fun time for students as

they get to laugh and guess, as some of the riddles, as you might know, are jokes as well. Students have the

opportunity to tell their jokes and riddles in their mother tongue as some of them are not easy to translate. You

can also take this time as an opportunity to develop language skills as well as critical thinking skills. In this class,

students are the leaders/teachers. There is a teacher helper who leads the morning activity with the help of the

teacher as well as the help of Susanita, the classroom puppet. You should see how much they love Susanita.

The rest of the day looks very similar to the one described in elementary. The only thing that varies, is that

students are immersed in the target language, which in this case is Spanish. You, as the teacher, need to

make sure students are not only learning reading, writing, science, math, etc., but are also learning the target

language as they develop their English skills during their language time. Being an immersion teacher is very

rewarding as you are encouraging and supporting students to be bilingual, biliterate and bicultural. This means

that when students are bilingual, they can speak two languages; biliterate means that students can read and

write in two languages; and bicultural means that students learn and appreciate their own culture and their

classmate's culture as well.

                                                                                                   Why Teach? | 5
Secondary Perspective

   The bell rings at 8:15 AM, but you've already been at
school for more than an hour-making copies,
checking emails, and writing the plans and goals for
the day on the board. As an English teacher, you've
decided to work on writing fluency during this year,
so as the students enter the classroom, they take out
their journals and begin responding to the prompt on
the board. Every day the class meets, the students will
write for five minutes and then briefly discuss their
responses with each other and as a whole group. You
write alongside them to model what it looks like, and

                                                                                              Image 1.4
often share your own writing-at the beginning of the
year, most of the students struggled to write for five straight minutes, but now nearly all of them have gotten
the hang of it. The rest of the lesson involves a mini lesson on figurative language, small group discussions
about students' literature circle books, and a whole group review game to prepare for the unit test on
Wednesday.

   The school adopted a block schedule last year, so your classes are 75 minutes long. You teach three of four
blocks each day; today is an A day, which means the first block is 9th grade honors and the other two are
10th grade general English. Tomorrow, you will teach two blocks of 9th grade general and one block of 10th
grade College Preparatory English. You hate these labels and what they do to the students in the room, and, as
department chair, you have been working with your principal to remove such rigid tracking.

   A day in the life of a high school teacher could involve guiding students in their work, as this English teacher
is doing.

   "Bear Block" falls between 1st and 2nd block, and ten students stream into the room to retake tests, make
up missed homework, or just hang out and read. You glance at the learning management system and see that
there are 45 essays waiting for you, but there won't be time to look more closely at them until later tonight.
During lunch, some of your journalism club students are in the room, partially working on stories and layouts,
but mostly sharing the latest news about their friends and acquaintances.

   For the Professional Learning Community (PLC) meeting during fourth block, you will meet with the other
10th grade English teachers to look at the results of a common assessment. At some schools in the district, the
grade-level teachers all teach the same lessons, but luckily at this school you have more freedom in how you
teach the material. There is a new teacher on the team who is struggling with classroom management, so the
first 15 minutes of the meeting is spent discussing some strategies that have worked in other teachers' rooms.

   The end of the day comes at 3:15 PM, but it will be another hour or two before you head home-there are
sub plans to finish for Thursday because you will be attending a district-wide training for working with English
Language Learners, and you are hoping to send at least ten texts and emails to parents. The initial fear of
parent contact faded quickly, and now it's one of your strengths-you reach out early and often, connecting with
families around student successes first. Later, if students begin struggling, contact is much more seamless. It's
been a long, exhausting day, but interacting with the students has made it all worth it.

6 | Why Teach?
Special Education Perspective

                               You arrive early in the morning, an hour or so before

                               teachers officially start the school day. You greet the

                               office manager, principal, and custodian on the way

                               to your classroom. Aside from these three, the

                               building will be mostly empty for another half hour.

                               You've found that this quiet morning time provides

                               the best opportunity to catch up on Individualized

                               Education Plan (IEP) paperwork, reflect on student

                               data from the prior day, and make adjustments to

                               instruction for the coming day. As the official start

                               time for the school day draws close, you make a quick

                               dash to the copy machine, fingers crossed that it isn't

                               broken and that there isn't a line of teachers anxiously

                               waiting their turn. It's your lucky day. Your last

                               photocopies shoot out of the machine just as the

Image 1.5                      overhead announcement calls teachers to report to

                               their morning duty stations. You quickly drop the

copies off in your classroom, pick up your data binder, and dash out the door to the bus loop.

The bus loop is a flurry of activity. You greet students with high-fives, occasional hugs, and countless

reminders to "use walking feet." Amid all of these informal greetings, you are slipping in some IEP services by

completing morning check-ins with several students who have behavioral or social-emotional goals on their

IEPs. From an outsider's view, these check-ins don't look that different from your interactions with any other

student. However, intermixed with those high-fives and hugs you quietly assess needs, remind students of the

goals they are working on, offer support where needed, and quickly make notes in your data binder. On this

particular day, a third grader with autism reports that he is feeling like "a category 3 hurricane." You know he

needs some quiet time before joining his homeroom class, so you walk him to the computer lab where he has

an open invitation to help the instructional technology specialist get the computer lab set up for the day.

The halls begin to clear as the instructional day begins. You spend the next six hours in constant motion,

serving 18 students across four grade levels. You transition between co-teaching in general education classes

and pulling small groups of students to your own classroom for intensive intervention in literacy, math, or

social skills. When co-teaching, your job is to supplement the general education teacher's deep knowledge of

grade-level content with specialized instructional strategies that make content meaningful and accessible for

students with disabilities and other learning differences. When providing intensive intervention, you implement

research-based programs that target specific skills identified in your students' IEPs. Data collection is on-going

and individualized for each student, so your trusty data binder is by your side in all settings.

Normally, you would end the school day completing check-outs with the same students you saw in the

morning. Today, you assign that responsibility to a teaching assistant so you can participate in a special

education eligibility meeting. It is the initial eligibility meeting for this student and her family. A team of

educators work with the parents to determine if the first grader has a disability and needs special education.

Her parents feel overwhelmed by the process and fearful when the team concludes that their daughter has an

intellectual disability. This is a moment when your job and your passion meet. You assure the parents that the

future is bright for their daughter, that the educational label does not change who she is or who she will be,

and that you will highlight her strengths and address her needs as you plan her education with them as equal

partners. The decisions that you will make with this family are new to them, but for you they are a familiar and

important part of your day as an elementary special education teacher.

                                                                                                  Why Teach? | 7
   The scenarios above describe some typical teaching days, but not all days are the same in teaching. In fact,
each one will be different in some way. Deciding to become a teacher is an exciting commitment to shaping
the future, and it is both demanding and rewarding. We will take a closer look at the teacher's purposes and
beliefs as we ask and reflect on what are the things that great teachers do differently.

1.2 Becoming a Teacher - Profile of Teachers Today

   The National Center for Educational Statistics
(NCES) collects data on various aspects of education,
one of which is the demographics of teachers and
students. In the 2020-21 school year, there were 3.8
million full- and part-time public school teachers,
including 1.9 million elementary teachers and 1.9
million secondary teachers. In 2020-21, of all public
school teachers, ninety percent held a regular or
standard state teaching certificate or advanced
professional certificates while fifty-one percent hold
masters degrees. In 2020-21, the average base salary
(in current 2020-21 dollars) for full-time public school Image 1.6
teachers was $61,600.10 While salaries differ across the
country, salary levels for teachers within states or school districts are often set based on teachers' years of
experience and education credentials (commonly referred to as "steps and lanes").

   Seventy-seven percent of public school teachers were female and 23 percent were male in 2020-21. In 2020-21,
the proportion of K-12 public school teachers who were White (80 percent) was significantly higher than the
proportion of K-12 public school students who were White (46 percent), whereas the proportion of teachers of
other racial/ethnic groups was lower than the proportion of students in those groups. For instance, 9 percent of
public school teachers were Hispanic, compared with 28 percent of public school students.

          In 2020-21, of all public school teachers,
            · 80 percent were White;
            · 9 percent were Hispanic;
            · 6 percent were Black;
            · 2 percent were Asian;
            · 2 percent were of Two or more races;
            · Less than 1 percent were American Indian/Alaska Native; and
            · Less than one-half of 1 percent were Pacific Islander.

     Stop and Investigate - Demographics

8 | Why Teach?
        Check out the demographics of teachers in your state or school district. How do they compare? Find
     the salary scale for teachers in your local school district. How does it compare?

The trends are clear: in the United States, we lack a racially and culturally diverse teaching force, and that trend
has not changed much in the past 20 years. While the 2020-2021 school year included more Hispanic, Asian,
and multi-racial teachers, teachers are still overwhelmingly White. In the same school year, however, students
who attended public schools were only 45% White (NCES, 2020b). That means that generally, there are more
White teachers and more students of color (Geiger, 2018). This trend is concerning, given that research shows
that having teachers of color benefits all students, not just students of color (Wells, Fox, & Cordova-Cobo, 2016).

Increasing Diversity of Teachers Today

There are many reasons why teachers in the United States are not racially diverse. While the U.S. Supreme
Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education demanded all schools integrate to address some of the
inequalities between separate schools for White and Black students, it did have other consequences that
directly impacted the diversity of teachers in the United States. Recent reviews of archival data estimate that
from 1964-1972, in 781 school districts across the south, 31.8% of Black teachers left the teaching profession
(Thompson, 2019). Some were pushed out of the profession while others migrated north to continue teaching.
Some Black teachers entered occupations which required lower skill levels. (Milner & Howard, 2004; Thompson,
2019). To make up for the loss, districts hired white teachers from both genders, who were new to the field or
who lacked training.

   Even though this historical antecedent did limit access to teaching jobs for Black people, racial discrimination
in the hiring process continues to compound this issue. D'Amico et al. (2017) found that despite equally-
qualified candidates applying for jobs in one large school district, White teacher candidates still received a
disproportionate number of job offers: of the 70% White applicants, 77% received job offers, while of the 13%
Black candidates, 6% received job offers (D'Amico, Pawlewicz, Earley, & McGeehan, 2017; Klein, 2017). Beyond the
hiring process, retention of hired teachers is lower for teachers of color than for White teachers. For example,
between the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 school years, only 15% of White teachers left their jobs, compared to 22% of
Black teachers and 21% of Hispanic teachers (U.S. Department of Education, 2016). Teacher disparities also exist
within zip codes. Evidence indicates that teachers are tied to the communities they serve.

   Research indicates that roughly 60 percent of educators choose to teach in a region close to their home, or to
their university (Reininger, 2011). Beginning teachers may opt to teach near places which are familiar to them
and they may already feel a sense of belonging in their home communities.

   Recently, there have been efforts to capitalize on the connections teachers have with certain home
communities. Those who reside within a community have relationships and networks centered within the
region. Rather than recruit outsiders, or those who are from different areas, recent efforts have focused on

                                                                                                                                                                    Why Teach? | 9
targeting individuals who live in the community. Recruiters believe these individuals may be more invested in
the students and may be intrinsically motivated to help them succeed. Some regions have developed "Grow-
Your-Own" initiatives and have developed scholarships to specifically target members of a community. The
term, "Grow-Your-Own," implies that a neighborhood can grow its own educators, rather than recruit teachers
from far away places.

   The term, "Grow-Your-Own" is relatively new, however, the idea of recruiting teachers from specific regions
has been in existence for quite some time. School districts are now expanding this idea and are starting to
reach out to students of color in the hopes that teachers can start to bridge the divide between educators and
classroom populations.

     Deeper Dive - Grow Your Own Initiative

        Check out this inspiring article about the "Grow your Own" Initiative - Oregon districts turn high
     school students into future teachers through `Grow Your Own' efforts

In order to combat the staffing shortages which are widespread due to the Covid-19 Pandemic, school districts
have developed their own ways to harness the talent of those individuals who work within the community,
or who work at the school. Bus drivers, education assistants, school volunteers and parents have begun to
think about working as long-term substitute teachers. Some of these individuals attend community colleges
to begin to obtain their teaching credential and learn about the pedagogical strategies of education pathways.

     Critical Lens - Capitalizing Race Terms

        You may have noticed in this section that races are capitalized (like White and Black). Capitalizing
     these names recognizes the people more than the color. In fact, the Associated Press recently changed
     its writing style guide[2] to capitalize Black and Indigenous when referring to racial categories.

1.3 What do Great Teachers Do Differently?

Reflect on your experience as a student in a K-12 classroom. Your experiences as a student may have been
varied. If you cannot call to mind an experience easily, think about a learning experience from a coach, mentor
or relative. Think of a task or situation where you learned a new skill or mastered a content area. When you
think about your relationship with this individual, what three words come to mind?

     Activity - Icebreaker

        Can you name three Characteristics of an effective teacher?
          · Think about a teacher who made a difference in your life and why?
          · What specifically did they do or say that made a difference for you?
          · How does this inform the kind of teacher you hope to be?
          · This could have been a positive or negative teacher experience.

As a student, you may have attended school in a rural community, in a setting where there were small class
sizes, in a school with a variety of students from various ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Or, you might have
been in a school with a large population in an urban community. Consequently, as former students, you all
bring these experiences and points of view with you into the classroom. Teachers who are effective in reaching
students of diverse backgrounds recognize these various types of knowledge as student assets.

   Students bring knowledge with them as they enter schools and classrooms. In fact, their first teachers are
their parents, extended family members, and members of the church and community leaders. In these spaces,
they begin to learn the values of their family. They learn the habits and customs regarding when to bring to
another member of the family, or what work entails. They receive an education in these settings. The students
bring this knowledge base with them to school. (Moises Esteban-Guitart, 2021).

   When considering how students learn, one crucial factor involves the teacher and student relationship. As
we examine the characteristics of effective and ineffective teachers in our school experience, it is likely we will
see correlations between the student-teacher relationship (STR) and our performance or lack of ease in the
classroom. As we look at teaching through this lens, we come to understand that teaching content is only one
aspect of the teacher role. Creating an emotionally caring and educationally supportive environment in our
classroom can give us an advantage in engaging students for learning.

   The following TED Talk Video is presented by Ms. Rita Pierson. Ms. Pierson is an inspiring former teacher
who has a philosophy that all students can learn, and that a teacher can lift students to heights they never
thought they could achieve. This presentation focuses on practical success and failure resulting from classroom
relationships. Often pre-service teachers believe that they are preparing for a career that will require them only
to teach the content. However, as teachers, we cannot shy away from the fact that we also teach complex
human beings.

                                                                                                                                                                    Why Teach? | 11

1.4 Teacher Purposes and Beliefs

After watching the video from Rita Pearson, consider the importance of establishing caring and trusting
relationships with your students, as well as the importance of believing in them by acknowledging any effort
they are making.

   Now, we are moving to another important aspect of teaching and that is to convey content to their students.
Teachers need to express why the content they teach is important to learn. For elementary teachers, the
necessity for students to learn how to calculate, read, and write is a given, but the answer is not as clear for other
subjects: music, science, physical education, history, and art. Many parents do not see the need for their children
to study a subject past a certain point. In order to ground why content is important, reflection and creation of a
personal philosophy is essential.

   Teachers enter the profession for a variety of reasons. Some educators are motivated by intrinsic factors, such
as the need to "give back" to the student population and help to inform the next generation. Some educators
believe their work contributes to creating a more just society. Those who are motivated by intrinsic factors,
or factors which are internal and come from within, often find that they pursue their passions. On the other
hand, some teachers are also motivated by extrinsic factors. Extrinsic factors could include a reward, monetary
compensation, or another external factor. No matter what your motivation is for teaching, all future educators
need to understand teacher knowledge and how to apply it on a daily basis.

1.5 Teacher Knowledge: Content, Pedagogical and Curricular Knowledge

        "Knowledge is power. Information is liberating. Education is the premise of progress, in every society,
     in every family" -Kofi Annan.

If teaching is the highest form of understanding, as Aristotle claims, then what are the forms of understanding
and how might we develop a framework for articulating this understanding? This complex understanding is
part of the foundational requisites of teacher knowledge. According to Gudmundsdottir & Shulman (1987), there
are three main foci that form the foundation of teacher knowledge: Content knowledge, pedagogical content
knowledge, and curricular knowledge.

   Content knowledge: Understand the standards that are required to be taught through a culturally responsive
lens. This means that teachers must understand the population they are working with so that standards can be
addressed in a multicultural environment.

   Pedagogical Content Knowledge: Understand what are the difficulties that students might encounter as
they learn about a new topic. This means that teachers need to assess the developmental appropriateness of

12 | Why Teach?
the topic in relation to their students. In order to achieve this, teachers must develop close relationships with
students to be able to learn about their background, motivations and learning styles in order to guide students'
achievement of their goals.

   Curricular Knowledge: Knowledge of curricular materials to teach particular topics and ideas. Teachers
should be able to identify and evaluate different perspectives and points of view in a subject matter so that they
avoid teaching stereotypes or implicit biases that are printed in some textbooks.

   In addition to these three foci, a teacher needs to develop a philosophy, or purpose, in which they have a
research based approach to the learning conditions, goals for learning and strategies to use in the classroom, so
that students learn the content. The development of and adherence to a research based philosophy of teaching
and learning serves as a teacher's guidelines for curricular choices, for the implementation of classroom
community strategies, and for building relationships with students as well as colleagues. We will dig deeper
into our philosophy of teaching as we advance in this text.

1.6 Lifelong Learning, Reflective Practitioner, and Mentoring

           Teachers engage in the process of lifelong learning as a way to meet

           the needs of their students, respond to best practices in the literature

           and research, and try to integrate the newly acquired approaches to

           support student learning. Some examples of lifelong learning, also

           known as professional development, may be attendance at a

           conference, mentoring (either as the mentee or mentor), joining a

           professional organization, and conducting research. As an

           undergraduate student pursuing your Bachelors Degree in education,

           you are immersed in a constant environment of learning.

           Let's embark on the journey of becoming reflective practitioners as

           becoming a master teacher takes continuous effort. Since teaching is a

           repeated process in which you plan, reflect, and adjust based on a

Image 1.4  student's learning, achievement and engagement, reflection is one
           habit that you must acquire to be able to improve your practice.

Dylan Wiliam describes this in the following video as the life-long process of a teacher.

   Dewey (1938) argued that reflective practice promotes a consideration for why things are as they are and

how we might direct our actions and behavior through careful planning. When we underpin this planning with
experience and theory, we become much more impactful. To make this point clear, we learn from reflecting on
our experience and not solely from our experience. This means that it is the lessons we reflect on that move us
forward.

   Donald Schön (1987), a philosopher and educational researcher, took reflective practice a little further and
defined two processes: reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. This means that we need to observe, reflect
and rapidly adjust our teaching in the moment, versus the process to reflect and look back to be able to adapt

                                                                                                                                                                   Why Teach? | 13
our lessons. To elaborate on Schön's point, we can affirm that learning to teach often means making choices
and taking actions without knowing in advance what we need to learn or what the consequences will be.
Thinking about these notions encourages teachers to be reflective practitioners; a professional who learns both
from experience and about experience.

                      Image 1.7

On the other hand, the Frankfurt school of critical social theory (1929), talks about the importance of moving
from growing as an individual to changing a whole society; in this case, your classroom. According to these
theorists, a "critical" theory may be distinguished from a "traditional" theory according to a specific practical
purpose: a theory is critical to the extent that it seeks human "emancipation from slavery", acts as a "liberating
... influence", and works "to create a world which satisfies the needs and powers of" human beings (Horkheimer
1972b [1992, 246]). Because such theories aim to explain and transform all the circumstances that enslave
human beings, many "critical theories" in the broader sense have been developed.

Video 1.5
   With these perspectives, we can argue that both schools of thought are beneficial when talking about

reflective practitioners. Teachers who think about their practice, reflect on the impact of their practice, and
evaluate their practice in terms of student understanding. Here, we move from our own personal growth to the
growth and change of our society.

   Now, let's talk about when we should start reflecting. A good starting point is for us to learn from our own
teaching. We need to reflect, or think, about the implications that our own values and experiences bring to
the classroom. With this being said, reflection on practice is something we must do for ourselves, since only
we have had our particular teaching experiences and only we can choose how to interpret and make use
of them. But this individual activity also may benefit from the perspective and feedback offered by fellow
professionals. Others' ideas and values may differ from our own, and they can, therefore, help in working out
our own thoughts and in bringing new ideas that we may otherwise take for granted. Collectively reflecting on

14 | Why Teach?
a subject area or lesson plan is an excellent way to help evolve ideas or strategies that can improve our own
practice.

          Reflection can happen in any number of ways, but here, we are going to list five general
       categories:

            · Reflecting on your own practice
            · Talking and collaborating with colleagues
            · Participating in professional associations
            · Attending professional development workshops and conferences
            · Reading professional literature

   John Kamal (2020), in his article Making Time for Reflective Practice shares some practical ideas and helpful
tips to become an effective practitioner as you reflect on your own teaching practices. For example, taking notes
after a lesson can support you as a teacher. You can reflect on the aspects of the lesson that went well and
the aspects that need some adjusting. Reflecting on your practice is a powerful development tool for teachers.
Teachers who consider these schools of thought, strategies, and expectations are on the path to becoming
reflective practitioners, professionals who learn both from experience and about experience.

Regarding mentoring, in the United States, there are some states who require mentoring programs for
beginning teachers and administrators. For example, California, New York, Hawaii, Kansas, Pennsylvania, and
other states have teacher induction requirements for first-year teachers. As a first-year teacher in these states,
you will be assigned a mentor in your district who will serve to support and guide you through the challenges,
questions, and joys that your first year of teaching will offer. Strong mentor-mentee programs increase the
development of a new teacher's connection to the school community and reduce isolations (NYSED, 2013).

Conclusion

Why do teachers teach? It is something inside them. It is a drive, a force, a passion, a desire to engage with their
students in order to watch them succeed. Choosing to be a teacher is not a monetary pursuit, as a teacher's
salary is hardly adequate considering all that they give to their students. Becoming a teacher is often considered
a calling. It is not for the light of heart, but rather, for those who love children and people, who have a passion for

                                                                                                                                                                   Why Teach? | 15
education, and who understand its impact on improving lives and creating a more just society . Most teachers
love to learn and hope to encourage that fundamental human process of discovery and growth in others.

          "The central role that slavery played in the development of the United States is beyond dispute.
       And yet, we the people do not like to talk about slavery, or even think about it, much less teach it or
       learn it. The implications of doing so unnerve us. If the cornerstone of the Confederacy was slavery,
       then what does that say about those who revere the people who took up arms to keep African
       Americans in chains? If James Madison, the principal architect of the Constitution, could hold people
       in bondage his entire life, refusing to free a single soul even upon his death, then what does that say
       about our nation's founders? About our nation itself? Slavery is hard history. It is hard to
       comprehend the inhumanity that defined it. It is hard to discuss the violence that sustained it. It is
       hard to teach the ideology of white supremacy that justified it. And it is hard to learn about those
       who abided it."

          · Why is it so difficult for educators to address the topic of slavery and racism?
          · Why do you think we are starting a chapter on the history of education in the United States with

             the topic of slavery?
          · Is this just about Black people or a legacy of systems of power and oppressions which impacted

             communities of color?
          · How does such oppression persist today, and how should educators proceed?
          · What responsibilities do educators have to disrupt systems of oppression?

What does the history of education have to do with that hard history referenced in the above quotes? The
history of US education is inseparable from the history of nation-building, so we begin this chapter with this
important framing. Because race is such a polarizing force in our nation today, we choose to focus on slavery as
a way to frame the difficulty of teaching about history in the US. In this section, we will follow historical events
through key periods of U.S history and identify the forces that left lasting influences on education in the United
States.

   "In the Preamble to the U.S. Constitution, the Founding Fathers enumerated the lofty goals of their radical
experiment in democracy; racial justice, however, was not included in that list. Instead, they embedded
protections for slavery and the transatlantic slave trade into the founding document, guaranteeing inequality
for generations to come. To achieve the noble aims of the nation's architects, we the people have to eliminate

                                                                                                                                                 History of US Education | 19
racial injustice in the present. But we cannot do that until we come to terms with racial injustice in our past,
beginning with slavery. (Hasan Kwame Jeffries https://www.splcenter.org/20180131/teaching-hard-history)

   So much of the historical narrative has centered on the achievement and influence of the white men who had
the power to control the narrative. The New York Times 1619 project attempts to reframe this history, beginning
by identifying this nation's birth as the moment in 1619 when the first ship carrying slaves arrived in the British
colony of Virginia (rather than July 4th, 1776) because chattel slavery served as a foundation of this nation's
economic and political systems for the next 250 years.

The history of education in the US naturally reflects the history of the nation. The schools have typically taught
students that slavery ended in the 19th century, a stance that disregards the formal and informal barriers
that were created and maintained for another hundred years (and beyond). Following the Civil War, Jim Crow
laws explicitly created separate systems for people of color, which were strictly maintained in structures such
as schooling, healthcare, and the justice system and had far-reaching consequences across the generations,
causing a significant wealth gap that persists to this day . When Jim Crow ended, these systems were
embedded throughout society and served to disenfranchise communities of color in order to uphold and
support white power structures (such as where people could live, work and go to school). While understanding
the legacy of slavery is central to understanding our history in this country, racialized oppression impacted
other oppressed peoples, notably the people who lived here first, the indigenous people of North America.
Westward expansion, Christian missionaries, and the spread of disease brought destruction and genocide to
native communities, their languages, cultural practices, and customs. More on these topics will be covered later
in this chapter.

   Our educational system has been centered around narratives of meritocracy and equality, those precious
American ideals that suggest that if any person merely works hard enough, they can have access to the
American dream. It is not typically taught that slavery was the economic engine that fueled the birth of this
nation, nor that specific laws and policies maintained those inequalities through to the modern day. This lack
of reflection on slavery's role in our collective history has been damaging because as a nation, we are now
divided around these issues. Many in the US society struggle to understand the lived experiences of BIPOC
communities because they do not match the stories with which they were raised, particularly the myths of
meritocracy and equality.

   Teachers who address slavery in the classroom must consider how they can empower students to process
hard history. Author and educator Adrienne Stang and Harvard researcher Danielle Allen discussed the
importance of beginning the lesson with affirmation and validation for how students feel and an
acknowledgement of what they already know about slavery. Described as "co-processing," this teaching tool
enables the teacher to scaffold learning in order to empower students to move through a place of discomfort.
Another example which includes a framework for teaching slavery includes Glenn Singleton's curriculum
entitled, "Courageous Conversations." Singleton's approach is unique because it utilizes four compass points to
teach about the context in which slavery operated, including the moral, emotional, intellectual, and relational

20 | History of US Education
perspectives to enable students to process this hard history. Stang and Allen also advocate using primary
sources of people who were enslaved when possible, in order to center their voices in the text.

   Supreme Court Justice Henry Blackmun argued " to get beyond racism we must first take account of race,
there is no other way". People in positions of power will reject and fight against the curriculum such as the
1619 project. When ignoring the racism that fueled this nation in the curriculum, many have argued that we,
as a pluralistic nation, can not move forward. Teachers have an important role to play and need to learn how
to lean into teaching hard history. Teacher prep programs should prepare educators to handle these topics
effectively. People will disagree about this and feel discomfort. These issues have become highly politicized in
this country and put a great deal of pressure on educators. Some districts and localities are not supportive of
unearthing past wrongs, what they consider to be a shaming of the nation's history and heroes. In this text,
we continue to reshape the traditional narrative with a critical lens. We choose to include critical perspectives
which traditionally have been left out because we know this is imperative to our nation's healing and growth.

     Critical Lens

   Schools do not only control people; they also help control meaning. Since they preserve and
distribute what is perceived to be `legitimate knowledge'--the knowledge that `we all must have,'
schools confer cultural legitimacy on the knowledge of specific groups. But this is not all, for the ability
of a group to make its knowledge into `knowledge for all' is related to that group's power in the larger
political and economic arena. Power and culture, then, need to be seen, not as static entities with no
connection to each other, but as attributes of existing economic relations in a society. They are
dialectically interwoven so that economic power and control is interconnected with cultural power and
control. In the following article, Michael Apple, talks about how the educational system keeps this
system of oppression - Michael Apple on Ideology in Curriculum

Precolonial America

In 1491, it is estimated that there were 2,000 distinct indigenous languages and approximately sixty million
people. Many of these languages still exist today and carry clues of cultural, historical and traditional knowledge.

   Much of what we know of these early communities comes from creation stories and archaeological evidence.

In the following film, we learn about how Indigenous peoples were using agriculture, water management,
deforestation practices, controlled burning, and urban development thousands of years before the arrival of
Columbus. These practices were driven by a need for shelter, food and clothing for a growing population. Clearly,
there were diverse systems of education to pass along such knowledge. The following film provides more detail
about these innovative practices:

North America in the 17th Century

Public education, as we know it today, did not exist in the colonies. In the First Charter of Virginia in 1606, King
James I set forth a religious mission for investors and colonizers to disseminate the "Christian Religion" among
the Indigenous population, which he described as "Infidels and Savages." His colonial and educational mission
would impact settlement and education in North America for centuries.

Puritan Massachusetts

Puritans in Massachusetts believed educating children in religion and rules from a young age would increase

their chances of survival or, if they did die, increase their chances of religious salvation. Puritans in

Massachusetts established the first compulsory education law in the New World through the Act of 1642, which

required parents and apprenticeship masters to educate their children and apprentices in the principles of

Puritan religion and the laws of the commonwealth. The Law of 1647, also referred to as the Old Deluder Satan

Act, required towns of fifty or more families to hire a schoolmaster to teach children basic literacy. Because of

similar religious beliefs and the physical proximity of families' residences, formal schooling developed quickly

in the commonwealth of Massachusetts. Connecticut, New York, and Pennsylvania followed in Massachusetts'

footsteps, passing similar laws and ordinances between the mid- and late-seventeenth century (Cremin, 1972).

During this time, children learned to read at home using the Holy

Scriptures and catechisms (small books that summarized key

religious principles) as educational texts. The primers that were used

"contained simple verses, songs, and stories designed to teach at

once the skills of literacy and the virtues of Christian living"

(McClellan, 1999, p. 3).

The importance of faith, prayer, humility, rewards of virtue,

honesty, obedience, thrift, proverbs, religious stories, the fear of

death, and the importance of hard work served as major moral

principles featured throughout the texts. When Indigenous people

were depicted or mentioned in texts, they were portrayed as

"savages and infidels," needing salvation through English cultural

norms. In light of what we now know of the genocide of native

peoples, the irony of who was performing the savagery should be re-

examined.

Another form of education occurred in Dame schools. Dame

schools were small private schools for young children run by

women. Where available, some parents sent their children to a

neighboring housewife who taught them basic literacy skills,

including reading, numbers, and writing. Because families paid for      Image 2.2 This illustrated alphabet from the
their children to attend Dame schools, this form of education was       1721 New England Primer infuses religious
mainly available to middle-class families. Teaching aids and texts      and moral lessons into basic literacy skills.

included Scripture, hornbooks, catechisms, and primers (Urban & Wagoner, 2009).

More expensive than Dame schools, Latin grammar schools were also available. The Latin grammar schools

were originally designed for only sons of certain social classes who were destined for leadership positions in

church, state, or courts. The first Latin grammar school was established in Boston in 1635 to teach boys subjects

like classical literature, reading, writing, and math at what we would consider the high school level today, in

preparation to attend Harvard University (Powell, 2019).

                                                                                 History of US Education | 23
Image 2.3                        In Colonial America, education in the mid-Atlantic and
                              southern colonies was heavily stratified and remained out
                              of reach for most inhabitants. The early recorded history of
                              US education mostly addresses the education of white
                              children. The assimilationist education of native peoples is
                              addressed later in the chapter. Starting in the 1600s,
                              millions of enslaved Africans were brought to the colonies
                              to fuel the industry and wealth that built this nation..

   The institution of slavery meant that White landowners sent their children to private schools to train future

land owners, and slaves were denied the right to an education. Literacy for enslaved people was outlawed and
considered dangerous for white inhabitants who controlled all aspects of an evolving society. Nevertheless,
brave individuals attempted to set up secret schools throughout the south. Northern schools for Blacks also
faced harassment and threats. In the following articles, you can find more information regarding the education
of African Americans, their literacy and the slavery of our ancestors.

American Revolutionary Era

After the American Revolution, our new country was establishing its systems and identity. Many key Founders
believed public education was a prerequisite to a democratic society. Three groups had distinct post-
revolutionary plans for education and schooling, all of which were intended to serve as part of the founding
process: Federalists, Anti-Federalists, and the lesser known Democratic-Republican Societies.

Federalist

"History has its eyes on you."- from the musical "Hamilton"
   Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, and John Adams, among other Federalists, focused on building a

new nation and a new national identity by following the new Constitution, which consolidated power in a new
federal government. The Federalists supported mass schooling for nationalistic purposes, such as preserving
order, morality, and a nationalistic character, but opposed tax-supported schooling, viewing it as unnecessary
in a society where elites rule.

                                                        As a Federalist, Noah Webster believed education should teach morality.
                                                     Noah Webster was one of the great advocates for mass schooling to teach
                                                     children not just "the usual branches of learning," but also "submission to
                                                     superiors and to laws [and] moral or social duties." Smoothing out the
                                                     "rough manners" of frontier folk was very important to Webster.
                                                     Furthermore, Webster placed great responsibility on "women in forming
                                                     the dispositions of youth" in order to "control...the manners of a nation" and
                                                     that which "is useful" to an orderly republic (Webster, 1965, 67, 69-77).
                                                     Webster's treatise on education and his spellers (like his 1783 American
                                                     Spelling Book) were intended to develop a literate and nationalistic
                                                     character to shape useful, virtuous, and law-abiding citizens with strong
                                                     attachments to Federalist America.

Image 2.4

           Anti-Federalists

Anti-Federalists, on the other hand, were opposed to a strong central government, preferring instead state
and local forms of government. The Anti-Federalists believed that the success of a republican government
depended on small geographical areas, spaces small enough for individuals to know one another and to
deliberate collectively on matters of public concern. Anti-Federalists feared concentrated power.

                             History of US Education | 25
   As an Anti-Federalist, Thomas Jefferson believed education should be
locally controlled. An aristocrat whose genteel lifestyle was bolstered by his
violent oppression of enslaved people, Jefferson put forth proposals to
educate all white citizens in the state of Virginia. Jefferson proposed a
system of tiered schooling. The three tiers were primary schools, grammar
schools, and the College of William and Mary. The foundation of his tiered
schooling plan included three years of tax-supported schooling for all white
children with limited options for a few poor children to advance at public
expense to higher levels of education. While he suggested very limited
educational opportunities for women, no other key Founder advocated
giving high-achieving scholars from poor families a free education. Religion
was not a core curricular area in the primary and grammar schools.
However, his plans were viewed as too radical by his aristocratic peers, and
they correspondingly rejected his state education proposals.

                                                                                Image 2.5

Pause and Ponder - Ideologies in Schools

   Where do we see elements of these different ideologies in today's schools? What has remained and
what has changed? What approach do you see as the most valuable in terms of today's public schools?

Early National Era (1789-1837)

During the early-to mid-nineteenth century, the United States was expanding westward, and urbanization and
immigration intensified. This period of history was defined by the emergence of the common school movement
and normal schools, though conflicts over the organization and control of education continued. This period also
saw the advent of higher education.

The Common School Movement

                                  Horace Mann established the common school movement and also advocated for normal
                               schools to prepare teachers. He was Massachusetts's first Secretary of Education and Whig
                               (formerly Federalist) politician, was the leader of the common school movement, which
                               began in the New England states and then expanded into New York, Pennsylvania, and
                               then into westward states.

Video 2.7
   Common schools were elementary schools where all students-not just wealthy boys-could attend for free.

Common schools were radical in their status as tax-supported free schooling, but their conservative-leaning
curriculum addressed traditional values and political allegiance. Schooling offered increasing opportunities for
children, especially those from working-class families, by teaching basic values including honesty, punctuality,
inner behavioral restraints, obedience to authority, hard work, cleanliness, and respect for law, private property,
and representative government (Urban & Wagoner, 2009).

The Development of Normal Schools

With the rise of common schools, Horace Mann then turned to how female teachers would be educated. For

Mann, the answer was to create teacher training institutions originally referred to as normal schools. A French

institution dating back to the sixteenth century, école normale was the term used to identify a model or ideal

teaching institute. Once adopted in the United States, the institution was simply called a normal school.

           Catherine Beecher, the first well-known teacher, became an instructor at a

           normal school to prepare other teachers. She played a significant role in

           influencing women to join the profession in large numbers, and made it

           acceptable for women to leave home and travel afar to become teachers,

           especially in the western territories of the growing nation.

           The first normal school in America was established in Lexington,

           Massachusetts in 1839 (now Framingham State University). They were primarily

           used to train primary school teachers, as middle and high schools did not yet

           exist. The curriculum included academic subjects, classroom management

           and school governance, and the practice of teaching. Teacher credentialing

           began and was regulated by state governments. Moreover, this contributed to

           the professionalization of teaching, and normal schools eventually became

           colleges or schools of education or full-fledged liberal arts and research

           institutes. Catherine Beecher was the first well-known teacher of the time and

           one of the normal schools' first teachers.

Image 2.7  Administrators and policymakers began to see an opportunity in hiring

           women, mainly because they could justify paying them less than men, and

because they were perceived to be gifted at working with children. As men were exiting the profession, more

women were hired for less money to educate the growing ranks of students as common schools spread

westward. Furthermore, once the profession was feminized, teaching became perceived as a missionary calling

rather than an academic pursuit. While male policymakers insisted women were better nurturers and more

suited to teaching morality and correct behavior in children, framing the discourse of teaching around a calling

helped rationalize lower pay for women and fewer advancement possibilities.

                                                                             History of US Education | 27
Pause and Ponder - Females in the Educational System
   How do you see the early roots of feminizing the teaching profession still in effect today?

Conflicts in the Common School Movement

The common school movement was not without its conflicts. Whigs (formerly Federalists), including Horace
Mann, sought to establish state systems of schooling in order to create standardization and uniformity in
curricula, classroom equipment, school organization, and professional credentialing of teachers across state
schools. Democrats, however, often supported public schooling but feared centralized government, thus
opposing the centralization of local schools under the common school movement. The battle between Whigs
and Democrats during the nineteenth century represents one of the initial conflicts related to public schooling.

   Another important conflict related to the common school movement was the clash between urban
Protestants and Catholics. Typically from Protestant backgrounds, common school reformers continued to use
the Bible as a common text in classrooms without considering the potential conflict this could generate in
diverse communities. Horace Mann advocated using only generalized Scripture in order to prevent offending
different sects. However, what appeared to Protestants as a generalization of Christian text was actually very
insulting to Catholic immigrants, who were becoming the second largest group of city dwellers at the time.
Protestant education leaders attempted to address this issue by reducing the religious content in the common
school curriculum, but unhappy Catholic leaders created their own private parochial schools? This conflict
generated a greater theoretical acceptance of the separation of church and state doctrine in publicly-funded
common schools, though in practice, common schooling continued to infuse Protestant biases for over a
century.

   Common schools also faced conflict in Southern states,
including Jefferson's Virginia, until after the Civil War. Planters
had no interest in disturbing the status quo by educating poor
whites or enslaved people. Driven by Southern aristocracy,
education continued to be viewed as a private family
responsibility and class privilege. As described previously, many
southern states prohibited educating enslaved people and
passed state statutes that attached criminal penalties for
doing so, such as the ones below.

        Excerpt from a 1740 South Carolina Act: Whereas, the having slaves taught to write, or suffering
     them to be employed in writing, may be attended with great inconveniences; Be it enacted, that all

     and every person and persons whatsoever, who shall hereafter teach or cause any slave or slaves to be
     taught to write, or shall use or employ any slave as a scribe, in any manner of writing whatsoever,
     hereafter taught to write, every such person or persons shall, for every such offense, forfeit the sum of
     one hundred pounds, current money.

        Excerpt from Virginia Revised Code of 1819: That all meetings or assemblages of slaves, or free
     negroes or mulattoes mixing and associating with such slaves at any meeting-house or houses, &c., in
     the night; or at any SCHOOL OR SCHOOLS for teaching them READING OR WRITING, either in the day
     or night, under whatsoever pretext, shall be deemed and considered an UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY; and
     any justice of a county, &c., wherein such assemblage shall be, either from his own knowledge or the
     information of others, of such unlawful assemblage, &c., may issue his warrant, directed to any sworn
     officer or officers, authorizing him or them to enter the house or houses where such unlawful
     assemblages, &c., may be, for the purpose of apprehending or dispersing such slaves, and to inflict
     corporal punishment on the offender or offenders, at the discretion of any justice of the peace, not
     exceeding twenty lashes.

Enslaved people have often been depicted in many American history textbooks as passive toward their owners.
This misrepresentation is quite problematic and gives people across races a whitewashed, inaccurate
understanding of the history of the US and our own individual heritages. African Americans escaped,
committed espionage on plantations, negotiated statuses, and occasionally educated themselves behind
closed doors. For enslaved people, education and knowledge represented freedom and power, and once
they were emancipated, they continued their relentless quest for learning by constructing their own schools
throughout the South, even with minimal resources. African Americans placed an exceptional value on literacy
due to generations of bondage and denial of access to reading and writing.

        You will notice in this chapter that we use the term "enslaved person" instead of "slave." Part of critical
     theory involves questioning existing power structures, even in word choice. Recently, academics and
     historians have shifted away from using the term "slave" and have begun replacing it with "enslaved
     person" because it places "humans first, commodities second" (Waldman, 2015, para. 2).

While slavery continued throughout the South, segregation continued in the North. One of the first challenges
to segregation occurred in Boston, Massachusetts. Benjamin Roberts attempted to enroll his five-year-old
daughter, Sarah, in a segregated white school in her neighborhood, but Sarah was refused admission due
to her race. Sarah attempted to enroll in a few other schools closer to her home, but she was again denied
admission for the same reason. Mr. Roberts filed a lawsuit in 1849, Sarah Roberts v. City of Boston, claiming that
because his daughter had to travel much farther to attend a segregated and substandard black school, Sarah
was psychologically damaged. The state courts ruled in favor of the City of Boston in 1850 because state law
permitted segregated schooling. This case would be cited in Plessy v. Ferguson in 1898 and in Brown v. Board of
Education in 1954, both of which are pivotal to segregation cases in the US..

Post Civil War and Reconstruction (1863-1877)

Following the Civil War, significant restructuring of political, economic, social, and educational systems in the
United States occurred. Political leaders considered education to be a necessary instrument in maintaining
stability and unity. During this era, education was shaped by increasing influence of the federal government,
the beginning of public education in the South, the Morrill Acts, and Native American boarding schools.

Increasing Influence of the Federal Government

Elazar (1969) asserted that "crisis compels centralization" (p. 51): when the nation undergoes a calamity, it
eventually leads to the federal government exercising extra-constitutional actions on its own will or as a result
of demands made by state and local governments. The post-Civil War Era provides one example of this effect.
The U.S. Congress established requirements for the Southern states to reenter the Union. "Radical Republicans",
as they were identified after the Civil War, believed that the lack of common schooling in the South had
contributed to the circumstances leading to war, so Congress required Southern states to include provisions
for free public schooling in their rewritten constitutions. To learn more about these radical republicans, see the

Segregated "Jim Crow" America

"After the Civil War, millions of formerly enslaved African Americans hoped to join the larger society as full and
equal citizens. Although some white Americans welcomed them, others used people's ignorance, racism, and
self-interest to sustain and spread racial divisions. By 1900, new laws and old customs in the North and the South
had created a segregated society that condemned Americans of color to second-class citizenship". Separate is
not Equal

   Of course, southern states followed through with the requirements and drafted language supporting schools,
but they created loopholes like separate and segregated schools in the "Jim Crow" era.

   Jim Crow was the White Supremacy system set up to separate and control Black citizens in all areas of civic,

political, economic, legal and social life and the schools played a large role. Black schools received substantially

                   "Now we are free. What do we want? We want education; we want protection; we want
                      plenty of work; we want good pay for it, but not any more or less than anyone else...and then
                      you will see the down-trodden race rise up." --John Adams, a former slave
                   "Denied public educational resources, people of color strengthened their own schools and
                      communities and fought for the resources that had been unjustly denied to their children.
                      Parents' demands for better schools became a crucial part of the larger struggle for civil
                      rights".

The Beginning of Education in the South

Following the Civil War, nearly four million formerly enslaved people were homeless, without property, and
illiterate. In response, Congress created the Freedmen's Bureau (officially referred to as the U.S. Bureau of
Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands). Supervised by northern military officers, the Freedmen's Bureau
distributed food, clothing, and medical aid to formerly enslaved people and poor Whites and created over 1,000
schools throughout the southern states. The Freedmen's Bureau lasted only for seven years, but it represented
a massive federal effort that provided some benefits.

   In addition to Freedmen's schools, Yankee schoolmarms also headed south as missionaries to help educate
formerly enslaved people. They sought mutual benefits: to educate the illiterate and simultaneously secure
themselves in the eyes of God. As missionaries, female teachers learned that their work was a calling to instill
morality in the nation's students, and this calling was pursued for the good of mankind instead of financial
gain. This same missionary status fueled both the migration of teachers westward following national expansion
and the thousands of schoolmarms that migrated to the South to educate formerly enslaved people who, they
believed, had to be redeemed through literacy, Christian morality, and republican virtue (Butchart, 2010).

   However, African Americans were primarily responsible for the education of their people. Formerly-enslaved
people knew the connection between knowledge and freedom. Ignorance was itself oppressive; knowledge, on
the other hand, was liberating. Literate African Americans were often teaching children and adults alike and
creating their own one-room schoolhouses, even with limited resources. By 1866 in Georgia, African Americans
were at least partially financing 96 of 123 evening schools and owned 57 school buildings (Anderson, 1988). The
African American educational initiatives caught Northern missionaries off guard:

   Many missionaries were astonished, and later chagrined...to discover that many ex-slaves had established
their own educational collectives and associations, staffed schools entirely with black teachers, and were
unwilling to allow their educational movement to be controlled by the `civilized' Yankees." (Anderson, 1988, p. 6)

                                                                                                                                                  History of US Education | 31
   In addition, industrial schools were built in the South for Black Americans. Southern policymakers, northern
industrialists, and philanthropic groups partnered to establish industrial schools focused on vocational or trade
skills. Southern policymakers benefited because industrial schools resulted in both segregating the workforce
and higher education which aligned with their values. Northern industrialists benefited because they gained
skilled laborers. Philanthropists believed they were giving Black Americans access to education and jobs.

   Booker T. Washington advocated for the industrial schools being
established for African Americans. Washington believed in giving Black
people knowledge of the trades, in order to earn a living.

   Two African American leaders in the late nineteenth century had different
perspectives on newly-developed industrial schools. Booker T. Washington
was born an enslaved person in 1856 and grew up in Virginia. He attended the
Hampton Institute, whose founder, General Samuel Armstrong, emphasized
that "obtaining farms or skilled jobs was far more important to African-
Americans emerging from slavery than the rights of citizenship" (Foner, 2012,
p. 652-653). Washington supported this view as head of the Tuskegee Institute
in Alabama. In his famous 1895 "Atlanta Compromise" speech, Washington
did not support "ceaseless agitation for full equality"; rather, he suggested, "In
all the things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers, yet
one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress" (Foner, 2012, p. 653).
Washington feared that if demands for greater equality were imposed, it
would result in a white backlash and destroy what little progress had been Image 2.9
made. The Tuskegee Institute offered vocational training programs to help
Blacks find what was considered more "respectable" careers.

                                                     W.E.B. Du Bois viewed the situation differently. Born free in Great
                                                  Barrington, Massachusetts in 1868, Du Bois was the first African American to
                                                  earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University. He served as a professor at Atlanta
                                                  University and helped establish the NAACP in 1905 to seek legal and political
                                                  equality for African Americans. He opposed Washington's pragmatic
                                                  approach, considering it a form of "submission and silence on civil and political
                                                  rights" (Urban & Wagoner, 2009, p. 176). He came from a very different
                                                  background, lived in different circles in the North, and as a result, could
                                                  envision a different future for Blacks, one that included upward mobility and
                                                  higher educational aspirations. The two men are often contrasted for these
                                                  different perspectives in what they felt was realistic for Black people of the
                                                  time in terms of their education.

   In addition to the Freedman's Bureau, the federal government implemented two legislative acts related to

32 | History of US Education
education. The Morrill Act of 1862 gave states 30,000 acres of land for each senator and representative it had in
Congress in 1860. The income generated from the sale or lease of this land would provide financial support for
at least one agricultural and mechanical (A&M) college, known as a land-grant institution (Urban & Wagoner,
2009). Land-grant institutions were designed to support the growing industrial economy. The second Morrill
Act of 1890 required "land-grant institutions seeking increased federal support...to either provide equal access
to the existing A&M colleges or establish separate institutions for the `people of color' in their state" (Urban &
Wagoner, 2009, p. 188). The Morrill Acts demonstrated how industrialization and westward expansion resulted
in increasing involvement of the federal government in education policy to meet national needs.

Using its military, the federal government created over 400 Native American boarding schools across 37
states. The first and most famous of these was the Carlisle School, founded in Pennsylvania in 1879. The
federal government convinced many Native American parents that these off-reservation boarding schools
would educate their children to improve their economic and social opportunities in mainstream America. In

                                                                                                                                                 History of US Education | 33
reality, these schools were intended to deculturalize Indigenous children. Supervisors at the boarding schools
destroyed children's native clothing, cut their hair, and renamed many of them with names chosen from the
Protestant Bible. The curriculum in these schools taught basic literacy and focused on industrial training;
graduates of these boarding schools were to be sorted into agricultural and mechanical occupations. A total
of 25 off-reservation boarding schools educating nearly 30,000 students were created in several western states
and territories, as well as in the upper Great Lakes region. Based in ethnocentrism, the belief that their white
protestant culture was superior to other cultures, these boarding schools relied on a harsh form of assimilation,
a fundamental feature of common schooling.

        In the summer of 2021, the dark history of Indigenous boarding schools made headlines as Canadian
     authorities discovered unmarked graves and remains of children[3] killed at multiple boarding schools

     boarding schools and the intergenerational trauma they have caused. These boarding schools are one
     way that education has been used to oppress and de-culturize a particular group of Americans who
     have experienced intergenerational trauma. Recognizing and teaching this tragic history is one small
     step toward dismantling the colonizer/settler/founders mythology.

Today

Throughout the centuries, the debate over what is taught in schools has always been fraught with conflict, and
this modern era is no different. As a result, different schools of thought emerged in this conflict as you read
about in chapter 3. If you follow the local news, you can't help but see that these battles are fought daily. One
cannot deny the political nature of schooling, despite efforts to sanitize it, because schooling occurs in a cultural
context and a public domain.

     Pause and Ponder

34 | History of US Education
        Many schools have used indigenous symbols and stereotypes as their mascots and still do. What is
     the impact on native communities- and white communities when these practices persist? What
     impact does it have on young children and on our shared future as a pluralistic society?

The Progressive Era (1896-1917)

The Progressive Era was defined by reform across all aspects of society, and education was no exception. Many
of the philosophies you learned about earlier in this chapter were established in the Progressive Era. Changes
in education during this period included varying forms of progressivism, the emergence of critical theory,
extending schooling beyond the primary level, and the development of teacher unions.

Differing Approaches to Progressivism

During the Progressive Era's focus on social reform, different approaches emerged. The administrative
progressives wanted education to be as efficient as possible to meet the demands of industrialization and
the economy. Efficiency involved centralizing neighborhood schools into larger urban systems, allowing more
students to be educated for less money. Graded classes, specialized and differentiated subject areas, ringing
bells, an orderly daily itinerary, and hierarchical management-with men serving as school board members,
superintendents, and principals, and women on the bottom rung as teachers-also increased educational
efficiency. Educational efficiency required preparing good workers for a rapidly changing economy.
Administrative progressives adopted factory models in schools to become better at processing and testing the
masses, a continued form of educational assimilation.

   Similar to actual factories, factory models in education
increased efficiency, which was important to administrative
progressives.

   Curricular or pedagogical progressives were focused on
changes in how and what students were learning. Many of
these progressives saw schooling as a vehicle for social
justice instead of assimilation. John Dewey is often referred
to as America's philosopher and the father of progressivism
in education. In Democracy and Education, Dewey (1944)
theorized two types of learning: "conservative," which

                                                                                                        Image 2.12
reproduces the status quo through cultural transmission
and socialization, and "progressive," which frames education more organically for the purposes of experiencing
"growth" and activating"potentialities" (p. 41). For curricular and pedagogical progressives, "progressive"
learning has no predetermined outcome and is always evolving, or progressing. Democratic education, Dewey
believed, must build on the existing culture or status quo and free students and adults alike toward conscious
positive change based on newly-discovered information, improvements in science, and democratic input from
all members of the community, which added legitimacy to a society's growth.

   John Dewey was known as the father of progressive education.
   Dewey and like-minded progressives have often been referred to as social reconstructionists. They believed
education could improve society. Dewey recognized "the ability of the schools to teach independent thinking

                                                                                                                                                 History of US Education | 35
and the ability of students to analyze social problems" (Kliebard, 1995, p. 170). Dewey did not expect the school
to upend society; rather, as institutions that reached virtually all youth, he saw schooling as the most effective
means of developing the habits of critical thinking, cooperative learning, and problem solving so that students
could, once they became adults, carry on this same activity democratically in their attempts to improve society.
The progressives were often met with contempt because such critique threatened the existing socio-political
system, which conservative individuals wished to preserve.

Emergence of Critical Theory

In Germany in 1923, critical theory was developed at The Frankfurt Institute of Social Research. With roots in

German Idealism, critical theorists sought to interpret and transform society by challenging the assumption

that social, economic, and political institutions developed naturally and objectively. In addition, critical theorists

rejected the existence of absolute truths. Instead of blind acceptance of knowledge, critical theorists

encouraged questioning of widely accepted answers and challenged objectivity and neutrality, noting that

these constructs avoid addressing inequality in political and economic power, social arrangements, institutional

forms of discrimination, and other areas. The original Frankfurt School theorists were dedicated to ideology

critique and the long-term goal of reconstructing society in order to "ensure a true, free, and just life"

emancipated from "authoritarian and bureaucratic politics" (Held, 1980, p. 15).

                              A decade later amidst the Great Depression, America witnessed

                              the emergence of its own Frankfurt School. In the United States,

                              critical theory was aligned with social reconstructionism and

                              situated in social foundations programs in various academic

                              institutions, including its first department in Columbia

                              University's Teachers College. Why would this movement find its

                              home in American education? Educators were "a positive creative

                              force in American society" that could serve as "a mighty

                              instrument of...collective action" (Counts, 2011, p. 21). Critique,

                              reflection, and action, often referred to as praxis, are intrinsically

Image 2.13                    educational, and these actions transcend the mere transmission
                              of knowledge and culture. America's social reconstructionists

                              attempted to cultivate a specialized field that drew from many

academic disciplines in order to develop professional teachers' understanding of how schooling tended to

reinforce, evangelize, or perpetuate a given social order. They repudiated a predetermined "blueprint" for

training teachers, rejecting "the notion that educators, like factory hands, merely...follow blueprints" (Coe, 1935,

p. 26).

Social reconstructionists viewed teachers as professionals who did not need "blueprints" to tell them exactly

how to teach. More on philosophical approaches to education in chapter 3.

Pause and Ponder - What is the purpose of education?

            Is it the transmission and indoctrination of the values, customs, ideologies, beliefs, and rituals?

         Should education serve as a means of critique and social reconstruction in order to improve society?

     Deeper Dive

        "It would seem to me that when a child is born, if I'm the child's parent, it is my obligation and my
     high duty to civilize that child. Man is a social animal. He cannot exist without a society. A society, in
     turn, depends on certain things which everyone within that society takes for granted. Now the crucial
     paradox which confronts us here is that the whole process of education occurs within a social
     framework and is designed to perpetuate the aims of society. Thus, for example, the boys and girls who
     were born during the era of the Third Reich, when educated to the purposes of the Third Reich, became
     barbarians. The paradox of education is precisely this - that as one begins to become conscious one
     begins to examine the society in which he is being educated. The purpose of education, finally, is to
     create in a person the ability to look at the world for himself, to make his own decisions, to say to
     himself this is black or this is white, to decide for himself whether there is a God in heaven or not. To
     ask questions of the universe, and then learn to live with those questions, is the way he achieves his
     own identity. But no society is really anxious to have that kind of person around. What societies really,
     ideally, want is a citizenry which will simply obey the rules of society. If a society succeeds in this, that
     society is about to perish. The obligation of anyone who thinks of himself as responsible is to examine
     society and try to change it and to fight it - at no matter what risk. This is the only hope society has.
     This is the only way societies change".

Extending School Beyond the Primary Level

While high schools existed in New England towns since the establishment of the Boston Latin Grammar School
in 1636, it was not until the early nineteenth century that high schools started appearing in urban areas, and
they were not commonly attended until the early twentieth century. While common elementary schooling
focused on teaching students morality, a differentiated curriculum in the early twentieth century high schools
"reflected a new, largely economic, purpose for education" (Urban & Wagoner, 2009, p. 234). Debates arose
around the high school curriculum: should it teach a classical curriculum, or focus on vocational training to
meet the needs of the rapidly changing economy in the U.S.? In 1918, the National Education Association
published a report called "The Cardinal Principles of Secondary Education" to establish the goals of high
school education, including "health, command of fundamental processes, worthy home membership, vocation,
citizenship, worthy use of leisure, and ethical character" to prepare students "for their adult lives" by "fitting
[them] into appropriate social and vocational roles" (Urban & Wagoner, 2009, p. 271-272). The functionalistic
nature of high school also resulted in the development of extracurricular programs including, but not limited to,

cooperation" and to "serve...the needs of industrial society" (Urban & Wagoner, 2009, p. 272-276). This resulted in
the high school becoming a major institutional mechanism in developing the future teenager.

Changes beyond high school also occurred in the Progressive Era. It was also during this period that the
educational ladder expanded to include not only a system of elementary and high schools, but also junior high
schools, community colleges, and kindergartens, which had served as separate private institutions since the
mid-nineteenth century. Not only were more children attending school at this time, they were attending for
longer periods of time due to protections developed through progressive child labor laws, especially the Child
Labor Law of 1938.

Intelligence Testing

It was introduced to education following World War I. Based on French psychologist Alfred Binet's work on
intelligence, Louis Terman developed the Binet-Terman scale of intelligence and despite his own impoverished
upbringing, eschewed a framework of intelligence based on biological factors. Terman redirected Binet's work
and reduced intelligence to a single number on a scale that he termed the Intelligence Quotient (IQ). Terman
associated intelligence with ethnicity, aligning with pernicious racist and Eugenist ideas of the time, linking
certain intelligences to certain groups such as Blacks, Mexicans, Native Americans, and Southern Europeans
and anyone with a perceived disability or difference. Furthermore, Terman portrayed intelligence as something
fixed and hereditary, linking intelligence scores to the kind of educational or career opportunities people could
access. These tests had tremendous far-reaching impacts as they were used to sort recruits for World War I,
condemning those who scored lower to the front lines and the risk of death, and assigning those who scored
higher to safer desk jobs.. Terman also strove to test and sort US school children, going on to create national
exams to track the nation's school children in all grades, again with far-reaching consequences, including
intergenerational damage. While there have been many well-documented critiques of the cultural bias in
standardized tests of intelligence (such as Gould's The Mismeasure of Man), Terman and his colleagues wielded
significant influence that still impacts and shapes schools today.

Post World War II & Civil Rights Era (1940-1949)

In the decades following World War II, the U.S. prospered, and education saw many significant shifts, especially
focusing on equality of educational opportunities. In this period, ongoing inequalities in educational
opportunities led to limited federal funding; Brown v. Board of Education (1954) deemed segregated schools
illegal; and other minority groups continued to fight for equitable access to education.

Ongoing Inequities and Federal Funding

The 1945 Senate committee hearings on federal aid to education highlighted ongoing inequities in schooling,
as well as the fact that "education was in a state of dire need" of financial resources and more equitable funding
(Ravitch, 1983, p. 5). Most school funding came from property taxes, which continued to exacerbate inequities
because ..... Other changes took place following World War II to worsen already existing inequalities. After the
War, "white flight" from the inner city to suburbs resulted in highly-segregated communities, falling urban
property values, and rising suburban property values. White flight contributed to greater de facto segregation,
and it increased segregated schooling and enhanced inequalities in school funding.

   After Russia launched Sputnik in 1957, U.S. federal support of schools increased to allow for global competition.

                                                                                                                                                 History of US Education | 39
   In response, the federal government offered limited assistance. The National School Lunch Program was
passed in 1946 in order to enhance learning through better nutrition. In response to the anxiety created over
the launching of the Russian satellite Sputnik, Congress passed the 1958 National Defense Education Act,
which provided increased federal funding for math, science, and foreign languages in public schools. While
these examples are not exhaustive, they illustrate the piecemeal federal approach to funding public schools:
if a problem was perceived as a crisis and reached the federal legislative agenda, it was more likely to attract
congressional funding.

   In 1965, President Johnson worked with Congress in order to pass what became known as the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). The ESEA served as the largest total expenditure of federal funds for
the nation's public schools in history. Aligned with Johnson's war against poverty, the purpose of the law
included increased federal funding for school districts with high levels of poor students. The law included six
Titles (sections). Title I served as the primary legislative focus and included about 80 percent of the law's total
funding. Title I funds were distributed to poorer schools districts in an attempt to remedy the unequal funding
perpetuated by reliance on property taxes. Title VII, or the Bilingual Education Act of 1968, provided funds for
schools with students who were speakers of languages other than English. The other Titles provided federal
funding for school libraries, textbooks and instructional materials, educational research, and funds to state
departments of education to help them implement and monitor the law. This title funding resulted in the
growth of state power alongside the expansion of federal power since states gained greater oversight of federal
programs and mandates.

Separate is not Equal

                              The landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision

                              began the process of school desegregation, which took several

                              decades.

                              In 1896, Plessy v. Ferguson established the separate-but-

                              equal doctrine. In its decision, the U.S. Supreme Court

                              circumvented the original intent of the Fourteenth

                              Amendment's equal protection clause, which was intended to

                              give all persons equal rights under the law. The Court

                              strategically interpreted the clause to mean that as long as

                              segregated public facilities were "equal," they were

Image 2.14                    constitutional.
                                 The 1954 Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka decision

ended the separate-but-equal doctrine. Prior to this ruling, segregation was mandated by law (also called de

jure segregation). The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) found five

plaintiffs representing four different states (Delaware, Kansas, South Carolina, and Virginia) and the District of

Columbia to challenge segregated primary and secondary schools. All five cases were heard under the name

Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka. The Court ruled unanimously in 1954 to overturn Plessy. In his majority

decision, Chief Justice Earl Warren made the following conclusion:

Segregation of white and colored children in public schools has a detrimental effect upon the colored

children. The impact is greater when it has the sanction of the law, for the policy of separating the races is

usually interpreted as denoting the inferiority of the Negro group...Any language in contrary to this finding is

rejected. We conclude that in the field of public education the doctrine of `separate but equal' has no place.

Separate educational facilities are inherently unequal. (347 U.S. 483, 1954)

40 | History of US Education
   Even though Brown v. Board found segregation unconstitutional,
desegregation faced many challenges from White students, families,
educators, and others. White Supremacists actively fought integration and
used threats and ultimately force to intimidate communities of color who
were trying to gain access. The US would continue to try to undo the harm of
segregated schools for many decades to come, and that work continues, even
as schools have grown more segregated in practice.

   After ruling segregation unconstitutional, the Court then had to consider a
reasonable set of remedies in order to ensure desegregation. In 1955, The
Court ruled in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka II that desegregation
would occur "on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed."
This vague language, particularly the phrase "all deliberate speed,"
contributed to chaos and enabled state resistance, with each state and
district deciding its own approaches or avoidance thereof (Ryan, 2010).

   When attempted integration efforts occurred, they occurred on white
terms, determined by white school boards. Desegregation efforts resulted in Image 2.15
Black teachers losing their jobs and the closing of their schools. Black
students were integrated into White schools and were suddenly being taught by White teachers while being
subjected to an all-white curriculum that didn't include their voices or perspectives. Black students and
teachers alike experienced "cultural dissonance that exacerbated student rebelliousness, especially among
African American boys." Furthermore, "the actual implementation of integration plans and court orders
remained largely in the hands of white school boards" (Fairclough, 2007, p. 396-400). Due to massive resistance
to desegregation, Congress passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act in an attempt to force compliance. Following the
passage of ESEA, which provided millions of federal dollars to each state, the federal government could now
threaten non-compliant states (and school systems) with withholding these large sums of money annually
under Title VI of the act if they did not comply with the mandate to desegregate schools.

        Why do you think such a decision was made and what impact did it have on Black children in
     particular, on desegregation efforts?

Busing children to different schools not in their neighborhoods was one attempt to increase racial diversity in
schools.

                                                                                                                                                 History of US Education | 41
   Many urban school systems began drawing plans to bus white
and non-white children to schools across neighborhoods in order
to increase racial diversity in all of a district's schools (i.e., Swann v.
Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education, 1971). However, in 1974
in Milliken v. Bradley, the U.S. Supreme Court decided schools
were not responsible for desegregation across district lines if their
own policies had not explicitly caused the segregation. President
Nixon, who opposed inter-district busing, argued that in order to
protect suburban schools, inner city schools should be given
additional funds and resources to compensate urban school
children from the harms of past segregation and the legacies of
inequitable funding (LCCHR, n.d.). According to Ryan (2010), Image 2.16
"Nixon's compromise, broadly conceived to mean that urban
schools should be helped in ways that [did] not threaten the physical, financial, or political independence of
suburban schools... continues to shape nearly every modern education reform" (p. 5). The Milliken decision
halted any possibility to integrate schools effectively. Due to the existence of de facto segregation, there was no
way to significantly integrate students unless they crossed district boundaries.

   Nixon also worked with Congress to pass the 1974 Equal Educational Opportunities Act. This legislation
embodied the rights of all children to have equal educational opportunities, and it included particular
consideration to Multilingual Learners. The EEOA prohibited states from denying equal educational opportunity
on account of race, color, sex, or national origin. Moreover, the EEOA prohibits states from denying equal
educational opportunity by the failure of an educational agency to take appropriate action to overcome
language barriers that impede equal participation by its students in its instructional programs.

Increasing Access to Education for Minority Groups

The African American Civil Rights Movement gave hope to Mexican and Asian Americans, as well as women,
people with disabilities, and to a lesser extent, Native Americans. Like African Americans, Mexican Americans
utilized the courts to overturn segregated schools in the southwest, particularly in Texas and California. In fact,
the earliest segregation case was filed by Mexican Americans in 1931 in Lemon Grove, California[7]. Other cases
would be filed in the 1940s and 1950s, including Mendez v. Westminster[8] in 1947.

   Women continued to fight for equal pay and respect in the workplace, and some success was achieved in the
passage of Title IX as one of the amendments to the 1972 Higher Education Act. Title IX "prohibits discrimination
on the basis of sex in any federally funded education program or activity" in "colleges, universities, and
elementary and secondary schools," as well as to "any education or training program operated by a receipt of
federal financial assistance," including intercollegiate athletic activities (The U.S. Department of Justice, n.d.).

   A class action suit in San Francisco, California, led to legal rights for English Language Learners. In Lau
v. Nichols (1974), parents of approximately 1,800 diverse multilingual students alleged that their Fourteenth
Amendment equal protection rights had been violated because because they could not access the language
of instruction. The U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the school district violated Section 601 of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, which banned discrimination based "on race, color, or national origin" in "any program or activity
receiving federal financial assistance." As recipients of federal funds, schools were required to respond to the
needs of English language learners effectively, whether this meant implementing bilingual education, English
immersion, or some other method of instruction. The Court concluded, "There is no equality of treatment
by providing students with the same facilities, textbooks, teachers and curriculum, for students who do not
understand English are effectively foreclosed from any meaningful education."

   Children with differing educational needs due to variety of differences and disabilities had been excluded

42 | History of US Education
from many educational opportunities. Prior to 1972, students with special needs had no access to a public
education and were largely neglected in terms of any academic development in institutions and private
residences. In 1972, Pennsylvania Association for R*tarded [sic] Children (PARC) v. Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania[9], guaranteed the rights of disabled children to attend free public schools. Congress followed up
in 1973 by enacting the Rehabilitation Act, which guaranteed civil rights for people with disabilities, including
appropriate accommodations and individualized education plans to tailor education for students based on their
unique needs. Providing children special educational services in least restrictive settings was required by the
1975 Education for All Handicapped Children Act. "Least restrictive" essentially means that students with special
needs should be in the same classrooms with other students as much as possible with the least restrictions
possible. The video below shows the horrific atrocities that such students used to face in state-run boarding
schools.

The 1980s and Beyond

In the 1980s and beyond, education saw increasing federal supervision and support, though ultimate control
of education still remained with individual states. In this period, the Department of Education was established,
and the A Nation at Risk report led to standards-based reforms like No Child Left Behind,.

Establishing the Department of Education

While the federal government has no constitutional authority over public education, its power and influence
over schooling reached a pinnacle after the 1980s. In 1979, President Jimmy Carter created the federal
Department of Education. Ronald Reagan, who succeeded Carter, tried and failed to abolish it. Reagan's neo-
conservative followers largely consisted of traditionalists and evangelicals. The traditionalists believed moral
standards and respect for authority had been declining since the 1960s, while evangelicals (also known as the
Religious Right) were concerned by increasing U.S. secularism and materialism (Foner, 2012). For example, in
Engel v. Vitale (1962), the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that directed prayer in public schools was a violation of the

                                                                                                                                                 History of US Education | 43
First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which forbids the state (public schools and their employees) from
endorsing or favoring a religion. While the Religious Right saw this decision as taking God out of America's
public schools, the Court viewed separation of church and state as necessary to protect religious freedoms from
government intrusion. As established earlier in this chapter, however, even when presented in secular terms,
the moral values taught in the public schools were often based on or connected to Protestant Christianity, so
church influence was never truly separated from schooling.

     Pause and Ponder - Education in the US

        Consider how education in the US is impacted by 3 different levels of government: local, state, and
     federal control.

        Which historically has had the most control over schooling and curriculum?
        How do these 3 levels of governance provide a check and balance system to US schools? How might
     they not?

A Nation at Risk and Standards-Based Reform

In 1981, Reagan created the National Commission on Excellence in Education to address the perceived problems
of educational decline. In 1983, the commission released a 71-page report entitled A Nation at Risk. The authors
of the report, who were primarily from the corporate world, declared, "American students never excelled in
international comparisons of student achievement and that this failure reflected systematic weaknesses in our
schools and lack of talent and motivation among American educators" (Berliner & Biddle, 1995, p. 3). However,
A Nation at Risk was somewhat "sensational" (Urban & Wagoner, 2009, p. 402), containing numerous claims
that were uncorroborated or misleading generalizations as a pretense for a larger political agenda intended to
discredit public schools and their teachers.

   Developing the perception that America's schools were in crisis, A Nation at Risk justified a top-down, punitive
approach to school reform. While state-by-state standards-based reform had been underway for several years
as primarily, A Nation at Risk inspired new theories about `systemic' reform, which emphasized renewing
academic focus in schools, holding teachers accountable for educational outcomes, measured by students'
academic achievement, and aligning teacher preparation and pedagogical practice with content standards,
curriculum, classroom practice, and performance standards" (DeBray, 2006, p. xi).

                  President George W. Bush signs into law the No Child Left

                  Behind Act Jan. 8, 2002, at Hamilton High School in Hamilton,

                  Ohio. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB, 2001) was an

                  example of standards-based reform. As a bipartisan-passed

                  reauthorization of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary

                  Education Act, it was "the first initiative to truly bring the

                  federal government as a regulator into American public

                  education" (Fabricant & Fine, 2012, p. 13). Previously, the federal

                  government's control of schools typically extended only to

                  funding; now, NCLB would hold schools, teachers, and students

Image 2.17        accountable for passing standardized tests given annually in
                  math and reading in grades 3-12. The law also required states to

test English language learners for oral, written, and reading proficiency in English each year. Often

unacknowledged, this bipartisan bill was intended to address inequities in US schools and while the

implementation was far from perfect, certain aspects remain:

1. Accountability for student performance on biased standardized tests; public characterization of schools as
     succeeding or failing based on those scores

2. Heightened communication with parents and the community at large.
3. Data-driven decision making to guide school improvement (looking at relationship between academic

     achievement and race)
4. Enhanced preparation of educators; requirements for teachers to be "highly qualified" in their content

     areas (qualified math teachers are teaching math)

In the past, parents did not always know when schools were failing their children. NCLB sought to change that.
ESEA was originally created to affect equity in terms of poverty in US schools. The federal government plays a
role checking the local and state control of US schools.

   Initially, there was strong progressive support for NCLB given the low standards and expectations of many
schools attended primarily by students of Color and students from low income families. It was hoped that
setting uniform standards would help raise achievement in those schools. However, NCLB's acute focus on
the results of narrow standardized tests resulted in teachers `teaching to the test' using uniform curricula that
have little or no connection to an increasingly diverse student population. Not only did NCLB publicize school
performance on standardized tests, it punished schools that performed poorly. [Sentence elaborating on the
punishment]. The punitive nature of the law harmed many students, teachers, and administrators. Madaus et
al. (2009) asserted that as a result of changes arising from NCLB, testing "is now woven into the fabric of our
nation's culture and psyche," which is evidenced by the fact that even "the valuation of homes in a community
can increase or decrease based on [school] rankings" based on test scores (p. 4-5). NCLB is based on a theory
of action that assumes that uniformity, standardization, centralization, and punitive measures can compel
learning and decrease achievement gaps. The assumption that all children learn uniformly in all respects reveals
a lack of understanding of the complexity of the learning process and the various demographic differences
among children in a diverse society, including cultural, language, and ability differences.

        Can you think of a time when it was important for the federal government to intervene in America's
     schools?

     Critical Lens - Standardized testing

        In a society experiencing greater diversity, it is more important than ever to realize how culture plays
     a significant role in shaping children's school experiences, which makes standardized assessments all
     the more problematic as they tend to be culturally biased. Therefore, relying on standardized
     assessments in making conclusions about student achievement (or lack of achievement) limits
     teachers' opportunities to identify the true strengths and learning needs of their students. . Rote
     memorization and test preparation skills can easily inhibit creativity and imagination, and such rigid
     approaches are teacher-centered and assimilatory.

In 2015, the No Child Left Behind Act (originally the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965) was
reauthorized as the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA). The law:

  · Advances equity by upholding critical protections for America's disadvantaged and high-need students.
  · Requires that all students in America be taught to high academic standards that will prepare them to

      succeed in college and careers.
  · Ensures that vital information is provided to educators, families, students, and communities through

      annual statewide assessments that measure students' progress toward those high standards.
  · Helps to support and grow local innovations, including evidence-based and place-based interventions

      developed by local leaders and educators.
  · Sustains and expands investments in increasing access to high-quality preschool.
  · Maintains an expectation that there will be accountability and action to effect positive change in our

      lowest-performing schools, where groups of students are not making progress, and where graduation
      rates are low over extended periods of time (U.S. Department of Education, n.d.).

By specifically tying federal funds to standardized assessments, standardized curricula, and accountability
measures, along with requiring states and state education agencies to devote extraordinary resources toward
fulfilling these mandates through oversight, since 2001 the federal government has more actively controlled
America's public schools than ever before. Increased federal influence illustrates the underlying belief that if
the U.S. is going to maintain economic superiority and global competitiveness, public schooling must become a
national responsibility. Contemporary goals focusing on preparing children to compete globally are significant
for a number of reasons, not the least of which include the evolving nationalization of our public schools and
the simultaneous loss of local authority and discretion over fundamental matters related to student learning.

46 | History of US Education
Conclusion

Education in the United States has a complicated past entrenched in religious, economic, national, and
international concerns. In Colonial America, Puritans in Massachusetts expected that education would teach
children the ways of religion and laws, vital to their own survival in a new world. Meanwhile, the Middle
and Southern Colonies viewed education as a commodity for the wealthy families who could afford it, and
a way to perpetuate their economic system. After the American Revolution, Federalists, Anti-Federalists, and
Democratic-Republican Societies all had different perceptions of how schools should be organized to support
our newly-established independent nation. In the Early National Era, common schools, normal schools, and
higher education grew as education became more widely established. Many groups were excluded from the
early educational system due to racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism, to name a few, reflecting the dominant
narrative of the times which was white-centered, English-speaking, protestant, patriarchal and ableist.

   Following the Civil War, the federal government was increasingly involved in education, including the
temporary creation of the Freedmen's Bureau and subsequent federal funding of agricultural and mechanical
colleges with the passage of the Morrill Acts. In the Progressive Era, efforts to maximize the efficiency of
educational systems and to utilize education as a venue for social reform prevailed. After World War II, equitable
access to education became a primary focus, as "separate-but-equal" doctrines were overthrown and schools
grappled with institutional discrimination against non-White students, students with disabilities, women, and
English Learners.

   The 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act provided federal funds to public schools, while states and
local school districts continued to exercise considerable discretion over curriculum, assessments, and teacher
certification. In the 1980s and beyond, increased pressures for standardization and accountability resulted
in standards-based reform, including the No Child Left Behind Act in 2001. More recently, education has
been leveraged to support all of a students' developmental needs, not just academic. Common educational
philosophies including perennialism, essentialism, progressivism, and social reconstructionism reflect varying
beliefs about the roles education should fill.

   Like learning, teaching is always developing; it is never realized once and for all. Our public schools have
always served as sites of moral, economic, political, religious and social conflict and assimilation into a narrowly
defined standard image of what it means to be an American. According to Britzman (as quoted by Kelle, 1996),
"the context of teaching is political, it is an ideological context that privileges the interests, values, and practices
necessary to maintain the status quo." Teaching is by no means "innocent of ideology," she declares. Rather, the
context of education tends to preserve "the institutional values of compliance to authority, social conformity,
efficiency, standardization, competition, and the objectification of knowledge" (p. 66-67).

   It should be no surprise then that contemporary debates over public education continue to reflect our
deepest ideological differences. As Tyack and Cuban (1995) have noted in their historical study of school reform,
the nation's perception toward schooling often "shift[s]... from panacea to scapegoat" (p. 14). We would go a long
way in solving academic achievement and closing educational gaps by addressing the broader structural issues
that institutionalize and perpetuate poverty and inequality.

Foundations of Educational Philosophy

     Pause and Ponder - Education

        You may have heard comments implying that education in the United States is not political, separate
     from religion, and accessible to everyone. The reality is that from its early existence in the western
     hemisphere in the 1600s, it was indeed political, religious, and accessible only to a select few. These
     traits continue to influence the evolution of education in the United States today.

The education system in the United States is a social institution. A social institution is a pattern of behaviors and
social arrangements that have evolved to meet the needs of society. Quite often, how those needs are defined
in official conversations is dependent on who has the social, economic, and legal power to do the defining.

   Given this, and since the current system in the US was derived from a system that was explicitly designed
to reproduce wealth and privilege for societal elites, it should be no surprise that the foundational theorists

52 | Educational Philosophies
upon which the US education rests are representative of a narrow range of perspectives on education. Many
educational approaches, perspectives, and philosophies have been neglected in the development of the US
system. For instance, the educational system in the US is not rooted at all in the philosophies of Aztec or Mayan
civilizations. Nor does it include understandings about teaching, learning, or intellectual growth from Muslim,
Hindu, or Yoruba societies. It is accurate to say the US system of education and the philosophies on which it
rests are decidedly Eurocentric.

     Critical Lens - Eurocentrism

        Eurocentrism (also Eurocentricity) is a worldview that is centered on or privileges European-based
     civilization or a biased view that favors it over nonEuropean-based civilizations.

In order to understand the educational system in the US in a way that supports educators in meeting the needs
of all students, we offer the following orientation to the educational philosophies on which this system was
founded.

   A philosophy grounds or guides practice in the study of existence and knowledge while developing an
ontology (the study of being) on what it means for something or someone to be--or exist. Educational
philosophy, then, provides a foundation which constructs and guides the ways knowledge is generated and
passed on to others. Therefore, when thinking and reflecting about your own philosophy of education, you
need to acknowledge your values, beliefs and attitudes towards the educational system, as this will guide
your practice. Therefore, it is of critical importance that teachers begin to develop a clear understanding
of philosophical traditions and how the philosophical underpinnings inform their educational philosophies.
Philosophies need to translate ideas into action. If you want to use certain techniques, then you need to
understand how they are effective in the classroom to create that portion of your education philosophy.

   Over the course of history, philosophy has experienced several paradigm shifts that influence teaching and
learning. Philosophical traditions from the 19th century helped anchor the early foundations of educational
philosophy and the development of public education in Europe and the United States.

     Activity - Think and Reflect

        Think and reflect on the following guiding questions:
          · What does being a teacher mean to you?
          · What are the skills that, from your perspective, effective teachers have?
          · What should be taught?
          · How should it be taught?
          · What is knowledge?
          · Why is it important to establish a trusting relationships between students, teachers and the
             community?

                                                                                                                                               Educational Philosophies | 53
        Whether you are aware or not, you have begun writing philosophical statements about education
     and being a teacher.

3.1 Philosophical Perspectives of Education

As students ourselves, we may have a particular notion of what schooling is and should be as well as what
teachers do and should do. In his book entitled Schoolteacher: A Sociological Study, Dan Lortie (1975) called this
the "apprenticeship of observation" (p. 62). Many people who pursue teaching think they already know what it
entails because they have generally spent at least 13 years observing teachers as they work. The role of a teacher
can seem simplistic because as a student, you only see one piece of what teachers actually do day in and day
out. This one-dimensional perspective can contribute to a person's idea of what the role of teachers in schools
is, as well as what the purpose of schooling should be. The idea of the purpose of schooling can also be seen as
an individual's philosophy of schooling.

   Philosophy can be defined as the fundamental nature of knowledge, reality and existence. In the case of
education, one's philosophy is what one believes to be true about the essentials of education. When thinking
about your philosophy of education, consider your beliefs about the roles of schools, teachers, learners, families,
and communities. There are four philosophical perspectives currently used in educational settings:
essentialism, perennialism, progressivism, and social reconstructionism/critical pedagogy. Unlike the more
abstract philosophical perspectives of ontology and axiology, these four perspectives focus primarily on what
should be taught and how it should be taught, i.e. the curriculum. These are explained below.

3.2 Four Key Educational Philosophies

Essentialism

Essentialism adheres to a belief that a core set of essential skills must be taught to all students. Essentialists
tend to privilege traditional academic disciplines that will develop prescribed skills and objectives in different
content areas as well as develop a common culture. Typically, Essentialism argues for a back-to-basics approach
on teaching intellectual and moral standards. Schools should prepare all students to be productive members of
society. The Essentialist curriculum focuses on reading, writing, computing clearly and logically about objective
facts concerning the real world. Schools should be sites of rigor where students learn to work hard and respect
authority. Because of this stance, Essentialism tends to subscribe to tenets of Realism. Essentialist classrooms
tend to be teacher-centered in instructional delivery with an emphasis on lecture and teacher demonstrations.

54 | Educational Philosophies
Perennialism:

Perennialism advocates for seeking, teaching, and learning universal truths that span across historical time
periods. These truths, Perennialists argue, have everlasting importance in helping humans solve problems
regardless of time and place. While Perennialism resembles essentialism at first glance, Perennialism focuses
on the individual development of the student rather than emphasizing skills. Perennialism supports liberal
arts curricula that helps produce well-rounded individuals with some knowledge across the arts and sciences.
All students should take classes in English Language Arts, foreign languages, mathematics, natural sciences,
fine arts, and philosophy. Like Essentialism, Perennialism may tend to favor teacher-centered instruction;
however, Perennialists do utilize student-centered instructional activities like Socratic Seminar, which values
and encourages students to think, rationalize, and develop their own ideas on topics.

Video 3.2

Progressivism

Progressivism focuses its educational stance toward experiential learning with a focus on developing the whole
child. Students learn by doing rather than being lectured to by teachers. Curriculum is usually integrated
across contents instead of siloed into different disciplines. Progressivism's stance is in stark contrast to both
Essentialism and Perennialism in this manner. Progressivism follows a clear pragmatic ontology where the
learner focuses on solving real-world problems through real experiences. Progressivist classrooms are student-
centered where students will work in cooperative/collaborative groups to do project-based, expeditionary,
problem-based, and/or service-learning activities. In progressivist classrooms, students have opportunities to
follow their interests and have shared authority in planning and decision making with teachers.

3.3 A Response to Dominant Systems:

Social Reconstructionism

Social reconstructionism was founded as a response to the atrocities of World War II and the Holocaust to
assuage human cruelty. Social reform in response to helping prepare students to make a better world through
instilling liberatory values. Critical pedagogy emerged from the foundation of the early social reconstructionist
movement.

     Critical Lens - Liberatory Thinking

        "Liberatory thinking is the re- imagining of one's assumptions and beliefs about others and their
     capabilities by interrupting internal beliefs that undermine productive relationships and actions.
     Liberatory thinking goes beyond simply changing mindsets to creating concrete opportunities for
     others to experience liberation. The opportunities provides cover for and centers underrepresented and
     marginalized people. It pushes people to interrogate their own multiple identities in relation to others
     and to think about the consequences of our actions, especially for students of critical need. It explores
     how mindsets can impede or ignite progress in the classroom, school, and district."

        Chicago Public Schools
        For more information in Liberatory Thinking, please refer to the Equity Framework from the Chicago
     Public Schools

Critical Pedagogy

Critical pedagogy is the application of critical theory to education. For critical pedagogues, teaching and
learning is inherently a political act and they declare that knowledge and language are not neutral, nor can they
be objective. Therefore, issues involving social, environmental, or economic justice cannot be separated from
the curriculum. Critical pedagogy's goal is to emancipate marginalized or oppressed groups by developing,
according to Paulo Freire, conscientização, or critical consciousness in students.

   Critical pedagogy de-centers the traditional classroom, which positions teachers at the center. The curriculum
and classroom with a critical pedagogy stance is student-centered and focuses its content on social critique
and political action.

3.4 Ways of Knowing

     Pause and Ponder - Ways of Knowing

        In addition to the historically neglected thinkers and the theories presented above, it is important for
     educators to consider that there are many ways of knowing and acquiring knowledge

        How do you know something is true?

In the US school system, for instance, students begin the day when a bell or signal goes off at the same
predetermined time every day. This scheduling system shapes students' awareness of how days in their lives will
most likely be structured. Consider an alternative: What would happen if the school day started every day when
the sun passes a certain point across the horizon. What would students learn about the world? How would
students' way of knowing about time and responsibility be changed?

     Critical Lens - Cultural Practices

        Here are two news stories with examples of cultural practices that are not taught in mainstream
     schools because they have been steered away from in this imperialistic, colonizing culture.
     Nevertheless, they have been sustained by thinkers and teachers and continue to be sustained today.

3.5 Educational Thinkers

The thinkers and perspectives in the preceding section of this text are considered foundational thinkers in
mainstream formal education in the US, other thinkers from the same time period and throughout history are
considered foundational contributors to education throughout the world. Some of this has to do with the notion
of US colonialism, imperialism, exceptionalism (the belief that the United States is either distinctive, unique, or
exemplary compared to other nations), and the legacy of the enslavement of Black Americans in the United
States. Because of these legacies, very few people of color were accepted into the cannon of formal educational
thinkers. As a result, the US system has been shaped by a very narrow sample of foundational theorists, and
many educators who trained in the 20th and 21st centuries in the US had their perspectives formed under this
narrow umbrella.

   The following individuals and theories are presented so that you can broaden your perspective and better
serve all students during your career in education.

William Edward Burghardt Du Bois

Du Bois was an American sociologist, historian and Pan-Africanist civil rights
activist. Du Bois completed his graduate work at the University of Berlin and
Harvard University, where he was the first African American to earn a
doctorate. He became a professor of history, sociology and economics at
Atlanta University. Du Bois was one of the founders of the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909.

   In an effort to portray the genius and humanity of the Black race, Du Bois
published The Souls of Black Folk (1903), a collection of 14 essays. The
introduction of the book famously proclaimed that "the problem of the
Twentieth Century is the problem of the color line." Each chapter begins with
two epigraphs - one from a White poet, and one from a Black spiritualist - to

                                                                                                                                       Image 3.2
demonstrate intellectual and cultural parity between Black and White
cultures.

   A major theme of The Souls of Black Folk is the double consciousness faced by African Americans: being both
American and Black. This was a unique identity which, according to Du Bois, had been a handicap in the past,
but could be a strength in the future: "Henceforth, the destiny of the race could be conceived as leading neither
to assimilation nor separatism but to proud, enduring hyphenation."

   Double consciousness is the internal conflict experienced by subordinated or colonized groups in an
oppressive society. Originally, double consciousness was specifically the psychological challenge African
Americans experienced of "always looking at oneself through the eyes" of a racist white society and "measuring

58 | Educational Philosophies
oneself by the means of a nation that looked back in contempt". The term also referred to Du Bois's experiences
of reconciling his African heritage with an upbringing in a European-dominated society.

   More recently, the concept of double consciousness has been expanded to other situations of social
inequality, notably women living in patriarchal societies as well as LGBTQ2S+ people living in homophobic and
transphobic societies.

   The idea of double consciousness is important because it illuminates the experiences of Black people living in
post-slavery America, and also because it sets a framework for understanding the position of oppressed people
in an oppressive world. As a result, it became used to explain the dynamics of gender, colonialism, xenophobia
and more alongside race. This theory laid a strong foundation for other critical theorists to expand upon.

Carter Godwin Woodson

                       Woodson was an American educator, historian, author, and the founder of

                       the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. He

                       achieved a graduate degree at the University of Chicago and in 1912 was the

                       second African American, after W. E. B. Du Bois, to obtain a PhD from

                       Harvard University. Woodson remains the only person whose parents were

                       enslaved in the United States to obtain a PhD. He taught at two historically

                       Black colleges: "Howard University and West Virginia State University".

                       Woodson believed that education and increasing social and professional

                       contacts among Black and white people could reduce racism, and he

                       promoted the organized study of African-American history partly for that

                       purpose. He would later promote the first Negro History Week in

                       Washington, D.C., in 1926, forerunner of Black History Month.

                       Woodson published The Education of the Negro Prior to 1861. Believing

                       that history belonged to everybody, not just the historians, Woodson sought

Image 3.3              to engage Black civic leaders, high school teachers, clergy, women's groups

                       and fraternal associations in his project to improve the understanding of

African-American history. He founded the Association for the Study of African American Life and History whose

purpose he described as the "scientific study" of the "neglected aspects of Negro life and history" by training a

new generation of Black people in historical research and methodology

                                                                       Educational Philosophies | 59
bell hooks

   hooks is a US based educational theorist and social activist. In        Image 3.4
Teaching to Transgress: Education as the Practice of Freedom, she
argues that a teacher's use of control over students dulls the students'
enthusiasm and teaches obedience to authority, and keeps students
from learning critical thinking. hook's pedagogical practices exist as an
interplay of anti-colonial, critical, and feminist pedagogies and are
based on freedom. hooks also built a bridge between critical thinking
and real-life situations, to enable educators to show students the
everyday world instead of the stereotypical perspective of the world.
hooks argues that teachers and students should engage in
interrogations of cultural assumptions that are supported by
oppression.

   note: bell hooks intentionally does not capitalize her name, which
follows her critical stance that language, even how we write one's own
name, is political and ideological.

Henry Giroux

                                  Giroux is a foundational critical theorist in the US and Canada, best known for
                               his pioneering work in critical pedagogy in K-12 and higher ed. His work
                               advocates supporting students developing a consciousness of freedom and
                               connecting knowledge to power, and the ability to take constructive action. His
                               latest work examines the pitting of people against each other through the lens
                               of class, race, and any other differences that don't embrace white nationalism.

Image 3.5                      We will now analyze the impact of the pedagogical practice, as well as the
                               educational thought, of different key educators in Latin America. These

                               educators influenced a cultural change with ideas and concepts that modified

the parameters of the educational system that was established in LatinAmerica.

Some of these educators have not been recognized in the educational system around the world. However,

their work has been a catalyst in giving way to cultural and educational transformations in Latin America. The

following educators stand out for their innovative tendencies who fought for an educational system to which all

people had access.

When studying these Latin American educators, it should be noted that they generated a change that had

a great impact on socio-cultural problems and that their success, or failure, depended on the government

policies carried out in the corresponding countries.

Paulo Reglus Neves Freire

                           Freire is a Brazilian philosopher and educator, was one of the most

           influential thinkers behind social reconstructionism. He criticized the

           banking model of education in his best known writing, Pedagogy of the

           Oppressed, which is generally considered one of the fundamental texts of

           the critical pedagogy movement. Banking models of education view

           students as empty vessels to be filled by the teacher's expertise, like a

           teacher putting "coins" of information into the students' "piggy banks."

           Instead, Freire supported problem-posing models of education that

           recognized the prior knowledge everyone has and can share with others.

           Conservative critics of social reconstructionists suggest that they have

           abandoned intellectual pursuits in education, whereas social

           reconstructionists believe that the analyzing of moral decisions leads to

           being good citizens in a democracy.

                           The installment dedicated to Paulo Freire covers the different stages of

Image 3.6  the life of the Brazilian pedagogue and politician. The documentary shows

           his Christian roots and his first steps related to literacy and adult education

in Brazil, especially the one carried out in Angicos. Then, it continues with Freire's years in exile, which included

a diverse tour of Chile, the US, Nicaragua, etc. and the publication, in 1970, of two of his most important works:

Education as a practice for freedom and Pedagogy of the oppressed. At the same time, it is argued that these

works strengthened a political idea that became the organizer of the movement of the oppressed in Latin

America.

Pause and Ponder - Dominant Narrative

                                                Educational Philosophies | 61
   The work of Freire, Giroux, and hooks are included as necessary responses to the exclusionary and
marginalizing nature of the dominant narrative of educational systems. Even today, although educators
may study their work, the systems they're employed with tend to perpetuate the inequalities and
dynamics Freire, Giroux, hooks, and others address.

Gabriela Mistral

   Mistral, pseudonym of Lucila Godoy Alcayaga, was a Chilean poet,               Image 3.7
diplomat and pedagogue. She received the Nobel Prize for Literature in
1945 for her poetic work, she was the first Ibero-American woman and the
second Latin American person to receive a Nobel Prize.

   Her political-ideological profile is represented as a hybrid between her
Catholic, but not conservative, beliefs and her liberal traits, although she is
not strictly defined as liberal. Her words and poetry, which frequently gave
life to various newspaper articles, generated multiple conflicts with the
most conservative sectors of society. Mistral, however, continued on her way
and affirmed her work in the rural and indigenous sectors. During her trip
to Mexico, at the invitation of Vasconcelos, she fulfilled her full potential as
a teacher, promoting a pedagogy based on the child, with Christian roots
and that took into account the singularities of the rural and indigenous
areas in which she worked. In 1945 she became the first woman to receive
the Nobel Prize for Literature, something that made visible the impact of
her teaching practice, intellectual and poetic practice.

Domingo Faustino Sarmiento

                               Sarmiento was an Argentine politician, writer, teacher, journalist,

                               serviceman and statesman; governor of the province of San Juan between

                               1862 and 1864, president of the Argentine Nation between 1868 and 1874,

                               national senator for his province between 1874 and 1879 and minister of the

                               interior in 1879.

                               His controversial, anti-racist and unitary side is reaffirmed, and the fact

                               that he belongs to a generation that understood writing as a political

                               practice. He questioned what was the best educational system for all of the

                               students in Latina America. He starts investigating the opposite

                               approaches of education in Massachusetts and Prussia. He believed that

                               the students had a better option to succeed and learn independently in a

                               society under the Prussian system, which was centralized and under the

                               management of the state. The educational system in Massachusetts, on

Image 3.8                      the contrary, was decentralized and the society was the principal entity to
                               promote education. Therefore, the habits of each state were instilled in the

students. For example, a republican state will have a republican approach to education and he did not agree

62 | Educational Philosophies
with this approach. Therefore, after his investigations he laid the programmatic foundations of a national
educational system, in where it was centralized and Popular Education was provided to all of the children in
Argentina.

   Later on, his side as a statesman is taken up again with the contributions he made in the elaboration of the
Law of Common Education of Buenos Aires (1875) and the sanction under his presidency of the National Law of
Common Education (1884).

Jesualdo Sosa

Sosa, better known as Jesualdo, was a Uruguayan teacher, writer, pedagogue and journalist. His teaching led
him to dedicate himself with greater purpose and knowledge on the activities, interests and needs of the child.

   Starting from a critique of the traditional school and the capitalist system, Sosa combined there a proposal
with Escolanovist overtones, which promoted the autonomy of children, their creativity, their expression, their
work training, and was articulated with the activities of the community. That experience was collected in Vida
de un maestro, a production that, despite the censorship attempts it suffered from dictatorial governments,
was able to expand worldwide. After that publication, his life is described as a time of maturation,
systematization and recognition, which gave him the chance to be called to collaborate in different parts of
Latin America.

Simón Narciso de Jesús Carreño Rodríguez

                                                       de Jesús Carreño Rodríguez was a Venezuelan hero, educator, and
                                                    politician. He was the tutor of Simón Bolívar and Andrés Bello. He contributed
                                                    concepts and ideas including written works aimed at the process of freedom
                                                    and American integration.

                                                       In the seventh installment, Simón Rodríguez is recognized as a great
                                                    precursor of our American pedagogical thought, as a fighter for the
                                                    emancipation of Latin America and for public education for all as a form of
                                                    social progress. His philosophy favored the equality in education as he
                                                    believed this was a right for all citizens. He highlights his conception of
                                                    equality, which was not restrictive as he believed that equality started in
                                                    educational practices. He sacrificed all his belongings and left everything for
                                                    his ideals. In the miniseries,

José Vasconcelos Calderón

   Vasconcelos Calderón was a Mexican lawyer, politician, writer,
educator, public official and philosopher. He was part of the
revolutionary movement led by Francisco Madero, which promoted the
democratic transformation of a country that, at that time, was shaken
by the dictatorships of Porfirio Díaz Mori. As a result of a political setup,
Vasconcelos became Secretary of Education of the Federal Government
(1921-1924). His management in this position is distinguished as short
and intense, since there he carried out, with the support of Gabriela
Mistral, his most recognized work, promoting high culture, rural literacy
missions and muralism as ways of recovering Latin American roots. His
work, The Cosmic Race, is considered a condensation of his position in
favor of mestizaje, which is the biological and cultural encounter or its
arrangement between different ethnic groups, in which they mix,
giving birth to new species of families and new genotypes. This was a
very controversial work as it was not aligned with the thinking of the
people from this time.

                                                                                                                             Image 3.10

José Carlos Mariátegui

Mariátegui, La Chira, was a Peruvian writer, journalist and political thinker, a prolific author despite his early

death. He is also known in his country by the name of El Amauta. He was one of the main scholars of Socialism

in Latin America.

                               "The revolution is not only the fight for bread, but also the conquest

                               of beauty" is a representative phrase of José Carlos Mariátegui, which

                               marks the beginning of the installment referring to the Peruvian writer,

                               journalist and intellectual. At first, the documentary goes through what

                               is considered his first school, recounting his initial steps in the writing

                               of the newspaper La Razón, where he grew as a journalist and became

                               involved in workers' struggles and reformist ideals. Then it is analyzed

                               how during his exile in Europe, Mariátegui was nurtured by Marxist

                               ideas, the struggles of Italian workers and began to work on the notion

                               of indigenism as a creative and revolutionary myth. During his return, it

                               is stated that he strengthened his political proposal of autochthonous

                               socialism, marked by a juxtaposition between Marxist theory, Latin

                               Americanism and indigenism, with a strong emphasis also on gender

                               equality and the depatriarchalizing of educational practices. These

                               aspects are present in its most important editorial offering, Amauta. In

                               1928, he created the Peruvian Socialist Party and published Seven

Image 3.11                     Interpretive Essays on Peruvian Reality, from which he criticized the
                               liberal model of education (which placed the problem of indigenous

people in education) and the lack of their recognition as subjects of law.

José Julián Martí Pérez

   Martí Pérez was a writer and politician of Cuban origin.
Democratic republican politician, thinker, journalist, philosopher
and Cuban poet, creator of the Cuban Revolutionary Party and
organizer of the War of 95 or Necessary War, named after the Cuban
War of Independence. He suffered the vicissitudes of critical
thought from a very young age, when he was imprisoned and
exiled. Strongly involved in the struggles against Spanish
colonization and US interference in the Caribbean, he claimed
Bolivarian principles. His political and educational thought is
described through four topics: the decolonization of Latin American
knowledge, the formation of good people and the role of love in
pedagogy, the special place given to creative work and the recovery
of Latin American identity. In 1892, a time of exile, he founded the
Cuban Revolutionary Party as a tool for the independence of the
island and finally died on the battlefield years later.

Jorge J. E. Gracia                                                    Image 3.12

Gracia was born in Cuba in 1942 and was a Cuban refugee in the USA. He studied at both Universidad de
La Habana and Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes San Alejandro in Havana before moving to the U.S., where
he earned a degree in philosophy from Wheaton College in 1965. He went on to receive a master's degree
in philosophy from University of Chicago in 1966, a licentiate in medieval studies from Pontifical Institute of
Medieval Studies in 1970 and his doctorate in medieval philosophy from University of Toronto in 1971.

   Gracia's areas of research included metaphysics, ethnic and racial issues, philosophy of religion, and medieval
and Latin American philosophy. These topics led him to author over 20 books and edit more than two dozen
volumes of works by others. One of his most notable contributions was his 1984 edited anthology on Latin
American philosophy, "Philosophical Analysis in Latin America," which was the first work of its kind published in
English by a philosopher.

   Beyond his vast collection of writings, he was also a leader for many important organizations. He was the
founding chair for the American Philosophical Association's Committee for Hispanics in Philosophy and sat
as president of the Society for Medieval and Renaissance Philosophy, Society for Iberian and Latin American
Thought, American Catholic Philosophical Association and the Metaphysical Society of America.

   Gracia worked for the State University of New York at Buffalo from 1971 until he retired in January 2020 as
SUNY Distinguished Professor and Samuel P. Capen Chair in the departments of philosophy and comparative
literature.

Héctor-Neri Castañeda

Castañeda was a Guatemalan American philosopher who emigrated to the U.S. in 1948 as a refugee. He
attended the University of Minnesota to earn his bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees.

   After graduating with his PhD, Castañeda studied at Oxford University for a year before returning to the U.S.
to work at Duke University for a short period of time. He went on to work at Wayne State University, where he
founded the philosophical journal Noûs, which is still in production to this day.

                                                                                                                                              Educational Philosophies | 65
   Eventually, he moved to Indiana University in 1969 and became the Mahlon Powell Professor of philosophy as
well as that university's first dean of Latino affairs.

   Castañeda is most notable for developing the guise theory, which applies to the analysis of thought, language
and the structure of the world through abstract objects. He is also credited with the discovery of the concept
of the quasi-indexical or quasi-indicator. This is a linguistic expression in which a person referencing another
can shift from context to context, much like in the way `you' can refer to a specific person in one context and
another person in a different context.

   In addition to his research, he was awarded a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation and received
grants from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and the National
Science Foundation. He was also given the Presidential Medal of Honor by the government of Guatemala in
1991, among many other accomplishments.

Conclusion

Like learning, teaching is always developing; it is never realized once and for all. Our public schools have always
served as sites of moral, economic, political, religious and social conflict and assimilation into a narrowly defined
standard image of what it means to be an American. According to Britzman (as quoted by Kelle, 1996), "the

66 | Educational Philosophies
context of teaching is political, it is an ideological context that privileges the interests, values, and practices
necessary to maintain the status quo." Teaching is by no means "innocent of ideology," she declares. Rather, the
context of education tends to preserve "the institutional values of compliance to authority, social conformity,
efficiency, standardization, competition, and the objectification of knowledge" (p. 66-67).

   It should be no surprise then that contemporary debates over public education continue to reflect our
deepest ideological differences. As Tyack and Cuban (1995) have noted in their historical study of school reform,
the nation's perception toward schooling often "shift[s]... from panacea to scapegoat" (p. 14). We would go a long
way in solving academic achievement and closing educational gaps by addressing the broader structural issues
that institutionalize and perpetuate poverty and inequality.

          "It becomes imperative to understand how to build positive social relationships that signal to the
       brain a sense of physical, psychological and social safety so that learning is possible."

          -Zaretta Hammond, 2014

     Learning Objectives
          · Identify the many ways in which students, educational staff and communities differ
          · Describe bilingual learning and the importance of honoring different cultures, languages, races,
             religions
          · Learn about motivation and the factors which influence student's success in the classroom
          · Articulate ways that interactions among differences in learning, trauma histories, and language
             acquisition create a power dynamic in the classroom
                                                                                                                            Students, Educators and Community | 69
          · Identify the effects of childhood trauma on student learning and behavior
          · Articulate trauma informed practices and explain the value of using them in a diverse classroom
          · Reflect on the importance of building relationships with your students

When you imagine your future classroom, what does it look like? In what ways will your students be alike? In
what ways will they be different?

   The dimensions along which your future students will differ are numerous and vary widely. There are many
ethnic and cultural factors to consider, such as gender, religion, ethnicity and language. What effect will
this have on the learning environment and climate of your classroom? Additionally, your students will have
differences in styles of learning, degrees of motivation, emotional well-being, wealth, access to resources, and
social skills amongst others. Students also vary in need, and could have cognitive and, or physical impairments.
Many of your students will embody several of these characteristics at the same time. Other factors reflect where
a student is from, including their cultural values and heritage. The environment also plays a role in student
disposition. For example, the student's home life and experiences help to shape what they bring with them
to the classroom setting. Regardless of the origin or type of factors that work together to make each student
unique, a well-prepared teacher needs to be knowledgeable of how student diversity affects their classroom
and their teaching. This chapter will review the array of student differences, with specific attention to the needs
of emergent bilingual students, and the importance of childhood trauma and social and emotional learning in
today's classrooms.

4.1 Autobiography

Across the United States, the tapestry of the K-12 student population has changed dramatically over the last
twenty years and is continuing to evolve. For example, in 2019, bilingual students constituted an average of 14.8
percent of total public school enrollment in cities, 10.0 percent in suburban areas, 7.0 percent in towns, and 4.4
percent in rural areas. As a future teacher, it is important to think about the student population you will be
working with in the future.

   This section will explore key issues related to getting to know your students' biographies. This exploration
of student biographies begins with an understanding of our own autobiographical narrative. We will build on
our autobiographical narratives by learning more about ourselves as learners, and how our own learning styles
could influence our future instructional practices.

Autobiographical Narratives

Every student brings unique talents and skills to the classroom. As educators, it is our job to find out what these
talents are so that we can build upon them within the classroom. According to Herrera (2010), "understanding
the core aspects of each student is essential to the process of identifying the skills and knowledge that he or
she brings to the classroom" (p. 7). Autobiographical narratives are one of the key tools that educators can use
to learn about the core aspects of each individual student biography.

   Autobiographical narratives pull from research on Biography Driven Instruction (BDI). Biography-Driven
Instruction (Herrera, 2016) is a communicative method of teaching and learning that helps teachers understand
and maximize assets of the student biography to provide a more culturally responsive approach to teaching.

Creating Autobiographical Narratives

Consider writing autobiographical narratives at the beginning of the term and revisit near the end. Reflect on
your growth: How has your thinking evolved? What have you learned about yourself this term?

   When creating autobiographical narratives, it is essential to consider the student population for whom you
wish to develop the narratives with, as this will largely influence the design of your own narrative. For example,
students at the Kindergarten level will need a much different autobiographical narrative than students in 12th
grade. In addition, you will want to think about how much information you would like to gather directly from
the students. Depending on the age, needs, and even language proficiency levels of your students, some
autobiographical narratives can be added to/completed by parents or primary caregivers.

   Once you have established these basic parameters, you will want to determine what information you would
like to gather. This information can range from very general to very specific. A good recommendation is that
you try to gather information about each of the following four dimensions of the students biography:

 1. Sociocultural (SC)

         Where were they born?
         Where were they raised?
         Are they in foster care?
         Who is their caregiver?
         What kinds of activities reflect their livelihood, inclusive of jobs and hobbies?
         Who are the most important people in their lives?

2. Linguistic (LG)

         What is their first language?
         What is their second language?
         What do they consider their strengths/weaknesses to be when it comes to language?

 3. Academic (AC)

         Where did they go to school?
         What special programs were they involved in at school?
         Did they participate in any sports?
         What did they like most/least about school?

4. Cognitive (COG)

         What is the student's learning style?
         What do they consider their strengths when it comes to learning?
         What do they struggle with when it comes to studying?

As part of this course, you may be asked to complete your own autobiographical narrative. When creating it,
please keep the above four dimensions in mind. Each dimension plays a critical role in defining who you are as
an individual and future teacher.

                                                                                                                             Students, Educators and Community | 71

Applaying Autobiographical Narratives

Using insights gleaned from students' autobiographical narratives, teachers have the knowledge they need to
make critical adaptations to their instructional practices to better meet the needs of their student populations.
A few of these adaptations have been identified below based on the potential information that could have been
learned about the four dimensions of the student biography.

 1. Sociocultural (SC)

         Invite family members, caregivers, or foster parents in to share information about their cultural
            background.

         Ask a family member, caregivers, or foster parents to share expertise related to their professional
            practices.

         Have the student share information about another city, state, or country they may have lived in and/or
            traveled to at some point in their lives.

2. Linguistic (LG)

         Have students use their first language to promote development/transfer as they acquire English.
         Provide specific interventions for students to help them address areas where they may be struggling.
         Capitalize on students strengths' and make them language models for the class.

3. Academic (AC)

         Build on prior academic experiences to support new learning in the classroom.
         Promote active engagement in school activities, sports, and/or other programs.

4. Cognitive (COG)

         Incorporate multiple learning styles.
72 | Students, Educators and Community
         Provide learning strategies to support students in and outside the classroom setting.

These are just a few ways you can apply the information learned from autobiographical narratives in the
classroom.

   Individually brainstorms some additional ways you might use the information from autobiographical
narratives. Write down at least three ideas on a separate sheet of paper.

   Beyond the extensive list of diverse elements above, as an educator, one will also be faced with the variations
of ways in which students learn, feel about themselves as learners, and are motivated to learn. In future courses
that you will take to prepare yourself for being the best possible teacher, you will learn much more about these
factors, but for our purposes, let's take a brief look at each of these.

4.2 Student Diversity

As you were reflecting at the beginning of this chapter, when you envision your future classroom full of
students, you can ask again some questions such as: what does it look like? It may help to consider your
past experiences in classrooms. How does it sound? What do your students have in common? How do they
differ? Reflecting on these questions is valuable. Hopefully, you will come to understand that you are not
going to be teaching a class of students, as much as a collection of individuals, each with their own strengths,
talents, weaknesses, personalities and needs. There are many ways in which your future students may differ.
The following is a brief overview of some of the myriad factors that will make your students unique and, in some
cases, challenging.

   As defined by the National Education Association,
diversity is "the sum of the ways that people are both alike
and different" (para. 1). The NEA goes on to list a variety of
dimensions that are included in diversity. Some of these
are: "race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, language,
culture, religion, mental and physical ability, class and
immigration status" (para. 1, www.nea.org, n.d.). It is such
diversity that creates both richness and challenge within a
classroom. The variety of students in one's classroom
provide many opportunities for learning and growth for
everyone in that community. Concurrently, such diversity
brings with it many related challenges such as the need for Image 4.2
differentiated learning techniques to meet the needs of
every student. Individual perspectives relating to diversity can provide the fuel for bullying and harassment of
students. And these are just two potential issues; there are many more.

     Pause and Ponder - Diversity

        Race · Ethnicity · Sexual Orientation · Language · Culture · Religion · Mental and Physical Ability ·
     Socioeconomic Status · Immigration Status

                                                                                                                             Students, Educators and Community | 73
          · What does each of these mean to you?
          · Where do you fit in each of these categories?
          · What was your school like regarding these aspects of diversity?
          · Is anything missing?

Another term we encounter often regarding today's classrooms is multicultural. When you think of the word
culture, what comes to mind? The word means different things to different people. Culture includes the many
things that combine to make one community or group distinct from another, such as their values, clothing,
religion, holidays, traditions, language, music, literature, beliefs and expectations (Alsubaie, 2015; Perso, 2012). If
we understand culture that way, it is clear that everyone is coming from their own unique cultural experience,
including students and teachers. The culture of the teacher and the students in one classroom will affect the
education process found there (Alsubaie, 2015).

   It is, therefore, very important to seek to understand both your own background and cultural beliefs and those
of your students. As stated by Alsubaie (2015) "teachers who learn more about their students' backgrounds,
cultures and experiences will feel more capable and efficient in their work as teachers" (p. 88). The more aware
you become of your own personal set of beliefs, values and expectations, and even of your own biases, the better
able you will be to seek to understand your future students. In addition to learning about student experiences
and backgrounds, it is also important to address what drives students to seek knowledge and motivation.

     Activity - Diversity

        You might identify your own attitudes toward diversity by remembering certain pivotal moments in
     your life. Ask yourself the following questions:

          · Recall the incident in which you first became aware of differences. What was your reaction?
             Were you the focus of attention or were others? How did that affect how you reacted to the
             situation?

          · What are the "messages" that you learned about various "minorities" or "majorities" when you
             were a child? At home? In school? Have your views changed considerably since then? Why or why
             not?

          · Recall an experience in which your own difference puts you in an uncomfortable position vis-à-
             vis the people directly around you. What was that difference? How did it affect you?

          · How do your memories of differences affect you today? How do they (or might they) affect your
             teaching?

        (The Regents of the University of Michigan, 2016)

74 | Students, Educators and Community
4.3 Motivation

Motivation to learn is very complex, and includes cultural background, our own developmental level, beliefs
in the value of learning (in general or something in particular) and the belief in our ability to be successful
(academic-self-concept comes into play here). In future classes, you will study educational psychology. One
definition from that discipline for motivation is as follows:

   "Motivation is an internal state that activates, guides and sustains behavior. Educational psychology research
on motivation is concerned with the volition or will that students bring to a task, their level of interest and
intrinsic motivation, the personally held goals that guide their behavior, and their belief about the causes of
their success or failure."

   As a teacher, you are tasked with helping to motivate your students to learn. As you just learned with the
autobiography narratives, it is best to begin by knowing about yourself first so that you can enhance a student's
unique talents and skills to the classroom. You need to learn about their histories, background and culture in
order to understand what motivates them.

   One of the most difficult aspects of becoming a teacher is learning how to motivate your students. Some
educators and even researchers state that students who lack that intrinsic motivation will not learn effectively.
They won't retain information; they won't participate; and, some of them may even become disruptive. However,
in her book Cultivating Genius, Dr. Gholdy E. Muhammad states: "For one, I have never met an unmotivated
child in my years working with youth. I have, however, "met" unmotivating curriculum and instruction." (p.65).
Therefore, as educators, it is our responsibility to start including students, and a diverse workforce that includes
people of color when re-writing the curriculum.

     Pause and Ponder - Motivation

        Reflect on the different ways you were motivated as a student:
          · Was the focus on intrinsic or extrinsic motivation?
          · Were you motivated to succeed by cooperating with others?
          · Were you motivated to succeed as an individual?
          · Does competition or cooperation motivate you?
          · What challenges stand in the way of success?
          · Based on your experiences why is it important for you to understand about motivation?

Thus far, we have addressed the multiplicity of ways students are unique. Another way to enhance learning
involves the awareness of learning styles.

4.4 Learning Styles

Everyone has a way in which they feel that they learn best. It can be through listening, watching, touching or
doing, or a combination of any of them. This can also affect what tools best help a student in the classroom.
Some will do well just reading the textbook, some may need hands-on experiments, or charts and graphic

                                                                                                                             Students, Educators and Community | 75
organizers. There is no one size fits all approach to learning, which is one of the great challenges that teachers
face and one of the reasons why observation and relationships should be at the core of teaching.

     Pause and Ponder - Learning Styles

        Reflect on your learning style as a student:

          · In what way do you learn best?
          · How do you study?
          · What was your favorite subject, why?
          · Who was your favorite instructor, why?
          · How were your learning style and your friends' different?
          · Did you have friends who needed to take notes, while others learned just by listening to the

             teacher?

There are certainly many types of learning styles. Here are three theories theories that explain different learning
styles: Multiple Intelligence Theory, The VARK Approach, and The Equity Framework.

   Howard Gardner's Multiple Intelligence Theory recognizes that different people have different ways, or
combinations of ways, of relating to the world. Gardner explains eight different types of intelligence:

 1. Verbal (prefers words)
2. Logical (prefers math and logical problem solving)
 3. Visual (prefers images and spatial relationships)
4. Kinesthetic (prefers body movements and doing)
 5. Rhythmic (prefers music, rhymes)
6. Interpersonal (prefers group work)
 7. Intrapersonal (prefers introspection and independence)
8. Naturalist (prefers nature, natural categories)

Another approach to learning styles is called the VARK Approach, which focuses on learning through different
senses (Visual, Aural, Reading/Writing, and Kinesthetic):

  · Visual learners prefer images, charts, and the like.
  · Aural learners learn better by listening.
  · Reading/writing learners learn better through written language.
  · Kinesthetic learners learn through doing, practicing, and acting."

Another, and more current approach to learning is the Equity Framework from Dr. Gholdy E. Muhammad,
which focuses on reimagining the standards we set for teaching and learning. The four-layered equity
framework includes the learning goals of:

 1. Identity development
2. Skill development
 3. Intellectual development

76 | Students, Educators and Community
4. Criticality

Having an understanding that students come from different cultures, and learn differently based on their
educational values, will lead you to seek out many teaching strategies as well as realizing the importance of
observation and relationships. Taking the time to get to know your students and how they learn as well as
having a large toolkit of strategies, will help you to accommodate your students' needs. This can also be referred
to as differentiated learning or differentiated instruction. Differentiated instruction, according to Tomlinson (as
cited by Ellis, Gable, Greg & Rock, 2008, p. 32) is the process of "ensuring that what a student learns, how he
or she learns it, and how the student demonstrates what he or she has learned is a match for that student's
readiness level, interests, and preferred mode of learning." By the time you are ready to teach, you should be
prepared to observe, develop strong relationships and differentiate your instruction and all of this will be based
on your knowledge of your students and how they learn best.

   At this point, we have discussed the diverse perspectives of students and talked about their cultural
experiences, learning styles, motivation, and home settings. In addition to these factors, some students arrive
in the classroom with multiple ways of communicating; therefore, we are shifting our focus to bilingualism and
the historical context of language acquisition in the U.S.

4.5 Bilingualism - Emergent Bilinguals

Bilingualism is not a rare phenomenon; in fact, there are approximately 33 million bilingual people worldwide,
accounting for 43% of the population. - Pew Research Center, 2022.

   Bilingual education is not an invention of the 1960s. Contrary to popular misconception, earlier waves of
immigrants often enrolled their children in bilingual or non-English-language schools -- public and private. In
1839, Ohio became the first state to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at
parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico
Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850. By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed
similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as
diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee. Enrollment surveys at the turn of the 20th century
reported that at least 600,000 primary school students (public and parochial) were receiving part or all of their
instruction in the German language -- about 4% of all American children in the elementary grades. That's larger
than the percentage of students enrolled in Spanish-English programs today. (Until recently, German was the
dominant minority language.)

   However, political winds shifted during the World War I era. Fears about the loyalty of non-English speakers in
general, and of German Americans in particular, prompted a majority of states to enact English-only instruction
laws designed to "Americanize" these groups. Some went so far as to ban the study of foreign languages in the
early grades -- a restriction that was struck down as unconstitutional in 1923. Nonetheless, by the mid-1920s,
bilingual schooling was largely dismantled throughout the country. English-only instruction continued as the
norm for LEP students until its failure could no longer be ignored. LEP students in English-only classrooms were
falling behind in their academic studies and dropping out of school at alarming rates.

   The Bilingual Education Act of 1968 -- passed during an era of growing immigration and an energized
civil rights movement -- provided federal funding to encourage local school districts to try approaches
incorporating native-language instruction. Most states followed the lead of the federal government, enacting
bilingual education laws of their own or at least decriminalizing the use of other languages in the classroom.
Soon after, the Supreme Court recognized that leaving LEP students to "sink or swim" in English-only
classrooms made "a mockery of public education" -- which must be equally available to all students. The court's
decision in the landmark Lau v. Nichols case required schools to take "affirmative steps" to overcome language

                                                                                                                            Students, Educators and Community | 77
barriers impeding children's access to the curriculum. Congress immediately endorsed this principle in the
Equal Educational Opportunity Act of 1974.

     Deeper Dive - Demographics

        Bilinguals represent about 20 percent of the population in the United States. According to the US
     Census Bureau, in 2019 the five most frequently spoken languages in the home other than English are:

         1. Spanish or Spanish Creole
        2. Chinese
        3. Tagalog
        4. Vietnamese
        5. Arabic
        For more detailed information, visit What Languages Do We Speak in the United States?

Neither the Bilingual Education Act nor the Lau decision requires any particular methodology for teaching
LEP students. That is, there is no federal mandate for bilingual education (although a few states mandate
it under certain circumstances). What civil rights laws do require are educational programs that offer equal
opportunities for LEP children. To enforce this principle, the federal courts and the federal Office for Civil
Rights apply a three-step test to ensure that schools provide: · Research-based programs that are viewed as
theoretically sound by experts in the field; · Adequate resources -- such as staff, training, and materials -- to
implement the program; and · Standards and procedures to evaluate the program and a continuing obligation
to modify a program that fails to produce results. Politically inspired efforts to eliminate bilingual education,
such as the Unz initiative in California, would have a hard time passing this test. States or school districts that
persist in such civil rights violations could face severe sanctions, including the loss of all federal education
funding. This information is based on an analysis by the National Association of Bilingual Education.

   But what does it mean to be bilingual, and what are the terms that are used in the United States to refer to
students who are learning another language? According to Oxford Dictionary (2022), bilingualism is the ability
of an individual, or the members of a community, to use two languages effectively. In the United States, the
term English Language Learner (ELL) has been used predominantly as a label to students who are developing
their language proficiency in English. ELL is also the preferred term by state and federal agencies since it used
to determine protected status for students who fall under this category.

   However, the term ELL tends to devalue the language(s) in which these students are proficient. The term
emergent bilingual has begun to replace the term ELL because it values the funds of knowledge (see video
below) and language competencies the students already have while celebrating their identity as someone
becoming bilingual. Bilingualism or the students' emerging bilingualism is shown as an asset rather than a
deficit.

     Activity - Bilingualism

        Please read the following Poem in Spanish:
        En secreto
        recogí el vaso en que habías bebido
        y lo llevé a mi casa.
        Por las tardes, cuando llego del colegio,
        Lo coloco bajo el grifo
        Y veo flotar un beso en el agua.
        -Jairo Anibal Niño

        Reflect on the following guiding questions as you read and re-read the poem:
          · If you are native Spanish speaker, or learned Spanish as your second language, how did you feel
             when reading a poem in a language that was familiar to you?
          · How did your fluency level in Spanish make you feel? Why?
          · In what ways could you, as an instructor, help support the content to someone who might not
             understand Spanish?

While motivation, learning styles and bilingualism influence student learning, there is a growing body of
research which suggests that intellectual abilities can be developed and are not fixed. In this next section,
consider how one's presence of mind affects knowledge acquisition.

4.6 Growth Mindset or Fixed Mind-set?

Students' mindsets indicate how well and how much they are able to learn. Psychologist Carol Dweck, (2008)
defines a growth mindset as the increase in ability to learn when a learner accepts that they may improve, and
this improvement will lead to increased ability to learn more. Effort is valued because effort and self-efficacy lead
to knowing more and therefore having more ability to learn. Individuals with a growth mindset also ask for help
when needed and respond well to constructive feedback. In contrast, individuals with a fixed mindset assume
that some people naturally have more ability than others and nothing can be done to change that. Individuals
with a fixed mindset often view effort in opposition to ability ("Smart people don't have to study") and so do
not try as hard and are less likely to ask for help since they believe that asking questions indicates that they
are not smart. There are individual differences in students' beliefs about their views of intelligence. However,

                                                                                                                            Students, Educators and Community | 79
teachers' beliefs and classroom practices influence these students' perceptions, behaviors, and willingness to
adopt a growth mindset.

   Teachers with a growth mindset believe that the goal of learning is mastering the material and figuring things
out. Assessment is used by these teachers to understand what students know so they can decide whether to
move to the next topic, re-teach the entire class, or provide remediation for a few students. Assessment also
helps students understand their own learning and demonstrate their competence. Teachers with these views
say things like, "We are going to practice over and over again. That's how you get good. And you're going to
make mistakes. That's how you learn" (Patrick, Anderman, Ryan, Edelin, & Midgley, 2001, p. 45).

   In contrast, teachers with a fixed mindset are more likely to believe that the goal of learning is doing
well on tests - and especially outperforming others. These teachers are more likely to say things that imply
fixed abilities such as, "This test will determine what your math abilities are," or stress the importance of
interpersonal competition, "We will have speech competition and the top person will compete against all the
other district schools and last year the winner got a big award and their photo in the paper." When teachers
stress competition some students will be motivated; however, there can only be a few winners so there are
many more students who believe they have no chance of winning. Another problem with competition as an
assessment is that the focus can become winning rather than understanding the material.

   Teachers who view assessment as promoting and developing learning rather than as a means of ranking
students, or awarding prizes to those who did very well, or catching those who did not pay attention, are likely
to enhance student willingness to identify and correct gaps in learning and understanding.

     Critical Lens - Growth Mindset

        The growth mindset encourages educators to praise student's efforts and not necessarily their ability.
     Dr. J.Luke Wood critiques this approach and states that the growth mindset is deficient as an approach
     that does not call out, explicitly, for students, that sometimes no matter how hard one works, a racist
     and classist system might inhibit their ability to succeed. He argues that the concept is incomplete and
     that it hurts students of color, especially boys.

        In the article Prominent Scholar Calls Growth Mindset A "Cancerous" Idea, In Isolation, Dr. Wood
     states: "if you are a person who has never been told that you have the ability to do the work, how will
     you be able to do so? We need to praise their effort and ability. If you come from a community where
     you have never received messages like that from faculty members and educators, it's important at
     some point to be able to hear, you know what? You have the ability to do this. I believe in your ability to
     do this."

        Therefore, it is important for educators to look at student's strengths and praise their effort and
     ability.

When thinking about what drives each individual student, it's essential to also think about a set of basic human
needs. One theory to consider is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.

   We will learn more in depth about Maslow's Hierarchy of needs in a later chapter. However, it is appropriate
here to add a brief overview of his research and findings as it relates to student's motivation. Maslow's hierarchy
of needs is represented below. At the base of the pyramid are all of the physiological needs that are necessary
for survival. These are followed by basic needs for security and safety, the need to be loved and to have a sense
of belonging, and the need to have self-worth and confidence.

80 | Students, Educators and Community
   According to Maslow's theory, humans have several innate needs and those needs are ranked in terms of
a hierarchy. If one of these needs is not achieved, it will rule the individual's life. If we are talking about our
diverse students, we need to understand different cultures and their unique values. For instance, countries such
as the United States whose culture looks for a significant set of rules and guidelines in their lives, might have
safety as the top of their pyramids. On the other hand, Latin American countries, well known for their nurturing
characteristics, might have social needs at the top of their pyramid.

   Among the plethora of distinct values across cultures, we are going to highlight research from Zaretta
Hammond and Geert Hofstede.

   The research of Zaretta Hammond (2015) addresses the difference between collectivistic vs individualistic
cultures and its impact on motivation. "Collectivistic societies emphasize relationships, interdependence within
a community, and cooperative learning. Individualistic societies emphasize individual achievement and
independence" (Hammond, 2015, p. 25).

In addition to individualist and collectivist communities noted above, students bridge home and school cultures
as they walk into the classroom each day. In fact, upon entering any U.S. public school today, you will likely
see evidence that our schools have become very diverse and that students from diverse cultures are present in
our educational system. However, we need to ask if all our students are included in our learning. We can think
of different learning styles and motivation, but have we ever thought about different cultures and how these
impact our teaching and learning?

   Think about how you might approach each child, while learning and respecting their culture and values, in
order to improve your interactions with them. An easy or flexible child will not need much extra attention unless
you want to find out whether they are having difficulties that have gone unmentioned. A slow to warm up child
may need to be given advance warning if new people or situations are going to be introduced. Some students
might be perceived as unmotivated or feisty; therefore, we may need to give them extra attention and make
them feel welcome. Rather than believing that discipline alone will bring about improvements in children's
behavior, our knowledge of our students, their cultures, along with the curriculum we use, may help a teacher
and all the educators to gain insight to work more effectively with a child.

     following TedTalk and reflect on another way to embrace culture and learning styles.

4.7 Childhood Trauma

Earlier, we mentioned how a student's environment, including characteristics and situations present in their
home setting also impact students. You can now see how many factors combine to create each unique student
that you will teach, as well as how challenging it can be to meet the needs of such a variety of learners. Another
external issue which new teachers should be aware of is that of childhood trauma. While there is enough
information on this topic to fill its own textbook, having a brief overview of the information will be beneficial to
your understanding of a diverse array of students.

                                                                                                                            Students, Educators and Community | 83
What is Trauma?

The brain responds to many different stimuli. Using the metaphor of a house, we can imagine that the brain
has an upstairs section and a downstairs section. The upstairs part of the brain is called the Prefrontal Cortex
(PFC). This part of the brain controls many of the academic skills teachers expect of students such as planning,
impulse control, executive functioning and organization. The downstairs portion of the brain consists of the
Limbic system including our Amygdala. The Amygdala is involved in the brain's fight or flight response. Over
time, we were conditioned to be in survival mode. When the body experiences a traumatic event, such as
abuse, or another highly stressful event, the upstairs portion or Prefrontal cortex shuts down and the body
depends on the downstairs brain. When this happens, the executive functioning, planning and decision
making portion of the brain becomes inoperable. Of course, smaller doses of stress, such as the ability to focus
under pressure while playing sports or performing a musical piece can be beneficial because the brain is able to
release cortisol and this can actually aid in our performance. However, higher levels of stress can be poisonous
for our bodies.

   According to the Child Welfare Information Gateway (2014), trauma is "an emotional response to an intense
event that threatens or causes harm. This harm can be physical or emotional, real or perceived, and it can
threaten a child or someone close to him or her. Trauma can be a result of a single event, or it can result from
exposure to multiple events over time" (p. 2). There are many events that might possibly cause trauma.

   These include, but are not limited to physical, emotional or sexual abuse, neglect, effects of poverty, being
separated from your loved ones, bullying, domestic or community violence through which harm to a loved one
or pet has been witnessed, accidents, natural disasters, and behavior that is unpredictable dur to addiction or
mental illness (Child Information Gateway, 2014, p. 2). A traumatic experience is very often overwhelming to the
individual, extremely painful or frightening, and includes a loss of control and the inability to regulate one's
emotions. It is vital to remember that a traumatic experience overwhelms one's ability to cope and that this can
be different for each person. Therefore, due to a variety of factors (such as resilience) what might be traumatic to
one student might not be to another. Again, this is not a "one size fits all" scenario. Each student is an individual.
In fact, students may be supported by other forms of external guidance. Examples of structural support can
come from extended family members, mentors, peers, counselors, and school staff members.

How Trauma Affects the Brain

There is no shortage of information regarding how trauma affects brain development, but very basically, "when
a stressful experience (such as being abused, neglected, or bullied) overwhelms the child's natural ability to
cope" this can cause a "fight, flight or freeze" response. This response results in changes in the body, including
an accelerated heart rate and higher blood pressure. This also results in changes in how the brain "perceives
and responds to the world". The result of this can be that the "trauma interferes with normal development and
can have long lasting effects" (above information from Child Welfare Information Gateway, 2014, p. 2).

How Trauma Affects Learning and Classroom Environment

There are many different types of trauma. It is estimated that by the age of 16, approximately 2 out of
every 3 children will experience a traumatic event, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration. At least 1 in 7 children experienced child abuse or neglect, and these statistics are
underreported, so this figure is likely to be higher. As a result, students who enter the classroom may have
feelings of anxiety and may be triggered to get into fight or flight mode.

84 | Students, Educators and Community
   A variety of learning related tasks are affected by trauma.
Students who have experienced trauma may have
difficulty regulating emotions. They may have impaired
cognitive functions. The ability to organize material
sequentially may be difficult. Transitions may be
problematic. Problem solving might be hard. They may be
self-protective, easily frustrated, and have inconsistent
moods. This is just a brief non-inclusive list of some of the
ways in which your classroom could be impacted by
students with a background of child trauma.

                                                                Image 4.4

Trauma Informed Practice-Trauma
Informed Care

Educators can begin to understand how to address issues of trauma when interacting with students. The first
step is to build and foster a strong relationship with students. Developing a caring atmosphere allows students
to feel safe. When you notice changes in student behavior, you can begin to assess the situation and employ
strategies to help students. While this list is not meant to be exhaustive, here are some factors educators can
look for.

   There are many different signs of trauma in students:

  · Overreactions to everyday challenges
  · Negative outbursts or aggression
  · Frequent stomach aches or headaches
  · Appearing very sad
  · Inappropriate social interactions
  · Trouble with executive functions like focus, organization, and self-regulation
  · Falling behind with classwork

Trauma Informed Care is a term used with patients in a clinical setting which includes the desire to have a
complete understanding of a patient's situation and life history. While the classroom is not a clinical setting,
having an awareness of the characteristics, behaviors, and family life of a student can greatly help to inform
educator decision making in the classroom.

   Some students can exhibit difficult behaviors because of
their backgrounds while some will not. All students need to
be understood and supported. According to the Substance
Abuse for Mental Health Administration (2014), the
components of trauma-informed care consist of the
creation of a safe environment, supporting and teaching
emotional regulation and building relationships and
connectedness. Knowing your student is vital. Trying to
understand your students' trigger points is also of key
importance. "An emotional trigger point is an event, thing,
experience, potentially even an individual who cause the
mind and body to react" (Baton Rouge Behavioral
Hospital). Keep in mind that students sometimes have

                                                                                                       Image 4.5
strong reactions to external stimuli and that they are not

                                                                                                                            Students, Educators and Community | 85
trying to push your buttons (We Are Teachers Staff, 2018). Student behaviors are often the result of being
triggered by something (such as a loud noise or yelling) that may not startle another student. The primary
function of the triggered response is to help the child achieve safety in the face of perceived danger. Seek first
to understand the child's behavior and change your thinking from "what is wrong with this student?" to "what
has this student been through?" (Bashant, 2016).

   If relationship building, support, understanding and the creation of a safe environment (which all are unique
to the needs of each child) are key to working with your students, what doesn't work is equally apparent. Sadly,
it is often the first thing educators turn to when these behaviors appear. The research is clear that punishment
of this behavior not only does not work, it is highly detrimental to the student. According to NEA Today (2016),
because traumatic experiences directly shape your students' brains, the disruptive behavior that is witnessed
and often punished isn't willful disobedience or defiance, but a subconscious effort to self-protect. Students
whose behavior is perceived as disruptive may be acting out because their brains are screaming: Flight! Flee!
Freeze! Their goal is to be safe. Respond in ways that help to make your students feel connected and safe first,
and then revisit possible consequences for any broken rules.

          Starr Commonwealth Chief Clinical Officer, Dr. Caelan Soma (2018) offered these tips for
       understanding and working with students who have experienced trauma.

           1. They are not trying to push your buttons.
          2. They worry about what is going to happen next.
           3. Even if the situation doesn't seem that bad to you, it is how the child feels that matters, not

                how you feel.
          4. Trauma does not always have to be associated with violence
           5. You don't need to know how the trauma was caused to be able to help.
          6. They need to feel that they are good at something and that they can have a positive

                influence on the world.
           7. There is a direct connection between stress and learning.
          8. Self-regulation is a challenge.
          9. You can ask kids directly what you can do to help them make it through the day.
         10. Be supportive of students with trauma even when they are outside of your classroom.

   There are numerous videos, books, and articles regarding trauma informed best practices. At the end of this
chapter, there is a link to the National Child Traumatic Stress Networks Child Trauma Toolkit for Educators. This
free and easy to download resource has numerous tips and suggestions for teachers.

   In addition to implementing elements of trauma-informed practice into teaching, educators must also
recognize and reflect upon their own cultural and racial biases when interacting with marginalized students.
For example, when we conceptualize the idea of trauma, we sometimes do not consider the ways in which
the historical and socioeconomic disparities have impacted specific groups of students for generations. For
example, Native American students may have experienced school settings which have forced them into schools
where they had to assimilate into federally mandated boarding schools. For many Native American students,
attending a school where they had to be isolated from their families is, in fact, a traumatic event. The effects
of these historical events continue to impact Native American communities. According to the Suicide Abuse
and Mental Health Services Adminstration, the rate of suicide is nearly four times higher for Native Americans
between the ages of 15-24 than that of their white counterparts.

   Although trauma-informed care continues to be promoted in some schools, educators must think carefully

about the communities they serve when implementing these practices in schools.
   For example, using aspects of trauma-informed care, educators must attend to the values of Native American

students and integrate the "cultural traditions of valuing reciprocal relationships with all living things" into their
practice. Teachers must develop an understanding of the experiences of Native students in school and how
families approach the tradition of schooling in America. Instead of focusing on the traumatic experiences of
communities, continue to view the assets students bring with them into the classroom.

Relationship Building

Over the course of your journey to become a teacher you will most likely learn a lot about the value of
forming positive relationships with your students. It may seem like a "no-brainer", but its importance cannot
be overstated. According to the Room 241 Team (Concordia University Portland, 2018), "...for children who have
been affected by trauma, strong connections are vital. Rich relationships with teachers help children form
the foundations of resilience" (para. 3). Venet (2018) echoed the value of relationship building as part of the
delicate balancing act of working with trauma-affected students. The author stated that "...students who have
experienced trauma, start by flipping the traditional classroom paradigm: Relationships have to come before
content..." (para. 6). The more you know and understand your students, the better equipped they will be to face
the challenges of learning.

          Ten ways that a teacher can build relationships with their students:
           1. Greet each student every day with both a hello and a good-bye.
          2. Use letters and questionnaires to help you find out about your students.
           3. Get parent input if you can.
          4. Appeal to your students' interests.
           5. Speak to students with respect.
          6. Attend after school activities.
           7. Let students inside your world (with appropriate boundaries, of course).
          8. Let your students have a voice.
          9. Be real.
         10. Trust that they will all do great things
          Connell (2016)

   In consideration of teacher-student relationships, be sure to always remember the importance of listening. So

and valued. It can make all the difference in the world.

Conclusion

Every year teachers will meet new groups of students. Every class consists of a unique combination of
individuals. They will vary by many factors related to diversity. Some will have experienced many childhood
traumas, while some will have experienced few or none. Their experience and maturity in relation to social
emotional learning will differ as well. However, one thing will remain constant. Your students will do best
in a positive environment where mutual respect is fostered. Strong teacher-student relationships are the
cornerstone of these classrooms. Having knowledge about yourself, child development and differentiated
instruction will help you to have a greater understanding of your students. You will be learning this as you move
forward in your education. What you cannot be taught is to care about forging these relationships in the first
place. That must already be a part of who you are.

5. Building a Classroom Community

          "To teach in a manner that respects and cares for the souls of our students is essential if we are to
       provide the necessary conditions where learning can most deeply and intimately begin..."

          bell hooks, 1994

                           Image 5.1
     Learning Objectives

          · Differentiate between classroom management and creating an equitable classroom
             community for all students

92 | Building a Classroom Community
          · Identifying key components to constructive communication
          · Identify basic principles for learning and academic achievement in building a collaborative

             classroom environment that honors all identities
          · Name several steps to respond to conflicts and behavior issues in the classroom that includes

             restorative justice
          · Describe contemporary issues that affect the classroom environment

When you think about your school days, what are your fond memories? Maybe the teacher who taught so well;
the teacher who connected deeply making you love the subject that you did not even think of; those study halls;
those fun club activities; and of course, your school friends! But, did you ever think how do the teachers make
this all happen? How was this teaching and learning possible, given the array of subjects you learn at school,
the variety of topics you cover in each subject, and the need to teach diverse students with different learning
abilities and needs? How did the teachers make their teaching effective?

   Many of you will agree that if you are to teach effectively and for students to learn, you may need to have a plan
to deliver your class. But keep in mind that you may have the best content-wise lesson plan for your class and
you may even have the best resources to deliver your instruction, however, if you want to be a successful teacher,
you need to also create the atmosphere for teaching and learning. Hence, in order to create an atmosphere for
learning, classroom management plan serves as a prerequisite for effective teaching and learning (Allen, 1996).

     Activity - Case Scenario

        Joey comes to school in the morning, and one of his classmates makes a negative comment about
     his shirt. It's already been a rough morning-he accidentally overslept his alarm and his grandma was
     yelling at him to hurry up so he wouldn't be late-so he snapped at his classmate, "Oh shut up." His
     teacher overhears and says, "We don't use that language at school, so now your card is on yellow." He
     tries to explain: "But he-" but his teacher interrupts. "Oh, now you're talking back to me? That's a red
     card and now you have a silent lunch."

        What do you think of the teacher's response? How might you approach Joey?

In the example above, you can see how some traditional approaches to behavior management-including
card-flipping systems and silent lunch-don't get to the root of the problem and actually can cause more
harm, making them ineffective practices. In this chapter, we will investigate and reflect on the elements of
the classroom environment, how trauma impacts classroom environments, critical community stakeholders in
classroom environments, and strategies for building a positive classroom environment.

                                                                                                                                  Building a Classroom Community | 93
5.1 Elements of classroom environment

In this section, we will differentiate between classroom management and efforts to create an equitable
classroom community for all students

   In order for students to be successful at school, we must first carefully craft a supportive, learning-centered
classroom environment. There are many aspects to consider when designing your classroom environment.
Some are within your direct control as an educator, and even though others might appear out of reach, when
you develop strong relationships with your students, you can do the imaginable.

   Let's focus on three specific things you can control as you craft your own classroom environment: physical
set-up, overall atmosphere, and student behavior and attitudes towards learning. Together, you may hear these
elements referred to as "classroom management." The idea behind this term is that you have certain systems in
your classroom that need to be "managed," or organized, in order to scaffold your students' success. However,
this term has had a lot of criticism lately as the word "management" holds a power dynamic that we want to
avoid in our classrooms. Instead, we want to create a welcoming environment that focuses on enhancing the
strengths of students.

  · Physical set-up: One component of classroom management is the physical arrangement of the room.
      Where will students keep their personal belongings? How will students access instructional materials
      throughout the day? A clear organizational system within the physical arrangement of the room is
      necessary. How are desks and tables arranged? Can all students easily see the teacher, classmates and the
      board? Are there spaces for students to participate in whole-group, small-group and individual learning?
         Are learning materials (including math
      manipulatives, paper, pencils, science notebooks, and
      books for reading) easily accessible and organized? Are
      students with disabilities able to access the materials
      and move around the classroom easily? Can emergent
      bilinguals understand where to access the materials?

  · Overall atmosphere: Does the classroom feel
      structured, warm, and welcoming, or does it feel cold,
      sterile, and depersonalized? Do students see
      themselves in the environment? Does it reflect their
      cultures, values and traditions? Does the teacher
      interact with students in positive ways that build their Image 5.2
      trust, or does the teacher yell at students and talk
      down to them? Do students feel like this is a "home" for them and their learning, or do they count down
      the hours each day until they can leave?

  · Agreements: Has the teacher created community agreements with students? Are there clear expectations
      of how students should learn in the classroom? Are the systems in place for students to respect their own
      learning and the learning of others? Is the teacher acknowledging the work that all of the students are
      doing individually and as a group? Are the agreements for all of the students, or are some students in
      certain groups offered more attention and maybe more rewards or more consequences compared with
      similar behaviors in their peers? Is there a communication system in place so educators, students, and
      families know these agreements and how the performance of their specific student measures up?

These elements are essential for new teachers to have at the forefront as this will ensure a proactive and warm
approach to creating a classroom environment. According to Canter, an assertive teacher "clearly and firmly
expresses their needs. They have positive expectations of students, and this is reflected in their words and
actions. Because they say what they mean and mean what they say, students know the limits in the classroom.

94 | Building a Classroom Community
When they must respond to inappropriate behavior, they are consistent and fair. Because students are not
required to play guessing games with the teacher, and because they consider the teacher as fair, the teacher is
respected and the teacher's expectations are met." (Canter, 2010)

   We talked about some elements that might be beyond the teacher's control in the classroom, such as trauma
that students may have experienced previously, or what resources families or communities have access to or
lack. However, as stated before, when teachers develop strong relationships with students and their families,
guiding them through the system and how to find support systems will be within your reach as an educator.

   Another example that may seem out of reach is that cultural differences manifest themselves as apparent
"misbehavior." For example, if an educator comes from a culture where young people should look their elders in
the eyes to show respect, they may accidentally label "misbehavior" in students who come from cultures where
avoiding eye contact is actually a sign of respect. Zaretta Hammond, in her book Culturally Responsive Teaching
and the Brain, states that we must use culture as a trust builder. In order for educators to understand about
culture and its impact on student-teacher relationship, she has created a visual called the Culture Tree.

                    online here: https://openoregon.pressbooks.pub/foundationsofeducation/?p=32#oembed-1

Video 5.1
   Watch the above video to understand the various levels of Hammond's Cultural Tree.
   Hammond's "cultural tree" identifies three levels of culture:

 1. Surface level (the leaves): This level is made up of cultural aspects you can see, like food, dress, etc.
2. Shallow culture (the trunk): This level includes cultural aspects that are less explicit, like concepts of time,

      personal space, and eye contact.
 3. Deep culture (the roots): This level is the collective unconscious, the beliefs and norms that provide the

      foundation for culture. Examples include concepts of fairness, concepts of self, and spirituality.

Therefore, the job of educators and teachers is to learn about different cultures and acknowledge those
differences in the classroom as well as share their own culture and experiences with students. This will allow
students to feel welcome and appreciated as well as develop a strong sense of belonging.

   Trauma, resources, and culture, sometimes are not considered as part of "creating a welcoming classroom
environment". However, these aspects have a big impact on the overall classroom environment, and therefore
are important to be aware of. For this reason, we intentionally refer to "classroom environment" throughout
this chapter because we feel it is more inclusive of the many contexts and systems that impact your students'
learning success.

     Critical Lens - Race and Classroom Management

        While we like to think of our classrooms as fair, equitable places when it comes to classroom
     management, the reality is that this isn't always true. Teachers of all races are more likely to punish
     Black students (Smith, 2015), and Black girls are seven times more likely to be suspended than White

                                                                                                                                 Building a Classroom Community | 95
     girls (Finley, 2017). Sometimes, getting in trouble at school is an entry point into the juvenile detention
     system, leading to what is known as the "school-to-prison pipeline." It is important for educators to be
     aware of these statistics and trends in order to proactively support all students' success within the
     classroom and beyond.

        What will you do to reflect on your own biases?

5.2 Trauma in the Educational Setting

In chapter 4, we explained in detail what it means for students to have trauma and its impact in the classroom
as well as the difficulty that students experience with regulating their emotions. Therefore, when thinking of
a classroom environment, teachers need to make sure they are creating a warm and welcoming environment
where all students can thrive.

   On the other hand, we need to focus on the trauma our students of color experience just for being students
of color. In her book Cultivating Genius, Gholdy Muhamad (2022), talks about racial trauma. She states that
educators talk a lot about emotional trauma or trauma from childhood but educators talk less about the effects
of racial trauma in schools for students. What happens when teachers think less about other people who share
the same race or identity of their students? Do teachers think this type of thinking never manifests or makes its
way into classrooms? We don't leave our racism, biases, political agendas, or ideologies at home when we enter
classroom spaces. When deficit thinking leads to trauma, our students may be affected for the rest of their lives.
Our young people may feel like they don't belong; they may feel worthless or that they are not good enough.
Their academics and engagement are negatively affected as a result. This can follow them throughout their
lives and disrupt their joy.

   Therefore, teachers need to self reflect on their own biases. They need to name them and work towards
disrupting this kind of thinking so that we can dismantle the systems of oppression that permeate our
institutions.

Adverse Childhood Settings

Our students, like Joey, come to school each day wearing an invisible backpack, filled with all of the experiences
they have had in life. Some of these invisible backpacks are light because our students' experiences thus far
have been loving, safe, and predictable. Unfortunately, too many of our students wear heavy backpacks full of
experiences that have been frightening, unpredictable, and unsafe. These experiences can be characterized
as Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs). Childhood exposure to abuse, neglect, and household dysfunction
may lead to increased social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties as well as decreased academic performance
in the educational environment. Additionally, traditional means of interventions and support may not be
successful in modifying behaviors for the long-term. Meeting the needs of our students impacted by adverse
childhood experiences requires a shift in the educational setting to focus on the consistent development
of healthy relationships between students and staff including the implementation of trauma-informed
classrooms and interventions.

   Learn more about ACEs according to Nadine Burke Harris in the following TedTalk:

ACES in the Classroom

Our students' invisible backpacks can be filled with experiences that weigh them down and impact their ability
to function successfully in the educational environment. These can be single-episode experiences, such as a
house fire or car accident, or the more complex experience of developmental traumas. Developmental traumas
can include ongoing physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, physical and emotional neglect, and household
dysfunction. Abuse is defined by a caregiver's action, or failure to act, resulting in death, significant physical
or emotional harm, or the exploitation of a child under the age of 18 (Child Welfare Information Gateway,
n.d.). Physical neglect can include failure to consistently meet basic needs such as food and shelter, as well
as failure to provide a safe, clean environment. Failure to provide adequate medical and dental care are also
forms of neglect, though families without resources are subject to these issues and, as a result, children
experience a lack of adequate care, beyond their families' control. Emotional neglect involves the failure to
meet or recognize a child's emotional needs. Household dysfunction is the most common adverse childhood
experience in childhood as many of the characteristics are often co-occurring. This category includes a variety
of factors impacting caregivers such as divorce or separation, alcohol and/or substance abuse, mental health
issues, domestic violence, and incarceration (Felitti et al., 1998).

          In Oregon, teachers are considered mandatory reporters even when they are outside of the school.
       That means that you are legally obligated to report any signs of abuse or neglect of a child to the
       appropriate authorities, which in this case is Child Protective Services. You can also report it to your
       supervisor and/or counselor so that they can guide you on how to report what you are concerned
       about. Failure to do so can lead to the loss of your job.

Bullying in the Classroom

While ACEs occur outside of the classroom setting, another element of trauma for students in school can be
bullying. In 2017, about 20 percent of students ages 12-18 reported being bullied at school during the school
year (U.S. Department of Justice, 2017). In order for behavior to be considered bullying, the behavior must be
aggressive and include:

 1. An imbalance of power. Students who bully use their power-such as physical strength, access to
      embarrassing information, or popularity-to control or harm others. Power imbalances can change over
      time and in different situations, even if they involve the same people.

                                                                                                                                 Building a Classroom Community | 97
2. Repetition of behavior. Bullying behaviors happen more than once and establish a pattern of behavior.
      One stand-alone hurtful comment or action is not the same as bullying.

There are generally three types of bullying: verbal bullying, social bullying, and physical bullying. Verbal bullying
is saying mean things and includes behaviors such as teasing, name calling, inappropriate sexual comments,
taunting and threatening to cause harm. Social bullying, sometimes referred to as relational bullying, involves
hurting someone's reputation or relationships. Social bullying includes leaving someone out on purpose, telling
other children not to be friends with someone, spreading rumors about someone, and/or embarrassing
someone in public. Physical bullying involves hurting a person's body or possessions. Physical bullying includes
behaviors such as kicking or hitting, spitting, tripping or pushing, taking or breaking someone's things, and/or
making rude or mean hand gestures. In 2017, about 42 percent of students who reported being bullied at school
indicated that the bullying was related to at least one of the following characteristics: physical appearance
(30%), race (10%), gender (8%), disability (7%), ethnicity (7%), religion (5%), and sexual orientation (4%) (U.S.
Department of Justice, 2017).

     Pause and Ponder - Bullying

          · What kinds of bullying have you seen/experienced/been a part of?
          · How did this make you feel?
          · Were you ever a bystander and did not intervene?
          · What did that feel like for you?

Cyberbullying, also referred to as electronic bullying, is bullying that takes place using electronic technology.
Examples of cyberbullying include mean text messages or emails, rumors sent by email or posted on social
networking sites, and embarrassing pictures, videos, websites, or fake profiles.

   Unlike traditional bullying, cyberbullying can happen 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and reach a student
even when they are alone. It can happen any time of day or night. Cyberbullying messages can be posted
anonymously and distributed quickly to a wide audience. It can be difficult and sometimes impossible to trace
the source. Deleting inappropriate or harassing messages, texts, and pictures can be extremely difficult after
they have been posted or sent.

In our increasingly technological world, instances of

cyberbullying are becoming more common. Cyberbullying is

particularly hard to control because it can happen anytime,

anywhere, and evidence of the original creator of hurtful content

can be deleted or obscured.Bullying and cyberbullying have

significant implications when it comes to trauma and our

students' school and life experiences. Children who are

cyberbullied or bullied in school are more likely to use drugs and

alcohol, skip school, be unwilling to attend school, receive poor

grades, have lower self-esteem and more health problems. There

can also be the most devastating of consequences: a child

committing suicide.                                                 Image 5.3

As an educator, you are in a position to prevent bullying or

intervene when it happens. Later in this chapter, we will discuss how to create a positive classroom environment

for students in order to mitigate the chances of bullying in school and beyond.

5.3 Families and the Community

     Pause and Ponder - Families

        Imagine you hear a teacher saying to another teacher in the hallway, "Families don't come to
     conferences because they just don't care about their kids."

          · How would hearing that statement make you feel as a teacher?
          · A student?
          · A family member?

This statement in the box above is one you may have already heard from teachers talking about their students'
families, or is one you will likely hear sometime during your teaching career. This statement conveys a deficit
view of families by positioning families as "uncaring," while the reality is likely quite different. Families might
be unable to attend a conference due to various challenges with scheduling, transportation, childcare, or their

                                                                                                                                 Building a Classroom Community | 99
own negative experiences in school. This statement also reveals misunderstandings of the differences between
family involvement versus family engagement, two terms that are often used interchangeably but actually are
distinct concepts.

Family Involvement vs. Family Engagement

Family involvement tends to be more school-oriented, whereas family engagement tends to be more family-
oriented. Ferlazzo (2011) described family involvement as the school holding the expectations for family
participation and telling families what they need to do. In other words, the school does things "to" or "for"
families and families respond. For example, consider when it is time for teacher conferences: the school sends
out a schedule, and the expectation is that families will come to school at the appointed time. The goal for these
meetings is often a one-sided transition of information, where the teacher reports back to the family how the
student is performing in class, while expecting the family to be somewhat passive acceptors of this information.

   Family engagement, on the other hand, indicates working "with" families: sharing responsibility and working
together to support children's learning. In this case, when it is time for teacher conferences, the teachers are
encouraged to work with families and find ways to communicate with all of them. While some families will
come to school at the scheduled time, some might schedule a phone call when they are on break from work,
while others might prefer to do FaceTime because they want to see the teacher. Teachers will also engage
family members as contributors, asking them what they have seen at home, or what their celebrations, goals,
or concerns are for their child's learning.

                                                      Schools cannot exist without families, and therefore

                                                      there is a great need for partnerships between

                                                      schools and families. Families can contribute to

                                                      school communities in a variety of ways, even well

                                                      beyond volunteering in classrooms or contributing to

                                                      required fundraisers. Families can use their firsthand

                                                      knowledge of the local community to help connect

                                                      teachers with community agencies or experts for a

                                                      field trip or classroom visits. All students bring a

                                                      wealth of background experiences-often built with

                                                      their families-to the classroom each day, which can

                                                      help students connect to and understand learning

Image 5.4                                             goals and the world around them. Remember that
                                                      while there are some more visible, traditional forms of

support (like volunteering or joining the PTA), families partner with educators in limitless ways to support a

common goal: their child's learning and growth.

Critical Lens - Cultural Norms for Family Engagement

        Different cultures have different norms for how families should be involved in their child's education.
     Some cultures believe that educators are the trained experts and leave their child's learning fully up to

100 | Building a Classroom Community
     the school as a sign of respect for the teacher's position. Some cultures believe that families and
     teachers are co-educators. Be careful not to judge family engagement based on your own cultural
     background!

Building strong partnerships between schools and families also requires a reconfiguration of the traditional
view of "family." Be careful not to assume that a student's family consists of a mother and father. Families might
consist of same-sex parents, single parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles, step-parents, adopted parents,
foster parents, older siblings, and more. For this reason, using the word "family" instead of "parents" can be
more inclusive. In addition, we need to view communities as part of families, and schools can engage with
their community "families" in creative ways. For example, some schools have "grandmas." These community
grandmas come into the classroom a few days a week to tell stories about their lives and listen to students share
their own stories. This partnership demonstrates a beautiful way to build meaningful relationships between the
school and community.

     Pause and Ponder - School Experience

        Think back to your own school experience.
          · How was your family invited to be a part of a school/family partnership?
          · Were there activities you looked forward to or dreaded your family being a part of at school?
          · What are some ways you could envision building true family/community partnerships in your
             future classroom?

                                                                                                                                 Building a Classroom Community | 101
5.4 Interrupting Bias and Stereotypes in School/Family Partnerships

           Chimamanda Adichie (2009) warns us about stereotypes in her TED

           Talk, The Danger of a Single Story (video 5.4) as we previously studied

           in our final activity in chapter 3. The issue with stereotypes, she states,

           is that they are partial and provide one lens: "they make one story the

           only story." Viewing children and families through one lens, a deficit

           lens, is harmful and imposes limits on what they can accomplish. This

           "single story" is especially likely to harm children and families of color.

           Sometimes, single stories about our families-especially families and

           communities of color-can lead to stereotypes and assumptions that

           hurt our families and weaken school/family partnerships. Let's look at

           two fairly common stereotypes.

           One common stereotype is that families do not come to school

           because they do not care. In reality, there are many possible reasons

           why families do not come to school. Edwards (2016) offers that families

           of color may have had unpleasant experiences in schools themselves

           and are not willing to succumb to the "ghosts" of school again. As

Image 5.5  children they were not welcome or well-treated in school and cannot
           bring themselves to enter the buildings again; schools were traumatic

places.

Another common stereotype is that families have nothing to offer their children or school. In reality, families

are their children's first teachers. Deficit views of families negate the fact that prior to coming to school, children

have learned their family's language and culture by being immersed in them. Children learn their families' and

communities' ways of knowing and being by interacting and engaging with community members and families.

To build stronger school/family partnerships schools can reframe the traditional reliance upon family

involvement instead of family engagement. The norm for involving families is that the school dictates the

needs and reaches out to families, telling them the needs. Instead, reframing this partnership to one of

family engagement invites collaboration and shifts from a deficit orientation to a strengths-based perspective.

Families have a lot to offer in an educator's work toward building positive classroom environments, and schools

need to take note of the resources available in their community and extend invitations for meaningful work.

5.5 Communication with Students

"Yet only through communication can human life hold meaning." (Friere, 1970, p. 77). To teach is to
communicate. One cannot be an excellent educator if they do not possess strong communication skills.

   According to Silver (2018), teaching is all about communication - listening, speaking, reading, presenting and
writing. Teachers who hone their communication skills are prepared to instruct, advise, and mentor students

102 | Building a Classroom Community
entrusted in their care. Additionally, teachers must communicate well to effectively collaborate with colleagues
and update administrators on student progress. Frequently, parents call, visit or email, so teachers must be
adept at answering questions verbally and in writing.

        Pause and Ponder - Why Is It Important for Teachers to Have Good Communication Skills?

        Article by Freddie Silver

   Teachers are engaged in communication with many different people. While much of a teacher's day is spent
with their students, they must also interact with other teachers, paraprofessionals, administrators, parents, and
community members. Many first-year teachers are surprised by how many different forms of communication
they must engage in each day. Because of this, it is good to have an understanding of how to effectively
communicate with all stakeholders.

   Classroom events are often so complex that in order for teachers to have effective communication with
their students, they need to start with building trusting relationships. Trusting relationships will ensure that
students feel a sense of belonging and are eager to communicate their thinking, their learning and their needs.
According to Aguilar (2017), building trust is difficult. "Whether in a conversation or during a class, whoever
intends to build trust (the teacher, coach or principal) needs to have five positive or neutral interactions with
another person; that is what it takes to build and maintain trust. Therefore, teachers need to understand the
power of trusting relationships and the power of positive interactions with their students.

                                                                                                                                Building a Classroom Community | 103
        https://www.mindful.org/brene-brown-on-what-it-really-means-to-trust/

Being respectful, friendly, diplomatic, a good listener and to be able to build a rapport all require good
communication skills. Therefore, teachers also need to be culturally sensitive and learn about their students
to understand their communication styles. For example, some students will use nonverbal communication
and express themselves through their actions. Others are more verbal and can express their needs using
their words. One way to manage these different styles of communication, and become comfortable with
the key features of communication that are characteristic of classrooms, teachers need to learn about the
functions or purposes of communication, especially the balance among talk related to content, to procedures,
and to controlling behavior. Another feature has to do with the nature of nonverbal communication--how it
supplements and sometimes even contradicts what is said verbally. A third feature has to do with the unwritten
expectations held by students and teachers about how to participate in particular kinds of class activities--what
we will later call the structure of participation.

          "The teacher's thinking is authenticated only by the authenticity of the students' thinking. The
       teacher cannot think for her students, nor can she impose her thoughts on them. Authentic
       thinking, thinking that is concerned about reality, does not take place in ivory tower isolation, but
       only in communication. If it is true that thought has meaning only when generated by action upon
       the world, the subordination of students to teachers becomes impossible. " (Freire, 2000).

Communicating with Families and Caregivers

Teachers are responsible for keeping parents informed and involved to whatever extent is practical. Virtually
all parents and caregivers understand and assume that schools are generally intended for learning, but
communication can enrich their understanding of how this purpose is realized in their particular child's
classroom, and it can show them more precisely what their particular child is doing there. Such understanding
in turn allows families and caregivers to support their child's learning more confidently and in this sense
contributes, at least indirectly, to a positive learning environment in their child's class.

5.6 Strategies for Building a Positive Classroom Environment

The development of a strong sense of community and belonging in the classroom is essential to building
relationships that may serve as protective factors for our students. Implementation of practices and approaches
built around empathy, the ability to recognize and feel the emotions of others, has the ability to positively
impact all students, but is critical to the success of students who have experienced adversity.

   At times, it is difficult to separate our empathy with students from our sympathy for students. Some of our
students experience such difficult lives and our sympathy leads us to expect less of them. Interacting with
students from a place of sympathy does not build our connections with them and does not let them know we
believe in them. The following table shows differences in statements focused on empathy versus sympathy.

Video 5.5
   It is our job as educators to create an environment that models empathy for students to facilitate trust

and security. Bob Sornson (2014) states, "By helping children learn empathy, we raise the odds they will have
strong positive social relationships, truly care for others, and be able to set appropriate limits in their own
lives without using angry behaviors or words" (para. 2). Traditional elements of a classroom environment,
including structured, predictable routines and morning meetings, can be expanded with the intention to
increase opportunities for empathy on a daily basis. However, some traditional models of classroom
management include practices that interfere with the development of healthy connections between teachers
and our students. Building connections with students can be challenging at times and take effort and repeated
attempts with students who have experienced adversity; furthermore, these relationships can be damaged
quickly if we use practices that do not align with building empathy.

The following table provides an overview of some management practices to avoid and strategies to create a
welcoming environment, though you will get much more in-depth information on how to create that positive
culture as you continue in your pathway as a preservice teacher.

  Activity - Stop and Reflect

     Think about a classroom where you felt welcome. What did the teacher do or say to make you feel
  that way?

Do's and Don'ts

       Don't: Clip Charts and Card-Flipping Systems
       Clip charts and card-flipping systems, which often are based on a variant of a "stoplight model"-
    green indicating on-task behavior, yellow indicating a warning for misbehavior, and red indicating a
    repeated infraction-are punitive and shaming in nature and should be avoided in the classroom.
       Clip charts and card systems are one genre of behavior management strategies that are punitive
    and shaming in nature. And as the word management suggests, this is a practice that creates a
    power dynamic that should not be present in a welcoming environment. The idea behind these
    systems is that when students break a rule or demonstrate an established misbehavior, they will be
    asked to "move their clip" (often lower down a chart of behavioral levels) or "flip a card" (often from
    green to yellow to red). Each clip or card level carries its own consequences. These systems are
    publicly shaming because students have to move their clip or flip their card in front of their peers,
    often after a teacher provides a verbal reprimand that the entire class hears. Also, any member of the
    classroom community-or even a visitor who steps into the classroom-can see at a glance how every
    child in the room is doing at any given moment. Using clip charts may activate a student's fight,
    flight, or freeze response, indicating the student no longer feels safe in the environment.
       Don't: Public Humiliation/Shaming
       It is never acceptable to yell at a student. It is even less acceptable to do it in a public environment.
    Frustration as a teacher is expected. We the adults, however, need to remain calm. Students look to

106 | Building a Classroom Community
us to keep them safe, to protect them from those who may be shaming them for being "different"
and humiliating them in front of their peers. We do not want to add to that shame and humiliation.
Other forms of public humiliation and shaming can include visible punishments like writing a
student's name on the board or asking a student to stay in or away from a certain part of the
classroom (i.e., standing in a corner or not joining the group on the carpet). (Do note that sometimes
students need space to decompress and regulate their emotions, and this can be done without
publicly humiliating the student.)

   Don't: Isolation

   Additional practices that can activate this response include isolating students who are
experiencing strong emotions. As adults, we feel a range of emotions throughout the day. Our
students can experience this same range of emotions. If our classrooms are not based on empathy
and understanding, we may exacerbate the situation by sending the student out of the room or to a
calm-down space as a punitive response to their emotion. An empathetic response validates the
student's feelings and may need to set a limit or consequence if safety is a concern.

   Don't: Group Punishment

   Group punishment occurs when one student or a small group of students demonstrate off-task
behavior and consequences are applied for all the students in the class, whether or not they
participated in this off-task behavior. You might have heard statements like, "If anyone talks during
snack time, no one gets to go outside for recess," or "If any student shouts out during this activity, no
one gets added game time." These kinds of punishments are not realistic or reasonable. Some
students who struggle with self-regulation skills become the scapegoat for "ruining it" for all the
students in the class, which can lead to resentment from their peers and exclusion from their peer
group.

   Don't: Assign Laps at Recess

   A common consequence for misbehavior or noncompliance with classroom policies (such as
completing homework) is asking the student to walk laps at recess. This practice is not productive
for several reasons. First, it associates exercise with punishment. Students need to have positive
associations with exercise in order to maintain their own physical health; if walking is something one
only does when they are in trouble, they are less likely to continue this healthy behavior for their own
well-being. Secondly, it takes away the unstructured break time from the students who often need it
most. Students who need constant redirection for socializing or being on the move during class, for
example, would definitely benefit from ample opportunities to socialize and move at recess!

   Don't: Be a Negative Role Model

   Role modeling is critical in the development of empathy. Unfortunately, we are not perfect and, at
times, we may model inappropriate behaviors. For example, a student may have something that
does not belong to them and, out of frustration, we go over and grab it from the student. Later that
day, the same student wants something someone else has and goes over and grabs it from them.
Our typical response would be some sort of consequence, leaving the student feeling as if "it isn't
fair." In reality, we modeled the behavior and provided a consequence to the student for using an
adult-modeled behavior. These moments will happen and are opportunities for us to acknowledge
our behavior and repair the relationship with the student. A response oriented toward repairing the
relationship may sound like this: "Joey, I'm sorry. Earlier I grabbed something from your hands.

                                                                                                                       Building a Classroom Community | 107
       When you did the same thing to Raúl, I gave you a consequence. I need help remembering to do
       the right thing sometimes too. Do you think you could help me?" This response models for Joey that
       even adults make mistakes and how to recover and repair when they occur.

The practices listed above can trigger a student's automatic fear response. A student in a fight, flight, or freeze
state struggles to learn and is no longer thinking through their choices. As educators, we need to minimize the
use of these practices and replace them with those that build our students' emotional intelligence.

          Do: Know Your Students
          Positive relationships that affirm students' membership in the classroom community are a
       foundation of a welcoming classroom environment; therefore, educators need to develop individual
       relationships with their students as much as possible. Get to know your students as individuals
       through activities like beginning-of-the-year "getting to know you" surveys, sitting with your
       students during lunch, chatting during less structured time like breaks or recess, and asking families
       for their tips (after all, families have known our students for far longer!). Attend sporting events,
       performances, and other activities that students invite you to. Use the information you gather to
       work personalized references into classroom instruction, but make sure you do so equitably.
          At the same time, remember that your job is not to be a student's friend. You are still the
       professional adult, and you must keep this professional boundary in mind. The age of your students
       also plays a role. A kindergarten teacher being invited to a child's birthday party is quite different
       from a high schooler inviting a teacher to a birthday party.
          Do: Establish Positive Relationships with Families
          From the very beginning of the school year, reach out to families in a variety of ways-phone calls,
       notes, messages through your school's learning management system-to establish positive
       relationships. Provide specific, positive feedback on what you are seeing their child accomplishing in
       the classroom to demonstrate to families that you know their child as an individual. Some teachers
       like to use "surprise" notes home that highlight positive achievements and accomplishments for
       individual students for families to celebrate. (Be sure to send these notes home for all children-you
       may wish to keep track to make sure you are equitably distributing these positive notes.) While the
       beginning of the school year can be hectic, investing time up front in building positive relationships
       means that when you need more support later if an issue arises, you'll have a partnership already
       built with the family.
          Also, keep in mind that educators and families share a common goal: wanting what is best for
       their children. Sometimes educators and families may have different perspectives on how to get to
       that same outcome. Remembering that families and educators are partners in this common goal
       can help when conflicts do arise. This Edutopia article shares some communication strategies to try
       with families at the beginning of the year.
          Do: Routines
          As human beings, we feel safe when we know what to expect. Routines help our students know

108 | Building a Classroom Community
what to expect. Established and predictable routines can include visual and verbal reminders for the
flow of a typical day in the classroom, such as a posted schedule with the times and activities listed.
These routines are also explained and practiced with the students frequently at the start of the
school year. Routines can include special greetings, expectations for various parts of the day like
arrival and departure, and procedures for accessing materials like writing utensils during instruction.
Predictable routines create a feeling of safety and security for students as they can reasonably
expect to know what is coming next. Preparing students repeatedly, ahead of time, for any changes
in the routine also facilitates trust within the environment and can act as a preventative measure for
those who experience dysregulation related to change.

   Do: Morning Meetings

   One daily routine that can build empathy and community is a morning meeting. These classroom
community gatherings can occur on a classroom carpet or at their desks and typically include both
academic and social-emotional activities. For example, students may engage in special morning
greetings with their peers and the teacher can talk about the plans for the day. Morning meetings
are a fantastic opportunity to build in activities which increase a sense of belonging and community
in the classroom. Allowing students to openly express how they feel in the classroom and about the
environment helps to give them a voice and feel like they are a valued member of the group. At the
secondary level, educators can allot a few minutes at the beginning of each class to complete a brief
check-in with their students. This can include asking non-threatening questions or providing
students the opportunity to share on a rotating basis. At times, the secondary level is overlooked
when conversations about building emotional intelligence are discussed. These students are
undergoing significant developmental changes and also need the opportunity to be heard and have
a sense of belonging. Minor modifications to daily interactions with students build in opportunities
for empathy and social-emotional development. This increases their exposure to healthy, prosocial
skills which can increase their ability to function in healthy relationships.

   Do: Classroom Responsibilities

   Classroom responsibilities, sometimes referred to as classroom jobs, provide students with
ownership of the classroom environment. Common elementary classroom responsibilities include
line leader, caboose, and paper passer. Students can also be "librarians" responsible for maintaining
and organizing books in the classroom. Dr. Clayton also had what she called a "S.I.C.," which stood for
"student in charge." This student would "take over" when Dr. Clayton was working with a small
group, such as a reading group. Students would go to them to ask to use the bathroom, for example.
(Side note: be sure the answer that they give is "yes"!) Responsibilities can continue into middle
school and high school. Of course, a high school student is not interested in being the line leader,
but they can be the teacher's assistant for the day, such as running errands to the front office. Just
be sure that these responsibilities rotate among students so that no favoritism is interpreted.

   Do: Individual Contracts

   Sometimes, certain students need more specific structures and rules that everyone in the class
doesn't need. Instead of creating a "one-size-fits-all" behavioral management system that actually
does not meet the needs of all of your students, consider writing individual behavior contracts.
These contracts should have specific, observable goals with clear time parameters, along with
straightforward, tangible outcomes. For example, in Dr. Wells's kindergarten class, she had one

                                                                                                                       Building a Classroom Community | 109
       student who was really struggling with self-regulation skills, but she also knew he was obsessed
       with Angry Birds. She created an Angry Birds behavior chart with this student only. After she chose a
       target behavior (such as listening and following directions the first time they are given, an important
       safety skill), she would establish criteria to set the student up for demonstrating the target behavior.
       At first, the goal might be that the student follows 1 out of 10 directions in one hour. Despite the nine
       times the student didn't follow directions, the student still earns the reward-in this case, playing a
       round of Angry Birds on the classroom tablet for five minutes-because they need to experience
       success first. Then, as this goal becomes easier, increase the challenge: now, the student needs to
       keep 5 out of 10 Angry Birds on his chart (signifying he listened 5 out of 10 times) in an hour. Next,
       expand the time slot. Perhaps the student has to keep 5 out of 10 birds for the whole morning, and
       then reset for the afternoon with the same expectations. If your behavior contract uses a chart like
       this one, remember to keep it private. Instead of taping it to the board for the entire class to see,
       consider keeping it on a clipboard and discretely marking on it, and then privately conferring with
       the student out of earshot of peers when the established time period has ended.

          When making individual contracts, remember it is important to know your students, their needs,
       and their interests. While some students may have multiple areas for growth-shouting out and
       following directions the first time when given, for example-pick the one area you need to see
       growth in first for the student to feel safe and trusted. Also, be aware that individual contracts won't
       fix everything immediately: they take time, patience, and consistency.

          Do: Teach Social/Emotional Skills and Mindfulness

          The implementation of social-emotional learning activities into the curriculum can assist in the
       development of self-regulation and conflict resolution skills. If students are taught to recognize and
       regulate their own emotional states, they will be better able to recognize the states of others, remain
       in the thinking part of the brain and more likely to resolve conflicts in a way that is mutually
       beneficial. Skills such as using a regulation space, a place in the classroom where students can go
       when they need a break or need to regulate their emotions, must be taught repeatedly and should
       be taught to the whole class. This space should include sensory items such as stress balls, fidget
       sticks, and putty, as well as self-regulation tools such as social stories, coloring pages, deep breathing
       tools, and visual reminders for how to use the area. Normalizing the use of this space removes any
       stigma or punishment associated with experiencing strong emotions and makes the use of
       regulation skills a positive experience for students. Additionally, educators should role model the use
       of regulation skills to the class throughout the day. For example, using statements such as "Class, I
       am feeling frustrated right now. I can feel myself starting to get warm and my heart is going faster.
       I'm going to use Figure 8 Breathing to calm down."

          Do: Restorative Justice, Conflict Resolution and Problem Solving

          Restorative Justice is a system of addressing behaviors which focuses on the learning through
       reconciliation with the classroom community. When a student misbehaves persistently and
       disruptively, you will need strategies that are more active and assertive and that lead to conflict
       resolution--the reduction of disagreements that persist over time. The conflict resolution strategies
       that educators and teachers advocate and use usually have two parts (Jones, 2004).[7] First, the
       strategies involve a way of identifying precisely what "the" problem is. Once this is done, they require
       reminding the student of classroom expectations and rules without apology or harshness, but with
       simple clarity and assertiveness. When used together, the clarification and assertion can not only

110 | Building a Classroom Community
       reduce conflicts between a teacher and an individual student, but also provide a model for other
       students to consider when they have disagreements of their own.

     Critical Lens - Inclusive Practice

        As you develop getting-to-know-you surveys or beginning-of-the-year activities, it is important to
     make sure all students will be able to answer the questions. Avoid questions that may be impacted by
     privilege such as those related to vacations or material items.

Restorative Justice, Conflict Resolution and Problem Solving
   Step 1: Clarify and identify the problem: Classrooms can be emotional places even when its primary purpose

is to promote "thinking" rather than the expression of feelings as such. The emotional quality can be quite
desirable: it can give teachers and students "passion" for learning and respect or even good feelings for each
other. But it can also cause trouble if students misbehave: at those moments negative feelings--annoyance,
anger, discomfort--can interfere with understanding exactly what went wrong and how to set things right
again. Allow all involved to calm down and then let each individual state their view of the problem. If the issue
is between two students, let each share their side of the story. If the issue involves you and a student, let the
student state his view, and then you share yours.

   Step 2: Active and empathetic listening: Diagnosing accurately the conflict is necessary in order to resolve
it. We need to use "Active Listening"--attending carefully to all aspects of what a student says and attempting
to understand or empathize with it as fully as possible, even if you do not agree with what is being said
(Cooper & Simonds, 2003). Active Listening involves asking a lot of questions in order continually to check your
understanding. It also involves encouraging the student to elaborate or expand on his or her remarks, and
paraphrasing and summarizing what the student has said in order to check your perceptions of what is being
said. It is important not to move too fast toward "solving" the problem with advice, instructions, or scolding, even
if these are responses that you might, as a teacher, feel responsible for making. Responding too soon in these
ways can shut down communication prematurely, and leave you with an inaccurate impression of the source of
the problem.

   Depending on the issue, you may want to use Step 3 or skip this and use Step 4. For most conflicts that
involve two students, we will use Step 4.

   Step 3: Assertive discipline and "I" messages: Once you have listened well enough to understand the student's
point of view, it helps to frame your responses and comments in terms of how the student's behavior affects
you as a teacher. The comments should have several features:

  · They should be assertive--neither passive and apologetic, nor unnecessarily hostile or aggressive. State
      what the problem is, as matter-of-factly as possible: "Joe, you are talking while I'm explaining something,"
      instead of either "Joe, do you think you could be quiet now?" or "Joe, be quiet!"

                                                                                                                                  Building a Classroom Community | 111
  · The comments should emphasize I-messages, which are comments that focus on how the problem
      behavior is affecting the teacher's ability to teach, as well as how the behavior makes the teacher feel. They
      are distinct from you-messages, which focus on evaluating the mistake or problem which the student has
      created. An I-message might be, "Your talking is making it hard for me to remember what I'm trying to
      say." A you-message might be, "Your talking is rude."

  · The comments should encourage the student to think about the effects of his or her actions on others--a
      strategy that in effect encourages the student to consider the ethical implications of the actions (Gibbs,
      2003). Instead of simply saying, "When you cut in line ahead of the other kids, that was not fair to them,"
      you can try saying, "How do you think the other kids feel when you cut in line ahead of them?"

Step 4: Negotiating a solution: The steps so far describe ways of interacting that are desirable, but also fairly
specific in scope and limited in duration. In themselves, they may not be enough when conflict persists over
time and develops a number of complications or confusing features. A student may persist, for example, in
being late for class, in spite of diverse efforts by the teacher to modify this behavior. Two students may persist
in speaking rudely to each other, even though the teacher has mediated this conflict in the past. Or a student
may fail to complete homework, time after time. Because these problems develop over time, and because
they may involve repeated disagreements between teacher and student, they can eventually become stressful
for the teacher, for the student, and for any classmates who may be affected. Their persistence can tempt a
teacher simply to announce or dictate a resolution--a decision that may simply leave everyone feeling defeated,
including the teacher.

   Often in these situations, it is better to negotiate a solution, which means systematically discussing options
and compromising on one if possible. Negotiation always requires time and effort, though usually not as much
as continuing to cope with the original problem, and the results can be beneficial to everyone. A number
of experts on conflict resolution have suggested strategies for negotiating with students about persistent
problems (Davidson & Wood, 2004). The suggestions vary in detail but usually include some combination of the
steps we have already discussed above, along with a few others.

  · Decide as accurately as possible what the problem is--Usually this step involves a lot of the active listening
      described above.

  · Brainstorm possible solutions, and then consider their effectiveness--Remember to include students in
      this step; otherwise, you are simply imposing a solution on others, which is not what negotiation is
      supposed to achieve.

  · Choose a solution, if possible by consensus--Complete agreement on the choice may not be possible, but
      strive for it as best you can. Remember that taking a vote may be a democratic, acceptable way to settle
      differences in many situations. If feelings are running high, however, voting has an ironic by-product: it
      simply allows individuals to "announce" their differences to each other and therefore maintain the conflict.

Pay attention later to how well the solution works--For many reasons, things may not work out the way you or
the students hope or expect, and you may need to renegotiate the solution at a later time.

Conclusion

Before students can learn, they must first feel safe, supported, and valued. Creating empathy-driven classroom
environments involves intentional decisions about specific elements under the educator's control, such as
an accessible physical arrangement of the classroom, an affirming atmosphere, and using humanizing
management strategies while intentionally avoiding those that cause humiliation or shame. Additionally,
educators can partner with critical community stakeholders, such as school social workers and family or
community members, to access additional resources to support students' success.

   Creating empathy-driven classroom environments also involves awareness of elements that are not under the
educator's control. Adverse childhood experiences are common within our classrooms, with varying degrees
of impact on the social, emotional, behavioral, and cognitive functioning of our students. Understanding the
unique histories of each of our students is important, but so is uncovering who they are as individuals including
what makes them resilient. A history of adverse experiences does not mean our students cannot learn and grow
and develop healthy relationships. It means they have experiences that may change the path that gets them
there and will need the positive adult connection we can provide as their teacher even more.

   To create an empathy-focused classroom environment, there are certain elements to include-such as
routines, morning meetings, and developing individual relationships with students-and elements to avoid, such
as clip charts or card-flipping systems, group punishment, and public humiliation. Building and implementing
a trauma-informed classroom with empathy at the core is a practice that supports all students and will increase
a sense of community and belonging for all.

   Building and modeling empathy fosters a reciprocal relationship in which students can feel educators'
genuine care and concern for their best interests. We lay the foundation for our students' success by
intentionally creating a humanizing classroom environment in which they can learn and grow.

          "Pedagogy is always about power, because it cannot be separated from how objectives are
       formed, desires mobilized, how some experiences are legitimized and others are not, or how some
       knowledge is considered acceptable while other forms are excluded from the curriculum."

 Pedagogy is a word you will encounter often in your teacher prep path as well as your practice. Pedagogy is defined as
 the philosophy of teaching and learning. Pedagogical strategies are the things we do to bring about and support
 teaching and learning.

This chapter introduces a variety of general pedagogical strategies which span a broad spectrum, from student
centered at one extreme to teacher centered at the other. Bloom (1956) created a hierarchy that classifies
thinking from a low cognitive load, knowledge, to high cognitive load, creating. Bloom's Taxonomy is often used
by effective teachers to write clear learning objectives to meet the standards of the lesson. There are many ways
to approach the art and science of teaching and learning, depending on whose cultures and histories we focus
on. This chapter is intended to provide a brief intro to various ways of serving the needs of diverse learners.

6.1 Ways of Knowing and Learning

     Stop and Think

        Have you ever stopped to consider what you know and how you know it? Maybe you know how to ice
     skate, or that the freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or that you should brush your teeth
     each morning. Perhaps you know how to divide fractions or read music. You might know your sister is
     mad because of the way she looked at you this morning. Think of an example of something you do
     every day. How do you know how to do this task?

To learn is `to gain knowledge or skill by studying, practicing, being taught, or experiencing something', based
on the Merriam-Webster online dictionary. This definition suggests that learning is something you gain or
acquire and there are multiple ways to acquire knowledge. Schools are not the only place people learn. We
begin to acquire knowledge from the moment we are born.

   There are three general types of knowledge that we acquire, as described in the Western world. The most
basic is knowledge by acquaintance: developed as a direct result of awareness and interaction with the world
(attributed to Bertrand Russell). A second kind of knowledge is factual or declarative knowledge and is often
referred to as knowledge that we acquire when we learn the capitals of states, types of dog breeds, or the
names of scientists. A third is procedural knowledge and can be described as knowing how to do something:

                                                                                                                                                 Teaching and Learning | 117
ice skate, make cookies, kick a ball, speak, write your name, etc. Schools focus mostly on declarative and
procedural knowledge (Saks et al, 2021).

   In a teacher education program, for example, a student may memorize principles of culturally responsive
teaching as declarative knowledge, but may have little grasp of how these principles would be used in a
classroom. What the student needs is to develop procedural knowledge so that they can actually develop
an understanding of how to teach in a culturally responsive way. The distinction between declarative and
procedural knowledge is embodied in the work of learning theorists, such as Benjamin Bloom. Bloom's analysis
contrasted lower levels of learning (i.e., knowledge, comprehension), which emphasized facts, concepts, and
rules, and "higherorder" learning (i.e., application, analysis, synthesis, and evaluation), which emphasized how
knowledge is used as part of higher level cognitive processes. His taxonomy is frequently referred to in the US
education system and will be reviewed later in the chapter. Blooms Taxonomy is also addressed in the context
of assessment in Chapter 8.

   Procedural knowledge is not always more complex and can be quite simple, such as knowing how to brush
one's teeth. Also, procedural knowledge is often "automated" due to frequent repetition, so we may engage
in the procedure without much conscious awareness. For adults, driving a car in familiar surroundings may
become an automated procedure. We often will not recall how many lights we stopped at on our way home,
for example. Reading also becomes an automated process, no longer requiring full conscious effort to decode
and comprehend familiar text. It is sometimes declarative knowledge that challenges us, when the topic is less
familiar or infrequently accessed, such as when asked about elements in the periodic table or leaders of the
18th century in Latin America.

   Most learning combines both declarative and procedural knowledge. You know the elements necessary for a
persuasive essay and you apply them creatively to suit your needs based on what you know of your intended
audience or the teacher for whom you are writing the assignment. In many cases, teachers' instructional goals
include acquisition of both declarative and procedural knowledge. We rarely learn facts for their own sake
(though sometimes it might seem like it) but instead develop knowledge so that we can apply it for specific
purposes.

it clear that learning takes place in settings that have specific cultural and social norms. These norms or
expectations influence the learning and transfer significantly. (Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2000) This is
why it's critical that teachers create classrooms where the norms and expectations create strong conditions
for learning for each of their students. One way to support all learners in achieving academic success is to
implement culturally responsive teaching strategies. Key characteristics of culturally responsive pedagogy
(Hammond, 2014) include:

  · communicating high expectations,
  · actively engaging students in learning,
  · providing an appropriate level of challenge to increase intellectual capacity,
  · having a positive perspective on parents and families, and
  · helping students understand how the curriculum links to their everyday lives.

118 | Teaching and Learning
Just under 100 years ago, simple reading, writing, and calculating were the goal of schooling. Basic declarative
and superficial procedural knowledge were sufficient. Educational systems did not typically train people to
think and read critically, to express themselves clearly, or to solve complex problems. Now, complex literacy skills
are required of almost everyone to navigate in our current global landscape. Demands for more sophisticated
skills at work have increased dramatically . Meaningful participation in the democratic process has become
increasingly complicated as local, national, and international issues are increasingly intertwined. New science
of learning is providing knowledge to significantly improve people's abilities to become active learners who
seek to understand complex subjects and are better prepared to transfer what they learn to new problems and
settings. It is imperative that teachers learn and implement strategies that nurture the academic potential of
all students, regardless of background, experience or identity, so they can succeed in our increasingly complex
world.

6.2 The Dominant Narrative

There's an old saying in the US. There are three sides to a story: one side, the other side, and what really
happened. In any society, the side of the story that is most upheld by the political, legal, and economic
structures of that society is called the dominant narrative.

   Formal public education in the US is firmly grounded in the dominant narrative. The dominant narrative
includes stories about who we are and what the country is. One example of a dominant narrative in US history
lessons is how westward expansion gave people in the US economic opportunity. Additional examples of
dominant narrative in the field of teacher education are the commonly taught ideas around how children learn,
what the best way is for them to demonstrate learned knowledge, and values around sharing that knowledge
in a competitive or collaborative way.

   Counter narratives highlight alternative ideas to dominant
narratives. Counter narratives can include facts that haven't
been shared in common history lessons. One example of this
would be the genocide of indigenous peoples during
colonization from the perspective of the people who
experienced and fought it (rather than westward expansion
and nation building).

   As teachers, we can begin to make room for
counternarratives by learning about multiple ways of knowing,
multiple ways of demonstrating knowledge, and the many
varied understandings of what knowledge is important to a Image 6.2
community. Can you think of a local issue in your community
and how different sides of the issue might be presented? Furthermore, how might an educator present such
an issue, in a way that allows students to critically think about the issue?

6.3 Instructional Strategies and Approaches

There are multiple ways to deliver instruction and their degree of success varies based on both the strategy
implemented and the needs, background, preferences and readiness of the learner. Education researcher and
professor John Hattie spent more than 15 years reviewing studies on what impacts student learning outcomes.
After reviewing over 1,200 studies he identified 7 major sources that contribute to learning; the student, the

                                                                                                                                                 Teaching and Learning | 119
home, the school, the curricula, the teacher,teaching and learning approaches, and the classroom (John Hattie,
2012).

                                                                                          This visual to the left includes some of the many

                                                                                      analysis of education research. Hattie found that .4
                                                                                      was the average effect or impact size of the various

                                                                                      elements of some of these strategies within the
                                                                                      common instructional approaches that follow.

                             Direct Instruction

                             In general usage, the term direct instruction refers to

Image 6.3                    (1) instructional approaches that are structured,

                             sequenced, and led by teachers, and/or (2) the

presentation of academic content to students by teachers, such as in a lecture or demonstration. In other words,

teachers are "directing" the instructional process or instruction is being "directed" at students.

The basic techniques of direct instruction not only extend beyond lecturing, presenting, or demonstrating,

but many are considered to be foundational to effective teaching. For example:

· Establishing learning objectives for lessons, activities, and projects, and then making sure that students
   understand the goals.

· Purposefully organizing and sequencing a series of lessons, projects, and assignments that move students
   toward understanding and the achievement of specific academic goals.

· Reviewing instructions for an activity or modeling a process--such as a scientific experiment--so that
   students know what they are expected to do.

· Providing students with clear explanations, descriptions, and illustrations of the knowledge and skills
   being taught.

· Asking questions to make sure of student understanding after a lesson.

As seen in Image 6.3, teachers rarely use either direct instruction or some other teaching approach--in practice,
diverse strategies are frequently blended together. For these reasons, negative perceptions of direct instruction
likely result more from a widespread overreliance on the approach, and from the tendency to view it as an
either/or option, rather than from its inherent value to the instructional process (Carnine, Silbert, Kameenui, &
Tarver, 1997).

120 | Teaching and Learning
Active Learning

   The Socratic method, originally formulated by the Greek         Image 6.4
Philosopher Socrates in 399 BCE, is a teaching method where
the instructor asks questions designed to understand the point
of view of the students. This was a radical approach for its time
because it placed the learning more in the hands of the
student. Teachers have been using this method for centuries
and it has taken many forms but the intent was always to
critically engage students in the learning. As active learners,
students are motivated to ask questions and make sense of
what they are learning. All students have the opportunity to
reflect on a prompt, work in a pair or small group, and interact
with the material. Active learners are asking questions,
conversing about a topic and interacting with others to learn.

Drill and Practice

                    The drill and practice instructional strategy refers to small

                    tasks, such as the memorization of spelling and vocabulary

                    words, or the practicing of the multiplication tables repeatedly.

                    As students, drill and practice instruction was probably a

                    familiar memory throughout your schooling. It is used primarily

                    for students to master fundamental materials, typically limited

                    to declarative knowledge, through repetition. By today's

                    educational standards, drill and practice is considered

                    outdated and often deemed ineffective as an instructional

Image 6.5           strategy. According to Jill Sunday Bartoli, "Having to spend long
                    periods of time on repetitive tasks is a sign that learning is not

taking place -- that this is not a productive learning situation." (Bartoli, 1989, p. 292)

                                                                                            Teaching and Learning | 121
Lecture

   Lecture is a convenient instructional strategy. Material can be
delivered efficiently since there are no interruptions from
students. A lecture can allow the teacher to relate new material
to other topics in the course, define and explain key terms, and
relate material to students' interests. It is one type of direct
instruction.

   Lecture is an instructional strategy that places students in a
passive role. Essentially the lecturer is the expert and the
students are having knowledge, declarative or procedural,
poured into their brains. The material and presentation are
solely the intellectual product of the teacher. Students sit Image 6.6
silently at desks that face the lecturer, sometimes taking notes.
Some lectures may include visuals such as PowerPoint presentations.

   Often lecture topics are not remembered well because retrieval pathways to memory have not been
established by students actively participating in the instruction. Students don't typically have the opportunity
to take the presented material and create their own meaning. The lecturer usually does not know if students
understand the topic because there is no feedback from students (Lujan, H. & DiCarlo, S, 2006).

Question and Answer

The technique of question and answer allows the application of knowledge by students and offers some
opportunity for participation. By asking questions, teachers are inviting brief responses from students, who
incorporate their prior knowledge and some interpretation in their responses. This gives some indication of
whether students are understanding the material being presented. Questions serve both to motivate students
to listen and to assess how much and how well they are learning the material. Incorporating this instructional
approach allows both the teacher to ask students questions and students to ask the teacher questions,
fostering a better understanding of the lesson (Paul & Elder, 2007).

Discussion

In this instructional strategy, the role of the teacher shifts to leading an exchange of ideas about a specific topic.
The teacher is no longer the sole provider of the content as students gain a voice for their ideas and sometimes
the research they have conducted. At times, the teacher may assign students' individual concepts to speak
about during the discussion. Some control of the course the discussion takes depends on the students. All of
the content planned for the lesson might not be discussed. In fact, after reflecting on the day's discussion a
teacher might begin the next day with important content that had been overlooked or dismissed during the
discussion.

   In order to ensure equitable discussions, teachers need to incorporate strategies so all students contribute
to the conversion and all student voices are heard. In addition, for effective class discussions students need to
listen to what their classmates are saying in order to consider multiple perspectives, consider new ideas, and
sometimes revise their own thinking. It's helpful for all when the teacher, or better yet, a student, summarizes
the important points (Brookfeld & Preskill, 2012).

   An example of a type of discussion you may have experienced in middle or high school is a Socratic seminar. A

122 | Teaching and Learning
Socratic seminar is a formal discussion, usually based on a piece of text, in which the leader, who may initially be
the teacher but should eventually be a student, asks open-ended questions. Teachers often ask that students
support their ideas with evidence from the text and/or their personal experiences. Students listen closely to the
comments of others, think critically for themselves, and express their own thoughts in response to the ideas of
their peers (Israel, 2002).

Think Aloud

Thinking aloud makes the invisible visible. When students think aloud they allow their teachers and peers to
follow their reasoning. This strategy is commonly used when solving math problems or trying to comprehend a
challenging reading passage but it can be applied to any content area. Effective teachers model thinking aloud
frequently with their students to demonstrate how they might approach difficult math problems, approach
complex text, and engage with cognitively demanding concepts.

   Teachers can verbalize their questions and wonderings as they think aloud so that students can see that
problem solving is not a simple, linear process. By modeling this process of Thinking out loud students can
verbalize their inner speech and this outward verbalization can direct future problem-solving. Think-alouds
can be used to model comprehension processes such as predicting, creating mental images, connecting new
information to prior knowledge, monitoring comprehension, and applying steps in a sequence. (Farr & Conner,
2015) When students think aloud they learn how their own learning works and the teacher has the opportunity
to informally assess the depth of their understanding or the types of misconceptions they might hold. This
cyclical process allows the teacher to modify future instruction based on what students reveal as they think
aloud.

Video 6.3

Inquiry

When students investigate so they can answer a question about a particular topic, they are using inquiry
or inquiry-based learning. When teachers use inquiry-based learning, students or teachers may identify
questions. The questions posed should be open ended so the learner has space to hypothesize and inquire

                                                                                                                                                 Teaching and Learning | 123
about the topic. Inquiry learning may be experienced individually; but it is beneficial when students work with
other students. Differing perspectives and varied resources are important to inquiry-based projects.

   Providing responses to questions such as "Why is the sky blue?" demands high-order thinking skills from
both the student and the teacher. Allowing students to explore a broad topic or to choose questions of interest
creates a level of investment and lays the foundation for an environment for successful inquiry-based projects.
Students benefit from learning and negotiating through group investigation in order to answer a question.

   Teachers who wish to engage in inquiry-based learning must set the stage for this process in three ways:

           1. Assess students to determine their knowledge of the topic, and lay groundwork when that
                knowledge does not exist.

          2. Match the scope of the inquiry question to the learning level of students.
           3. Provide resources and/or provide internet search strategies for locating credible resources

                that will inform the inquiry.

The teacher's role in inquiry-based learning is one of facilitator, mentor and advisor. Students may struggle
through problems; however, if the struggle occurs at a level that students may be successful, this struggle is
worthwhile. The teacher's most difficult role, in this case, is to resist answering questions that would inform the
inquiry and allow students to experience productive struggle.

   "Productive struggle is the "sweet spot" in between scaffolding and support. Learning happens when
students stretch beyond their comfort zone. Rather than immediately helping students at the first sign of
distress, we should allow them to work through these stretch zones independently before we offer assistance.

   That may sound counterintuitive, since many of us
assume that helping students learn means protecting
them from negative feelings of frustration. But for
students to become independent learners, they must learn
to persist in the face of challenge." (Barbara Blackburn,
2018, p.1)

   Inquiry based learning requires time and patience;
however this teaching strategy lays groundwork for real-
world learning in which students will engage in
throughout their lives (Sharples, Collins, Feißt, Gaved,
Mulholland, Paxton, & Wright, 2011).

                                                                                                       Image 6.7

Project Based Learning

Project-based learning is an approach that gives students the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills
through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the real world. In project-
based learning (PBL), there is often a "public product" that becomes a culminating event at the end of a project
and allows students to showcase their learning. It is a natural extension of inquiry learning. "Effective PBL
requires students to engage in sustained inquiry, observation, and hopefully fieldwork to help them develop
into advocates for causes they're exploring." (Jorge Valenzuela, 2021)

   Four major concepts form the foundation of project based learning; active construction, situated learning,
social interactions, and cognitive tools. Active construction refers to learners actively constructing meaning

124 | Teaching and Learning
based on their experiences and interactions with the world rather than being passive recipients of learning.
It's based on situated learning because it occurs in an authentic, real-world context that can directly involve
students and it includes ongoing opportunities for social interaction during the learning through discussions
and sharing of ideas in the classroom. Lastly, PBL incorporates the use of cognitive tools such as organizers, data
displays, software, and presentation resources that support student learning. (Krajcik & Blumenfeld, 2014)

   When done well, PBL inspires students to question, think critically, and draw connections between their
learning and the real world. The model of project based learning can vary from one school to the next or even
from one project to another, however, the following critical elements are always present:

  · Organization around an open-ended driving question or challenge
  · Integration of essential abstract academic content and skills into the project development
  · Use of inquiry to learn or create something new
  · Application of critical thinking, problem-solving, collaboration, and communication ( "21st-century skills")
  · Student voice and choice
  · Opportunities for feedback and revision
  · Presentation of the problem, process, and final project

Community Based Learning

Community Based Learning(CBL) is a "broad set of teaching/learning strategies that enable youth and adults
to learn what they want to learn from any segment of the community.an approach that gives students
the opportunity to learn through engagement with community." At its best, Community-Based Learning
integrates community engagement, school-community partnerships, and critical social-justice based reflection
to meet the learning needs of the students while reciprocally supporting the needs of community partners.
When taught with intention, the engagement inherent in Community Based Learning works to create an
environment full of potential for students and community partners to improve the world around them by
expanding the classroom into the world outside of the school grounds.

   Community Based Learning can take the following forms of curricular involvement:

  · Direct Service: cleaning up litter on a beach or serving food in a soup kitchen
  · Indirect Service: fundraising or gathering signatures for a petition
  · Apprenticeships: volunteering while learning a trade

                                                                                                                                                 Teaching and Learning | 125

Collaborative Learning

"Collaborative learning" encompasses a range of approaches that involve students in joint intellectual efforts
or in the efforts of students and teachers together. Working in groups of two or more, students work to gain
understanding, develop solutions, or create a product. Most collaborative learning activities center on students'
exploration or application of the course material rather than relying simply on the teacher's presentation of it. It
is a significant shift away from the typical teacher centered or lecture-centered classroom. (Smith & MacGregor,
1992)

   It is based on the assumptions that learning is an active, constructive process that depends on rich contexts.
Collaborative learning also recognizes that learners are diverse and that learning is inherently social. As Jeff
Golub explains, "Collaborative learning has as its main feature a structure that allows for student talk: students
are supposed to talk with each other....and it is in this talking that much of the learning occurs." (Golub,
1988) Collaborative learning produces intellectual synergy through mutual exploration, meaning-making, and
feedback. It often leads to deeper understanding and sometimes a whole new understanding for students. The
image below outlines an example of a process to promote collaboration in the classroom. It involves student
conversation prompts to encourage them to ask questions. This process also enables them to listen and then
summarize the statements of other classmates so they can come to an understanding and work together as
they learn.

126 | Teaching and Learning
                  Image 6.8

The most structured example of collaborative learning is cooperative learning. In cooperative learning, the
development of interpersonal skills is as important as the learning of content itself. Many cooperative learning
tasks include both academic and social skills as objectives. Strategies often involve assigning roles within each
small group (such as recorder, participation encourager, summarizer) to ensure the positive interdependence
of group members and to enable students to practice different skills. Setting aside time for students to reflect
on how they are doing and on the group process is embedded within the approach so that students become
more effective working in future groups. (Johnson, Johnson and Holubec, 1990).

   Cooperative learning's emphasis on social skills aligns well with the current educational focus on social
emotional learning (SEL) in the classroom. The relationship skills developed by working interdependently
in groups address a component of one of the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning
(CASEL) framework's key elements of SEL. When teachers design collaborative learning thoughtfully, including
intentional grouping, clear guidelines for interacting and expectations for outcomes, students develop active
listening, clear communication, negotiation skills, and the ability to work with diverse individuals.

6.4 Creating Learning Goals

Teaching is a complex endeavor and many tools have been developed to organize instruction and ensure
lessons are purposeful and lead all students to learn. Benjamin Bloom (mentioned earlier) created a hierarchical
classification of thinking that has been used for classroom instruction. It relies on a continuum of cognitive
complexity from simple to complex and concrete to abstract (Armstrong, 2010). It is a commonly used resource

                                                                                                                                                 Teaching and Learning | 127
for writing objectives with verbs classified by level. The verbs at the top of the pyramid (Image 6.4) are

believed to represent higher-order thinking skills while the ones at the bottom are more basic.

                             Bloom's taxonomy underwent a major revision by

                             Krathwohl & Anderson (2001). Image 6.9 names the various

                             levels of Blooms Taxonomy. The pyramid begins with

                             Knowledge and increases the cognitive load of the learner.

                             The verbs associated with differing levels of thinking skills

                             required for any given task provide guidance as a teacher

                             writes lesson outcomes for a class. For instance, a lower

                             order outcome may be: The student will recall

                             multiplication tables one through four. A higher order

                             outcome might be: The student will differentiate between

                             nutritious foods and foods with processed ingredients.

                             When teachers understand the complexity of thinking

                             levels required by the lesson, they may ensure that

                             students have a good balance amongst all skills in the

                             spectrum.

                             Focusing on what students should know is frequently

Image 6.9                    called the "cognitive" approach; focusing on what students

                             should be able to do is known as the "behavioral"

approach." Most teachers often combine the two and include both declarative and procedural knowledge

within their objectives. Large-scale learning objectives will be articulated in a teacher's curriculum guide, but it

is up to each individual teacher to formulate learning objectives for individual lesson plans.

Using Bloom's Taxonomy for Creating Learning Objectives

Oregon provides guidance for developing learning goals for students based on students' current abilities and
baselines skills and in alignment to the Oregon state standards (Oregon Department of Education). Teachers,
often working in grade level teams or professional learning communities (PLCs), develop objectives to guide
their day to day teaching. They check for understanding using observations, exit tickets, or work samples to
determine if students are learning and they adjust their teaching accordingly to support student progress
(Fisher & Frey, 2014). This may include reteaching parts of the lesson, differentiating instruction for groups
of students, providing additional practice opportunities, or moving quickly through a concept that seems to
already have been grasped by students.

   Lesson plans often include 2 or 3 objectives. This allows the teacher to scaffold instruction, providing lots
of support when introducing a concept and then scaling back support to encourage student independence,
based on the work of Lev Vygotsky (Wood, Bruner, and Ross, 1976). Students bring varying levels of readiness to
learn a concept or complete a task. If teachers offer support to students during the learning process, they can
assist them in accessing more complex tasks. Using Bloom's Taxonomy can help teachers create objectives that
start with tasks requiring lower order thinking skills, and move to tasks that require higher order thinking. By
including multiple objectives in progression, a teacher can measure what objective the students have not met
yet and focus on addressing those specific parts of the lesson.

Critique of Bloom's Taxonomy

Both Bloom's Taxonomy and its 2001 revision tend to meet the needs of bureaucratized institutional teaching
systems. Public education in the US is trending towards creating distinct, measurable outcomes to
demonstrate student learning. Bloom's taxonomy gives educators a relatively straightforward framework to
accomplish these goals.

   However, the progression of Bloom's Taxonomy through hierarchical levels is rigid and is not representative
of the way many people learn. The taxonomy directs educators toward its " top" level at the risk of devaluing
the other levels. The distinction between the categories is artificial since any learning involves many processes.
The classification of learning into discrete levels may undermine the holistic, interrelated, and interdependent
nature of the levels that Bloom's Taxonomy attempts to capture. (Fadul, J. A. (2009).

   "Collective Learning: Applying distributed cognition for collective intelligence". The International Journal of
Learning. 16 (4): 211-220.) Further, from the perspective of this counter narrative, its rigidity does not leave much
room for cultural inclusivity.

   You may wonder why and how critiques emerge about well established concepts like Bloom's Taxonomy.
One avenue of critique arises from the realm of critical theory. Critical theorists attempt to understand and
dismantle the societal frameworks that cause and contribute to oppression. Critical theorists assert that
academia itself has played a role in perpetuating these oppressions, and advocate for reimagining the status
quo. One way to support this kind of inquiry is to learn about different educational systems around the world.
It can give us ideas and fresh perspectives. Another reason is that comparing outside or nondominant systems
to our own highlights the assets and deficits that might be invisible to us because we are so immersed in the
environment. You will learn more about this as you progress through your studies to become a teacher.

     Consider

        After reading about Bloom's Taxonomy, its critiques, and how objective writing can be approached,
     what questions or critiques do you have about the following sample learning objectives? For example,
     critiquing some of the following objectives would involve a teacher asking themselves: is this really
     what we want students to learn? Why 85%? Why do we care? Is this valuable in the big scheme?

          Sample Objectives
          Remember: The student will be able to list the parts of a salmon with 85% accuracy.
          Understand: The student will be able to paraphrase research on the effectiveness of vaccination
       policies with 85% accuracy.
          Apply : The student will be able to create a graph of emissions of greenhouse gasses over time
       with 85% accuracy.

                                                                                                                                                 Teaching and Learning | 129
          Analyze: The student will be able to explain the various ways to solve a math equation with 85%
       accuracy.

          Evaluate: The student will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of U.S. propaganda during WWII
       with 85%.

          Create: The student will be able to construct a program for addressing food disaster relief with 85%
       accuracy.

Conclusion

You may be familiar with the slogan "knowledge is power." There's a lot of truth to that statement. You may
also be familiar with the saying: "the hand that rocks the cradle rules the world." As teachers, we have the
power to shape not only what our students learn, but what our students learn is important, and how they learn
those things. Reflection on this dynamic can give us the opportunity to consider how to introduce ways of
teaching and learning that have been devalued and erased from mainstream education through the process
of colonization and homogenization of the curriculum. In order to do this, teachers must be in touch with the
communities they teach, and the historical and political forces that have brought us to where we are today.

   Curriculum, according to John Dewey (1902) "...is a continuous reconstruction, moving from the child's present
experience out into that represented by the organized bodies of truth that we call studies... are themselves
experience..." (p. 11-12). This chapter will focus on the different types of curricula and the relationship between
curricula, cognition, and affect.

7.1 The Purpose of a Curriculum

What is the importance of a curriculum? Answers will vary. According to the United States Department of

Education the purpose of having a curriculum is to provide teachers with an outline for what should be taught

in classrooms. The United States Department of Education wants to ensure that students are exposed to

rigorous curricular goals to ensure that they are prepared for real-world experiences that will make students

college and career ready. Most schools look to local or state authorities for guidance regarding a curriculum.

                                         Most countries of the world have unified standards

                                         and a central curriculum. The United States, however,

                                         has never had a unified curriculum or even standards

                                         until attempts were made through federal legislation

                                         such as No Child Left Behind and the state-led

                                         initiative called the Common Core. This is because

                                         education started as a local affair in the United States.

                                         Core Knowledge Pioneer E.D. Hirsch argued that all

                                         children in the United States should have

                                         foundational essential knowledge, especially in

                                         grades K-8. This issue has been debated for hundreds

                                         of years in the United States due to the differing

Image 7.2                                agendas of federal, state and local governments and
                                         different philosophies regarding the purpose of

education. Local communities want a say in what is taught in their local schools, especially of late, controversial

themes such as evolution, racism, climate change, amongst other hot topics. Education is indeed highly

politicized today.

There is immense power in determining what students will learn, with many competing forces at play.

Because schooling in the United States is left to the jurisdiction of individual states, certain content is viewed,

valued, and taught differently depending on the collective values of the state or county. While school districts

provide a curriculum, teachers will pick and choose what they focus on. Teachers have more power that some

might think. Once the classroom door is closed, teachers teach largely based on who they are and what they

believe in- even as they use a district curriculum. There are many ways to teach about Martin Luther King,

for example. One teacher might focus on how much progress has been made in terms of racial justice, while

another teacher will focus on the lack of racial justice. Imagine how different learning could be if more complex

and important details were a part of the curriculum for all students.

But, what is the curriculum that each U.S. state follows? In 1990 a movement began in the United States

to establish national educational standards for students across the country. The goals were (a) outlining what

students were expected to know and do at each grade level and (b) implementing ways to find out if they

were meeting those standards. Currently 41 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Common

Core State Standards (CCSS). The four states that never adopted the Standards are Virginia, Texas, Alaska, and

Nebraska and the four states who have successfully withdrawn from the Common Core curriculum are Arizona,

Oklahoma, Indiana, and South Carolina. The states who have not adopted the CCSS have the responsibility to

review their academic standard on an ongoing basis to provide quality education to their students. Wikipedia

7.2 Sociological Influences of the Four Curricula

   There are four different types of curricula that
educators have to address in the classroom; these
four are the explicit, implicit, null, and extracurricular.
The most obvious curriculum in the classroom is the
explicit curriculum because that is the curriculum
that has been approved by each state. The
extracurricular curriculum also exists for such
activities as academic clubs, band and chorus, or
sports. The curriculum that is not so obvious is the
implicit curriculum or hidden curriculum which
teaches things not explicitly stated, and the null
curriculum is information that students may never be
exposed to because they are completely excluded Image 7.3
from the explicit curriculum. Each of these curricula
will be explained below with examples to illustrate what each entails.

Explicit Curriculum

Explicit instruction is a curriculum that has been intentionally designed, field tested by educators, and
disseminated publicly, often with resources that will help teachers facilitate classroom instruction. A curriculum
is guided by standards. It is important to differentiate between standards and curriculum:

                                                                                                                           Curriculum and Academic Standards | 139
Image 7.4

While NY has an organized statewide digital curriculum that all educators can access, Oregon has adopted the
same Common Core state standards but does not have a statewide curriculum. Instead, Oregon has district
curricula which follow the Common Core standards ( see video 7.2 for more information about the Common
Core Movement). What are the advantages of a system such as the system in New York? They are able to share
curriculum, ideas, and lesson plans across districts. This makes a difference when some districts have access to
a lot more resources than others. When teachers in a district can only share within its district, there is a limit
to what they can achieve. For example, If a district just started a dual immersion program and no one else has
such a program, they have to start from scratch and work alone, whereas in a statewide approach, resources are
widely shared.

Implicit Curriculum (also known as the Hidden Curriculum)

The implicit curriculum involves hidden lessons that emerge from the culture of the local school district school
and the values, behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs that have been defined by the district. Bruner (1960) addressed
the need to cultivate an understanding of ideas by including content beyond the explicit curriculum. An
example of an implicit curriculum is character education. Character education may address values that are not

140 | Curriculum and Academic Standards
part of the state-approved curriculum. While character education can be found in the explicit curriculum, the
nuances of the character education program may be informed by many factors present in the local school
district including the school community's cultural expectations, values, and perspectives. A character education
program may also include specific curricular topics which may contain varying ideological and/or cultural
messages. Teaching strategies that connect the school to the community like problem-based learning or
applied learning, can also be part of the implicit curriculum.

     Pause and Ponder - Hidden Curriculum

        Everything that goes on in school that is not part of an official lesson is part of the hidden curriculum.
     What messages do schools and teachers send by

It is important that schools and educators consider that all schools have a hidden curriculum, and that it
is largely outside of our consciousness. With attention and reflection, this curriculum can be brought into
sharper focus. In the late 1970s, Jean Anyon did a study of different kinds of schools in the United States and
described her observations about socioeconomic class and how SE class is perpetuated by a kind of hidden
curriculum. She observed that schools in wealthier communities provided more autonomy and freedom to
their students thus encouraging students towards executive and leadership roles, while students in poorer
communities were given less autonomy and freedom, and subsequently encouraged towards more working
and middle class roles. Ultimately, Anyon concluded that students were being prepared for certain kinds
of work, in her words: "differing curricular, pedagogical, and pupil evaluation practices emphasize different
cognitive and behavioral skills in each social setting and thus contribute to the development in the children of
certain potential relationships to physical and symbolic capital, to authority, and to the process of work" (Anyon,
1970)

   The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation funded a survey of U.S. public school teachers' from 2010 to 2012 in
both English language arts and math classes in seven large metropolitan areas. The study examined teaching-
effectiveness or differences in classrooms taught by the same teacher; and whether factors such as student
demographics play a role. The study found that "whenever there was a classroom of predominantly students
of color, teachers were systematically less likely to use proven instructional models they used with White
students."

                                                                                                                            Curriculum and Academic Standards | 141

development than other students is evident in our

educational system. The curriculum is typically less

challenging and more repetitive, with teachers

reinforcing what they believe students should be able

to do on specific tasks and focusing on the lower skills

in Bloom's Taxonomy. This type of instruction denies

students the opportunity to engage in what

neuroscientists call a productive struggle that

actually grows our brain. As a result, a

disproportionate number of        culturally and Image 7.5

learners.

Zaretta Hammond, in her book Culturally Responsive Teaching and the Brain (2015), explains what

neuroscientists are talking about neuroplasticity with an emphasis on culture. She states that we, as future

educators, spend a lot of our time learning about different theories but do not learn how to apply them in our

everyday teaching. Her emphasis has been on linking the research about the brain and how it can be applied

to a culturally responsive pedagogy. "Cognition and higher order thinking have always been at the center of

culturally responsive teaching, which makes it a natural partner for neuroscience in the classroom" (Zaretta

Hammon, p. 4). Therefore, we need to strive to facilitate student's cognitive growth so that they can activate

their neuroplasticity and become independent learners.

In the table below, you will find the difference between a dependent learner and independent learner

   Jean Anyon's foundational article on how The Hidden Curriculum can transmit ideas about social
class:

Null Curriculum

Eisner (1985) defined null curriculum as information that schools do not teach:

     "... the options students are not       There are several examples of null curriculum that can

study. An example of this would be a social studies unit focusing on the New Deal may not reference the fact

that the New Deal failed to resolve the problem of unemployment. Many educators would argue that racism

has not been taught in US schools for most of the history of the United States, and recent attempts to rectify

this have resulted in huge controversy.

144 | Curriculum and Academic Standards
Extra-Curricular Curriculum

Extra-curricular curriculum includes school-sponsored opportunities that fall outside of academic requirements
prescribed on the local and state levels. Examples of extracurricular activities include participation in sports,
music, student governance, yearbook, school newspaper, and academic clubs. Extracurricular participation is a
strategy to promote school connectedness (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009). Extracurricular
activities are often associated with many positive outcomes such as higher academic achievement and
decreased school dropout (Farb & Matjasko, 2012).

   According to the United States National Center for Education Statistics (2012), sports are the most common
type of extracurricular activity among secondary school students, with 44% of high school seniors reporting
participation in some type of sport. Additionally, 21% of students participate in music activities, as well as clubs,
such as academic (21%), hobby (12%), and vocational clubs (16%).

7.3 Racial Justice in the Curriculum

Recent concerns and protests about racial justice in the United States are another example of the tensions
among explicit, implicit, and null curricula. Some schools may openly address and discuss protests for racial
justice, while other schools may not mention them at all. The reasons for not addressing this topic range
from not wanting to upset students or parents to openly racist thinking at the classroom, district, or state
level. However, if something is never mentioned in school and therefore becomes part of the null curriculum,
students take note of what is missing. Milner (2017) describes events like the violence in Charlottesville in 2017
as exactly the kind of topic that students must learn about in schools to cement the importance of social
justice for future generations. Another example is Critical Race Theory. CRT seeks to address institutional and
systemic racism and how certain ethnic groups historically have not had access to the same opportunities in
housing, healthcare, justice, education, leading to an inequitable society. Critical Race Theory has become a
hotly contested theory reflecting a very divided politicized US society, so much so that conservative legislators
are taking steps to remove CRT from the classroom. All educators need to to understand how racism has
functioned in US society and what is the lens through which they will approach the topic. Following the death
of George Floyd, we are in a time of awakening and social changes in the United States, and educators most
certainly have an important role to play.

7.4 Cognitive and Affective Domains of Curricula

The curriculum can be viewed from varying perspectives. The cognitive perspective of the curriculum focuses
primarily on the acquisition of knowledge. The affective perspective tends to go beyond the acquisition of
knowledge to include the degree that students value the knowledge that is being delivered to achieve
educational outcomes. These two perspectives of curricula allow people to consider not only the subject matter,
but how the students react to the material being delivered.

The Cognitive Domain of Curricula

The cognitive domain of curricula deals with how students gain knowledge. In today's schools, this is often
achieved by dividing the knowledge into separate content areas. This model prioritizes a content-specific
instructional focus over social emotional learning.

Subject-Centered

The idea of subject-centered instruction separates instruction into distinct content areas. The skills and content
contributing to the curriculum varies by subject. While this model was adopted in the United States in the
1870's, it is still in practice today, especially at the secondary level. The pros and cons of this model were outlined
by Ornstein (1982).

Common Core Curriculum

The Common Core movement emerged in the early 2000s as a response to concerns about the variability
and inconsistency in educational standards across different states. The idea was to establish a set of uniform,
rigorous standards that would ensure all students were adequately prepared for college and the workforce,
regardless of where they lived. The National Governors Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School
Officers (CCSSO) led the effort, bringing together educators, researchers, and experts to develop the Common
Core State Standards. The standards were released in 2010 and initially adopted by 45 states and the District of
Columbia. E. D Hirsch, who founded the Common Core movement, advocates for a core curriculum where all
students should know a common body of knowledge. This model takes a more interdisciplinary approach to
ensure that all prescribed content is covered.

   Opponents of this method argue that this approach doesn't take children's unique learning styles into

consideration. For example, children with diverse needs may have difficulty thriving in such schools due to their
prescribed curriculum and the lack of an individualized teaching approach. Many parents struggled to support
their kids with new ways of doing math. There was increased pressure to test children and due to political
pressures from both sides of the aisle, the movement has fallen out of favor. A final question looms over this
topic, and that is: who decides what constitutes essential or common knowledge? In an increasingly divided
society, there are no easy answers to this question.

Mastery Learning

Mastery learning includes multiple educational practices based on the principle that if students are given
adequate time to study and have appropriate instruction most students can meet the learning standards set
for the course. Mastery learning is based on the acknowledgement of the differing rate of time that students
take to master material. Theoretically speaking, there could be the possibility that all students will be learning
at different paces and the teacher will have to attend to the differences in the pace of instruction of all of their
students (Block & Anderson, 1974).

   Some advantages of this method is that educators take the time to know their students and therefore, focus
their teaching based on the student's prior knowledge, interests, talents, and preferred ways of learning, making
it a culturally responsive approach.

148 | Curriculum and Academic Standards
The Affective Domain of Curricula

The affective domain of curricula places emphasis on
feeling and valuing in education. This is the aspect of
the curriculum that emphasizes emotions and
motivation. This domain is rooted in the belief that
schools have responsibilities beyond the delivery of
instruction. In this domain, the information is
presented in a manner that guides students to seeing
the value in the things they are learning in the
classroom in a way that helps the students see the
value in the material that is being covered in the
course. It is the goal to make a lasting impression on Image 7.7
the students, eliciting an emotional response from
the students.

   Concerned with the affective side of his students' education, Paulo Freire developed a liberation pedagogy
which has influenced generations of educators, centering the freedom and humanization of students. In his
theory, students become active learners as educators pose worldly problems that relate to their lives and push
them to analyze how and why those problems exist, leading to a cultural change. He encourages educators to
teach through critical pedagogical methods that promote the connection of students to their environment.

   The work of Freire inspired bell hooks (amongst many others) who added the concepts of self-care to Freire's
liberatory approach. The Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nat Hanh was another major influence for hooks
particularly regarding health and well-being. Self-actualization cannot occur without self-care. Hooks' holistic
concept of "Engaged Pedagogy" centers care and healing in the process of learning. Thich Nhat Hanh was
concerned with the whole body, more than just the mind. This wholeness includes mind, body and spirit and
emphasizes well-being, a somewhat radical notion in academia.

    Deeper Dive: Mindfulness in Schools

        The affective domain of curricula emphasizes emotions and motivation. Part of this is taking care of
     ourselves. Especially recently, educators have to navigate a system that is surrounded by negativity,
     racism, and hatred. In the following website The Urban Mindfulness Foundation, educators, especially
     educators of color, can find several resources that will connect them with different people, experiences
     and feelings.

        There is also a REAL TALK video that would teach educators, and other professions, what mindfulness
     means and the importance of practicing it on a daily basis in classrooms.

Sentipensante

Laura Rendon offers a transformative vision of education that emphasizes the harmonic, complementary
relationship between the sentir of feeling, intuition, the inner life and the pensar of thinking, intellectualism

                                                                                                                           Curriculum and Academic Standards | 149
and the pursuit of scholarship; between teaching and learning; formal knowledge and wisdom; and between
Western and non-Western ways of knowing. In the process she develops a pedagogy that encompasses
wholeness, multiculturalism, and contemplative practice, that helps students transcend limiting views about
themselves; fosters high expectations, and helps students to become social change agents. Teaching about
social justice is central to developing this responsibility in students.

   In this video, Laura Rendon describes what it means to be "una persona educada", a person not only with
academic knowledge but a person with wisdom, and responsibility for the world they are living in. She describes
contemplative education and how we need to learn to cultivate this wisdom, compassion and humanity.

CONCLUSION

Curriculum has always been a political and controversial topic because defining what children learn has so
much to do with determining what the political and societal future will be. In some states, educators are
increasingly limited in what they can teach because education has long been a political battleground. In many
cases however, educators have more autonomy than they realize. While it may be true that educators can not
teach on certain controversial topics ( such as racism or climate change) they are able to provide assignments
and the autonomy for students to do research in those areas. While educators should never tell their students
what to think, they can cultivate opportunities for their students to engage in critical thinking about important
issues that impact our modern society.

   What is the purpose of assessment in schools? At the core, the purpose is to assess student learning,
progress, and understanding to ensure that the teaching is appropriate and ultimately, successful. It provides

                                                                                                                                                                  Assessment | 153
valuable information to teachers about their students' knowledge and abilities, as well as their own instructional
methods. It involves gathering information about students' knowledge, skills, and abilities to inform
instructional practices and enhance educational outcomes. For external stakeholders such as school boards,
administrators, parents, there is an accountability mandate to ensure that students are receiving a high-quality
education. Assessment is also tied to grading and performance, and has huge implications for students in terms
of academic and professional goals. For many years, grading practices were accepted and not questioned.
Recently and increasingly, grading and testing are being examined for fairness, appropriateness and equity.
There is a growing recognition about the role of equitable grading and testing in creating a more just society.

8.1 Historical Context

Historically, unfair and discriminatory bias in assessment practices have been perpetuated over time,
stemming from cultural, social, or systemic biases. The US educational system is still functioning within the
legacy of these influences; learning assessment is naturally shaped by the same factors. These biases
disproportionately disadvantage certain groups of individuals based due to issues such as race, ethnicity,
gender, socioeconomic status, or cultural background. Because educational assessments have often reflected
the dominant cultural norms and values of the society in which they were created, this has led to unequal
opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups.

   Language barriers, biased questions and culturally unfamiliar content, for example, have unfairly
disadvantaged students from non-dominant backgrounds. Addressing historical bias requires a critical
examination of assessment tools, content, and methodologies to ensure they are inclusive, culturally sensitive,
and reflecting diverse perspectives. By acknowledging and rectifying historical bias in assessment, educational
institutions can strive for greater equity and provide a more accurate reflection of students' true capabilities and
potential. What follows are just a couple of historical examples which shaped and influenced how educators
assessed and tested students in US schools.

The Eugenics Movement: Intelligence Testing and Categorization

   In the US, in order to justify the practice of
enslavement of human beings, a type of racism
emerged in the 1800's called scientific racism.
Scientific racism attempted to justify the superiority
of the white race by relying on pseudoscience. One
way scientific racism manifested was in the Eugenics
movement. Eugenics is a set of beliefs and practices
that aim to improve the genetic quality of a human
population. Eugenics became an academic discipline
at many colleges and universities and received
funding from many sources.

   With the introduction of genetics, Eugenics
became associated with genetic determinism, the
belief that human character is entirely or in the
majority caused by genes, unaffected by education or Image 8.3
living conditions. Organizations were formed to win
public support and sway opinion towards Eugenic values. At the beginning of the 1900's, educational academics

154 | Assessment
were exploring ideas around "natural and genetically based" intelligence. They brought all their preconceived
notions about racial and ethnic superiority to their explorations and devised intelligence tests that ended up
often creating self-fulfilling prophecies. The legacy of this built-in systemic bias and implied White superiority
live on today through IQ testing and standardized tests - up to and including college entrance exams.

Sputnik: Cold War Fears

The headlines on October 4, 1957 revealed that the Soviet Union had successfully launched Sputnik 1, the first

man-made satellite. This event single-handedly launched America into a decades long endeavor to not only

compete in the space program, but to evaluate and launch a new and purportedly improved educational

system that would afford its students a curriculum of rigor, especially in the realms of mathematics and science.

It would, presumably, prepare U.S. students to compete with other nations.

                                     This event also marked a pivotal reversal of

                                     progressive educational philosophy that prevailed

                                     during the 1950's. Some proponents of a more

                                     rigorous curricula contended that U.S. education was

                                     "soft," that they relied too heavily on vocational

                                     training, and that teachers were not trained

                                     effectively. (Watters, 2015) Critics of the U.S.

                                     educational system included Arthur Bestor

                                     (Educational Wastelands 1953 and Restoration of

Image 8.2                            Learning 1956). Bestor, professor of history at the
                                     University of Illinois wrote a Life magazine article,

                                     "What Went Wrong with US Schools?" He made

sharp comparisons to schools and the Sputnik satellite, contending that US students were simply not prepared.

(Bestor, 1953)

These series of events set the stage for the educational reform measures of the next few decades in US

public schools, a period marked by the need for rigor, accountability and competitive edge within the global

sphere. Nearly two decades later, the historic report, A Nation at Risk (April 1983), would catapult a nation

toward an increased urgency for rigor and competency. There was a sense that our very future as a world power

hinged upon the success of our schools. Critics of progressive education, in particular, took aim at the US public

school system. Their fears would cause a significant shift in the approach to US schools, bringing business and

governmental leaders to the table for the next few decades with heightened expectations for assessing the

progress of children in US schools.

Critical Lens - A Nation at Risk

        We report to the American people that while we can take justifiable pride in what our schools and
     colleges have historically accomplished and contributed to the United States and the well- being of its
     people, the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of
     mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a people. - National Commission on
     Excellence in Education, 1983

The emerging emphasis was on summative assessment in the form of increased standardized testing, and
stakes became quite high in terms of their consequences for schools, communities and students. As US
American students falter compared to other industrialized countries, policy makers have shifted toward a great
concentration on high-stakes testing to increase student standing. Unfortunately, this emphasis on high-stakes
testing has not yielded an increase in scores (Michael Hout, 2012).

8.2 Global Assessment

   According to the Program for International Student
Assessment (PISA), Reading Literacy scores, United States
students earned an average score of 497, while students in
Singapore earned the highest average, 535 and students in
Lebanon tied with students in Kosovo for the lowest
average of 347. This places United States students in the
average range of reading. (Reading Literacy: Average
Scores, 2015)

   Mathematics Literacy scores revealed an average of 470
for U.S. students as compared to Singapore scores of 564 at
the highest end and 328 from the Dominican Republic at
the lowest end placing United States students as below
average performers. (Mathematics Literacy: Average
Scores, 2015)

   Although students in the United States have
demonstrated an interest and positive attitude toward
science, the scores reveal a discrepancy between attitude

                                                                                                       Image 8.4
and performance, with United States students scoring at
an average of 496 as compared to a high of 556 (Singapore), and a low of Dominican Republic (332).

8.3 High Stakes Testing and Accountability

High stakes testing is often used as a tool to hold schools and teachers accountable for student learning. It
may even be viewed as the sole measure of student success. If student learning is measured through tests,
then we must take into account the issue of bias particularly in standardized testing. Although most forms of
assessment have some kind of implicit bias, standardized testing is rife with it (Couch et al., 2021, Taylor and
Bobbit Nolan 2022.)

     Pause and Ponder - Article from National Education Association

        Racist Beginnings of Standardized testing

   High-stakes testing has always been supported by both major political parties in the United States, and in
2002 the U.S. government passed the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) into law (United States Congress, 2002).
As a policy, NCLB relies upon high-stakes testing as the central mechanism for school reform, mandating that
all students be tested in reading and math in grades 3-8 and once in high school, with future provisions that
students be tested at least once at the elementary, middle, and high school levels in science. If schools do
not show consistent growth on these tests in subgroups related to race, economic class, special education,
and English language proficiency, among others, they face sanctions such as a loss of federal funding, with
the ultimate policy goal of all students reaching 100% proficiency by 2014 (Karp, 2006). In 2015, Every Student
Succeeds Act was passed. ESSA takes steps to reduce standardized testing.

   Accountability (holding teachers, schools, and districts responsible, or accountable, for increasing student

learning and performance) carries both benefits and challenges. Of course, all educators and educational
stakeholders share a common goal of advancing student learning. Testing provides an opportunity to
understand what students have learned. They provide a common framework to measure students across age
levels and geographic regions. However, accountability can be hard to measure, and sometimes standardized
test scores become the primary way to measure teacher effectiveness. This measurement can be unfair,
especially when we consider the varying resources allocated to schools, the cultural bias of standardized testing,
and the reality that some students are not good test takers.

   In an age of accountability and data driven curriculum, policy makers have supported standardized and
other testing measures; however, some organizations have highlighted the importance of a balance between
teaching and testing. The "Learning Is More Than a Test Score" campaign has brought to light the curricula
omissions in favor of increased time for testing and preparation of testing. Studies reveal that students spend
20 to 50 hours each year taking tests while those in heavily tested grades spend 60 to more than 110 hours per
year. These figures translate to additional pupil expenditures of $700 to at time, more than $1,000 per year and
account for 20 to 40 minutes of lost instructional time each day (see footnote 1). The debate continues about
the loss of academic time and dollars spent in relation to the benefits of test preparation in schools across the
nation.

8.4 Types of Assessment

If used correctly, assessment is an integral part of the teaching/learning process. For teachers, it drives their
instructions and for students, it drives their learning. If done well, the feedback that educators provide to
students will guide them on how to achieve their goals. In this section, we are going to focus on different types
of assessment.

Diagnostic Assessment

The diagnostic assessment is a form of pre-assesment where teachers can learn about students' strengths,
weaknesses, knowledge and skills before their instruction. This type of assessment is not usually graded as it is
a baseline for teachers to know where to start in their lessons. With this form of assessment, teachers can plan
meaningful and efficient instruction and can provide students with an individualized learning experience.

Formative Assessment

The formative assessment is one which occurs throughout a lesson or unit and may take a variety of forms. A
teacher may determine what students know by question and answer formats, checklists, or by paper and pencil
assignments. Likewise, games such as Kahoot and Jeopardy may assist in similar data collection. The informed
teacher can utilize the results of the formative assessment to re-engage or to modify the teaching plans to
meet the individual needs of the students. Formative assessments are typically lower stress than summative
assessments; often students are not even aware their teachers are using the activity to assess their learning.

Summative Assessment

The summative assessment is the evaluation that is given at the conclusion of a unit or lesson. It may determine
student placement or level of knowledge and is often thought of as a grade determinant. Results of summative

158 | Assessment
assessment are not used in lesson planning; rather, they are used to evaluate the mastery of material. It can take
the form of a question and answer or paper and pencil approach like the formative assessment. Summative
assessments also typically have one correct answer.

8.5 Bloom's Taxonomy

Teaching is a complex endeavor and many tools have been developed to organize instruction and ensure
lessons are purposeful and lead all students to learn. Bloom's Taxonomy has been used to both design
instruction and assess learning for decades in the United States. The intent is to promote critical thinking and
encourage educators to plan for the level of critical thinking. It provides a road map for teachers in terms of
the level of complexity as it relates to the subject being studied. Do we want students to be able to answer
questions on a test about the Civil War or produce a play with fellow students about the Civil War? Teachers
need to define the level of complexity and then assess for that specifically. Once educators assess the learning,
they subsequently can redesign the instructional approach. In this way, assessment and instructional design
are involved in a symbiotic, organic and iterative process with each other. Effective instruction is dependent on
ongoing assessment.

                                                                                                       Assessment | 159
                                                   Bloom's Taxonomy was created by Benjamin

                                                   Bloom in 1956 at the University of Chicago. This

                                                   taxonomy is a classification system which has helped

                                                   educators to both design curriculum and plan

                                                   assessment.

                                                   Bloom's Taxonomy represents a process of thinking.

                                                   The first level of questioning prompts the learner to

                                                   remember facts about a given concept such as when

                                                   did the Brown vs Board of Education case get

                                                   decided? Students would recall the year 1954. The

Image 8.5                                          next levels require the connection of these facts to
                                                   develop a deeper understanding of their meaning,

such as what did the Brown vs. Board of Education ruling actually mean for US Americans? On the highest

level, students must create a new idea or demonstrate their understanding. Bloom's Taxonomy is also used to

formulate learning outcomes and drive assessment.

   Bloom's hierarchical classification of thinking has been used for classroom instruction for decades. It relies on

a continuum of cognitive complexity from simple to complex and concrete to abstract (Armstrong, 2010). It is a
commonly-used resource for writing objectives with verbs classified by level. The verbs at the top of the pyramid
(figure 8.5) are believed to represent higher-order thinking skills while the ones at the bottom are more basic.

   Bloom's taxonomy underwent a major revision by Krathwohl & Anderson (2001). The image above shows the
increasing cognitive load and provides a short definition of each level. The verbs associated with differing levels
of thinking skills required for any given task provide guidance as a teacher writes outcomes for any lesson for
a class. For instance, a lower order outcome may be: The student will recall multiplication tables one through
four. A higher order outcome might be: The student will differentiate between nutritious foods and foods with
processed ingredients. When teachers understand the complexity of thinking levels required by the lesson, they
may ensure that students have a good balance among all skills in the spectrum.

   Focusing on what students should know is frequently called the "cognitive" approach; focusing on what
students should be able to do is known as the "behavioral" approach. Most teachers often combine the two
and include both declarative and procedural knowledge within their objectives. Large-scale learning objectives
will be articulated in a teacher's curriculum guide, but it is up to each individual teacher to formulate learning
objectives for individual lesson plans.

   Designing and administering assessments that align with your standards and engage students at various
levels of Bloom's Taxonomy is an important first step, but another key part of effective assessments is analyzing
the data you collect. Analysis of data can occur on individual student, small group, or whole class levels. If many
students demonstrate a similar misunderstanding on an assessment, that data indicates the teacher should
re-teach that content to increase students' mastery. Data-driven instruction looks at the results of various
assessments when considering next instructional steps. Assessment and grades are not the same. Grades can
be a form of assessment, but not all assessments are graded. Assessments can include both quantitative and
qualitative data. For example, observing students during an activity would not be a grade, but it would give you

160 | Assessment
important information about what a student does or does not understand. There are many practices that exist
to support students during assessments, such as IEP accommodations, differentiated assessments, retakes,
and no-zero policies.

8.6 Grading

                                          Grading involves assigning scores or labels-such as

                                          letter grades, rubric scores, complete or incomplete

                                          labels, or numeric values-to a student's performance

                                          on a task. Two forms of grading that you may have

                                          experienced in school include mastery grading and

                                          standards-based grading. Mastery grading means to

                                          structure courses in a way that allows students the

                                          time and flexibility to focus on mastering a standard

                                          rather than achieving a certain number or letter

                                          grade. Standards-based grading breaks down the

                                          subject matter into smaller "learning targets." Each

                                          target (often phrased as an "I can" statement) is a

                                          teachable concept that students should master by

                                          the end of the course. Throughout the term, student

                                          learning on each target is recorded (Common Goal

                                          Systems, 2021). For example, in a simple grade on a

                                          report card, it may say the student received an A, or a

                                          percentage, such as 96%. In a standards-based report

Image 8.6                                 card, each target is broken down, such as "I can solve
                                          number sentences that have brackets", with a score

of 1-4; then, "I can find the sum of two-digit numbers", with a score of 1-4. In this scale, 1 indicates little or no

mastery and 4 indicates advanced mastery. Teachers track student progress, give appropriate feedback, and

adapt instruction to meet student needs.

The issue of grading is complex and often confusing for new teachers. There may be department-, school-, or

district-wide rules about how many grades a teacher should have in a quarter or semester. Some parents and

students are very focused on high grades, even if they don't reflect the student's actual level of understanding.

Most would argue that the primary purpose of the grading system is to clearly, accurately, consistently, and

fairly communicate learning progress and achievement to students, families, postsecondary institutions, and

prospective employers (Great Schools Partnerships, 2021); if teachers do not provide timely and meaningful

feedback, however, grading can sometimes interfere with assessments of students' actual understanding.

Grading for Equity

In an ideal world, grades and assessments are fair and impartial. However, the reality is that bias often creeps
into assessment systems. One simple work-around is to use rubrics with specific criteria. David M Quinn (2021)
conducted an experiment in which he gave teachers two second grade writing samples, one presented as
a Black student's work and one as a White student's. Teachers gave the White student higher scores except
when they used a grading rubric with specific criteria, which caused the pre-existing racial bias in the scores

                                          Assessment | 161
to disappear. Therefore, rubrics not only help students know up front what expectations are for an assignment,
but also reduce opportunities for bias to impact grading. See article below.

     Pause and Ponder - How to Reduce Racial Bias in Grading by David M. Quinn

        https://www.educationnext.org/how-to-reduce-racial-bias-in-grading-research/

   Through his work as a teacher and administrator, Joe Feldman is a leading advocate for more equitable
grading. He points out that students have to navigate very different grading systems in each of their classrooms,
and it may not always lead to equitable grading despite the best intentions of their teachers. Educators tend
to base their grading on participation, homework and timeliness. While educators do not consciously set up
inequitable grading processes, these grading systems are often unexamined and result in negative and long-
lasting consequences for students.

     Critical Lens - Call to Action for Equitable Grading Practices

        grading:https://crescendoedgroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Call-to-Action-for-Equitable-
     Grading-Oct-2018.pdf

Feldman describes the basis of the problem:
 1. grading practices vary from teacher to teacher, and are largely subjective
2. Grades provide unclear and often misleading information to parents, students, and postsecondary
      institutions
 3. Traditional grading practices are often corrupted by implicit racial, class, and gender biases
4. Most teachers use grading practices that use mathematically unsound calculations that depress student
      achievement and progress.

Pause and Ponder - Educator Quote

   "Examining my own grading practice challenges what I've learned to do as a teacher in terms of
what I think students need to know, what they need to show back to me, and how to grade them. This
feels really important, messy, and really uncomfortable. It is `Oh my gosh, look what I've been doing!' I
don't blame myself because I didn't know any better. I did what was done to me. But now I'm in a
place that I feel really strongly that I can't do that anymore. I can't use grading as a way to discipline
kids anymore. I look at what I have been doing, and I have to do things differently"- Call to Action For
Equitable Grading, 2018

     Feldman's Recommendations for Equitable Grading:

      1. Practices that are mathematically sound: Using algorithms that conform to sound
           mathematical principles and reflect growth and learning as well as truly describe a student's
           level of mastery. Examples: Using a 0-4 instead of a 0-100 point scale; avoiding giving students
           scores of zero; and weighing more recent performance and growth instead of averaging
           performance over time.

      2. Practices that value knowledge, not environment or behavior. Evaluating students only on
           their level of content mastery, not how they act (or how teachers perceive or interpret their
           behavior). Examples: Not grading subjectively interpreted behaviors such as a student's "effort"
           or "participation", or on completion of homework; focusing grades on required content or
           standards, not extra credit or when work is turned in; not using grades to control students or
           reward compliance; and providing alternative consequences for cheating or missed
           assignments.

      3. Practices that support hope and a growth mindset: Encouraging mistakes as part of the
           learning process and building students' persistence and resilience. Examples: Allowing test/
           project retakes to emphasize and reward learning rather than penalize it; and replacing
           previous scores with current scores.

     4. Practices that "lift the veil" on how to succeed: Making grades simpler to understand and
           more transparent. Examples: Creating effective, standards-aligned rubrics; using simplified
           grade calculations and standards-based scales and gradebooks.

      5. Practices that build soft skills without including them in the grade: Supporting students'
           intrinsic motivation and confidence rather than relying on an extrinsic point system. Examples:
           Using peer/self-evaluation and reflection; using a more expansive range of feedback strategies;
           building self-regulation.

      6. Improved grading practices are accurate, bias-resistant, and motivate students in ways
           traditional grading does not,

                                                                                                                                                            Assessment | 163
Conclusion

   As you can see, the stroke of a pen can have lasting
impressions on the student. Grades can classify
learners. They can motivate or squelch desire. They
can encourage or demean. They can be used to
punish or to teach. It is critical for educators to
recognize that grades have long lasting
consequences on the lives of your students.

Activity - Questions to Consider

· Have you examined your own experiences with assessment (testing and grading) and what
   impact they have had so far in your own life?

· Have you reflected on how your own biases may shape your assessment strategies in the
   future?

· How will you communicate about assessment to future students?
· How will all of this impact how you plan curricula and evaluate student learning to benefit all

   learners equitably?

          "Funding education is not a mystery. It is a set of choices. It's a function of leadership, & we have to
       have leaders who are willing to have the very real conversations that education costs more for
       certain children and that the...return on investment lowers our public welfare costs, lowers our
       incarceration rates and lowers all of the social welfare programs that we have to put in place."

The federal department of education performs duties such as:

  · Making policies and regulations for different local educational offices.
  · Strengthening educational regulations about civil rights.
  · Cooperating with the majority of national federal agencies to support education events.
  · Collecting, sorting and analyzing data on American educational institutions including schools, colleges,

      and universities.
  · Improving student achievement for worldwide competitiveness.
  · Making sure equal educational opportunities for young people.

Additionally, the United States Department of Education also cooperates with other governmental
organizations to improve education quality for children from low-income households.

Key Parts of the United States Department of Education

  · United States Secretary of Education: The Secretary is the top executive of the United States Department
      of Education. The main duties of the Secretary is to provide comments and suggestions on educational

168 | Governance and Finance
      policies and projects in the United States.
  · Institute of Education Sciences (IES): IES usually carries out research and analysis in order to offer scientific

      evidence for domestic educational topics. Currently, IES has a number of National Centers for evaluating
      educational reports and data sets. So far, a large number of American local communities and academic
      organizations have benefited from the research outcomes of IES.
  · Federal Student Aid FSA): This sub-department in the United States Department of Education mainly
      supports student financial needs. Every year FSA deals with millions of applications and offers American
      students different types of grants, loans, and funds from FSA. Students may apply for financial support via
      some legal federal or private programs in many states and local offices.
  · Student Achievement and School Accountability Programs (SASA): This part provides financial support
      especially for national colleges and universities in the U.S.A. Furthermore, a number of programs, such as
      the English Language Enhancement and the program for Homeless Children, are involved in better
      education quality.
  · Office of Migrant Education (OME): The Office manages programs to provide academic support to
      children from migrant families. Typically, migrants in the U.S.A had poor working conditions so couldn't
      offer quality education experience to their children. OME aims to provide equal education opportunity to
      all students regardless of nations and religions.
  · Office of Career, Technical, and Adult Education (OCTAE): OCTAE, as a sub-division of the United States
      Department of Education, makes policies for a wide range of educational subjects, such as the
      postsecondary education, career and technical education, adult education and literacy, rural education
      and college aid. The Office also carries out statistical research that focuses on high school or community
      colleges.

When considering how decisions concerning schools are made, there are various levels of involvement in
educational governance at the federal, state and local levels:

          The federal government has limited powers, but maintains influence through promoting
       educational policies and reforms and potentially withholding funding if regulations are not met.

          The state government determines standards and policies for the state.
          The local school district, sometimes called the local educational agency, is responsible for
       reporting and working with the state educational agency. At the local level, schools are combined by
       geographical lines to make up school districts. Finally, schools themselves follow a local governing
       structure.

                                                                                                                                              Governance and Finance | 169
Image 9.3: School Governance at Federal, State, District, and School Levels (adapted from Powell, 2019)

Federal

As we stated before, the United States federal government does not have direct authority over schools in each
state. It does not tell schools what to teach or how. The department maintains its power

   through the distribution of federal education assistance. The head of
the U.S. Department of Education is nominated by the president and
approved by the Senate (U.S. Department of Education, 2010). It is
important to note that federal education acts must include federal
funding formulas and methods of distributing federal funds.

   The US Department of Education is responsible for:

· promoting policies and reform efforts;
· providing federal assistance appropriated by Congress;
· enforcing civil rights laws pertaining to education; and
· collecting and providing statistics on education (U.S. Department

   of Education, 2010).

                                                                     Image 9.4

State

At the state level, there are three major positions that make decisions related to education.
  · The governor acts as the chief officer and oversees policy. The governor also has the ability to veto
         and approve legislation.
  · The state board of education includes members that act as policy
      makers and liaisons for educators.
  · The chief state school officer, also called the state superintendent,
      is responsible for administrative oversight of state education
      agencies. The chief state school officer may be a member of the
      state board of education, but is directly responsible for making
      sure policies and state laws are followed.

At the state level, there are many central decisions made for all of the
local school districts. First, the state allocates funds to each school
district. Later in this chapter, school funding will be discussed, but the
state makes up a considerable portion of funds for students. The state
also sets standards for assessment and curriculum. It is then up to each Image 9.5
locality to decide how the curriculum is implemented. The state is also
responsible for licensing public and private schools, charter schools, and teachers and public-school staff (Chen,
2018). In addition, states establish compulsory education laws, which dictate between which ages students
must attend school, often from ages five or six through 17 or 18, reflecting the range of the K-12 spectrum.

                                             that may be drawn by county or centers of population.

                                             allocation of funding within the district, curriculum,
                                             school policies, and employment policies and decisions.

The most local governance structure occurs in individual schools. Each school has its own leadership structure,
usually headed by the principal (Chen, 2018). Other members of the school administration include assistant
principals, with the number of assistant principals corresponding to the size of the student body.
Administrators of individual schools are responsible for supporting their faculty and staff to fulfill district and
state educational policies. Administrators are also liaisons between schools, families, and local communities.

The Hierarchy of the System

You must be wondering now, who is the boss in the school systems? The public school governing system is
actually a hierarchy (March, 1978). There are several tiers to this hierarchy beginning with the federal level and
ending with the individual teachers. It is a pyramid of administrators doing everything they can to educate
today's students. While some may believe that administration of schools starts with the federal government,
the truth is that on the federal level there is very little involvement in education, even in funding (Federal Role,
n.d.).

172 | Governance and Finance
   The federal government: The federal government sets some guidelines for education, such as the
No Child Left Behind Act, but not specific ones such as curriculum taught. As we stated in our
previous chapter, the states have most of the power over their own schools and what they teach
(Education Commission of the States [ECS], 1999).

   State: The state has the largest financial role in the schools. Most of the federal funding is applied
for by the individual school in the form of a grant for a special purpose (Federal Role, n.d.). The states
provide teacher salaries and the money required to run each individual school. Each individual
school has a parent led group that can help the school gain funds for things like technology (ECS,
1999)

   District: Each state is broken up into districts (ECS, 1999). Most administration deals on a small
level, either within the district, or in the individual school (March, 1978). The districts each have their
own school board made of elected members (Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.). Those
boards decide how their schools will achieve the standards set by the state. They will also decide
anything else they believe the schools should be doing to service their district's children. Some of
these things include overseeing the curriculum and helping to promote better teaching techniques
(Education Administrators, n.d.). The board has to have all schools achieving at a level set by the
state, so they use their resources to push the schools to achieve the standards they have set (ECS,
1999).

   Superintendent: A superintendent is chosen to oversee the schools in the district (ECS, 1999).
Much like a politician, this office is often given to those who have worked their way up from the
bottom of the hierarchy (March, 1978). They are in charge of making sure the schools are doing what
is required by the school board. They make routine visits to schools to check on how they are doing.
They work with the principals and teachers to see that children are getting the most out of each
school day.

   Principal: The district hires principals to oversee each individual school. These principals are there
to see that the teachers are doing their job and the children are getting the education they deserve
(Office of the Education Ombudsman, n.d.). They are responsible for scheduling, planning the daily
activities, and managing the overall activities of the school (Office of the Education Ombudsman,
n.d.). Principals make routine visits to classrooms to make sure they are running smoothly and that
teachers are making the most of their instructional time. Another difficult duty of the principal is the
budget for the school. The principal must decide how to best spend the school's money (Education
Administrators, n.d.).

   Assistant Principals: these administrators help the principal in the daily activities of the school.
They also handle most of the discipline problems leaving the principal available to focus on other
duties (Education Administrators, n.d.).

   Teacher: Each school is responsible for the hire of their teachers. The principal can decide who to
hire as long as they are qualified by the state (ECS, 1999). Teachers apply for a job through the district
and might interview at several schools before being hired by one. Each school is different so
principals often look for a teacher who will fit into the school. The teacher has the most direct effect
on students. They ultimately decide what happens in the classrooms (ECS, 1999). When the door
closes every morning it is up to the teacher to make an effective use of time and get children to

                                                                                                                                     Governance and Finance | 173
       those standards set by the state. If children in their classrooms are not performing well, the teacher
       is held responsible.

9.2 Financing of Schools

As a future teacher you will need to be aware of how schools are organized, governed and financed. Where
you work will also determine the amount of money and resources available to you. The federal, state and local
government all play a role in the complex financial system of education. Keep in mind that how well a school
is funded is often a reflection of the community composition and wealth (number of businesses, homeowners,
taxpayers, population size). In this chapter we will learn how schools are governed and financed in public
education and begin to explore how these factors impact our ability to help students learn.

   School funding follows a similar pattern as school governance. The federal government distributes money to
State Education Agencies (SEAs), who then distribute monies to Local Education Agencies (LEAs). The following
section will discuss how these funds are distributed and equality issues that arise.

     Pause and Ponder - Spending Allocation

        How much does our government allocate for education? How does that compare with other
     spending, notably military spending?

174 | Governance and Finance
                 Image 9.7

Federal Funding

The Federal government plays an important role in both governance and finance. The President of the United
States appoints a Secretary of Education to administer the department and distribute funding to states for
educational purposes. In addition, each house of Congress has their own committee on education. Members
of these committees provide guidance and expertise as educational policies and budgets are developed.
States and local school districts, rather than the Federal Government, make most of the major decisions about
the content, assessment, teaching force, structure, and funding of elementary and secondary education. The
Federal Government influences educational policy by attaching educational policies to receipt of federal funds
(Kober & Usher, 2012).

   Now, let's take a look at how funding was distributed in FY 2022 for the Department of Education (ED)
knowing that President Biden proposed a historic $36.5 billion investment in grants for Title I schools to provide
support to students who were impacted by the pandemic. This was a $20 billion increase from the 2021 enacted
level. (ed.gov). The rationale behind this investment would be to "provide historically under-resourced schools
with the funding needed to deliver a high-quality education to all of their students, as well as meaningful
incentives for states to examine and address inequities in school funding systems. These additional funds
will advance the President's commitment to ensure teachers at Title I schools are paid competitively, provide
equitable access to rigorous coursework, and increase access to high-quality preschool."

   However, the federal government is responsible for providing around nine percent of a school's budget. The

                                                                                                                                              Governance and Finance | 175
amount of federal funding for schools depends on the annual budget proposed by the president and set by
Congress through a budget resolution. SEAs then submit plans to the federal government outlining how they
will assess student progress and what their learning outcomes are. The remaining 91% of budgets typically
comes from state and local sources, often derived from taxes.

Title I Funding

In 1965, Congress passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). In this act, Title I, Part A (Title
I) provides federal assistance to LEAs and schools with large percentages of students from low-income, under-
resourced families. The purpose is to ensure that all children have a fair, equal, and significant opportunity
to obtain a high-quality education and reach, at a minimum, proficiency in state academic achievement
standards and State academic assessments. The federal government provides funds to SEAs, who then allocate
the money to LEAs. The LEAs are then responsible for allocating the funds to each school based on a funding
formula. In general, these funds are used for targeted assistance programs, or if more than 40% of the students
are eligible for Title I funds, then the funds may be used for school-wide improvement (EdBuild, 2020). The goal
of distributing funds in this way is to make schools more equitable; however, these funds only account for nine
percent of a school's funding. The other 91 percent comes from state and local funding.

State and Local Funding

State and local school funding is based on complex funding formulas, with income often sourced from taxes on
income, property, or sales. In general, most states use one or a combination of three different types of funding
formulas: a student-based formula, a resource-based formula, or a hybrid formula. A student-based formula
assumes a set amount that estimates how much it costs to educate one student. Adjustments are then made
for students that are low income or receive special services for special education or emerging bilinguals. A
resource-based formula uses the cost of resources or programs to fund specific programs. A hybrid funding
formula will rely on multiple formulas. In 2020, 38 states used a student-based or hybrid funding formula. Across
the nation, each state sets its own education budget, thus creating variance in funding and equitable education
across states.

   In 2015-16, New York State had the largest per pupil average expenditure in the United States at $24,657
versus Idaho, the lowest state at $7,921 (Digest of Education Statistics, 2018). This demonstrates the variability in
funding and resources by state. However, within states variability also exists between communities, largely due
to revenues from property taxes. School districts that are wealthier tend to have more money and resources to
dedicate to education.

   During colonial times, farmers harvested crops on plots of
land. In order to educate the children of farmers, colonial
regions required farmers to pay a property tax. In this way, each
farming community was responsible for contributing to the
schooling of the children. Today, the property tax still exists out
of the belief that districts and communities must contribute to
educating their children. However, only a relatively small
percentage of the population farm the land. Citizens from
larger districts generally spend more money to educate larger
populations of students, and smaller communities contribute
less money. Rather than having the federal government Image 9.8
maintain control over funding, states control school
expenditures.

   Today, the property tax is tied to real estate value. Homes which are high in value contribute a higher property
tax. More money from wealthy communities are given to schools in these regions. Impoverished communities,
or communities with housing that does not have the same value do not have adequate resources and funding
to contribute to schools.

   On average, individual states spend between $7,000 and $22,000 per year per student. This is the total
amount that states spend on each student including the cost of hiring a teacher and running a school. Local
states and governments pay for the majority of the educational needs of the students in their state. Federal
Government spending accounts for less than 10% of the total cost of educating students. Schools are funded
primarily through the property tax system.

   The idea behind the property tax system is that families and communities pay for the children who attend
school in that region. Even if you do not have a school age child, the concept of providing an education for
students in the community involves an aspect of collectivism. Collectivism means that everyone contributes to
the needs of all. In the United States, working citizens pay state and federal taxes. One of the taxes is called a
property tax.

   It is no secret that teachers spend their own money on school supplies and items for the classroom. On

average, teachers spend $459 each year on these classroom items. Sites such as "teachers pay teachers," assist
teachers in creating a place where they can earn money for creating curriculum and materials for other teachers
to use. While they try to make up the difference in what they spend in their classrooms, overall, teachers who
have the most impact on the everyday lives of students in their classes, have little say in budgets and the
amount of money spent on students.

                                                                                                                                              Governance and Finance | 177
   When schools shut down due to mitigating Covid-19 concerns in March of 2020, legislators made decisions
which impacted students and teachers. Teachers quickly pivoted, and for the most part created significant
changes to their everyday lives with students in the classroom. Although the impact of quarantine reflects
an epic event, it reflects how teacher voices aren't always brought to the table when decisions are made
concerning funding in the school setting.

   This funding disparity is further widened at the local level. Local funding makes up around 45 percent of a
school's budget. Once a state distributes funds to LEAs, the LEAs are then in charge of distributing funds to
each school. In 47 states, funding for education is raised through property taxes (EdBuild, 2020). Thus, schools
within wealthy districts will raise more funds than schools in economically disadvantaged areas. The federal
funds distributed to low income areas through Title I do not make up for the inequities in funding.

Critical Lens: Inequitable Funding

Funding public schools based on local property taxes can perpetuate issues of inequity when it comes to
accessing resources needed for high-quality education. This NPR article (Lombardo, 2019) explains how
predominantly White school districts can receive up to $23 billion more than districts that serve predominantly
students of color. Watch this video to learn more about how systemic racism impacts school funding.

Local School Budget Development Process

                                       As stated above, one of the major roles of the

                                       members of the Board of Education (BOE) is to

                                       develop a budget in collaboration with

                                       administrators. A budget is a plan of financial

                                       operation expressing the estimates of proposed

                                       expenditures for a fiscal year and the proposed

                                       means of financing them. Multiple laws and

                                       procedures must be followed during budget

                                       development. Educational law emphasizes that the

                                       budget should be written in plain language in a

Image 9.9                              manner that taxpayers can understand (NYSED.gov,

                                       2019). When developing a budget, the BOE and

administration need to keep several factors in mind and have accurate information about educational

objectives, enrollment projection; the community's receptiveness to tax increases, capacity and limitations of

facilities

There are two important terms that BOE members, administrators, taxpayers and teachers alike need to

understand are the tax levy and bonds. The difference between levy and bonds is that bonds are for building, or

improving current facilities, and levies are for learning. Bonds and levies provide schools with funds that must

be used for specific purposes.

The tax levy is the term used for the sum of revenue in property taxes a district must collect, after removing

other sources of funding including state aid, to meet the proposed budget. The tax levy is significant because

this is the basis for determining the tax rate for each of the cities, towns or villages that make up a school district.

To determine the tax levy, school districts use a state formula that begins with an increase of 2 percent or the

level of inflation (whichever is less). The Tax levy limit is the amount a district's tax levy may increase without

requiring a supermajority to approve a proposed budget (60 percent of votes plus one). The result is often a

number higher than 2 percent. Under this law, the property taxes levied by affected local governments and

school districts generally cannot increase by more than 2 percent, or the rate of inflation, whichever is lower.

In the state of Oregon, the structure of the tax has changed overtime, so we are summarizing how the system

has evolved. We start with Measure 5, which introduced tax rate limits, was passed in 1990 and became effective

in the 1991-92 tax year. When fully implemented in 1995-96, Measure 5 cut tax rates an average of 51 percent

from their 1990-91 levels. Measure 50, passed in 1997, cut taxes, introduced assessed value growth limits, and

replaced most tax levies with permanent tax rates. It transformed the system from one primarily based on levies

to one primarily based on rates. When implemented in 1997-98, Measure 50 cut effective tax rates an average of

11 percent from their 1996-97 levels.

A school bond election is a bond issue used by a public school district, typically to finance a building project

or other capital project. These measures are placed on the ballot by district school boards to be approved or

defeated by the voting public. School bond issues on the ballot are different from other areas of the election

ballot as state laws require ballot measures to be worded as specific to the point. School bond measures

generally do not receive as much attention as candidate elections or state-wide ballot measures, but they are

an important way in which citizens can guide school policy. Forty states require voter approval of bond issues

as a matter of course, and in seven more, voters can petition to have bond issues placed on the ballot. Of the

remaining three states, one of them, Indiana, uses what is known as the remonstrance-petition process.

Education Funding in Oregon

   Money to support public education in grades K-12
comes from state income taxes, the lottery fund, local
revenues primarily consisting of property taxes, and
federal funds. Historically, the largest source of
funding had been local property taxes, but this
changed dramatically in 1990 when voters passed
Measure 5, which lowered the amount of property
taxes dedicated to schools. By the 1995-1996 school
year, local property taxes for education were limited
to $5 per every $1,000 of a property's assessed real
market value. In 1997, voters passed Measure 50,
which further limited local property taxes for schools
by placing restrictions on assessed valuation of Image 9.10
property and property tax rates. The effect of these
measures was to shift the bulk of public school funding from local property taxes to Oregon's General Fund,
which comes from state income taxes.

   Oregon uses a formula to provide financial equity among school districts. Each school district receives (in
combined state and local funds) an allocation per student, plus an additional amount for each student enrolled
in more costly programs such as Special Education or English Language Learners. The 2021-2023 legislatively
adopted General Fund and Lottery Funds budget for the Education program area is $12.624 billion. This was an
increase of $1.1 billion (or 9.9%) from the 2019-2021 legislatively approved budget.

Access and Equity in Education funding

As we think about funding for schools, we turn our thoughts to equity and equality in education. Included
below is a short video describing equity and equality in more general terms. As a teacher you will have to make
decisions on how best to meet the learning needs of your students.

   Local budgets will determine the types of materials and resources both teachers and students will have
access to. For example, access to technology, opportunities for professional development, updated textbooks
and materials, access to field trips, and availability of extracurricular opportunities are a few ways that budgets
impact schools and students. In a school with fewer resources how can you make your materials equitable (fair)
to the resources wealthier districts have? As a teacher the question of equity of resources is one you will need to
get involved in. Advocating for equitable curricular and program resources for your students is an appropriate
role for teachers.

   There are multiple ways in which the quality of education is challenged by issues pertaining to equity and

access. For example, since the property tax is where much of the school funding is received, the value of homes

180 | Governance and Finance
in a certain district affects the amount that is spent on each student. In the past, families have challenged
the allocation of funding per student. One of the landmark cases involves a man named Demetrio Rodriguez.
Rodriguez and his family lived in Edgewood, a neighborhood located in San Antonio in the 1960s. He sent his
children to a school where the top two floors were condemned. Less than half of the teachers in the school
were licensed. The textbooks were falling apart and the school lacked air conditioning. The majority of children
who attended this school were Mexican-American. The district allocated $37 per student. In close proximity,
Rodriguez noted Alamo Heights, a wealthier district which spent $413 on each student, and the students who
attended schools in Alamo Heights were predominantly White. Rodriguez and other families filed a class-
action suit and argued that unequal access was unconstitutional. The Supreme Court case, San Antonio ISD
v. Rodriguez (1973) was a landmark case because it was the first to challenge the equity of school funding.
The court did not rule in favor of Rodriguez; however, it triggered a series of ongoing struggles concerning the
quality of education for all students in the U.S.

   Following the Rodriguez v. San Antonio many cases involving school funding ensued. Currently, Teachers

College, Columbia University hosts a project entitled, SchoolFunding.info in order to seek equity in school
funding. This project provides a national lens and view of the nationwide effort to uncover inequities in
expenditures for students. It surveys the current area involving state spending and continues to show how
the court system continues to struggle to define an adequate education. While the definition of "Adequate,"
continues to change, it was determined by the Supreme Court that an adequate education is a set of minimum
state academic standards, or what students should be able to know and do at each grade level, and this
definition is still the subject of debate in many states. In fact, after the Rodriguez ruling, it was decided that
states, rather than the federal government, should design a plan to ensure equal access to schools that received
equal funding.

   The cases which followed Rodriguez v. San Antonio involved challenges to equity and access in schooling.
In Milliken v. Bradley (1974) in Detroit, Michigan, the Supreme Court ruled that the school systems were not
responsible for desegregation across district lines unless it could be shown that they had each deliberately
engaged in a policy of segregation.

Models of Schools

Although this chapter is primarily focused on the governance and finance of public schools, we will briefly
describe other options that may be available to students.

   As we have been learning, the majority of schools in the United States fall into one of two categories: public
or private. A public school is defined as any school that is maintained through public funds to educate children
living in that community or district for free. The structure and governance of a public school varies by model,
but shares the characteristics of being free and open to all applicants within a defined boundary. A private
school is defined as a school that is privately funded and maintained by a private group or organization, not the
government, usually by charging tuition. Private schools may follow a philosophy or viewpoint different from
public schools; for example, many private schools are governed by religious institutions.

                                                                                                                                              Governance and Finance | 181
   There are a variety of public school models, including traditional, charter, magnet, Montessori, virtual,
alternative, Community-based and language immersion schools. Private school models include traditional,
religious, parochial, Montessori, Waldorf, virtual, boarding, and international schools.

   One type of school not listed above is homeschool. Homeschooling is a type of schooling that would not
fall into either the public or private category. Homeschooling is defined as a child not enrolling in a public or
private school, but receiving an education at home. Each state has its own rules and regulations that families
must follow and report on if homeschooling. For example, the Oregon Department of Education requires that
families inform the school division of their decision to homeschool their child, update the school district with the
student's annual academic progress, and provide evidence that the homeschool instructor (such as a parent)
meets specific qualifications to fill the role.

Although the Supreme Court made segregated schools illegal in Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, you will
see many schools today that continue to have student populations that are separated by race or socioeconomic
status. Brown v. Board attempted to end what is known as de jure segregation, or segregation that is mandated
by the law. However, segregation continued to persist even though the law did not mandate it due to a
practice called redlining, in which housing was allowed or denied in certain areas based on people's race or
socioeconomic status. Redlining has resulted in ongoing de facto segregation, which means that while overt
segregation was outlawed, it still continues in other ways due to this history of redlining. In this map from
EdBuild[1], you can see the relationships between racial/socioeconomic segregation and access to educational
resources. In contrast, de facto segregation is the result of separation according to race even though the

182 | Governance and Finance
law does not require it. An example of de facto segregation can be seen in some schools where in fact,
African Americans and/or Latinx make up the majority of the population of the school. Redlining, or housing
discrimination leads to de facto school segregation.

School Choice

Some public school models, including charter, magnet, and language immersion, may have more students
desiring to apply than there is space. In these schools, applications or lotteries may be used. An application
system allows the schools to choose students based on characteristics, such as grades, demographic diversity,
or geographic area. Often these schools are looking for high-achieving students or have a mission of diversifying
the school. A lottery system gives each student that has applied an equal chance of attending and is decided
by randomly selecting names from the pool of students.

   With so many school models available in the U.S., how do families choose which type of school their child
should attend? School choice is a complex issue for families to navigate. What may be best for one student is
not always best for another. The choices for students also vary by geographic and socioeconomic boundaries.
Many families make school decisions based on the following factors:

  · transportation and distance to chosen school;
  · cost or tuition of school;
  · curriculum and programs available;
  · religious affiliation; and
  · fit for the individual student.

Families in some areas of the U.S. also have greater access to the different models of schools presented at the
beginning of this chapter than others. Small rural towns may only have one school within the immediate area.
However, federal reform policies, such as No Child Left Behind (NCLB), have increased the number of charter
schools and use of vouchers.

     Activity - Stop and Investigate

        Go to edchoice.org to explore what resources are available to support families with school choice
     options.

In 2001, when NCLB was signed into law, federal and state funds required schools to make an Annual Yearly
Progress (AYP) report, based on assessment data. Schools that did not meet AYP for two consecutive years were
often required to earmark money for student tutoring or allow students to transfer. When a student transfers,
the school's funding formula decreases by one student, resulting in a loss of funds for the school. If a school
continues to not meet AYP, then the school may be closed. When a school is closed, it often becomes a charter
school (Brookhart, 2013).

   As shown earlier in Table 4.1, charter schools are often publicly funded, but they do not have the same
requirements as a traditional public school. When a student transfers out of a traditional school to a charter
school, the funds follow the student. Charter schools are autonomous from public schools and to operate

                                                                                                                                              Governance and Finance | 183
must meet the educational goals set forth in their charter. Charter school admittance is also application based,
usually being first come, first served or by lottery. In 2010, charter schools comprised six percent of public school
students, but now the number is closer to 30 percent in some localities (Prothero, 2018).

   Why does it matter if public schools become charter schools? In many regions, like Minneapolis-St. Paul,
California, and Texas, charter schools are more segregated than the public schools within those same
boundaries, which were already highly segregated (Institute on Race and Poverty, 2008). Because charter
schools rely on applications for admission, parent participation in the admission process also separates students
by socioeconomics (Frankenberg et al., 2011).

Online Learning

   When online learning began for K-12 students,
there were just 50,000 students who enrolled in this
alternative setting. (Patrick, 2011). Online learning has
been studied extensively due to the rise in digital
learning platforms in 2020 when the Covid era served
as a catalyst for school closings.

   Online learning began from earlier models called
distance learning or correspondence courses.
Students would receive instruction through the mail
as far back as the 1920s. Later in the mid 1980s these
remote schools began to allow students to submit
assignments through electronic mail. Evidence
indicates that by the mid 1990s, several states were Image 9.11
engaged in some type of virtual instruction.

   To define these involving models of instruction, several terms must be addressed. Researchers Watson and
Murin (2012, p. 4) note that blended learning involves somewhat of a hybrid learning experience. Individuals
participate in a formal course which integrates a classroom environment with an online course where they
exercise some control over "time, place, path and/or pace," within the class. In contrast, online learning does not
provide a hybrid experience and all teaching learning takes place over the internet and can involve a singular
course or an entire school. A term that includes all of these models is referred to as digital learning (Watson &
Murin, 2012, p. 4).

   Before the 2020 pandemic, students who opted to learn in this way needed access to the internet. A study
conducted by Tamara Tate and Mark Warschauer (2022) found that "Underrepresented and low-income high
school students have been most likely to use online courses for credit recovery, remediating failing grades"
(Tate & Warschauer, 2022). It is difficult to research the impact of the pandemic since districts often blended
learning and some students were able to return to school for part of the time earlier than others. However,
another study indicated that students who moved to online learning between March 2020 and April 2021
lost ½ to 1 year's worth of learning in language arts. Vulnerable populations including students who come
from low-income homes or ethnic minorities were at an increased disadvantage. When looking specifically at
measures which include "race, income, homelessness, disability, and English learner status, [these individuals]
experienced declines that were one and one-half to two times higher than their peers" (Tate & Warschauer,
2022).

Vouchers

                                                One reason that school choice has become so

                                                politicized is the use of school vouchers. School

                                                vouchers are defined as "a government-supplied

                                                coupon that is used to offset tuition at an eligible

                                                private school" (Epple et al., 2017, p. 441). In the 1960s,

                                                some of the first school vouchers were awarded to

                                                promote desegregation. School voucher policies and

                                                programs today vary across localities and are present

                                                in over thirty states. Students who receive vouchers

                                                enroll in a private school, which receives those funds.

                                                The voucher may cover tuition in full, or offset it

                                                significantly. This video explains some of the pros and

Image 9.12                                      cons of vouchers.
                                                   Vouchers are funded by one of the following: tax

revenues, tax credits, or by private organizations (Epple et al., 2017). The majority of states that use tax revenues

to fund their vouchers provide vouchers to under-resourced students. For example, Milwaukee, Cleveland, New

Orleans, and Washington, DC provide vouchers to students whose family income is just above the poverty line.

Some areas, such as in Ohio and Indiana, provide vouchers using tax revenues to all students in failing school

districts.

Some states (including Florida, Iowa, Georgia, Indiana, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island) utilize tax

credits to fund vouchers. Businesses in these states that fund vouchers are provided a tax credit. For example,

Florida businesses can receive 100 percent corporate tax income credit up to $559.1 million dollars (EdChoice,

2019). In addition to tax revenues and tax credits, many states also have privately funded voucher programs. One

notable voucher program is the Children's Scholarship Fund, which was founded with contributions from the

Walton Family Foundation (Epple et al., 2017).

Consequences of Vouchers

   When a student uses a voucher to attend a private
school, this changes the funding formulas for a local
school. This student is no longer included in the
funding formula for the LEA or SEA. This means that
the local and state budget is lowered because one
less student is being counted in that funding formula.
School vouchers are provided and promoted to give
under-resourced students school choice, but not all
students have equal opportunities.

   Public schools allow and are required by law to
provide services for all students. While policies
prohibit private schools from discriminating against
students based on race, many religious private Image 9.13
schools may consider religious affiliation, sexual
orientation and disability in their admission decisions. Certain states want to create laws which limit what is
taught in public schools, whereas other states let districts have autonomy in the decision-making process
within classrooms and schools. For example, there are currently 9 states who banned Critical Race Theory (CRT)

                                                                                                                                              Governance and Finance | 185
in their schools. The issue is that some legislators do not take the time to understand the concept and the
impact that banning CRT has in our communities of color. CRT actually celebrates and uplifts the strength of
communities of color while standing up for racial justice.

   On the other hand, private schools are not exempt from discrimination laws, but the application process
allows them to choose which students to admit. For example, a private school receiving government funds
must provide students with disabilities with accommodations, unless these accommodations change the
philosophy of the academic program, or create "significant difficulty or expense." A large portion of private
schools do not hire teachers trained to provide accommodations; thus, many claim they do not have the
resources to serve students with disabilities. Vouchers are not beneficial for students with disabilities that
cannot attend private schools, but vouchers also hinder these students further by diverting funds from the
public schools, who do provide these services, when other students use vouchers.

Conclusion

While many individuals and groups call for school reform in order to provide equity to all students, the process
is complex. As you have seen in this chapter, federal oversight of schools is somewhat limited, allowing school
governance to be different within each district and state. What may seem beneficial for students in one school
or community may not be beneficial for students in another school or community; therefore, the federal
government leaves many decisions about education to the discretion of state and local agencies. Many school,
district, and state policies are also tied to federal, state, and local funding, which all use a variety of funding
formulas. In order to create change, it is important that an individual understands how policy and funding
decisions are developed and implemented.

   School choice and the varied school models within the U.S. also makes school reform highly political. While
families are given the right to choose their own child's education, many families' choices are constrained
by geographic and economic resources. Educational professionals, policymakers and stakeholders have a
responsibility to serve all students, and that means practicing equity in decision-making and teaching, ranging
from curriculum construction, instructional practice, and policy advocacy that provides each student with what
they need to succeed and thrive. The landscape of schools in the U.S. is constantly changing, but one principle
will remain as the foundation of schools in this country: everyone deserves access to education.

        A high school English teacher is planning to have his students read The Bluest Eye by Toni Morrison.
     Set during the Great Depression, the main character searches for her identity and sense of self. In
     addition, there are themes of race, class, exploitation, and sex in the novel. Can the teacher include this
     book in his reading list for the year even though it was banned by the Parent Teacher Association
     (PTA)?

        Actually, there is no clear answer for this teacher. The National Education Association (NEA) Code of
     Ethics suggests a standard of reasonableness. When making decisions as a teacher, ethics oftentimes
     presents a `gray area' and does not always provide a definitive resolution.

In this chapter, we review the roles and responsibilities of teachers in today's public schools as they relate to
ethical and legal issues in education. We explore ethical teaching, along with legal parameters, established
through case law and set up in the U.S. Constitution and its amendments. Rights for both teachers and students
are examined, and current implications are discussed.

Ethics in Education

When you think of your favorite teacher, it is not often that you consider whether he or she was ethical. Yet
professional ethics and dispositions, as well as the legal responsibilities of teachers, are central in defining how
students view their favorite teacher. Ethics provides a foundation for what teachers should do in their roles and
responsibilities as an educator. It is a framework that a teacher can use to help make decisions about what is
right or wrong in a given situation.

   Teachers are not only responsible for their students but also in the long term, for the growth and development
of their community. Today's students are tomorrow's leaders, workers, policy makers, thinkers, dreamers, and
voters. It is not a stretch to say that teachers really do hold the future in their hands. To that end, developing an
ethical and liberatory approach to teaching is crucially important.

     Deeper Dive: Liberatory Education

        Liberatory education has been discussed in a prior chapter. Here is a reminder - Liberatory Education

10.1 What is a Code of Ethics?

Most professions have a Code of Ethics that binds its members together through shared values and purpose.
This professional Code of Ethics is a widely accepted standard of practice that outlines the accountability of its
members to those they serve as well as to the profession itself (Benninga, 2013). Here are some examples of
Ethics Codes:

Varying Codes of Ethics in Educational Organizations

Educational Organization           Code of Ethics

National Educational Association   The educator recognizes the magnitude of the responsibility inherent in the
(NEA)                              teaching process. The desire for the respect and confidence of one's colleagues,
                                   of students, of parents, and of the members of the community provides the
Association of American Educators  incentive to attain and maintain the highest possible degree of ethical conduct
(AAE)                              (NEA, Code of Ethics, 2019).

                                   The professional educator endeavors to maintain the dignity of the profession by
                                   respecting and obeying the law, and by demonstrating personal integrity (AAE,
                                   Code of Ethics, Principle II, 2019).

Each of the statements on ethics from these teacher professional organizations complements the others,
outlining expected behaviors and dispositions, identifying professional intent, and solidifying commitments
that are expected from educators in their roles representing public schools throughout the state and nation.

Let's see how a Code of Ethics could impact the scenario that opened this chapter. Recall that the high school
English teacher wanted to include a controversial book on his reading list for the school year that has been
banned from use. He believes this book will provide a rich experience for his students and provide stimulating
class discussion and debate around identity and race. In determining whether or not to incorporate the text, the
teacher must ask himself if he is truly presenting different points of view. In so doing, the teacher is adhering to
the National Education Association (NEA) Code of Ethics, specifically Principle I, Item 2:

       Principle I: Commitment to the Student:

                    The educator strives to help each student realize his or her potential as a worthy and effective
                    member of society. The educator therefore works to stimulate the spirit of inquiry, the acquisition
                    of knowledge and understanding, and the thoughtful formulation of worthy goals.

       Item 2:

                    In fulfillment of the obligation to the student, the educator shall not unreasonably deny the
                    student access to varying points of view (National Education Association, 2019, para. 8).

                                                                                                                            Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 191
             With this Code of Ethics in mind, this teacher could argue that reading this book stimulates the spirit
          of inquiry and knowledge acquisition, and not reading the book would unreasonably deny the students
          access to varying points of view.

       Code of Ethics in Action

          Consider the ethical dilemmas that are present every day in the classroom and the ethical decisions that
          a teacher must make. Consider how each decision that a teacher makes impacts the functioning of the
          school, the well-being of the students, and the personal goals of the teacher in pursuit of the profession
          of teaching and supporting student learning.

             There is not always one right "answer" in any given situation. A Code of Ethics provides guidelines to
          help guide your decision making and teaching practice. It helps with what you should do. It does not
          provide specific directions on what to do or even how to do it.

             Ethical decisions take place every day in our classrooms. Oftentimes, you may believe that treating
          students equally is an ethical approach. But if you go into a classroom, you may notice a teacher calling
          on a shy student and not calling on another student who usually dominates the discussion. Is this equal?
          Is this fair? These are two different things. The teacher is clearly treating the two students differently.
          The NEA Code of Ethics guides your teaching behaviors by placing your students at the center of your
          practice. Always consider that you must treat all students equitably, not necessarily the same or equally.

     Critical Lens - What is Equity and what is the difference with Equality?

        What is equity? - It is the continual process of looking for and removing things that create disparity.
     Equity requires providing people what they need to succeed in the proportion to which they need it.
     Equity can not be achieved with a neutral approach. Meeting students where they are at is an equitable
     approach.

A professional Code of Ethics governs a teacher's relationships, roles, conduct, interactions, and communication
with students, as well as families, administrators and the larger community. It provides educators with a way
to regulate personal conduct and ethical decision making. It does not tell a teacher why they should do
something. Having an informed awareness of statutes, laws, and other legal influences will assist you in defining

192 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
your role as an ethical teacher who is also fair and responsible. It is essential for an effective educator working
under any code of ethics to understand diverse student needs and deliver equity in practice.

     Pause and Ponder

        What are your own personal ethical beliefs having to do with education? What might be some ways
     to practice no harm? What situations could you envision in teaching that would require ethical
     decision-making?

One topic that's not commonly covered in codes of ethics for teachers is a continuous commitment to
examining and addressing one's own biases. As mentioned elsewhere in this text, as humans, our bias reflects
the implicit values and beliefs of the community and society. Our biases influence how we interact with
students, their experiences in school, and even their outcomes and opportunities. Here's an example of how
this works. Recently, researchers found that even in online classrooms, teachers' racial and gender bias can
influence whether students get referred to gifted programs or special education programs.

10.2 Education and the Law

What does discrimination look like in the classroom?

Discrimination in the classroom can be overt or covert and can take many forms. The following list provides
broad ways that discrimination could be identified in the classroom.

  · Treating people inequitably based on social categories, e.g., race, nationality, language (see more below
      about Protected Classes)

  · Treating people unequally and/or oppressively because they belong to a marginalized group
  · Behavior that results in subordinating or continuing to subordinate a marginalized group

Protected Classes and Federal Laws Protecting Individuals' Civil Liberties

Federal laws explicitly protect certain classes of people, called protected classes, from discrimination. This
means that it is illegal for any federal or state organization or public entity to discriminate against someone
based on their protected class(es) status.

     Critical Lens - Protected Classes

          · Race - The socially constructed categorization of people based on racialized characteristics
          · Color - The amount of melanin in a person's skin determining their coloring
          · National Origin - The nation where a person was born or where their ancestors come from
          · Religion - The US Constitution gives people the right to freedom of religion and schools must

             accommodate the religious needs of students
          · Sex - Gender-based policies that favor a specific gender are prohibited in schools. It is important

             to note that the state of Oregon has further laws that extend the protected class status to
             individuals based on sexuality and gender identity
          · Marital Status - A school cannot discriminate against an individual based on their marital status
          · Disability - The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines disability as any mental or physical
             impairment that limits major life activity
          · Age - Age discrimination particularly relates to personnel in schools in that age cannot be a
             discriminatory factor in hiring, retaining or compensating employees

10.3 The U.S. Constitution and the 1st and 14th Amendments

Significant, ground-breaking court cases have influenced the practice of public schools throughout history and
many verdicts have come from the U.S. Supreme Court. The majority of these cases focus on the First and
Fourteenth Amendments.

194 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
The First Amendment of the U.S Constitution

It addresses the freedom of speech, religion, press, and the right to petition the government, and assemble
peaceably (U.S. Constitution, First Amendment).

   It states:
             Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise

          thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to
          assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.

First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1791

          Courts have been called to answer questions about the freedoms outlined in the First Amendment as
          they relate to teachers and students (American Library Association, 2006). Cases include the dismissal
          or suspension of personnel due to issues such as religious clothing, political symbols and speaking
          profanity at a school assembly .

     Critical Lens - Tinker v. Des Moines

        Tinker v. Des Moines
        A school district in Des Moines passed a rule that students could not wear armbands to protest the
     Vietnam War. In Tinker v. Des Moines, the students argued that the district was violating their right to
     freedom of speech and the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the students. The Court also ruled that the
     only time school or school personnel could impinge on a student's right to freedom of speech was if
     they could show that the behavior significantly interfered with "the requirements of appropriate
     discipline in the operation of the school."

               The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., has settled

               many cases in our country's history about how the

               U.S. Constitution, especially the First and Fourteenth

               Amendments, relates to public schools.

               In Bartels v. Iowa (1923), the Supreme Court upheld

               a conviction of a teacher for teaching German to

               students. The English-only movement in schools that

               many attribute to contemporary times has its roots in

Image 10.2     some of the xenophobia that was used to justify

               World War 1. Later, In Griswold v Connecticut (1965)

the court ruled that the right to teach foreign languages is protected by the First Amendment of the

constitution.

The First Amendment rights provides teachers a degree of protection for in-class curricular speech. In Board

of Education, Island Trees Union Free School District No. 26 v. Pico by Pico (1982), the Supreme Court found that

the school board could not restrict certain books in the school system's libraries because school board members

               Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 195
disagreed with the content. Doing so was found to be a violation of the First Amendment and our protection
with regards to freedom of speech.

     Critical Lens - First Amendment Protections

          · Freedom of speech is the right for individuals to speak freely without fear of censorship or
             reprisal from the government. The right to freedom of speech applies to both school personnel
             and students. For example, a teacher might bring legal action against a school if they are fired for
             talking about issues of public interest like a school board election. Another example is that
             students have the right to exercise their freedom of speech through protests or messages on
             their clothing.

          · Freedom of exercise limits government interference and actions on individuals' religious beliefs
             and individuals' practices in relation to their religious beliefs

          · Freedom of press protects print and electronic media from censorship. This may apply in
             certain cases to school newspapers and media releases.

          · Freedom of assembly ensures the right that people can gather together peacefully as long as
             they are not engaging in illegal or criminal activities. This may apply in certain cases to students'
             right to form and participate in group protests in schools.

These rulings have come into conflict over the years due to school systems also having the right to set the
curriculum. This school system precedent was upheld in Krizek v. Board of Education (1989) when a non-tenured
English teacher showed an "R"-rated film to high school students and her contract was not renewed. The
district court found that the teacher's First Amendment rights were not violated, rather the school board acted
reasonably in determining that the film was inappropriate. (We'll discuss tenure in more depth later in this
chapter.)

The Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution

It guarantees equal opportunity for due process and equal protection to all who live within the jurisdiction of
the United States. This amendment was ratified in 1868 and written specifically to protect the rights of recently
freed enslaved people.

   Ensuring that this opportunity applies to all persons, it reads:
             All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens

          of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which
          shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive
          any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its
          jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

196 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution ratified in 1868, Section 1

The Fourteenth Amendment provides a guarantee that a state cannot take away constitutional rights or
privileges as identified in the U.S. Constitution (National Constitution Center, 2020). It has three primary clauses:

  · The Incorporation Doctrine extended the rights guaranteed in the Bill of Rights to state governments.
      This means that any state laws that violate the rights granted by the Constitution at the federal level would
      be overturned.

  · The Due Process Clause affirms that states may not deny any person "life liberty, or property, without due
      process of law."

  · The Equal Protection Clause establishes that states may not "deny to any person (citizen or non-citizen)
      within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."

Both the Due Process and the Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment significantly impact
education. The Equal Protection Clause is examined throughout this chapter as it relates to foundational legal
cases, racial issues, and LGBTQ+ rights and discrimination. Next, we will consider how the Due Process Clause
affects educators and students.

     Activity - Scenario

        Which legal protections might apply to this case?
        Soledad Garcia was born with Cerebral Palsy in Texas in 1955. She had no access to schooling and her
     Mexican-American parents could not afford to send her to a specialized facility and so she stayed at
     home. Which of the following protections might have helped Soledad's family as they advocated for
     her education?

10.4 What Federal Laws Protect Students and/or Educational Personnel's'
Civil Rights?

The Civil Rights Act of 1964

Title VI of the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin by
constraining private, non-government parties from discriminatory behavior in any program or activity that
receives federal funds, e.g., schools and school related programs. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act mandates that it
is unlawful for employers to discriminate against an individual in hiring, retention, and compensation because
of the individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.

                                                                                                                           Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 197
The Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA)

IDEA was enacted in 1975 to ensure that children with disabilities had access to a free appropriate public
education beginning at age 3 through age 21. The law provides guidance to states and school districts about
special education services. One important mandate from the 2004 reauthorization of IDEA provides guidance
to states and school districts to analyze and remediate the overrepresentation of racially, ethnically, culturally,
and/or linguistically marginalized students in special education services.

The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)

FERPA was written to ensure the privacy of students' educational records. It applies to any school or district that
is receiving federal funds. FERPA is covered in more detail later in this chapter.

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972

Title IX prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in programs and activities that receive federal funds,
including schools. Some example provisions relate to discrimination on the basis of pregnancy, participation in
athletic and/or STEM activities, hiring based on gender, and/or sexual harassment.

Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973

Section 504 prohibits employment discrimination against an individual with a disability when they can perform
the essential job functions with reasonable accommodations. This act focuses on employers in organizations
receiving federal funding, including schools.

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)

ADA prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, schools, transportation, public
and private services, and accommodations. This law applies to all public entities whether or not they receive
federal funding.

198 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Title III - Every Student Succeeds Act

NCLB's Title III mandated the creation of funding and support for school districts so that they could better serve
students learning English as an additional language, often called English Language Learners (ELLs). The act
created the Office of English Language Acquisition with a mission and budget to "close the achievement gap"
between students learning English as an additional language and native-English speaking students.

Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA)

The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was signed into law in 2015 (Every Student Succeeds Act, 2015). It
replaces the No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act that was enacted in 2002. ESSA requires states to be more
accountable for the achievement of students within their public schools. Its purpose is to provide equitable
opportunity for students with diverse backgrounds to include those living in poverty, minorities, special needs,
and English language learners.

   ESSA provides school districts more control in how they set education standards and determine
consequences for low-achieving schools in their districts. States provide an accountability framework to the
federal government that assures that all students receive a high-quality education. States are responsible for
having an accountability plan and specifying the accountability measures that they and their school districts
will follow (Lee, n.d.).

   The state educational plan must include how each school within the state will:

  · maintain academic standards;
  · provide annual testing in grades 3-8 in reading and math;
  · identify accountability measures that look at academic achievement, progress, English language

      proficiency, and high school graduation rates; and
  · measure school success by kindergarten readiness, advanced placement coursework, college readiness,

      and chronic absenteeism or discipline rates (Every Student Succeeds Act, 2015).

Schools must provide to the federal government a plan that outlines how they will ensure that students learn
and achieve in their schools. If underperforming in any of the above areas, schools must additionally present a
plan for improvement.

against individuals based on their protected class status.

     Activity - Reflection

        In terms of Soledad, the student mentioned above, almost all of the legal protections mentioned here
     could have applied to her case but most notably IDEIA which provided significant access to students
     living with disabilities. Before 1975, if a student had a disability, they were excluded from the US
     educational system. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 advocated for racial justice and laid the foundation for
     other marginalized groups, including those who live with disabilities, to access education? Because of
     Soledad's various marginalized identities, multiple laws bear on her situation.

Due Process

For educators and students, due process requires considering whether a constitutional right has been infringed
upon by the state, and then affords the accused student, teacher, school district or state the right to a fair
and impartial trial. Generally speaking, the due process clause of the 14th amendment entitles students and
educators to an impartial trial or hearing when certain constitutional rights are infringed by the state.

   All members of the school community have the right to due process with the purpose of providing a fair trial.
The central premise of due process is fairness. A school district can be sued if others believe the district acted
in an unfair or unreasonable way. This legal argument can be made on behalf of a teacher, student, parent,
or community member. Anyone who believes that they were unfairly or unreasonably impacted by a policy or
procedure of the school can institute a legal case against the school.

   In the Supreme Court case Hortonville Independent School District No. 1 v. Hortonville Education Association
(1976), the Justices ruled that the school board was able to deliver due process in a reasonable manner when it
fired teachers who went on strike after contract negotiations failed. The teachers were asked to return to work
but refused. They were then terminated. The teachers argued that their dismissal violated their due process
and should be reviewed by an impartial decision maker. The court did not agree, citing instead that the school
board was viewed as the impartial decision maker, and they did not need to be independent from the issue.

   Schools in the United States accept responsibility for children as they enter through their doors, and teachers
have responsibilities that relate to educating students as well as providing physical, social, and emotional safety
to all children, beyond teaching the required curriculum. Because of the diverse nature of schools, the U.S. court
system helps to balance teachers' and students' responsibilities and rights.10.5 Foundational Legal Cases

   Throughout U.S. history, there have been many notable court cases heard by the Supreme Court related to
public education in the United States (National Constitution Center, 2015). Select foundational legal cases are
highlighted below:

Examples of Foundational Legal Cases in Education

Case           Decision

Plessy v.      Racial segregation was upheld, allowing states to segregate schools under the "separate but equal"
Ferguson       doctrine. The Supreme Court upheld the segregationist doctrine of "separate but equal." This
(1896)         discriminatory doctrine was applied in many aspects of public life, including schooling, for decades, as a
               result.

Brown v.       This landmark Supreme Court case (Brown v Board)) overturned Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) and addressed
Board of       segregation of public schools on the basis of race. African American students who had been denied
Education      admittance to public schools argued that the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was
(1954)         violated. The justices agreed stating that "separate but equal educational facilities for racial minorities is
               inherently unequal".

San Antonio    The justices ruled that education is not afforded protection under the Constitution. The Supreme Court
Independent    also held that a school district is responsible for providing only a "minimum educational threshold" for
School         students within their jurisdiction, as defined by the state, and which adheres to federal law.
District v.
Rodriguez
(1973)

Plyler v. Doe  The Supreme Court previously held that education is not a "fundamental right" because it is not
(1982)         mentioned in the U.S. Constitution nor the Bill of Rights, but reinforced that public education does have "a
               pivotal role in maintaining the fabric of... society and in sustaining ... political and cultural heritage" of
               society. This ruling underscored the importance of public schools throughout the United States and held
               that all children within a state's jurisdiction, whether legal or illegal, have the right to a public education, if
               a public education is provided by the state.

Activity - Scenario Legal Case

   Which Legal cases might apply to this situation?

   Rebecca welcomed Moise Francois to Beavercreek Elementary. His mother had none of the usual
documentation but she did have an ID card and a local address on a utilities bill which helped to
establish that this was their elementary school. Rebecca knew that legally the schools never asked for
social security cards or any other kind of immigration or naturalization paperwork due to the landmark
Plyer vs Doe case. She also knew that she could place Moise in an ESL classroom for his first day which
would help to ease him into the US school system. The school had a plan for its English Language
Learners, as required by law per the landmark Lau vs Nichols case (both cases explained below).

Lau v. Nichols (1974)

A group of Chinese American students who were learning English as an additional language sued their school
system for violating their 14th Amendment rights by not providing them enough language support to be
successful in school. The Lau v. Nichols case was grounded in the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as it discriminated
against the students based on their national origin. The Court ruled in favor of the students and codified the
civil right to be instructed in a language or through a method (such as ESL) that is understandable. The Court
ruling laid the needed groundwork for the argument that national origin discrimination extends to language-

Throughout U.S. history, courts have become more involved in helping school districts make decisions that
affect how localities and states conduct schooling (Thomas, 2019). As diversity increases throughout the United
States, school policies and procedures continue to be challenged in our court systems. When pursuing legal
action, the goal is to ensure that schools provide a fair and reasonable system of education for all students.

10.6 State Oversight

Each state must follow its respective State Constitution as well as the U.S. Constitution when defining the
role and responsibilities of public schools within their state. Although education is a responsibility of the state,
school districts have authority over their individual schools as it relates to curriculum and discipline. Rights
are afforded to teachers in normal day-to-day functioning and when appealing grievances as it relates to such
things as contracts, policies, denial of tenure, or suspension. Students must also adhere to this authority, unless
it overrides a student's constitutional rights.

   States provide a wide range of oversight. They identify the minimum licensure requirements for educators.
States also dictate what educators must do within that state to maintain their teaching licenses. State laws
provide guidelines regarding how schools are organized based on funding. The legislature and Governor of each
state allocate a certain amount of funding to school districts throughout their state. School districts then decide
how those funds are spent. State legislatures and courts have intervened to help reduce funding disparities
among poorer and wealthier school districts to better ensure that all students have equal access to education.
States also create a state board of education, set-up school districts throughout the state, and establish school
boards for each district. State laws also help to define student discipline and due process policies.

   Examples of state involvement within public schools include:

  · Creating school districts
  · Allocating a budget to school districts
  · Regulating schools throughout those districts
  · Establishing the organizational structure for schools
  · Defining policies and functions of the school
  · Setting minimum curriculum requirements for schools
  · Defining licensure requirements for educators, and
  · Determining working conditions (National Conference of State Legislatures, 2020).

10.7 State of Oregon

If you are planning to get licensed in the state of Oregon, be sure to review the appendix on Civil Rights in
Oregon.

   In this section, you will learn about state laws that protect individual civil liberties and prohibit discrimination
in educational settings. It is important that you are familiar with these laws and how they are applied in schools
because teachers are considered "state actors" who act on behalf of the state.

Oregon Revised Statutes Relevant to Educational Settings

Oregon Revised Statutes (ORS) are codified laws of the State of Oregon. These are released every two years so it
is important to know current laws related to discrimination in educational settings, and also that you can access
the ORSs in future through this website

Protected Classes and State Laws Protecting Individuals' Civil Liberties

In the State of Oregon, sexual orientation is a protected class. This extends the federally recognized protected
classes to include sexual orientation. Sexual orientation is an individual's physical and/or emotional attraction
to other individual(s) or not. Some terms used to describe a person's sexual orientation may be heterosexual
(straight), gay, lesbian, bisexual, pansexual, or asexual.

What Protections are Individuals Afforded Under The Oregon Constitution?

Article I of the Oregon Constitution is a bill of rights of the privileges, immunities, and authorities that may be
legally and morally claimed by the citizens of the state within the bounds of reason, truth, and the accepted
standards of behaviors. These rights include:

  · Natural rights inherent in people
  · Freedom of worship
  · Freedom of religion
  · No religious qualification for office
  · No money to be appropriated for religion
  · No religious test for witnesses or jurors
  · Freedom of speech and freedom of the press
  · Equality of privileges and immunities of citizens
  · Assemblages of people; instruction of representatives; application to legislature
  · Emigration
  · Taxes and duties; uniformity of taxation

10.8 Rights of Teachers

Teaching License

As discussed previously, the first step in becoming a
legally-recognized teacher is to earn a teaching license.
Each state has different requirements for earning a
teaching license, as they define the specific dispositions,
knowledge, and skills needed to obtain and maintain
employment within a school in that state. In Oregon, the
process is overseen by The Teacher Standards and
Practices Commission. If you choose to complete an
undergraduate or graduate degree program in order to
teach, you will be working toward fulfilling the
requirements of a teaching license in the state where your
institution is located. Many states have reciprocity with
other states' teaching licenses, meaning that you can earn
a teaching license in one state and still go teach in
another one, as long as you also complete the
requirements for earning a teaching license in that new
state.

Once a teacher applies for and receives a job at a school,   unions and other professional organizations, academic
they receive a teaching contract. A teaching contract is a   freedom, freedom of speech and expression, liability,
written agreement between the school system and the          privacy, and religion. It is important to be aware of the
                                                             rights you do have, as well as the limits of your legal

teacher and serves as a legal document identifying the roles and responsibilities for the teaching position. If the

school board negotiated with a teacher's union, then the policies and regulations of the union will also be

identified in the contract. The teaching contract must be signed by the teacher, school, and ratified by the

school board to be binding. The teaching contract is binding unless it is breached, should either party fail to

perform as agreed during the time frame specified in the teaching contract. Be aware that each state has a

different definition of the types of teaching contracts that are presented to teachers within the state.

Tenure

You may have heard of the word "tenure" in discussions about teaching contracts. Tenure protects teachers
from arbitrary dismissal by school officials. Tenure derived from the Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883, which
was originally established as a merit system for government workers. Tenure rights for teachers in the United
States date back to 1909, when the NEA lobbied for these rights. States define tenure laws for teachers in public
schools, including elements like probationary periods and termination procedures. A school district can dismiss
a tenured teacher for justifiable reasons such as noncompliance, immoral conduct, committing a crime, and
insubordination. A teacher can also be dismissed for financial reasons, such as when a school district has a
deficiency of funds.

   Tenure does not guarantee a teacher a job for life, nor does it offer lifetime employment security (Hart, 2010).
The focus of tenure is on supporting and protecting good teachers. It is an earned process that mandates
due process. The benefits of a continuing contract or tenure are that a school must show cause in order to
dismiss you because you, as the teacher, have due process rights. Advocates for tenure see its benefits for
teachers in that it "significantly strengthens legal protections embodied in civil service, civil rights, and labor
laws" and "protects a range of discriminatory firings not covered under race and gender anti- discrimination
laws" (Kahlenberg, 2015, p. 7). In addition, teacher tenure has been shown to increase morale and overall teacher
involvement within a school and collaboration among colleagues. Tenure affords teachers the ability to question
and engage with school leadership as it relates to the functioning of a school and in building a strong school
culture, which has been linked to increased academic achievement for students (Lee & Smith, 1996).

   Presently, some states are changing their legislation as it relates to teacher tenure. The Every Student
Succeeds Act (ESSA) and Race to the Top grants through the U.S. Department of Education both require states
to evaluate student achievement and teacher effectiveness. Certain state legislatures view teacher tenure as a
barrier to these initiatives because it is more difficult for school districts to dismiss tenured teachers for poor
performance, and as a result, relatively few tenured teachers are fired (Goldhaber & Hansen, 2010). Therefore,
some states have begun to change tenure laws to adhere to the accountability requirements stipulated by the
U.S. Department of Education as it relates to teacher evaluation and student achievement. As a result, some
tenure systems have been removed or revamped with annual contracts requiring satisfactory performance.
Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, and Kansas have eliminated tenure completely (Underwood, 2018). Additional
states are also currently contemplating limiting or removing tenure for teachers.

     Activity - Licensure Requirements

        Look up licensure requirements for the state where you want to teach. What do you notice? What
     kinds of knowledge, training, and experience are you required to have? How is your understanding
     assessed before you are granted a license?

206 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
Unions and Participation in Professional Organizations

                        The National Education Association (NEA) and American

                        Federation of Teachers (AFT) are two of the largest teacher labor

                        unions and professional organizations in the United States at

                        present. Both have been in existence for more than 100 years

                        and support teachers, along with other school personnel. As

                        unions, both organizations support their members with

                        collective bargaining, whereby they work alongside teachers as

                        they negotiate with their respective school districts to resolve

                        disputes, as well as to lobby Congress for state and federal

                        legislation that would impact educational related issues,

Image 10.4              including teacher rights and responsibilities. In some states,
                        teacher unions will support your right to strike as a means of

collective bargaining.

You can join the union that is present in your school or even start one, but since not all states recognize

unions, the NEA or AFT may not be able to assist you with collective bargaining or school board negotiations,

depending on your state of employment. Collective bargaining is legal in Oregon and Washington. Collective

bargaining is illegal in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Texas, and Arizona. You may

hear these referenced as "right to work states," which means that employees have a right to work without being

forced to join a union. Even so, each professional organization provides support, a rich network of educators, and

professional development around issues and opportunities that can be beneficial for your teaching practice.

It is not often that educators are permitted to strike because they are employed by the state and are

considered vital to public service. Still, some teachers do strike regardless of state laws that may prevent them

from striking, as we saw in 2018 in West Virginia, Kentucky, and Oklahoma. When teachers go on strike, the

impacted school board can obtain a court injunction to order teachers back to the school and teachers can lose

pay for each day on strike. In many states, they can also be dismissed from their teaching positions for striking.

Activity - Advocacy

   You may have heard of the #RedforEd movement, which involves teachers striking or protesting in
many different states as a way to advocate for students. Watch this video to learn more about this
movement from the National Education Association (NEA)

Academic Freedom

Many teachers consider academic freedom to be a constitutional freedom outlined by the First Amendment.
Because a teacher is a state employee and has signed a legally binding teaching contract, the teacher has a
legal obligation to adhere to the rules and regulations identified by the school board and the laws of the state
and federal government. A teacher represents the school and cannot do whatever they want in the classroom.
Likewise, a teacher does not have complete freedom of speech to say whatever he or say wishes either. All
teachers must follow guidelines represented in their teacher contract and the policies and procedures of the
school board.

   While the legal system has afforded teachers the right to select appropriate class materials, the educational
purpose, the age and sophistication of students, and the context and length of time to complete assignments
must all be considered. For example, if you wanted to teach the muscular system in human anatomy in your
sixth grade science curriculum, but this content is not taught until tenth grade, you would not be able to
change the curriculum framework set by the school district per your teaching contract.

   If an activity aligns to your curriculum framework and you have followed the guidelines set forth by the
school board, you could, for example, have a speaker come into your classroom to talk about an aspect of your
curriculum or use an article published in the newspaper. Doing so would not be in breach of your contract. As
you prepare for class instruction, consider your assigned curriculum, review school policies, and ask your school
principal or other mentor teachers for guidance.

   Academic freedom basically refers to the freedom of teachers to communicate information and share
curricular material, without legal interference. In many cases, teachers were allowed a fair amount of academic
freedom in creating and teaching their coursework. However, this has been notably changing in a highly
politicized and divided nation.

Freedom of Speech and Expression

     Pause and Ponder - Teacher Rights

        Imagine a teacher published an opinion piece in the local newspaper. In the editorial, they were very
     critical of a policy that the school board had just passed. They also included many allegations that were
     not accurate. The community reacted very strongly on both sides of the issue. What rights does this
     teacher have for freedom of expression outside of their position as a teacher in this school district?

208 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
   Outside of the classroom, freedom of expression for a
teacher has been challenged in the court system if
administration or general public determined that the
speech or behavior was disruptive to the effectiveness
of a school. Because a teacher has a professional
responsibility to their school, educators must be careful
about what they say, both at school and outside of
school. It is also important for teachers to be mindful
about what they post on social media, even if it is their
personal account.

   In the Pickering v. Board of Education (1968) case, the
Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and found
that the teacher's First Amendment right to free
speech had been violated after he was dismissed by the
school board for writing and publishing a letter in the
local newspaper criticizing the board. The court held Image 10.5
that teachers were able to voice concerns, even if those
concerns were unfavorable to the school, as long as the regular school operations were not disrupted. In the
case, the court's opinion was that the plaintiff's First Amendment rights to free speech were not lost because a
school district believes the speech is not in its "best interest." After this ruling, the teacher in this case was
reinstated to his position.

   This influential case regarding First Amendment rights and freedom of speech for public school teachers
established precedent that public employees have the ability to speak out on issues of public concern, even as
state or government employees. Even so, the rights of public employees continue to be challenged in the U.S.
court system.

   In Connick v. Myers (1983), the Supreme Court again reversed a lower court decision and ruled that speech of
public employees is protected only when they speak on matters of public concern. The case results here showed
that the rights of public service employees must be balanced between matters of public importance and an
employer's interest to maintain a disruptive free workplace.

   Similar to freedom of speech, a teacher's freedom of expression can also be called into question as it relates
to personal presentation and dress. Court cases surrounding dress code requirements established by school
boards and imposed on teachers in their local schools have established some legal precedent, but this also
continues to be a hotly debated topic. As a public school teacher, can you exercise your own `personal liberty'
in how you dress?In East Hartford Education Association v. Board of Education (1977), a public school teacher
was reprimanded for failing to wear a necktie while teaching an English class. Joined by his teachers union,
he sued the board of education on the basis that the admonishment for the dress code violated his rights to
free speech and privacy. This case was heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals who found that the school board was
justified in imposing the dress code. As a teacher and public servant in a position of trust, the court felt that this
professional requirement and overall governance by the school board on the appearance of its teachers was
warranted.

   For many teachers and students alike, dress and personal appearance is considered a freedom of expression.
Geographic diversity and individual school culture can also be a factor in what is allowed or not allowed as
it relates to dress codes in schools across the United States (Sternberg, n.d.). What is acceptable in southern
California may or may not be in West Virginia or Vermont. School principals often become the main authority
for ensuring compliance (Waggoner, 2008). A standard of reasonableness is useful when crafting a successful
dress code, along with clarity of language and flexibility dependent on the situation to determine appropriate
dress and professional presentation. Review the dress code for your school and district to ensure that you are in
compliance.

                                                                                                                           Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 209
     Critical Lens - In the News

        In the fall of 2020, a teacher at a charter school in Texas says she was fired after wearing a mask with
     "Black Lives Matter" written on it (Pygas, 2020). The school told her the mask was a violation of the
     dress code and asked her to avoid wearing the mask due to the "current political climate." When she
     stated in an email that she would not stop wearing the mask, the school said she had "effectively
     resigned her position," since she did not intend to follow the established policy. Dress codes are one
     part of the professional behavior you may be expected to follow once you sign a teaching contract, so it
     is important to know exactly what your dress code policy says and what your rights are. Similar
     incidents have occurred in Oregon. Check out the controversy in Newberg, Oregon and how they
     banned freedom of expression regarding Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ rights: https://www.opb.org/

Liability and Teachers

Now, imagine an elementary school teacher is outside with their students on the playground. Two children ask
if they can climb on the climbing wall. The teacher agrees and begins to walk over so they can monitor their
play. At that very moment, a child falls off the monkey bars she was playing on and begins to cry. The teacher
quickly walks over to the fallen child and notices that she has a cut on her arm. Can this teacher be sued for
negligence?

   When at school, educators have a responsibility that is referred to by the courts as "in loco parentis" or "in
place of parents." This means that while in school it is the responsibility of educators to make similar judgments
as it relates to the safety of children that a parent might make. Because an educator is legally responsible for the
safety of children under their supervision, a teacher is considered negligent if they fail to protect a child from
injury or harm.

   Accidents happen, and there are multiple ways that a child could be injured, such as in the playground
scenario described above, in the lab of a science classroom, or even running down the hallway. However, if it is
determined that negligence did occur, or even if a parent believes that negligence took place, a liability suit can
be brought against the teacher or the school. The person who was harmed can bring civil or criminal charges
against the student or teacher who threatened harm. In addition, a teacher can be dismissed and lose his or her
teaching license as well as be criminally or civilly charged.

   Protections exist for teachers that limit liability. These include:

  · A reasonable attempt was made to anticipate a dangerous condition;
  · Proper precautions were instituted to include establishing rules and procedures to prevent injury;
  · Students were warned of possible danger; and
  · The teacher provided proper supervision (Legal Information Institute, n.d.).

The Supreme Court of Wyoming held in Fagen v. Summers (1972) that the teacher did everything possible to
keep students safe following a playground accident, citing that "a teacher cannot anticipate the varied and

210 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
unexpected acts which occur daily in and about the school premises." Schools and/or teachers are generally not
held responsible for accidents occurring on school property under these types of circumstances.

   In another playground accident in Louisiana several years later, Partin v. Vernon Parish School Board (1977),
the judge reiterated the importance of a teacher demonstrating a "high degree of care" for students under his
or her supervision, while confirming the earlier decision and citing that "the teacher is not the absolute insurer
of the safety of the children she supervises." In both of these cases, the teacher was not found guilty of any
negligence based on the above criteria.

   Teachers can have a lawsuit brought against them for civil liability or civil statutes if it is believed that:

  · a student has been mistreated or abused either verbally, physically, emotionally, or sexually by the teacher.
  · a teacher discriminated against a child due to his or her gender, race, or a special need(s).
  · a teacher treated certain children unfairly, such as through grading practices.
  · offensive material was assigned by the teacher (Legal Information Institute, n.d.).

Once you begin teaching, your school and state will have specific policies regarding liability protection for
teachers.

     Critical Lens: Who Gets to Define "Offensive"?

        What happens if what some families deem offensive is the lived experience of others? For example, a
     teacher in Texas was placed on administrative leave when some families complained about posters on
     the "walls" of her virtual Bitmoji classroom (Fitzsimons, 2020). These virtual "posters" depicted
     affirmations of LGBTQ+ communities and the Black Lives Matter Movement. But what about the
     students who see themselves in these LGBTQ+ and Black Lives Matter posters? How do we create
     classroom communities that are inclusive of various cultures and perspectives, while also
     acknowledging that some groups deem certain cultures and perspectives as "offensive"?

Teacher Privacy

Privacy is considered to be a protection in the U.S. Constitution under the Fourth Amendment as it relates to
unreasonable searches and seizures (U.S. Constitution, Fourth Amendment).

   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable
searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported
by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
seized.

Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution ratified in 1789, revised
1992

In the Supreme Court case, O'Connor v. Ortega (1987), the court ruled that public employees retain their Fourth

                                                                                                                            Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 211
Amendment rights with regard to administrative searches in the workplace. The Court held that a standard
of reasonableness was sufficient for work-related intrusions by public employers. It cited that an employee's
expectation of privacy may be unreasonable when the intrusion into the office is by a supervisor rather than a
law enforcement official while conducting normal business functions. For teachers, the school is considered a
public place and therefore there are minimal limitations placed on search and seizure. However, your personal
effects, such as a phone or bag, do not belong to the workplace and if searched, require a warrant. For your own
protection as a teacher, use care when deciding what to bring into the school.

     Critical Lens - Teachers and Copyright Laws

      A Word about Teachers and Copyright Laws

        Teachers are not exempt from copyright laws, and you must be careful about the materials you use in
     your classroom. In the Copyright Act of 1976, Congress established guidelines for the duplication of
     copyrighted works. According to the law, teachers may make a single copy of a chapter of a book, an
     article, a short story, short essay or poem, a diagram, chart or picture. Educators may make multiple
     copies of copyrighted work for the use in the classroom provided they meet specific guidelines of
     brevity, spontaneity, and cumulative effect.

        Teachers also need to be mindful of copyright laws involving electronic media. Pay attention to
     copyright laws for using videos, DVDs, and software programs. Be aware that internet laws are still
     evolving, and it is best to check with their librarian or media specialist in your school building.

Religions and Schools

The First Amendment separates religion from the business of the state. Government is prohibited from
imposing religious beliefs on any person. Public school serves as a state government service and therefore it
must be neutral and not promote religious beliefs on anyone in the school. The practice of religion in schools
has been challenged from prayer in schools, to religion in the curriculum, religious clubs and access to public
school facilities, to artifacts and clothing.

     Critical Lens - Supreme Court Cases on Religion in Schools

        The Supreme Court has continuously upheld the separation of religion from the school environment
     (ACLU Legal Bulletin, 2020).

212 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
   Y      Outcome
ear
          In Engel v. Vitale, the Supreme Court upheld that nondenominational prayers were unconstitutional
   19  because they promoted religion, and schools could not officially encourage student prayer as it would
62     interfere with the function of school.

   19     In Abington School District v. Schempp, the Supreme Court ruled that the state legislation passing a law
63     requiring all schools to read the Bible daily was unconstitutional.

   19     In Lemon v. Kurtzman, the Supreme Court held that prayers or blessings by clergy at the opening or
71     closing of a public ceremony in a school violates the free exercise clause. From this case there was a test
       that courts use to determine if religion in schools is constitutional. The questions are:

           · Is the policy or the act for a secular purpose?
           · Does the primary effect either advance or inhibit religion?
           · Does the law or policy result in excessive entanglement of government and religion?

   19 The Supreme Court ruled in Stone v. Graham that a Kentucky state law requiring the Ten
81 Commandments be posted in school classrooms was illegal.

The courts have upheld that there is a separation between church and state even to the extent of one's own
personal beliefs. In 1980, a teacher refused to teach a city-designed curriculum that she said violated her own
religious beliefs. In the Palmer v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago (1980) decision, the court recognized
that a teacher can have personal views that might be different from the curriculum, but upheld that the
mandate of the school district to provide an education requires that teachers "cannot be left to teach the way
they please."

10.9 Rights of Students

Students share many of the same constitutional rights to ensure protection as adults. Several sections outlined
below parallel those shown above under Teacher Rights, but with additional emphasis on the students
themselves.

   Courts have mandated that for a school to operate safely it needs to have broad authority to establish rules
and regulations as it relates to student conduct within the school. This means that parents agree to give some
level of control to schools when they enroll their child in the public school system. The courts have also insisted
that students do not lose all of their constitutional rights and a school's influence is not absolute.

       Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 213
Freedom of Speech and Expression

   Schools have an obligation to provide a safe and orderly learning
environment. Reasonable limits are put in place regarding language,
such as banning offensive language, to assure appropriateness and
respect. Forms of expression for students that are protected in schools
include:

  · the right to wear religious clothing and talk about religion,
  · to be free from bullying and harassment, and
  · to be free from racial or national origin discrimination (United

      States Courts, n.d.).

Protecting students' rights to political speech was explored in Tinker v.
Des Moines Independent School District (1969), which served as a
landmark Supreme Court case and the decision upheld that free Image 10.6
speech was permitted in schools. This ruling was later challenged in
1986 when a student used what was considered `vulgar' language by the school in a speech at an assembly. The
student was reprimanded by the school and the student sued the school claiming that his constitutional right
to freedom of speech had been violated. The case went to the U.S. Supreme Court where the court decided in
Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser (1986) that a school is not required to permit offensive or disruptive
speech on school grounds at a school sanctioned event because offensive speech or language disrupts the
educational mission of the school and is inappropriate for a school setting.

   Freedom is also limited as it relates to a student newspaper. In Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier
(1988), the U.S. Supreme Court decided that a student newspaper can be regulated for "legitimate pedagogical
concerns" allowing a school to remove articles that school officials deemed inappropriate for the school
community. The decision went further, allowing a school to determine if the speech was written in a reasonable
manner for members of the school community and ensuring that it did not contain language that was
"ungrammatical, poorly written, inadequately researched, biased, prejudiced, vulgar or profane, or unsuitable
for immature audiences." The court found that because a school newspaper is not intended to have a public
forum, a school can limit speech by imposing reasonable constraints if it is determined the speech would
disrupt a classroom and the normal functioning of a school.

   In the present day, free speech as it relates to the Internet is the same for teachers as it is for students.
If it is found that the speech posted online `substantially disrupts' the functioning and purpose of a school,
disciplinary actions can be taken against either cohort.

   Schools have the right to limit forms of expression-including speech, digital communication, and dress-when
they interfere with the pedagogical mission and goals of a school.

   In Doninger v. Niehoff (2008), a student's derogatory comments posted online were found to make a
substantial disruption to the school. A blog post contained language that would be prohibited within the school
and was disruptive to the work and discipline of the school. A Court of Appeals held that even though the online
comments were made off campus, the speech could be restricted to promote school-related goals on campus.
This case relates to disruptive speech and cyberbullying. It underscores school responsibility in maintaining a
safe environment for students.

   The speech of students and teachers is constitutionally protected, but the extent of the speech, as it relates
to the mission and goals of a school, must always have a legitimate pedagogical focus and direction. This holds
true whether it is in print in a school newspaper, in the local newspaper, or in electronic format. It is true if it
is part of the curriculum or in a theater production on school grounds. Speech is influenced both on and off
campus and can come under the school's authority both in-person and online.

Dress Code

Dress codes have been challenged by students claiming that they impinge on freedoms of speech and
expression. Courts have upheld that school boards can impose student dress codes to include symbols,
clothing, and jewelry if it is believed to have the potential to disrupt a school's functioning.

   In addition to supporting free speech as discussed above, the Tinker v. Des Moines (1969) case also weighed
in regarding dress code. During the Vietnam War, students planned to wear armbands to protest the War. Their
principal tried to limit these protests by banning armbands. The court ruled against the school, holding that
there was no evidence that students wearing armbands would disrupt school functioning.

   In 2006, a student wore a shirt to school that other students found offensive and which depicted a particular
political viewpoint. He was asked to cover the shirt based on the off-putting image and speech. He refused and
was given a disciplinary referral. In Guiles v. Marineau (2006), the student then sued the school administrators
to have the disciplinary referral expunged from his record and to disallow the school from enforcing the dress
code policy against him. The District court held that the school was entitled to enforce its dress code policy, but
upon appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals ruled that the shirt was protected speech under the First and Fourteenth
Amendments.

   In another case, B.H. and K.M. v. Easton Area School District (2013), students were suspended for wearing
bracelets that showed support for breast cancer awareness. In this case, the judge ruled in favor of the students.
The school district then elevated the case to the Supreme Court, but the court refused to hear the case,
stating that the message on the bracelet did not use lewd language and was not disruptive to the purpose
of education. The First Amendment requires schools to see all student views equally, as long as they are not
obscene or disruptive, irrespective of the message expressed (Sherwin, 2017).

     Pause and Ponder - Dress Code

        Andrew Johnson, a high school wrestler in New Jersey who wore his hair in cheekbone-length
     dreadlocks. Moments before Johnson was about to go to the mat for a match, the referee told him he
     wouldn't be allowed to compete because his hair was too long.

The purpose of a dress code is to provide an optimal learning environment. However, the learning environment

                                                                                                                            Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 215
can be restrictive if it includes gender-biased language that results in stricter enforcement of rules for female
minority students and groups belonging to a particular culture. A gender-neutral dress code is recommended,
and those who create the policy should attempt to gather student input when revising the school dress code.
(Barrett, 2018).

     Critical Lens - In the News

        Pay attention to the news-you are likely to hear many examples of dress code violations that
     systematically oppress certain groups. For example, a school in Houston made the news in early 2020[2]
     for their dress code policy. The policy required male students to keep their hair "ear-length or shorter,"
     thus banning dreadlocks. One male student, De'Andre Arnold was told he would have to cut his
     dreadlocks in order to walk at graduation. Despite complaints, the school district stood by its policy. In
     August, a federal court ruled this policy was discriminatory.

The American Civil Liberties Union also provides guidance on student rights as they relate to school dress codes,
gender, and self-expression:

  · Views are protected by the First Amendment and therefore schools cannot ban symbols or slogans or
      messages that they disagree with on student shirts, buttons, wristbands, or other garments or accessories.

  · While public schools can establish dress codes, they cannot treat boys and girls differently, censor
      viewpoints, or force students to conform to gender stereotypes under federal law.

  · Students are allowed to wear clothing that aligns with their gender identity and expression (ACLU Fact
      Sheet, 2016).

Schools and administrators must be aware of the constitutional rights of students and protect these freedoms.
Schools can assert certain restrictions as they relate to freedom of speech and expression, but at the same time
they also need to be cognizant of student diversity and cultural differences, as well as gender distinctions, and
economic disparities.

     Activity

        Think about some of your experiences with dress codes. Which cultures were normalized, and which
     were marginalized? Here are a few ideas to get you started.

          · Gender and sexuality: Were males and females held to different standards? (For example, were
             females expected to wear skirts or not to wear strappy shirts? See the #Iamnotadistraction
             movement[3] or the Let Her Learn report[4] advocating for female bodies not to be hyper-
             regulated and sexualized in dress codes.)

          · Race: Were certain hairstyles or traditions allowed or not? (For example, Black hair styles[5] are

216 | Ethical and Legal Issues in Education
   frequently at risk of marginalization, along with Black and Brown bodies in general[6].) Or, are
   certain racial groups punished more frequently[7] for dress code violations?
· Religion: Are head coverings and facial hair regulated? (For example, the Air Force updated their
   policy[8] in February 2020.)
· Socioeconomic: Were certain types of clothing allowed or not? (For example, some dress codes
   limit cheap plastic flip flops but allow more expensive leather ones.)

Search and Seizure

                          Imagine that a teacher suspects a student has illegal drugs in her

                          backpack. They noticed the student at her locker placing a small bag in

                          the front pocket. The teacher immediately reports their suspicions to

                          the principal. What should be the next step? The school administrator

                          must have a "reasonable suspicion" based on facts specific to the

                          student or the situation. A "hunch" is not sufficient. Rather, the principal

                          must believe that searching the student will turn up evidence of

                          violating a school rule or law. "Reasonable" is based on what is being

                          searched for and the age of the student.

                          The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution protects U.S. citizens

                          from unlawful search and seizure of possessions. If there is probable

                          cause for a search, a warrant is required from the court system before a

Image 10.7                person can be searched. Because of the nature and purpose of school,
                          courts have allowed schools to both search and seize possessions if

there is probable cause.

Personal materials, including lockers, are not supposed to be searched without reasonable suspicion that a

student is in violation of the law or a school rule.

In New Jersey v. T.L.O. (1985), the Supreme Court established a standard of reasonableness for student

searches conducted at school and by public school personnel. While the Fourth Amendment disallowing

unreasonable search and seizure still applies, if school administrators have a reasonable suspicion that a student

has either broken the law or violated a school rule, the search is justified. In this case, the student was found

smoking in the bathroom, a violation of school rules, and taken to the principal's office where her purse was

searched based on a reasonable assumption that the student had cigarettes in her purse.

Random drug tests have historically been permissible for both teachers and students. In the Supreme Court

case Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls (2002), the

court held that athletes can be randomly tested for drugs to protect the safety of the school and to ensure

a drug-free school. The safety and well-being of the school outweighed the privacy rights of students who

were voluntarily participating in the sporting events. The Court concluded that while the students participating

in extracurricular activities have limited Fourth Amendment rights, within the school setting there is a lesser

expectation of privacy, and the students' rights must be balanced against the school's interest in keeping illegal

drug use to a minimum (Staros & Williams, 2007).

In 2005, a 13-year old student was called out of class and questioned by police officers with school officials

present regarding neighborhood burglaries. His parents were not contacted, nor was he read his Miranda rights,

such as the right to remain silent, leave the room, or have access to a lawyer. The child confessed to the crime

                                                      Ethical and Legal Issues in Education | 217
but later sought to suppress his confession based on not receiving any indications of his rights while he was in
police custody in the school conference room. This case, J.D.B. v. North Carolina (2011), was later heard by the
Supreme Court where they ruled that age should have been considered in deciding whether the student was in
police custody within the school grounds. The justices went on to state that there are psychological differences
between an adult and a child, and when police are involved in questioning students, they must use "common
sense" due to the developmental differences of children. The Miranda warnings should have been applied in
this case in a manner appropriate for the student prior to his questioning.

   Search has also been controversial with the use of video surveillance and metal detectors in schools. Currently,
courts have held that if school safety has been threatened, means of surveillance can be introduced into
the school, but that extensive surveillance using video or metal detectors can hinder reasonableness of the
surveillance and violate Fourth Amendment protections. The intent of school policies and procedures are
consistently to provide and maintain "a safe, secure, healthy, and disruption-free learning environment" that is
conducive and supportive to teaching and learning (Vacca, 2014, p. 5).

Privacy of Records

In 1974, Congress passed the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), also called the Buckley
Amendment. This was an Amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA) of 1965. FERPA
is a federal law that protects the privacy of student educational records. FERPA requires schools to allow parents
and students access to official school records. It also requires schools to provide procedures for parents to
challenge the accuracy or completeness of information in their child's record. Parents retain the rights of access
to their child's school record until the child reaches the age of eighteen or is enrolled in a postsecondary
institution.

   The intent of FERPA is to protect student privacy and improve parental access to their child's information
within the school. It does not guarantee access to all school records on a child, such as personal teacher notes,
letters of reference, grade books, or correspondence with a principal. These items are exempted from view.
There may also be files or information that are kept separate from a student's file to protect the privacy rights
of other students in the school.

   FERPA guidelines require schools to:

  · Inform parents annually of their rights regarding their child's records.
  · Provide parents access to their child's records.
  · Maintain procedures that allow parents to challenge and if needed, amend inaccurate information.
  · Protect parents from disclosure of confidential information to third parties without their consent (Family

      Educational Rights and Privacy Act, 1974).
  · Allow students to opt out of testing

10. 10 Current Implications

Throughout the history of schools in the United States, ethics and the function of laws have evolved as society
has changed. To date, current issues continue to be addressed in our nation's public schools and within our
court systems. While others exist as well, below are three current issues within education and society as a whole.

Racial Issues

Today, racial concerns remain a key issue for schools and society at large. In T.B. et al. v. Independent School
District 112 (2019), African American students filed a complaint against white students in Minnesota. They
claimed they had been harassed and the school did not intervene to remove racism, harassment, and
discrimination nor did it protect their rights to safe and equal access to education within the school
environment. This is required as part of the Equal Protection Clause under the Fourteenth Amendment of the
U.S. Constitution and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. As of this writing, the case remains open in the court
of appeals.

   Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states, "No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race,
color, or national origin, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance" (Civil Rights Act, 1964).

   Racial harassment continues to occur in schools to the present day. As a teacher, you are responsible for
enforcing policies and procedures that are appropriate within the classroom to maintain a safe environment
for all students. Immediate action is required to respond to bullying and intimidation, such as speaking up
and talking with the offending students and reporting the action to your principal when you hear or see
questionable behavior or actions within your school. Regular professional development and training can
additionally help inform and support teachers. A culture of inclusion and acceptance is required by school
leadership that permeates throughout the school and community.

Video 10.8

Discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity are important issues in today's schools. For

LGBTQ+ teachers, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits employers from discriminating against

individuals because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin (Civil Rights Act, 1964). For students, Title IX

under the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education bans sex discrimination in schools and

reads "No person shall, on the basis of sex, be denied admission, or be subjected to discrimination in

admission, by any recipient to which this subpart applies" (U.S. Department of Education, 2015).

LGBTQ+ teachers and students have legal protections that          Students or teachers who believe they have been
make discrimination against them illegal under Title VII of    discriminated against can bring litigation under the
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title IX under the Office of  Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Civil Rights of the U.S. Department of Education.              Amendment. The Equal Protection Clause in Section

1 of the Fourteenth Amendment states:

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of

the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall

abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person

of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal

protection of the laws (U.S. Constitution, Fourteenth Amendment).

In addition, in 1984 Congress passed the Equal Access Act requiring federally-funded secondary schools to

uphold students' First Amendment rights to conduct meetings and hold an open forum with equal access to

extracurricular student groups or clubs (Equal Access Act, 1984).

In Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education (1999), the mother sued the school system on behalf of her

fifth-grade daughter for failing to prevent sexual harassment by another student. The Supreme Court upheld

that there is an implied right to education under Title IX and found that the school board acted with deliberate

indifference, ignoring the mother's complaints of harassment that were serious and systematic.

In Nabozny v. Podlesny (1996), the Court of Appeals ruled that public schools and their officials could be held

liable for failing to protect homosexual students from antigay harassment and harm. Since signed into law

in 2009, schools must follow the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act (2009). This law expanded

the federal hate crime law, to include crimes motivated by the victim's actual or perceived gender, sexual

orientation, gender identity or disability.

On the basis of sexual orientation and/or gender identity, students receive protection from bullying by other

students, teachers, and school staff and cannot be discriminated against in school by being unfairly denied

access to facilities, sports teams, or clubs. Both anti-bullying and school nondiscrimination laws support and

protect LGBTQ+ students. In addition, sexual harassment guidelines are provided through the Office for Civil

Rights at the U.S. Department of Education (2020b). It is the responsibility of a school to take meaningful steps

to support and protect all students.

   Protection from emotional or physical abuse is considered a primary right of children. Mandatory Reporting

requires educators to report any signs of child abuse. Children often can't or won't speak up if their parents,
caregivers, or third-party individuals are abusing them. They rely on you and others in the community to
recognize when something isn't right and to act upon your suspicions in order to help protect them.

   Warning signs include:

  · Physical signs present on the child
  · Behavioral signs or statements made by the child, or
  · Behavioral signs or statements made by the parent or caregiver.

Any single concern may or may not mean that abuse is occurring. But observing any of these indicators --
especially when more than one is present -- should prompt you to think about what might be happening and
report your suspicions. Oregon's children are relying on you and others in the community to observe, recognize
and report concerns of child abuse.

Welfare detailing what you can do about child abuse.

Conclusion

During this chapter, you have learned about how ethical and legal issues impact education. A professional
Code of Ethics influences a teacher's practice by outlining standards that ensure that all teachers demonstrate
integrity, impartiality, and ethical behavior to assure that students receive a fair and equitable education.
Teachers and students do not give up their constitutional rights when entering into public schools in the United
States; however, the courts have declared that there is a difference between teacher and student rights outside
of a school and those inside the school. Rights and responsibilities must align to state and federal law, as well
as the safety of students, and the mission of the public school. Case law has provided guidance for schools on
procedures and regulations as well as the roles and responsibilities of teachers and students. The legal cases
highlighted in this chapter are significant to the purpose and goals of public schooling throughout the United
States. There continue to be challenges over time, especially as society changes and the United States becomes
more diverse and local communities attempt to influence local schooling. A robust legal system is needed
to maintain a fair and responsible system of education that supports all students. Understanding ethical and
legal issues related to education will help you make informed decisions as an educator in the US public school
system.

          "I know that happiness has been the real, if covert, goal of your labors here. I know that it informs
       your choice of companions, the profession you will enter, but I urge you, please don't settle for
       happiness. It's not good enough. Of course, you deserve it. But if that is all you have in
       mind--happiness--I want to suggest to you that personal success devoid of meaningfulness, free of
       a steady commitment to social justice, that's more than a barren life, it is a trivial one. It's looking
       good instead of doing good."

   Starting their career is for most people one of the most exciting and energizing periods of their lives. For most

young people, it represents their unofficial entrance into the adult world. They are often in a new environment
with new people and challenges, and they have real responsibilities. This is especially true for new teachers.

   For many, the transition into full-time teaching is relatively easy and satisfying. For others, however, the first
year is a struggle. Some new teachers are shocked and disappointed by their initial experience of being a
teacher. For most, however, the first year of teaching is a mixed bag of highs and lows.

   Fortunately, People entering the teaching profession in the second decade of the twenty-first century
typically will have a rich variety of options and opportunities from which to choose because of so many
retirements. So much for the good news.

   It is important to note that the first year of teaching can be a rough one for beginners. Each year, many new
teachers walk into their classrooms with energy, high hopes, and rose-colored glasses, only to face unexpected
problems that cause them to drastically lower their perceptions of their capabilities as teachers.

   Surprise is a big part of the first year too. New teachers often report their astonishment at this or that
experience or event. The first year is intense because of the unexpected demands and the startling events that
lurk in what was thought to be a familiar world: the classroom.

11.1 What Education do I Need?

When moving to a new state, it is important to check in with the state licensing authority to determine what
educational qualifications are required of teachers. In Oregon, this would be the Oregon Teachers Standards
and Practices Commission - TSPC

   Every state manages its own credentialing guidelines, which can make the licensure process confusing,
especially when moving between states.

     Deeper Dive - Licensure

        For more about licensure across states: 50-State Comparison: Teacher License Reciprocity

Typically, teacher licensure requires a bachelor's degree at minimum, but educators have been hired with
associates degrees in high need rural areas. Due to the critical demands for more professionals to join the
teacher workforce, there are more pathways than ever to become a licensed teacher. Tennessee has an
apprenticeship program for new teacher candidates, and other states such as Oregon are looking to replicate
this model.

   Many higher education institutions now offer remote and online programming for students who need to
keep working at their jobs (in addition to the traditional model of in-person learning). It is important to consider
the local options and scholarships available before considering out-of-state and/or private options because local
options have been vetted carefully by the community.

     Critical Lens - "There is no such thing as free,"

        Buyer beware! "There is no such thing as free," so be sure to read the fine print and understand what
     you are getting into. Students sometimes think they are getting a cheaper education but have not
     considered other costs and consequences such as hidden costs or consequences such as having to find
     one's own student teaching practicum! Do your research and ask around to district personnel or
     college/university advising staff! Choose local for a safe bet: "Choose Local": Oregon EPP Preliminary
     Licensure Program Inventory (Responses)

Many students also pursue graduate studies, and teacher salaries typically correlate with level of education.
Increasingly, there are options to pursue graduate studies/degrees while working for districts. This option can
make the teacher career pathway much more affordable. Due to the aging workforce, known colloquially as
the silver tsunami, many schools have critical hiring needs. As a result, state governments are coming up with
new ways to educate teachers and a variety of funding incentives in the forms of grants and scholarships. Take
advantage of these opportunities!

   Community colleges are a great way to start one's educational path as they offer affordable pathways and

                                                                                                                                                    Becoming a Teacher | 227
can offer a diverse coursework, as well as a diverse student community (people of all ages, backgrounds, and
lived experiences). Students who already work in the schools can apply their rich experiences to their classroom
learning. Finding jobs in non-licensed roles (such as that of a paraprofessional) in the schools is one of the
best "front-row seats" to view the teaching profession. Most importantly, it helps evolving educators to build
the confidence to pursue licensure. Additionally, districts increasingly are finding ways to provide financial
support to assist with tuition costs so that paraprofessionals can work towards becoming licensed teachers
while working.

   Once you have chosen a Bachelor's program to pursue, you can determine which community college courses
your future university will accept. Less important than the degree you choose at the community college is
to understand the requirements of the transfer institution. Pick a degree that either fits perfectly with your
transfer plan or has enough flexibility to accommodate it. Many transfer schools will accept a certain amount
of elective credit which provides some flexibility, but most have a set of classes they expect you to take as
foundational course work.

   The sooner you choose your transfer university, the sooner you can make good choices about which classes
to take at the community college. It is critical to work with an advisor who can support you to navigate the
transfer pathways. Elementary educators should focus on a broad range of subjects while middle and high and
school educators should focus on the area they hope to teach, in addition to foundational coursework listed
below. Typical coursework includes a collection of the following:

  · Social science (Psychology, Sociology)
  · Humanities (Literature, Art, Music, Language, History)
  · Science (Biology, Environmental Science, etc)
  · Communication (Speech)
  · Math
  · Health and Physical Education
  · Ethics (philosophy or religion)
  · Specific Education coursework
  · Ethnic Studies

Increasingly, the lack of representation in the US curriculum of certain groups is well-documented. This leads to
a society that struggles to reckon with its past, present, and future in terms of delivering equity and justice to
all of its citizens. For this reason, taking course work in Ethnic Studies - to better know the rich heritage of a
variety of underrepresented groups, their voices, art, literature and histories- is highly recommended. In each of
the areas above, there should be options to study Black history or Latino/a/x/e literature, Asian art or women's
contributions to the sciences for example. Educators who take such coursework will be better equipped to re-
center the curriculum and work towards a more just society.

228 | Becoming a Teacher
   Educators have a responsibility to teach curricular material in a way that does not perpetuate, but dismantles
the oppressive processes, systems, dynamics, and stereotypes prevalent in US society. While college education
typically covers a lot of information, it might not cover anti-racism. In order to be the most effective educator
for all the students you reach, regardless of their or your identity, it is imperative that you educate yourself on
how to communicate and provide learning opportunities on such topics as racism, sexism, classism and other
oppressions. Educators must be able to handle the topics that affect their students, especially the ones that
matter to them and affect their lived realities. Educators can not teach in a protected bubble, and must be
responsive to the needs of a modern society.

     Critical Lens - Learning and Growing

        You may already be envisioning with excitement your journey toward becoming a teacher, perhaps
     by walking across a stage to accept your diploma and later getting the keys to your very own classroom.
     While this is an important first step in your path toward becoming a professional educator, your journey
     does not end as soon as you have completed your teaching credential. You will have a lifetime of
     opportunities to continue learning, growing, and leading in the ever-changing and evolving field of
     education.

Stay Informed

As we've mentioned in other places in this book, one of the

most exciting parts of being a teacher is that you get to be a

life-long learner yourself. First of all, you will continue to learn

and hone your craft as a teacher through many venues. You

may choose to complete additional courses, future advanced

degrees (maybe even a doctorate so you can work with

preservice teachers as a college professor), or certificates.

Another important way to stay informed is to become a

member of professional organizations that support teachers.

These organizations are often focused on specific sub-fields,

like literacy, math, or science, but some organizations support       Image 11.2 - As a teacher, you will have

which can be an exciting way to keep your learning current

while meeting other educators like you. Often students and early-career teachers can join these organizations

or attend conferences at a discounted rate-sometimes even for free. Below, you will find a lists with a few of

these professional organizations.

One final way for you to stay informed as a future teacher is to keep up with current events, policy, legislation,
and other visible ways education is in the news. While sometimes it can feel overwhelming to maintain your
day-to-day responsibilities as a teacher while also keeping an eye on outside events, this awareness of current
events is vital for your ongoing advocacy for your students, your colleagues, and yourself. Here are a few online
resources that are completely devoted to covering headlines related to education.

     Pause and Ponder - News

        What was the last time you saw or heard about education in the news? Was the story positive or
     negative? What was the goal of this coverage? Whose story was told and whose story was not?

The institution of education is constantly evolving, and often outside forces have long tried to shape the
trajectory of it. Education was-and is interrelated with other institutions in the United States, such as the
economy, politics, and religion. For example, just in the first few years of the 2020s, headlines about education
addressed the pandemic, issues of equity with online learning, the claim that Critical Race Theory (CRT) is being
taught in K-12 schools, and additional topics that were of timely consideration due to other social, economic,
and political factors.

   Popular media and politicians have used the strategy of conflating accurate United States history which
includes colonization, enslavement, and ongoing systemic oppression- with CRT. CRT is, in short, a complex
theory designed for legal analysis (watch the video below for more explanation).

   Listening closely to these news stories can also highlight misunderstandings people have about how
education works in the United States. You know from your journey through this text that the US Department
of Education (US DoE) has no jurisdiction over curriculum; educational decisions are left to individual states.
Nevertheless, critics of CRT have accused the US DoE of endorsing CRT when the federal government simply
plays no such role in mandating curriculum.

     Critical Lens - Critical Race Theory in Education

        In 2021, Critical Race Theory became an often-covered headline related to education. In this piece[2],
     Deborah Plummer explains what Critical Race Theory is and why it is controversial. In this interview
     with NPR[3], Gloria Ladson-Billings, one of the first people to apply Critical Race Theory to the field of
     education, explains some of the recent bills to block the teaching of Critical Race Theory.

        You can also watch the following video with Ibram X. Kendi talking about Critical Race Theory:

        Video 11.4
        After you have explored those three resources, consider the following:

232 | Becoming a Teacher
          · How did the information in these pieces compare with what you were hearing on the news?
          · What new understandings and questions do you have?

Furthermore, part of staying informed involves seeking news from multiple sources instead of accepting as
truth what you hear from one source. Make sure that you are seeking input from well-studied experts in the
field. When reading the news about education with a critical lens, here are a few questions to consider:

  · What is the headline/story about?
  · Why is this a significant event to cover?
  · Who seems to be driving the narrative in the piece?
  · Whose voices seem to be excluded?
  · What emotional response from the listener/viewer/reader does the piece seem intended to evoke, and

      why? For whose benefit?
  · What stances from actual stakeholders in education-teachers, families, students, administrators, or

      others-are centered or de-centered?
When you listen with a critical lens to stories about education in the news, you may notice an absence of
teachers' voices. This is an important observation. What might we be missing when we are not hearing from
the teachers themselves? This can lead to the de-professionalization of teachers.

   De-professionalization is a common problem in education. When education is micromanaged-when
teachers are told what to teach and given scripted, "teacher-proof" curriculum to teach from-and when
teachers are undervalued-expected to do extensive work for low wages - de-professionalization occurs. As
you learned in Chapter 2, education's long history in the United States as a female-dominated field directly
correlates to de-professionalization, especially when women teachers were paid less and encouraged to think
of their work as a "calling" instead of a profession.

   As you've read so far, staying informed is part of your ongoing journey toward becoming a teacher, and you
should continue to stay informed even after you earn your teaching license. Next, we'll consider ways to stay
engaged.

                                                                                                                                                    Becoming a Teacher | 233
Stay Engaged

The best way to learn to be a teacher is to get experience actually

working with students, so consider various ways to stay engaged

with young people. One way to stay engaged is to seek out

opportunities to volunteer in local classrooms. Teachers can always

use help with creating classroom materials, working one-on-one

with students, and other classroom tasks. You also may be able to

apply to be a substitute teacher in your local school district, even

before you finish earning your teaching credential. While this can

be a powerful way to develop your future teaching skills, you should

also be aware that being a substitute teacher is not the same as

being a full-time classroom teacher.

   Another way to stay engaged is through opportunities in your       Image 11.3 - Tutoring is one way to stay
local community. You may be able to help with an after-school         engaged with young people and build your
tutoring program or homework club. If your community has a high       future teaching skills.

number of refugees, there may be special programming available to support this portion of the population. You

could also be involved with designing and implementing curriculum for local summer camps or children's

museums. Wherever your passions lie, there are likely to be many opportunities to stay engaged with young

people that will strengthen your skills as a future teacher.

However you choose to stay engaged, be sure you are aware of any policies various organizations may have

about volunteers and visitors. Many public schools require background checks for volunteers who will be in

schools regularly (such as when you are completing a practicum experience); others may simply ask you to

check in at the front office when you arrive and let them know when you leave. As a volunteer, you should also

never be alone with a student. These rules and expectations are in place to keep students safe, so it is important

that you are following them at all times.

One final consideration as you stay engaged is to make it a priority to stretch yourself outside of your comfort

zone. While it may be extremely tempting to go back to the summer camp you loved as a child as a counselor

now, that experience is one you are already familiar with. Go beyond your local community and past experiences

to expose yourself to different places, people, and ways of thinking. Your future classroom will be full of diverse

learners, and stretching your horizons now will only make you a more effective teacher.

Activity - Your own experience as a student

· Think about your own experience as a student.
· When you had a substitute teacher, how did you respond?
· How did the sub respond?

Stay Focused

                    Finally, the path forward will require you to stay focused. Teaching is

                    an exciting profession. No day is exactly the same: you will have different

                    learners with different experiences, strengths, and needs, and this

                    community will shape the outcome of every day in your future

                    classroom. With this excitement comes other emotions too. In your

                    determination to become the best possible teacher, you will also find

                    some self-doubt. Remember that it can take three to five years to feel

                    like you have mastery of your craft as a teacher, so it is quite common to

                    feel like you don't have all the tools in your teacher toolbox when you

                    are an early-career teacher. As we mentioned above, staying informed

                    is one of the best parts of being a teacher: even veteran teachers can

                    keep learning and adding to their teacher toolboxes.

Image 11.4             Another emotion you might feel is exhaustion. You know from your
                    own experience as a student, from your readings in this book, and from

your interactions with friends and family members who are educators that teaching is hard work. You work long

hours with few breaks, and then beyond the instructional day there are emails, family conferences, faculty

meetings, and other special events. You find yourself in the grocery store aisle worrying about one of your

students and if they will have food to eat that night, or if what you said to one student when you were frustrated

came across much harsher than you meant it to. You'll find yourself watching TV or talking to friends when new

ideas for lessons come to mind, or when you realize you have something else you need to add to your never-

ending to-do list.

For the sake of yourself and your students, here is one of the most important pieces of advice we can offer

you: taking care of yourself is critical! You have worked hard for the privilege of guiding your future students'

learning and growth. You also need to stay focused on your own well-being. Speak up when you are feeling

overwhelmed, and carve out as much time for yourself as possible. Keep practicing hobbies that bring you

joy, and find new ones. If you do not have a mentor or community of support, find one or several. After all, if

you aren't taking care of yourself, it's hard to be the best possible teacher for your students. This can not be

overstated so please read this twice and take it to heart!

        Reflect:
          · What are some activities that bring you peace and joy now?
          · How could you see yourself continuing these when you are a teacher, or what new activities
             might you want to try?
          · What network of resources or people do you have for when you do need help getting through a
             tough time?
          · If you hold a marginalized identity, a mentor or support system that shares that identity can
             offer you useful support and advice.

Conclusion

While your journey through the foundations of US education has come to a close in this book, your journey
toward becoming an effective, life-changing teacher is just beginning. In the years to come, you will continue to
develop your craft by staying informed, engaged, and focused. You will have opportunities to see how the field
of education is changing and will continue to change in the future. You will even have opportunities to be a part
of efforts to drive change. Knowing the history and understanding how deeply connected US education is to
the political, social, economic, and legal realms will better equip you to analyze current trends and anticipate
new ones. After all, education can be like a pendulum: certain beliefs and practices tend to fall in and out of
favor every few decades.

   You will have opportunities to work with colleagues and other stakeholders to make education a better place
for teachers, students, families, and communities. As you go forth into the field of education, we challenge you
to maintain a critical lens as you continually question how to make US education the most inclusive, effective,
and successful for all of our learners and their communities.
