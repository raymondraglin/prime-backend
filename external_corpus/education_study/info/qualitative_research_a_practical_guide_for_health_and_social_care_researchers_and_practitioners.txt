PREFACE

I discovered qualitative research as a doctoral student in a predominantly quantitative research
environment.

As someone trained in biomedical science and quantitative public health research, qualitative research was
a new frontier for me.

I taught myself the qualitative research paradigms and designs, methods, and analysis approaches.

I remember being surrounded by qualitative textbooks and feeling lost and confused.

In 2014, the year after finishing my PhD, I designed and launched a three-day short course on qualitative
research for public health.

I wanted to provide researchers, clinicians, practitioners, and students with an introduction to the key
concepts of qualitative research.

I wanted people to leave the course knowing what to google and read!

I wanted to provide guidance and excitement about what qualitative research is, and what can be achieved
through these methods.

This book is the content of the course and more. We draw on our teaching and research experience with
examples throughout.

We hope you find this book helpful and wish you all the best on your qualitative research journey.

RESEARCH

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Identify the key terms and concepts used in qualitative descriptive research.
             Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of qualitative descriptive research.

What is a qualitative descriptive study?

The key concept of the qualitative descriptive study is description.

Qualitative descriptive studies (also known as `exploratory studies' and `qualitative description approaches')
are relatively new in the qualitative research landscape. They emerged predominantly in the field of nursing
and midwifery over the past two decades.1 The design of qualitative descriptive studies evolved as a means
to define aspects of qualitative research that did not resemble qualitative research designs to date, despite
including elements of those other study designs.2

Qualitative descriptive studies describe phenomena rather than explain them. Phenomenological studies,
ethnographic studies and those using grounded theory seek to explain a phenomenon. Qualitative
descriptive studies aim to provide a comprehensive summary of events. The approach to this study design
is journalistic, with the aim being to answer the questions who, what, where and how.3

A qualitative descriptive study is an important and appropriate design for research questions that are
focused on gaining insights about a poorly understood research area, rather than on a specific
phenomenon. Since qualitative descriptive study design seeks to describe rather than explain, explanatory
frameworks and theories are not required to explain or `ground' a study and its results.4 The researcher
may decide that a framework or theory adds value to their interpretations, and in that case, it is perfectly
acceptable to use them. However, the hallmark of genuine curiosity (naturalistic enquiry) is that the
researcher does not know in advance what they will be observing or describing.4 Because a phenomenon
is being described, the qualitative descriptive analysis is more categorical and less conceptual than other
                                                                                   CHAPTER 5: QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH | 8

methods. Qualitative content analysis is usually the main approach to data analysis in qualitative descriptive
studies.4 This has led to criticism of descriptive research being less sophisticated because less interpretation
is required than with other qualitative study designs in which interpretation and explanation are key
characteristics (e.g. phenomenology, grounded theory, case studies).

Diverse approaches to data collection can be utilised in qualitative description studies. However, most
qualitative descriptive studies use semi-structured interviews (see Chapter 13) because they provide a
reliable way to collect data.3 The technique applied to data analysis is generally categorical and less
conceptual when compared to other qualitative research designs (see Section 4).2,3 Hence, this study
design is well suited to research by practitioners, student researchers and policymakers. Its straightforward
approach enables these studies to be conducted in shorter timeframes than other study designs.3
Descriptive studies are common as the qualitative component in mixed-methods research (see Chapter 11)
and evaluations (see Chapter 12),1 because qualitative descriptive studies can provide information to help
develop and refine questionnaires or interventions.

For example, in our research to develop a patient-reported outcome measure for people who had
undergone a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a common cardiac procedure to treat
heart disease, we started by conducting a qualitative descriptive study.5 This project was a large, mixed-
methods study funded by a private health insurer. The entire research process needed to be straightforward
and achievable within a year, as we had engaged an undergraduate student to undertake the research tasks.
The aim of the qualitative component of the mixed-methods study was to identify and explore patients'
perceptions following PCI. We used inductive approaches to collect and analyse the data. The study was
guided by the following domains for the development of patient-reported outcomes, according to US Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, which included:

                Feeling: How the patient feels physically and psychologically after medical intervention
                Function: The patient's mobility and ability to maintain their regular routine
                Evaluation: The patient's overall perception of the success or failure of their procedure

                  and their perception of what contributed to it.5(p458)

We conducted focus groups and interviews, and asked participants three questions related to the FDA
outcome domains:

                From your perspective, what would be considered a successful outcome of the procedure?

         Probing questions: Did the procedure meet your expectations? How do you define whether the
         procedure was successful?

                How did you feel after the procedure?
9 | CHAPTER 5: QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH

         Probing question: How did you feel one week after and how does that compare with how you
         feel now?

                After your procedure, tell me about your ability to do your daily activities?

         Prompt for activities including gardening, housework, personal care, work-related and family-
         related tasks.

         Probing questions: Did you attend cardiac rehabilitation? Can you tell us about your experience
         of cardiac rehabilitation? What impact has medication had on your recovery?

                What, if any, lifestyle changes have you made since your procedure?5(p459)

Data collection was conducted with 32 participants. The themes were mapped to the FDA patient-
reported outcome domains, with the results confirming previous research and also highlighting new areas
for exploration in the development of a new patient-reported outcome measure. For example, participants
reported a lack of confidence following PCI and the importance of patient and doctor communication.
Women, in particular, reported that they wanted doctors to recognise how their experiences of cardiac
symptoms were different to those of men.

The study described phenomena and resulted in the development of a patient-reported outcome measure
that was tested and refined using a discrete-choice experiment survey,6 a pilot of the measure in the
Victorian Cardiac Outcomes Registry and a Rasch analysis to validate the measurement's properties.7

Advantages and disadvantages of qualitative
descriptive studies

A qualitative descriptive study is an effective design for research by practitioners, policymakers and
students, due to their relatively short timeframes and low costs. The researchers can remain close to the
data and the events described, and this can enable the process of analysis to be relatively simple. Qualitative
descriptive studies are also useful in mixed-methods research studies. Some of the advantages of qualitative
descriptive studies have led to criticism of the design approach, due to a lack of engagement with theory
and the lack of interpretation and explanation of the data.2

Summary

Qualitative descriptive studies are gaining popularity in health and social care due to their utility, from
a resource and time perspective, for research by practitioners, policymakers and researchers. Descriptive
studies can be conducted as stand-alone studies or as part of larger, mixed-methods studies.

             Identify the key terms, concepts and approaches used in phenomenology.
             Explain the data collection methods and analysis for phenomenology.
             Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of phenomenological research.

What is phenomenology?

The key concept in phenomenological studies is the individual.
Phenomenology is a method and a philosophical approach, influenced by different paradigms and
disciplines.1
Phenomenology is the everyday world from the viewpoint of the person. In this viewpoint, the emphasis is
on how the individual constructs their lifeworld and seeks to understand the `taken for granted-ness' of life
and experiences.2,3 Phenomenology is a practice that seeks to understand, describe and interpret human
behaviour and the meaning individuals make of their experiences; it focuses on what was experienced and
how it was experienced.4 Phenomenology deals with perceptions or meanings, attitudes and beliefs, as well
as feelings and emotions. The emphasis is on the lived experience and the sense an individual makes of those
experiences. Since the primary source of data is the experience of the individual being studied, in-depth
interviews are the most common means of data collection (see Chapter 13). Depending on the aim and
research questions of the study, the method of analysis is either thematic or interpretive phenomenological
analysis (Section 4).

Types of phenomenology

Descriptive phenomenology (also known as `transcendental phenomenology') was founded by Edmund
Husserl (1859-1938). It focuses on phenomena as perceived by the individual.4 When reflecting on the
                                                                                                                               PHENOMENOLOGY | 14

recent phenomenon of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is clear that there is a collective experience of the
pandemic and an individual experience, in which each person's experience is influenced by their life
circumstances, such as their living situation, employment, education, prior experiences with infectious
diseases and health status. In addition, an individual's life circumstances, personality, coping skills, culture,
family of origin, where they live in the world and the politics of their society also influence their experience
of the pandemic. Hence, the objectiveness of the pandemic is intertwined with the subjectiveness of the
individual living in the pandemic.

Husserl states that descriptive phenomenological inquiry should be free of assumption and theory, to
enable phenomenological reduction (or phenomenological intuiting).1 Phenomenological reduction
means putting aside all judgements or beliefs about the external world and taking nothing for granted in
everyday reality.5 This concept gave rise to a practice called `bracketing' -- a method of acknowledging the
researcher's preconceptions, assumptions, experiences and `knowing' of a phenomenon. Bracketing is an
attempt by the researcher to encounter the phenomenon in as `free and as unprejudiced way as possible
so that it can be precisely described and understood'.1(p132) While there is not much guidance on how
to bracket, the advice provided to researchers is to record in detail the process undertaken, to provide
transparency for others. Bracketing starts with reflection: a helpful practice is for the researcher to ask the
following questions and write their answers as they occur, without overthinking their responses (see Box 1).
This is a practice that ideally should be done multiple times during the research process: at the conception
of the research idea and during design, data collection, analysis and reporting.

       Box 6.1 Examples of bracketing prompts

       How does my education, family background (culture), religion, politics and job relate to this
       topic or phenomenon?
       What is my previous experience of this topic or phenomenon? Do I have negative and/or
       positive reactions to this topic or phenomenon? What has led to this reaction?
       What have I read or understood about this topic or phenomenon?
       What are my beliefs and attitudes about this topic or phenomenon? What assumptions am I
       making?

Interpretive or hermeneutic phenomenology was founded by Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), a junior
colleague of Husserl. It focuses on the nature of being and the relationship between an individual and
their lifeworld. While Heidegger's initial work and thinking aligned with Husserl's, he later challenged
several elements of descriptive phenomenology, leading to a philosophical separation in ideas. Husserl's
descriptive phenomenology takes an epistemological (knowledge) focus while Heidegger's interest was in
ontology4 (the nature of reality), with the key phrase `being-in-the-world' referencing how humans exist,
15 | PHENOMENOLOGY

act or participate in the world.1 In descriptive phenomenology, the practice of bracketing is endorsed and
experience is stripped from context to examine and understand it.

Interpretive or hermeneutic phenomenology embraces the intertwining of an individual's subjective
experience with their social, cultural and political contexts, regardless of whether they are conscious of this
influence.4 Interpretive or hermeneutic phenomenology moves beyond description to the interpretation of
the phenomenon and the study of meanings through the lifeworld of the individual. While the researcher's
knowledge, experience, assumptions and beliefs are valued, they do need to be acknowledged as part of the
process of analysis.4

For example, Singh and colleagues wanted to understand the experiences of managers involved in the
implementation of quality improvement projects in an assisted living facility, and thus they conducted a
hermeneutic phenomenology study.6 The objective was to `understand how managers define the quality
of patient care and administrative processes', alongside an exploration of the participant's perspectives of
leadership and challenges to the implementation of quality improvement strategies.(p3) Semi-structured
interviews (60-75 minutes in duration) were conducted with six managers and data was analysed using
inductive thematic techniques.

New phenomenology, or American phenomenology, has initiated a transition in the focus of
phenomenology from the nature and understanding of the phenomenon to the lived experience of
individuals experiencing the phenomenon. This transition may seem subtle but fundamentally is related
to a shift away from the philosophical approaches of Husserl and Heidegger to an applied approach to
research.1 New phenomenology does not undergo the phenomenological reductionist approach outlined
by Husserl to examine and understand the essence of the phenomenon. Dowling1 emphasises that this
phenomenological reduction, which leads to an attempt to disengage the researcher from the participant,
is not desired or practical in applied research such as in nursing studies. Hence, new phenomenology is
aligned with interpretive phenomenology, embracing the intersubjectivity (shared subjective experiences
between two or more people) of the research approach.1

Another feature of new phenomenology is the positioning of culture in the analysis of an individual's
experience. This is not the case for the traditional phenomenological approaches1; hence, philosophical
approaches by European philosophers Husserl and Heidegger can be used if the objective is to explore
or understand the phenomenon itself or the object of the participant's experience. The methods of new
phenomenology, or American phenomenology, should be applied if the researcher seeks to understand a
person's experience(s) of the phenomenon.1

See Table 6.1. for two different examples of phenomenological research.

Advantages and disadvantages of phenomenological
research

Phenomenology has many advantages, including that it can present authentic accounts of complex
phenomena; it is a humanistic style of research that demonstrates respect for the whole individual; and
the descriptions of experiences can tell an interesting story about the phenomenon and the individuals
experiencing it.7 Criticisms of phenomenology tend to focus on the individuality of the results, which
makes them non-generalisable, considered too subjective and therefore invalid. However, the reason a
researcher may choose a phenomenological approach is to understand the individual, subjective
experiences of an individual; thus, as with many qualitative research designs, the findings will not be
generalisable to a larger population.7,8

Summary

Phenomenology focuses on understanding a phenomenon from the perspective of individual experience
(descriptive and interpretive phenomenology) or from the lived experience of the phenomenon by
individuals (new phenomenology). This individualised focus lends itself to in-depth interviews and small
scale research projects.

             Explain the purpose of an action research approach.
             Explain the action research cycle.
             Describe action research characteristics.

What is action research?

The key concept in action research is change or action.
Action research (also known as `participatory action research') aligns well with the practice of health and
social care because researchers and practitioners in this discipline work with people and communities in
holistic and relational ways to understand the history, culture and context of the setting. Action research
aims to understand the setting and improve it through change or action.1 This method has its roots in
activism and advocacy and is focused on solutions. It is practical and deals with real-world problems and
issues. Action research often undergoes phases in seeking to understand the problem, plan a solution,
implement the solution and then reflect on or evaluate the solution, cyclically and iteratively. Action
research is used in the practice of health and social care because it has two fundamental aims: to improve
and to involve. This chapter outlines how this is evident, using examples from the research literature (see
Table 7.1.).

Action research as involvement

Action research is a collaborative process between researchers and community members. This process is
a core component of action research and represents a significant shift from typical research methods.
Through action research, those who are being researched become the researchers, with close consideration
given to power dynamics. The research participants become partners in the research and are involved
21 | CHAPTER 7: ACTION RESEARCH

in identifying and prioritising the research area, designing and undertaking data collection, conducting
data analysis, and interpreting and disseminating the results.1 The research partners may be provided
with support and training to enable them to undertake these activities and to promote empowerment
and capacity building (see examples following). Patient and public involvement in research and healthcare
improvement (known in Australia as `consumer and community involvement'), has led to action research
gaining popularity as a research design that captures the `living knowledge' with, for and by people and
communities throughout the research journey.

As an example, in the project Relationships Matter for Youth `Aging Out' of Care,2 Doucet and colleagues
aimed to examine relationships that matter to young people in care and how these relationships can
be nurtured and supported over time. The project is a collaborative participatory action research study
incorporating photovoice (see Chapter 17 for more information on photovoice). Eight young people,
formerly in care and from diverse backgrounds, were recruited to the study. The lead researcher highlighted
their own lived experience of the child welfare system and a consciousness of the power dynamics at
play. The lead researcher created processes within the project to ensure the youth co-researchers were
empowered to share their experiences and that the research team members were working with the youth
co-researchers and not for them. These processes included three months of weekly facilitated group
discussions, shared meals before project commencement and group outings and community engagement
during the project to encourage connection, bonding and trust. The youth co-researchers were provided
with photography training and digital cameras. Data collection included the youth co-researchers
submitting 6-7 photographs with responses to the following questions for photo contextualisation:

              1. What does this photograph mean to you? Why is this photo, in particular, most significant
                  to you?

              2. How do you see this photo as a reflection of the issue of supportive long-term
                  relationships - and one that is relevant to you as a former youth in care in your
                  community?

              3. What is the relationship between the content of the photo and how you perceive the
                  community or the world around you? What recommendation for change in your
                  community is associated with this photo?2(para22)

The photographs were showcased at an exhibition that was open to the community; those in attendance
included policymakers, advocates and community representatives. The change documented through this
project was one of social transformation for the community and self-transformation and healing for the
individuals.

Action research as improvement

Action research can be practitioner-led, whereby the study investigates problems identified by the
practitioner with the goal of understanding and improving practice over time. Improvement can be both
                                                                                                             CHAPTER 7: ACTION RESEARCH | 22

social improvement and healthcare improvement. Healthcare improvement, in particular quality (of
healthcare) improvement, has been the focus of clinical practice, research, education and advocacy for more
than 30 years. The two main frameworks guiding healthcare and quality improvement efforts are the Plan,
Do, Study, Act (PDSA) cycle and Learning Health Systems.3 Both of these frameworks lend themselves to
action research. For example, the PDSA cycle is guided by three overarching questions:

                      What are we trying to accomplish?
                      How will we know that a change is an improvement?
                      What change can we make that will result in improvement?4(Figure1)

Learning Health Systems is another approach to quality improvement that has gained popularity over
the past decade. Data collected by health services (e.g. patient data, health records, laboratory results) are
used for knowledge creation in continuous and rapid cycles of study, feedback and practice change.5 A
Learning Health Systems framework incorporates systems science, data science, research methods for real-
world contexts, implementation science, participatory research and quality improvement approaches.

Van Heerden and colleagues adopted an action research study to transform the practice and environment
of neonatal care in the maternity section of a district hospital in South Africa. The study Strategies to
sustain a quality improvement initiative in neonatal resuscitation6 was conducted in three cycles. Cycle 1
was a situation analysis that explored and described the existing practices and factors influencing neonatal
resuscitation and mortality in the hospital through administering questionnaires with nurses (n=69); a
focus group with nine doctors; and an analysis of hospital records. A nominal group discussion (structured
group discussion including prioritisation) was conducted with 10 managers and staff, followed by a
reflective meeting with the project's steering committee. Cycle 2 developed and implemented strategies
to sustain a quality improvement initiative. The strategies addressed training, equipment and stock, staff
attitudes, staff shortages, transport transfer for critically ill neonates, and protocols. Cycle 3 was an
evaluation of change and sustainability after the implementation of strategies (Cycle 2) and involved
the analysis of hospital record data, repeat questionnaire with nurses (n=40), focus group discussion
with 10 doctors, steering committee and management members, followed by reflective meetings with the
steering committee. Qualitative data was analysed through open coding, and quantitative data was analysed
descriptively. The neonatal mortality rate declined (yet still needed to improve) and the implementation
strategies facilitated change that led to improvement and practice transformation.

Action research as a methodology or an approach

There is debate as to whether action research is a methodology or an approach, since several different
research methods and methodologies can be used. For example, multiple forms of data collection can be
utilized, including quantitative data from surveys or medical records, to inform the identification and
understanding of the problem and evaluation of the solution. Action research can also draw on descriptive
qualitative research, quantitative cross-sectional studies, case studies (see Chapter 8), ethnography
23 | CHAPTER 7: ACTION RESEARCH

(Chapter 9) and grounded theory (Chapter 10). Action research can therefore take a purely qualitative
approach, or can take a mixed-methods approach. See Table 7.1. for examples of action research studies.

Advantages and disadvantages of action research

Action research addresses practical problems, drawing on principles of empowerment, capacity-building
and participation. The research problem to be addressed is typically identified by the community, and the
solutions are for the community. The research participants are collaborators in the research process. The
examples presented in this chapter demonstrate how the research collaborators and co-researchers received
training and support to lead elements of the project. Another advantage of action research is that it is a
continuous cycle of development. Hence, the approach is iterative and the full solution can take multiple
cycles and iterations to develop and sustain.7,8

Since action research is fundamentally about relationships and integrating research into the real world,
studies can take years to result in a solution. It is important to be able to adapt and be flexible in response
to community and stakeholder needs and contexts. The research can therefore be constrained by what
is practical and also ethical within the setting. This may limit the scope and scale of the research and
compromise its rigour. Action research can also create unanticipated work for community members and
participants because they are not usually involved in research in this way, and thus training may be required,
as well as remuneration for time and experience.7,8

Why an action research study was implemented This project was initiated by
staff at the YMCA. Hence, it was community initiated and led. The YMCA team
wanted to improve the sports program for forced migrant young people
resettled in their community. The young people were provided with a one-year
free membership; however many families did not renew this after the free
period. The research team believed that an action research approach in which
they worked alongside forced migrant young people would extend to the
young people's family members also benefiting from sports involvement. The
YMCA team had a staff member with lived experience of being an asylum
seeker and the manager knew about YMCA programs that could benefit from
an action research approach. To improve the adoption of telehealth aligned
with the principles of plan do study act (PDSA) quality improvement process.

Phase 1: Qualitative in-depth case study

Phase 2: Action research - researchers worked in partnership with participants
at each site to plan, test and evaluate solutions to telehealth adoption. Study
setting YMCA in Northeastern Ontario, Canada Four community nursing
settings using telehealth to monitor the symptoms of patients with Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and Chronic Health Failure, United
Kingdom Data collection, sampling and participants Relationships between
the research team, YMCA team and young people were developed through
meetings, shared meals, community encounters, Facebook group and visits to
the homes of the young people.

33 forced migrant young people from 15 families became collaborators in the
study. The average age was 13 years.

Get-to-know-you interviews were conducted, incorporating art and
interviewing techniques - `draw any images and/or symbols that meaningfully
depicted personal stories related to playing sport in Canada', which was
followed by interpreting events. The team then co-developed creative
non-fiction polyphonic vignettes - these were shared with the young people
and families and the YMCA and research teams for feedback. Recruitment via
site collaborators and local telehealth champions. All case study participants
were invited to take part in the action research component if interested. 57 staff
(community matrons, nurse specialists, frontline clinical and support staff,
clinical leads and service managers, and other managers) and 1 patient. Total
participants: 58.

Phase 2: Action research component.

Workshop 1 - develop an implementation plan (plan component of the PDSA
cycle). Phase 1 case study findings presented. 3-6 actions were identified.

An Action Inquiry Group (AIG) was established for each action with members
responsible for implementation (DO) and review of progress and learning
(STUDY).

Workshop 2 - review and reflect on work and extend, refine or discontinue the
plan. (ACT) Analysis Reflexive thematic analysis Thematic analysis using
framework analysis Key themes Themes are not presented in this article as it
focuses on the process of the action research project. Seven main action areas
were identified (see subheadings in the article)

Summary
25 | CHAPTER 7: ACTION RESEARCH

Action research is a research design in which researchers and community members work together to
identify problems, design and implement solutions and evaluate the impact of these solutions. Change or
action is a core component of this research design.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:

             Identify the key terms and concepts used in qualitative case study research.
             Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of qualitative case study research.

What is a case study?

The key concept in a case study is context.

In qualitative research, case studies provide in-depth accounts of events, relationships, experiences or
processes. Stemming from the fields of evaluation, political science and law, the aim of a qualitative case
study is to explore a phenomenon within the context of the case1 and to answer how and why research
questions.2 The contextual conditions are relevant to the phenomenon under study and the contextual
factors tend to lie with the case.1 From the outset it is important (a) to determine who or what is your case
- this can be a person, program, organisation or group, or a process - and (b) to articulate the phenomenon
of interest.

An example of why context is important in understanding the phenomenon of interest is a study of health
promotion action by local churches in Victoria, Australia.3 The phenomenon under study was health
promotion action, with 10 churches comprising the cases, which were mapped across the framework of
health promotion approaches.4 The contextual factors included church denomination (Baptist, Church
of Christ, Uniting, Anglican, Catholic and Salvation Army), size (small, medium and large), location
(rural and metropolitan), partnerships with external organisations (government, local schools and social
welfare organisations) and theological orientation (traditional, modern or postmodern), to understand the
phenomenon of health promotion action. Data collection took 12 months and involved interviews with
37 church leaders, 10 focus groups with volunteers, 17 instances of participant observation of church
activities, including church services, youth events, food banks and community meals, and 12 documentary
analyses of church websites, newsletters and annual reports. The case studies identified and illustrated how
27 | CHAPTER 8: CASE STUDY

and why three different expressions of church - traditional, new modern and emerging - led to different
levels and types of health promotion activities.

Three prominent qualitative case study methodologists, Robert Stake, Robert Yin and Sharan Merriams,
have articulated different approaches to case studies and their underpinning philosophical and
paradigmatic assumptions. Table 8 outlines these approaches, based on work by Yazan,5 whose expanded
table covers characteristics of case studies, data collection and analysis.

There are several forms of qualitative case studies.1,2
Discovery-led case studies, which:

   describe what is happening in the setting
                                                                                                                      CHAPTER 8: CASE STUDY | 28

   explore the key issues affecting people within the setting
   compare settings, to learn from the similarities and differences between them.

Theory-led case studies, which:

   explain the causes of events, processes or relationships within a setting
   illustrate how a particular theory applies to a real-life setting
   experiment with changes in the setting to test specific factors or variables.

Single and collective case studies, where:2, 9

   the researcher wants to understand a unique phenomenon in detail- known as an intrinsic case
      study

   the researcher is seeking insight and understanding of a particular situation or phenomenon, known
      as an illustrative case study or instrumental case study.

In both intrinsic, instrumental and illustrative case studies, the exploration might take place within a single
case. In contrast, a collective case study includes multiple individual cases, and the exploration occurs
both within and between cases. Collective case studies may include comparative cases, whereby cases are
sampled to provide points of comparison for either context or the phenomenon. Embedded case studies
are increasingly common within multi-site, randomised controlled trials, where each of the study sites is
considered a case.

Multiple forms of data collection and methods of analysis (e.g. thematic, content, framework and constant
comparative analyses) can be employed, since case studies are characterised by the depth of knowledge
they provide and their nuanced approaches to understanding phenomena within context.2,5 This approach
enables triangulation between data sources (interviews, focus groups, participant observations), researchers
and theory. Refer to Chapter 19 for information about triangulation.

Advantages and disadvantages of qualitative case
studies

Advantages of using a case study approach include the ability to explore the subtleties and intricacies of
complex social situations, and the use of multiple data collection methods and data from multiple sources
within the case, which enables rigour through triangulation. Collective case studies enable comparison and
contrasting within and across cases.

However, it can be challenging to define the boundaries of the case and to gain appropriate access to

Summary

Qualitative case studies provide a study design with diverse methods to examine the contextual factors
relevant to understanding the why and how of a phenomenon within a case. The design incorporates single
case studies and collective cases, which can also be embedded within randomised controlled trials as a form
of process evaluation.

CHAPTER 9: ETHNOGRAPHY

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:

             Identify the key terms and concepts used in ethnography.
             Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of ethnography.

What is ethnography?

The key concept in ethnography is culture.

Ethnography studies emerged from the discipline of anthropology. They aim to understand the meanings
and behaviours associated with the membership of groups, teams, organisations and communities.1 The
focus of ethnographic research is on the lived culture of groups of people; ethnographers have studied
systems of belief, religious frameworks, worldviews and structures that form the social world. There are
many definitions of culture. In ethnography, culture is defined as the group norms and expectations
that allow members of the group to communicate and work together. This includes attributes, beliefs,
customs, behaviours, knowledge, capabilities and habits. Examples of cultural groups include people from
a particular region or race, religious groups, organisational groups, workplaces and social groups (for
example, friendship groups, and mothers groups). Note that culture is dynamic and socially constructed
and it is normal for there to be sub-cultures within cultural groups.2

Multiple methods can be used in ethnographic research, but participant observation is a hallmark
method.1,3 To explore culture requires a `triangulation'; that is, the use of multiple methods, such as
observations and interviews, to develop a comprehensive understanding of culture through observing
people and listening to what they have to say about (or within) the culture.

Several approaches to data analysis lend themselves to ethnography, including the identification, study and
analysis of patterns. The process of analysis follows a typically unstructured and iterative path consisting
33 | CHAPTER 9: ETHNOGRAPHY

of description (describing data), analysis (examining relationships and linkages) and interpretation
(explanations beyond analysis).4

There are other key concepts in ethnographic research, which are outlined below.

Additional key concepts in ethnographic research

   Fieldwork and field notes - the time spent engaging in primary data collection, which is
      predominantly participant observation, and the mode of data collection. Fieldwork is the time spent
      immersed in the culture under study, while field notes are the written reflections, observations and
      ideas documented during or soon after fieldwork.5

   Participant observation - the main method of data collection in ethnography involves the
      researcher participating as a member of the community or culture, to gain first-hand experience of
      daily life in the research setting.5

   An emic perspective - ethnography seeks to understand the worldview of the participant; it thus
      follows that the researcher can have an emic perspective (insider) or an etic perspective (outsider).
      This is not a binary category. Rather, researchers might be considered on a continuum, from emic to
      etic6 (see Chapter 28 for an overview of insider and outsider research), and therefore reflexivity
      (Chapter 30) and researcher positionality (Chapter 28) are important elements of the research
      process. Implementing `insider' ethnography: lessons from the Public Conversations about HIV/
      AIDS project in rural South Africa describes an ethnography project involving insider community
      members and outsider investigators reflecting on the advantages and challenges of this approach.7

   Thick description - the researcher creates detailed observational field notes with references to the
      social actions and behaviours of participants. The field notes include anecdotes, observations about
      the language used and quotes to illustrate the activities of the cultural group being observed. The
      researcher then integrates theoretical frameworks to help create meaning for the observations.8

   Holism - ethnography focuses on studying all aspects of a culture, including religious practices,
      politics, institutions, family structures and cultural traditions. Using the analogy of the structure of
      the human body, Bronislaw Malinowski, one of the founders of the functionalist school of
      anthropology, described survey research as the skeleton and ethnography as the flesh and blood.4

How long researchers spend conducting observations in the field depends on the research question and
context. For example, in research to observe and characterise the behaviours and processes of antimicrobial
decision-making in two surgical units of an acute hospital setting, researchers spent 58 hours in participant
observation at three points of care: pre-admission clinic, surgery and on the ward following surgery. These
three points of care were chosen as key moments in the patient's experience of surgery. The observations
were conducted in an acute hospital where medical practice is process-driven and protocol-driven. Hence,
it did not take extensive time to observe the typical process and protocol in this setting. Researchers used
an observation audit sheet (see Chapter 15) and informed participants that the study was focused on
clinical decision-making, rather than specifically antimicrobial prescribing. This was done to minimise
                                                                                                                  CHAPTER 9: ETHNOGRAPHY | 34

the `Hawthorne effect', whereby people are said to change their behaviour because they know they are
being observed. Following participant observations, six semi-structured interviews were conducted with
two surgeons and four anaesthetists to clarify and discuss the findings of the observations. Interview data
were analysed thematically, using inductive and deductive coding.9

In contrast, an ethnographic study of homecare workers supporting people living with dementia involved
100 hours of participant observations of 16 homecare workers who were supporting 17 people living with
dementia. Interviews were conducted with 82 people, including people living with dementia, family carers,
homecare managers and support staff, homecare workers, and health and social care professionals.10

Advantages and challenges of ethnography

The immersive approach to ethnography enables a nuanced understanding of the cultural group under
study. Unlike other research designs, the prolonged engagement with the research setting provides an
opportunity to refine and iterate research questions leading to a deeper understanding of the phenomenon.
Participant observation provides a first hand of the behaviours and interactions of people within a cultural
group which can be triangulated with interviews and documents to increase the rigour of the research.9

There are many challenges in conducting ethnographic research. The time required to undertake
ethnographic fieldwork can range from short sessions of observations over months or years, to the
researcher living in the community for a period of time. The resources and time required may be
substantial. When a researcher is embedded within a community, their departure can cause anxiety and
distress for both the researcher and the community members. This experience was described by Paolo
Franco, who spent 18 months conducting fieldwork in a retirement village, as a volunteer technology
supporter for the residents. Franco described how the participants became dependent on his technology
service as well as socially and emotionally connected to him as the researcher. To mitigate problems
occurring with a researcher withdraws from a research setting, the researcher should let participants know
as early as possible about their estimated time in the community, and should have a plan for their exit.11

Another key challenge in ethnography is gaining access to `the field' and enlisting the support of
gatekeepers. Careful planning and engagement are required to ensure communication channels are open
and positive relationships are established. Managing ethical conduct is another important consideration
in ethnography. Researchers need to consider how much they will disclose to participants about the
purpose of the research, and whether they will be covert (undercover) or overt (open and transparent)
in their approach to fieldwork. For the most part, researchers are overt about their research, hoping that
participants will `forget' that they are being studied and will revert to natural behaviours.5

Summary

Ethnography focuses on understanding culture and the behaviours, experiences and meanings at the
group level. The main method of data collection is participant observation, which can be combined with
interviews, focus groups and field notes to inform interpretations of the research topic.

             Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of grounded theory research.

What is a grounded theory study?

The key concept of grounded theory is building theory.
Grounded theory studies, developed by Barney Glaser and Anselm Strauss, aim to build theory `from
the ground up' - meaning `from the data'.1,2 For many people, the idea of developing a theory can be
intimidating.3 However, the theories generated from grounded theory studies are rarely grand theories at
the level developed by, for example, philosophers Foucault or Hegel. Rather, the focus is on discovering
concepts that explain social processes, actions and interactions from the collected data.1,2 In health and
social care research, this can typically take the form of a framework or typology.
Since Glaser and Strauss initiated the grounded theory approach in the 1960s, multiple competing methods
have arisen from different ontological and philosophical foundations, which are outlined in Table 10.1.

To ensure that the theory is derived from the data, researchers undertaking Classical or Straussian
Grounded Theory should have no preconceived theories before starting the research - which means they
should not be seeking to test a theory - they should not be constrained by the literature when coding
data and they should not impose prior concepts on the data.3 Grounded theory is therefore inductive -
it generates theory - as opposed to deductive - which tests theory.4 Theories about social processes and
actions should be generated systematically through research, and `discovered' from the data rather than
hypothesised and tested against data.6,2 Hence, grounded theory studies suit research topics in which little
is known about the `how and why' of social processes.5

Multiple forms of data collection can be employed in ground theory studies, with data collection and data
analysis occurring concurrently to inform theory development.1 For example, the researcher may conduct
20 interviews, undertake the analysis and begin to form a theory, and then, based on this theory, develop
an interview guide that will elicit further theoretical development as more data is collected. This process
happens across multiple cycles of data collection; analysis and data collection usually stops when theoretical
                                                                                                         CHAPTER 10: GROUNDED THEORY | 40

saturation is reached.7 Hence, the research is iterative and evolves through the collection and analysis
of data. Theoretical saturation is when all the domains or aspects of the theory have been thoroughly
examined.1 Grounded theory studies can draw on other qualitative designs - for example, a researcher
can conduct a grounded theory phenomenology study or a grounded theory case study. The approach to
analysis is typically the constant comparative approach.1,2

Advantages and disadvantages of grounded theory

The advantages of grounded theory studies include that the researcher is able to be immersed in the data
at a detailed level, and this immersion occurs early in the research process, to enable the constant interplay
between data collection and analysis. The concept of theoretical saturation ensures that the data accounts
for all elements of the theory that is generated. However, the process of theoretical sampling and the
iterative nature of going back and forth between data collection and data analysis can take a long time. In
creating the theory, the context of the social processes may be lost and the overall theory may lack nuance.
Consequently, it can be difficult to scale up the theory to different contexts.4,8-10 Examples of studies
employing grounded theory are shown in Table 10.2.

Each qualitative research design has a unique focus and will elicit different results. Hence, to facilitate the
integration of qualitative research into health and social care, an understanding of these designs and what
they can achieve is needed.

Table S2 presents an overview of considerations for each of the six qualitative study designs covered in
section 2. The first column, on the far left, is a prompting question based on the key concept for the
specific research design, and the answers to this question prompt are mapped to a corresponding research
design (the column on the far right of the table).1,2 The second column indicates the practicalities of data
collection, sample size, and time, resources and expertise required. Note that the sample sizes given are not
prescriptive; they provide a guide or recommendation as to the likely number of participants required; for
example, to inform applications for grants and ethics approval. The final column indicates the appropriate
qualitative research design, based on all of these prior considerations. For more detail on each of the study
designs, please read the corresponding chapter indicated in the final column.

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand the definition of mixed-methods research.
             Identify the three main mixed-methods research designs.
             Articulate an answerable mixed-methods research question.

What is a mixed-methods study?

The key concept in mixed-methods research is combining qualitative and quantitative research designs and
data.
Mixed-methods research requires a purposeful gathering of quantitative and qualitative research methods,
including in data collection, data analysis and interpretation of the results. The main word here is `mixed':
there must be an intentional combining of both research methods to address the research question.
Planned integration of quantitative and qualitative methods enables researchers to answer research
questions that neither quantitative nor qualitative methods could answer on their own. Mixed-methods
research draws on the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative research methods, enabling the
exploration of diverse perspectives and relationships within the two different types of data.1

How does mixed-methods research fit into a research
paradigm?

As described in Chapter 2, a paradigm is a worldview - a framework of beliefs, values and methods.2 There
is some debate about whether research paradigms should be bound to a particular methodology. Paradigm
purists argue that it is impossible for quantitative and qualitative methods to achieve compatibility, due
47 | CHAPTER 11: MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH

to the varying types of research questions that the two methods address.3 This perspective suggests that a
research project should include only quantitative OR only qualitative methods.

However, researchers using mixed methods argue that it is perfectly logical to use different methods within
a single project, blending them as needed to address a particular research question. Many mixed-methods
researchers also highlight that paradigms are socially constructed, and that there is no plausible reason these
constructs cannot exist within mixed-methods research. As such, mixed-methods researchers encourage
other research professionals to consider the evolving relationship between paradigms and methods, in an
ever-changing world.4

Chapter 2 describes the four main research paradigms (positivist or scientific, interpretivist or
constructivist, radical or critical, and post-structural). Most mixed-methods research reflect post-positivist
assumptions, whereby outcomes are perceived to occur based on a combination of factors that interact
with each other, rather than assumed to occur in a linear process of cause and effect between exposure
and outcome.4 The `post' addition to the positivist paradigm reflects further development from its original
concept. Post-positivists maintain the assumption of cause and effect but are willing to identify more
complex and non-linear relationships within the data.

The other paradigm (although it is not one of the main four) that primarily exists in the context of mixed-
methods research is pragmatism. Pragmatism is oriented towards using multiple research methods but
stipulates that the use of these methods should always be guided by existing research problems. Pragmatism
values both objective (quantitative) and subjective (qualitative) knowledge to meet research objectives.4
The main reason for adopting a pragmatist position in research is to enable the researcher to collect and
analyse their data through a pluralistic lens in order to best answer the research question.

What are the mixed-methods research designs?

There are three mixed-methods research designs: convergent, explanatory and exploratory.

   A convergent mixed-methods study seeks to combine qualitative and quantitative results with the
      intention of creating a complete understanding of a particular phenomenon. A convergent mixed-
      methods study may also validate one set of findings against another, such as comparing participants'
      responses on quantitative scales with responses to open-ended qualitative interview questions.

   An explanatory mixed-methods study seeks to explain quantitative results through qualitative
      inquiry.

   An exploratory mixed-methods study seeks to use qualitative results in the development of a
      quantitative component, which is then tested with study participants.

The terminology used to describe the different mixed-methods designs changes from time to time. When
reading an article or textbook written prior to 2021, mixed-methods designs may be referred to as
                                                                                              CHAPTER 11: MIXED-METHODS RESEARCH | 48

For example, in Patient-centred innovation for multimorbidity care: a mixed-methods, randomised trial
and qualitative study of the patients' experience,6 both a randomised trial (quantitative) and interviews
(qualitative) were conducted to address two research aims: (1) to assess the effectiveness of the intervention
in relation to relevant patient-reported outcomes, and (2) to understand what worked and did not work
about the intervention for patients. A one-hour case conference intervention was developed for the
randomised trial, involving a nurse exploring what was important to patients. A planned and coordinated
case conference followed with the patients' healthcare professionals (for example, psychiatrist, social worker

and dietitian) based on this feedback. The nurse, the patient and all relevant health professionals then met
for over an hour to focus on the patient's goals and to co-create a care plan. Outcomes assessed included
self-efficacy in managing chronic disease, health status, quality of life, psychological distress and health
behaviour.

For the qualitative component of this project, semi-structured interviews were conducted, with
purposively selected patients (e.g. by age, sex and type of patient) as the qualitative component of the
research in the trial intervention arm. The researchers analysed the data using thematic analysis.

From a quantitative research perspective, the intervention provided no statistically significant
improvement. However, five themes were identified from the interviews: (1) patients valued the team
developed as part of the intervention, (2) patients felt more supported, (3) receiving a follow-up plan was
helpful, (4) being offered a change in the treatment plan was refreshing, and (5) patients perceived positive
outcomes from the intervention.

Without the qualitative evaluation of this intervention, the trial would have been considered unsuccessful.
Yet, by seeking participant feedback, it became evident that the trial did in fact improve patients' healthcare-
seeking experiences and perceptions, in terms of multimorbidity, in ways not captured through
quantitative measures. The researchers now know what works and what does not work about the
intervention and can use this data to tailor future trials or implementation.

Summary

The three types of mixed-methods research can be conducted across health and social care disciplines, with
a multidisciplinary team. Each type of mixed-methods study has its own strengths and limitations, but all
integrate quantitative and qualitative research methods to develop a thorough picture of the phenomena
under investigation.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Identify the key terms, concepts and approaches used in evaluation.
             Explain the methods of data collection and analysis for evaluations.
             Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different evaluative approaches.

What is evaluation?

There are many definitions of `evaluation'. Mertens and Wilson1 quote from Fournier:
Evaluation is an applied inquiry process for collecting and synthesizing evidence that culminates in
conclusions about the state of affairs, value, merit, worth, significance, or quality of a program, product,
person, policy, proposal, or plan. Conclusions made in evaluations encompass both an empirical aspect
(that something is the case) and a normative aspect (judgement about the value of something). (p6)
Hawe and colleagues provide the following definition of (program) evaluation2:

      ... program evaluation usually involves observing and collecting measures about how a program operates and
      the effects it appears to be having and comparing this to a preset standard or yardstick. (pp6-7)

A more clearer definition, however, is this one from the Better Evaluation website (para1):

      any systematic process to judge merit, worth or significance by combining evidence and values.

Many words are used interchangeably to refer to evaluation, such as `appraise', `review', `assess' and
`interpret'. This is because the definition differs between disciplines and sectors, depending on the aims
and outcomes of what is being evaluated. While evaluation is different to research, it is often considered
similar because the underlying principles of collecting and assessing research evidence are the same.3
The differences and similarities between research and evaluation are outlined extensively on the Better
Evaluation website.
55 | CHAPTER 12: EVALUATION APPROACHES

Approaches to evaluation

Given that evaluation is conducted across many sectors, spanning education, agriculture, community
services, international development, policing and justice, health, and others, it is unsurprising that a
diverse array of evaluation approaches have been developed. Stufflebeam describes 22 program evaluation
approaches in his widely cited monograph.4 These approaches are distinguished by factors such as their
purpose, scope, engagement with stakeholders, methods, timing and applications. In this chapter we focus
on four approaches that are most often used in health and social care (Table 12.1.).

Objectives-based evaluation

Objectives-based evaluation methods are widely used in the education sector and public health. The focus
of this approach is the assessment of whether the program's objectives, which must align with the identified
needs of program participants, are achieved. This approach places strong emphasis on valid measurement
of program effects. It is also referred to as `impact evaluation'.

Program and service managers, funding bodies and researchers usually determine the questions that guide
these evaluations and the appropriate measures to answer them. While experimental or quasi-experimental
methods are not essential to this approach, they are reasonably commonly used in public health to address
questions concerning the causal relationships between interventions (independent variables) and the
achievement of objectives (dependent variables). The objectives-based approach has been criticised for
placing too great an emphasis on a tightly prescribed set of program endpoints, with insufficient attention
to the process of implementing a program. However, the collection of process information is compatible
with the approach, particularly for determining the association between intervention exposure and
outcomes.

Empowerment and participatory evaluation

Empowerment and participatory evaluation is distinguished by the prominent role it gives to program
participants in the evaluation process. Participants must determine the evaluation questions, consistent
with the interests they have in the program, and make decisions about the appropriate methods to use.
Participants may be heavily involved in data collection, analysis and dissemination. The evaluator must
respect participants' choices in all aspects of the inquiry and facilitate and build their capacity to control the
evaluation in their preferred ways. Including program participants in an evaluation can be time consuming
and require additional resources.

The empowerment approach values the rich and diverse insights that participants bring from their lived
experiences, and places greater emphasis on relevance than rigour. One perspective is not regarded as more
`true' than others, and the purpose of the evaluation is not to reach ultimately correct conclusions but
rather to empower participants (especially people who are disenfranchised) and catalyse social change
through raised consciousness.5 Qualitative methods, and participatory action research (see Chapter 7), are
commonly used in empowerment evaluation.
                    CHAPTER 12: EVALUATION APPROACHES | 56

Realist evaluation

The realist evaluation approach has been advanced by Pawson and Tilley. It shares many elements of the
theory of change perspective and is founded on the critical realist paradigm.6 Researchers adopting this
approach maintain that interventions are theories concerning how a set of activities will operate in given
social contexts to bring about change and the achievement of desired objectives. A key role for evaluators,
therefore, is to work with program managers and other stakeholders to ensure the theory of change is
inherent and explicit within a program; this is usually represented as a program logic model, which is used
to guide the evaluation.

The realist evaluation approach is characterised by the purposive sampling of a wide variety of quantitative
and qualitative information to shed light on the generative mechanisms of change that take place in the
program, and the contextual factors that determine whether they are activated or not. The focus on
learning about how change is achieved (rather than the assessment of program effects), together with its
recognition of the critical role of context (defined in the broadest sense) and attention to both intended
and unintended consequences, has made this an appealing approach for the evaluation of complex
interventions.6

Utilisation-focused evaluation

Patton argues that evaluations should be undertaken for specific intended uses.7 A critical role for the
evaluator, therefore, is to undertake an analysis of program stakeholders, to identify the primary users
of the program and to determine the needs and associated questions they have concerning the program.
Utilisation-focused evaluation has a neutral value base in that the approach acknowledges that evaluation
may be undertaken to assess processes, impacts and cost-benefit, to bring about improvement, to generate
knowledge, or for other purposes determined by stakeholders.

The utilisation-focused approach may adopt quantitative, qualitative or mixed methods, and these
decisions are also guided by the interests of stakeholders (all those involved in a program, including those
who develop, deliver and benefit from the program) and their views about the kinds of data that are
credible and useful. The evaluator can facilitate this decision-making by presenting a menu of evaluation
methods to stakeholders and providing expert advice to enable assessment of the utility, validity and
cost-effectiveness of different options. This approach provides a wide ranging set of design options to
stakeholders making it more expensive to conduct than applying a single evaluation design option. As
Patton states, `... by actively involving primary intended users, the evaluator is training users in use,
preparing the groundwork for use, and reinforcing the intended utility of the evaluation every step along
the way' .7(p38)

No single evaluation approach is better than the other, and multiple approaches can be drawn upon within
one evaluation project, depending on the purpose of the evaluation.8

Data-collection methods and analysis

The methods of data collection and analysis rely on correct evaluation designs. Evaluation designs describe
a set of tasks to systematically examine the effects of a program. A good study design creates confidence that
the program caused the observed changes; because there is optimal planning, the best possible measures are
used to assess the impacts of the program, no alternative explanations exist for the results and it is possible
to identify how the program worked on the target population.9

It is not possible to provide an in-depth discussion about evaluation designs here, but they follow the
same principles of research designs used in academic research: observational, quasi-experimental and
experimental. Observational designs do not use control or comparison groups and usually measurements
are taken from one point in time. They include pre-tests and post-tests, time-series designs and case studies.
59 | CHAPTER 12: EVALUATION APPROACHES

Quasi-experimental designs are generally more suited to public health than other types of evaluations,
and aim to use a comparison group. They do not, however, randomly allocate to the groups. Quasi-
experimental designs include reciprocal group design, historical control group design and stepped
intervention design. Experimental study designs expose a group of people to an intervention, and this
group is then compared to a control group that was not exposed to the intervention. The main types
of experimental designs are randomised controlled trials (RCT) and cluster randomised controlled trials
(CRCT).10

Data collection methods (discussed in Section 3) also depend on the level of evaluation being conducted.
The four levels of evaluation are:

   Formative: prior to implementation testing and refinement
   Process: implementation of strategies
   Impact: attainment of objectives
   Outcome: attainment of goals.

Examples of these evaluation levels are outlined in Table 12.2.

Data collection measures rely on the level of evaluation being clearly articulated and planned, with clear
objectives and data collection points identified. The appropriate method of data collection will be the one
that can gather the information necessary to answer the evaluation questions. For example, quantitative
measures and tools are best suited to collecting information about attendance at training programs (surveys
and attendance sheets), but qualitative measures and tools (interviews and focus groups) are best suited to
collecting information about participants' experiences of the training. The evaluator must become familiar
with the program and its goals, so as to choose the most appropriate data-collection methods and tools.

Data analysis follows the same principles as academic data analysis, which are explained in Section 4.
For example, numerical data such as cost, attendance numbers and biometric measures are analysed for
patterns, correlations, cross-tabulations, frequency tables and more. Textual analysis of spoken or written
words can be analysed through content, themes, framework matrices and timelines.

Summary

Evaluation is a discrete area of research yet shares many similarities with research conducted in the health
and social care field. To create well-planned and delivered program evaluations, it is necessary to understand
the approaches, levels and study designs.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand when to use interviews in qualitative research.
             Develop interview questions for an interview guide.
             Understand how to conduct an interview.

What are interviews?

An interviewing method is the most commonly used data collection technique in qualitative research.1 The
purpose of an interview is to explore the experiences, understandings, opinions and motivations of research
participants.2 Interviews are conducted one-on-one with the researcher and the participant. Interviews are
most appropriate when seeking to understand a participant's subjective view of an experience and are also
considered suitable for the exploration of sensitive topics.

What are the different types of interviews?

There are four main types of interviews:

   Key stakeholder: A key stakeholder interview aims to explore one issue in detail with a person of
      interest or importance concerning the research topic.3 Key stakeholder interviews seek the views of
      experts on some cultural, political or health aspects of the community, beyond their personal beliefs
      or actions. An example of a key stakeholder is the Chief Health Officer of Victoria (Australia's
      second-most populous state) who oversaw the world's longest lockdowns in response to the
      COVID-19 pandemic.

   Dyad: A dyad interview aims to explore one issue in a level of detail with a dyad (two people). This
67 | CHAPTER 13: INTERVIEWS

      form of interviewing is used when one participant of the dyad may need some support or is not
      wholly able to articulate themselves (e.g. people with cognitive impairment, or children).
      Independence is acknowledged and the interview is analysed as a unit.4
   Narrative: A narrative interview helps individuals tell their stories, and prioritises their own
      perspectives and experiences using the language that they prefer.5 This type of interview has been
      widely used in social research but is gaining prominence in health research to better understand
      person-centred care, for example, negotiating exercise and food abstinence whilst living with Type 2
      diabetes.6,7
   Life history: A life history interview allows the researcher to explore a person's individual and
      subjective experiences within a history of the time framework.8 Life history interviews challenge the
      researcher to understand how people's current attitudes, behaviours and choices are influenced by
      previous experiences or trauma. Life history interviews have been conducted with Holocaust
      survivors9 and youth who have been forcibly recruited to war.10

Table 13.4 provides a summary of four studies, each adopting one of these types of interviews.

Interviewing techniques

There are two main interview techniques:

   Semi-structured: Semi-structured interviewing aims to explore a few issues in moderate detail, to
      expand the researcher's knowledge at some level.11 Semi-structured interviews give the researcher the
      advantage of remaining reasonably objective while enabling participants to share their perspectives
      and opinions. The researcher should create an interview guide with targeted open questions to direct
      the interview. As examples, semi-structured interviews have been used to extend knowledge of why
      women might gain excess weight during pregnancy,12 and to update guidelines for statin uptake.13

   In-depth: In-depth interviewing aims to explore a person's subjective experiences and feelings about
      a particular topic.14 In-depth interviews are often used to explore emotive (e.g. end-of-life care)15
      and complex (e.g. adolescent pregnancy) topics.16 The researcher should create an interview guide
      with selected open questions to ask of the participant, but the participant should guide the direction
      of the interview more than in a semi-structured setting. In-depth interviews value participants' lived
      experiences and are frequently used in phenomenology studies (as described in Chapter 6).

When to use the different types of interviews

The type of interview a researcher uses should be determined by the study design, the research aims and
objectives, and participant demographics. For example, if conducting a descriptive study, semi-structured
interviews may be the best method of data collection. As explained in Chapter 5, descriptive studies seek to
                                                                                                                     CHAPTER 13: INTERVIEWS | 68

describe phenomena, rather than to explain or interpret the data. A semi-structured interview, which seeks
to expand upon some level of existing knowledge, will likely best facilitate this.

Similarly, if conducting a phenomenological study, in-depth interviews may be the best method of data
collection. As described in Chapter 6, the key concept of phenomenology is the individual. The emphasis
is on the lived experience of that individual and the person's sense-making of those experiences. Therefore,
an in-depth interview is likely best placed to elicit that rich data.

While some interview types are better suited to certain study designs, there are no restrictions on the type of
interview that may be used. For example, semi-structured interviews provide an excellent accompaniment
to trial participation (see Chapter 11 about mixed methods), and key stakeholder interviews, as part of an
action research study, can be used to define priorities, barriers and enablers to implementation.

How do I write my interview questions?

An interview aims to explore the experiences, understandings, opinions and motivations of research
participants. The general rule is that the interviewee should speak for 80 per cent of the interview, and the
interviewer should only be asking questions and clarifying responses, for about 20 per cent of the interview.
This percentage may differ depending on the interview type; for example, a semi-structured interview
involves the researcher asking more questions than in an in-depth interview. Still, to facilitate free-flowing
responses, it is important to use open-ended language to encourage participants to be expansive in their
responses. Examples of open-ended terms include questions that start with `who', `how' and `where'.

The researcher should avoid closed-ended questions that can be answered with yes or no, and limit
conversation. For example, asking a participant `Did you have this experience?' can elicit a simple `yes',
whereas asking them to `Describe your experience', will likely encourage a narrative response. Table 13.1
provides examples of terminology to include and avoid in developing interview questions.

How long should my interview be?

There is no rule about how long an interview should take. Different types of interviews will likely run
for different periods of time, but this also depends on the research question/s and the type of participant.
For example, given that a semi-structured interview is seeking to expand on some previous knowledge, the
interview may need no longer than 30 minutes, or up to one hour. An in-depth interview seeks to explore
a topic in a greater level of detail and therefore, at a minimum, would be expected to last an hour. A dyad
interview may be as short as 15 minutes (e.g. if the dyad is a person with dementia and a family member or
caregiver) or longer, depending on the pairing.

Designing your interview guide

To figure out what questions to ask in an interview guide, the researcher may consult the literature, speak to
experts (including people with lived experience) about the research and draw on their current knowledge.
The topics and questions should be mapped to the research question/s, and the interview guide should
be developed well in advance of commencing data collection. This enables time and opportunity to pilot-
test the interview guide. The pilot interview provides an opportunity to explore the language and clarity
of questions, the order and flow of the guide and to determine whether the instructions are clear to
participants both before and after the interview. It can be beneficial to pilot-test the interview guide
with someone who is not familiar with the research topic, to make sure that the language used is easily
understood (and will be by participants, too). The study design should be used to determine the number
of questions asked and the duration of the interview should guide the extent of the interview guide. The
participant type may also determine the extent of the interview guide; for example, clinicians tend to be
time-poor and therefore shorter, focused interviews are optimal. An interview guide is also likely to be
shorter for a descriptive study than a phenomenological or ethnographic study, given the level of detail
required. Chapter 5 outlined a descriptive study in which participants who had undergone percutaneous
coronary intervention were interviewed. The interview guide consisted of four main questions and
subsequent probing questions, linked to the research questions (see Table 13.2).17
                                                                                                                     CHAPTER 13: INTERVIEWS | 70

It is important to create an interview guide, for the following reasons:
                                                                                                                      CHAPTER 13: INTERVIEWS | 72

   The researcher should be familiar with their research questions.
   Using an interview guide will enable the incorporation of feedback from the piloting process.
   It is difficult to predict how participants will respond to interview questions. They may answer in a

      way that is anticipated or they may provide unanticipated insights that warrant follow-up. An
      interview guide (a physical or digital copy) enables the researcher to note these answers and follow-up
      with appropriate inquiry.
   Participants will likely have provided heterogeneous answers to certain questions. The interview
      guide enables the researcher to note similarities and differences across various interviews, which may
      be important in data analysis.
   Even experienced qualitative researchers get nervous before an interview! The interview guide
      provides a safety net if the researcher forgets their questions or needs to anticipate the next question.

Setting up the interview

In the past, most interviews were conducted in person or by telephone. Emerging technologies promote
easier access to research participation (e.g. by people living in rural or remote communities, or for people
with mobility limitations). Even in metropolitan settings, many interviews are now conducted
electronically (e.g. using videoconferencing platforms). Regardless of your interview setting, it is essential
that the interview environment is comfortable for the participant. This process can begin as soon as
potential participants express interest in your research. Following are some tips from the literature and our
own experiences of leading interviews:

   Answer questions and set clear expectations. Participating in research is not an everyday task.
      People do not necessarily know what to expect during a research interview, and this can be daunting.
      Give people as much information as possible, answer their questions about the research and set clear
      expectations about what the interview will entail and how long it is expected to last. Let them know
      that the interview will be recorded for transcription and analysis purposes. Consider sending the
      interview questions a few days before the interview. This gives people time and space to reflect on
      their experiences, consider their responses to questions and to provide informed consent for their
      participation.

   Consider your setting. If conducting the interview in person, consider the location and room in
      which the interview will be held. For example, if in a participant's home, be mindful of their private
      space. Ask if you should remove your shoes before entering their home. If they offer refreshments
      (which in our experience many participants do), accept it with gratitude if possible. These
      considerations apply beyond the participant's home; if using a room in an office setting, consider
      privacy and confidentiality, accessibility and potential for disruption. Consider the temperature as
      well as the furniture in the room, who may be able to overhear conversations and who may walk past.
      Similarly, if interviewing by phone or online, take time to assess the space, and if in a house or office
      that is not quiet or private, use headphones as needed.

   Build rapport. The research topic may be important to participants from a professional
73 | CHAPTER 13: INTERVIEWS

      perspective, or they may have deep emotional connections to the topic of interest. Regardless of the
      nature of the interview, it is important to remember that participants are being asked to open up to
      an interviewer who is likely to be a stranger. Spend some time with participants before the interview,
      to make sure that they are comfortable. Engage in some general conversation, and ask if they have any
      questions before you start. Remember that it is not a normal part of someone's day to participate in
      research. Make it an enjoyable and/or meaningful experience for them, and it will enhance the data
      that you collect.
   Let participants guide you. Oftentimes, the ways in which researchers and participants describe
      the same phenomena are different. In the interview, reflect the participant's language. Make sure they
      feel heard and that they are willing and comfortable to speak openly about their experiences. For
      example, our research involves talking to older adults about their experience of falls. We noticed early
      in this research that participants did not use the word `fall' but would rather use terms such as `trip',
      `went over' and `stumbled'. As interviewers we adopted the participant's language into our
      questions.
   Listen consistently and express interest. An interview is more complex than a simple question-
      and-answer format. The best interview data comes from participants feeling comfortable and
      confident to share their stories. By the time you are completing the 20th interview, it can be difficult
      to maintain the same level of concentration as with the first interview. Try to stay engaged: nod along
      with your participants, maintain eye contact, murmur in agreement and sympathise where
      warranted.
   The interviewer is both the data collector and the data collection instrument. The data
      received is only as good as the questions asked. In qualitative research, the researcher influences how
      participants answer questions. It is important to remain reflexive and aware of how your language,
      body language and attitude might influence the interview. Being rested and prepared will enhance
      the quality of the questions asked and hence the data collected.
   Avoid excessive use of `why'. It can be challenging for participants to recall why they felt a certain
      way or acted in a particular manner. Try to avoid asking `why' questions too often, and instead adopt
      some of the open language described earlier in the chapter.

After your interview

When you have completed your interview, thank the participant and let them know they can contact
you if they have any questions or follow-up information they would like to provide. If the interview has
covered sensitive topics or the participant has become distressed throughout the interview, make sure that
appropriate referrals and follow-up are provided (see section 6).

Download the recording from your device and make sure it is saved in a secure location that can only be
accessed by people on the approved research team (see Chapters 35 and 36).

It is important to know what to do immediately after each interview is completed. Interviews should be
                                                                                                                      CHAPTER 13: INTERVIEWS | 74

transcribed - that is, reproduced verbatim for data analysis. Transcribing data is an important step in the
process of analysis, but it is very time-consuming; transcribing a 60-minute interview can take up to 8
hours. Data analysis is discussed in Section 4.

Summary

Interviews are the most common data collection technique in qualitative research. There are four main
types of interviews; the one you choose will depend on your research question, aims and objectives. It is
important to formulate open-ended interview questions that are understandable and easy for participants
to answer. Key considerations in setting up the interview will enhance the quality of the data obtained and
the experience of the interview for the participant and the researcher.

CHAPTER 14: FOCUS GROUPS

   Tess Tsindos

     Learning Outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Assess when to use focus groups in qualitative research.
             Develop questions for a focus group guide.
             Understand how to conduct a focus group.

What are focus groups?

Focus groups are convened to discuss an issue of mutual concern. The purpose of a focus group is
to explore the experiences, understandings, opinions or motivations of research participants.1 While
individual interviews explore the experiences of (usually) one participant (see Chapter 13), focus groups
are conducted with three or more people who share an experience or concern. The conversation between
participants in a focus group is mediated and facilitated by the researcher. Focus groups can be used when
little is known about the participants or a topic (an exploratory process), when testing new ideas (e.g.
acceptability of a program or intervention) or when undertaking an evaluation of a service or product.
The focus of the discussion is on the interaction between participants in the group; some participants may
have similar experiences or views, while others have different experiences. The group dynamic is important
and therefore it is important that participants lead the discussion and are encouraged to talk through their
similarities and differences, so that the researcher might gain a well-rounded perspective and account of the
topic. A group might be homogeneous, get along well and share similar experiences. Or the group might
be heterogeneous and have differing opinions and experiences. Participants might know each other because
they have been recruited from the same program or community, or they could be total strangers. All these
elements contribute to the focus of discussion, and to the group dynamic; that is, the interactivity of the
focus group.
                                                                                                                CHAPTER 14: FOCUS GROUPS | 82

How many focus group members should there be?

Ideally, a focus group should include 6-10 participants2 and the conversation should be moderated by the
researcher, using a focus group discussion guide. However, the number of participants may vary according
to the topic and the number of participants able to be recruited. The data collected from focus groups
tends to differ from interview data because people respond and compare their own experiences with those
of others in the group. Therefore, the number and composition of group members influence the data
gathered.

Having too many people in a group means that discussion can become chaotic and it is unlikely that
everyone in the group will have a say. Having too few people means that there may not be sufficient
interaction to enable to capture a group perspective. Focus groups have been conducted with as few as two
people: in a focus group conducted by one of the authors of this chapter, several participants had been
invited, but only two attended. Since participants were difficult to recruit from the target population, it
was not feasible to cancel the focus group. The topic was recovery after percutaneous coronary intervention
(a cardiac procedure). The focus group discussion developed into an intimate conversation between two
older men about their challenges in physical recovery and the psychological effects of not being able to fulfil
a traditional male role. The small group size was serendipitous, in that the researcher may not have been
able to collect such rich data had the group been larger.3

The researcher(s)

It is common to have two researchers present in a focus group. One facilitates the group, while the
other observes and records the session, and takes notes about who said what, body language and other
observable information that contributes to the context of the data being collected. The observer should
be as unobtrusive as possible and not participate in the group discussion. Similar to interviews, focus
groups are audio-recorded so the conversation can be transcribed for analysis. The researcher is encouraged
to build rapport with focus group participants, which is aided by having a friendly and approachable
manner. The focus group method enables the facilitator to probe ideas as they arise and to check their
understanding of participants' responses. This active facilitation enhances the robustness of the data
collected. The quality of the data collected will depend greatly on how effective the researcher is at
facilitating the group, and thus good interpersonal skills are essential. Conducting effective focus group
discussions comes with practice and experience.

How long should a focus group be?

There are no strict rules about how long a focus group should be. Different groups will likely run for
different amounts of time because this depends on the research question/s and the types of group
members. For example, a group of people who know each other and have a common experience may need
83 | CHAPTER 14: FOCUS GROUPS

no longer than 45 minutes, whereas a group of strangers with different experiences may need up to 2 hours.
Additionally, the number of people in the focus group will affect the amount of time needed. A focus
group discussion with 6 participants may likely be shorter than a focus group with 12 participants.

Designing the focus group guide

Before the commencement of a focus group, the researchers need to develop a focus group discussion
guide, which is similar to an interview guide. Both aim to explore the experiences, understandings, opinions
and motivations of participants. If the study's research methods include interviews and focus groups, the
questions will be very similar. The difference is that the focus group discussion guide does not typically
ask questions to elicit individual storytelling, but rather to ask questions to invite discussion of shared
experiences, in which participants confirm or contrast each others' views. If focus groups are the sole data
collection method, the researcher may consult existing literature, speak to experts, including people with
lived experience about the focus of the research, and draw on their knowledge so that the topics and
questions can be mapped to the research question/s.

The focus group guide should be developed well in advance of commencing data collection. This provides
time for the facilitator and the observer to explore together the language and clarity of questions, the
order and flow of the guide, and whether the instructions for participants are clear and comprehensive. To
facilitate free-flowing responses, it is important to use open-ended questions that encourage participants
to be expansive in their responses. Examples of open-ended question formats include those that start with
`who', `how' `tell me more about' and `where'.

Pilot interview/s enable the researchers to test the interview guide. However, they are often not conducted
because it can be difficult to recruit enough relevant participants. Instead, focus group questions might be
reviewed by other members of the research team for clarity and comprehensiveness. The study design will
determine the number of questions asked and the extent of the focus group guide. The target population
may also determine the extent of the focus group guide; for example, clinicians who are time-poor may need
shorter focus groups while patient populations may be interested in exploring their experiences in detail
and at length.

Following is a template that can be adapted for the introduction of a focus group. Table 14.1 offers example
questions for a focus group discussion guide.

Focus group introduction

              `Hi everyone. My name is [insert name] and I'm from [insert organisation]. I am conducting
              [describe study]. Thank you for agreeing to be part of this focus group today. You were invited to
              participate in this focus group because [include reason]. Today we would like to discuss [outline
              topics]. We anticipate that the session will go for approximately [insert expected time].
                                                                                                         CHAPTER 14: FOCUS GROUPS | 84

          Before we get started, I'd like to explain how we would like to structure the discussion.

          1. We would like to hear from everyone present. This may mean that I will call on you by name to
          respond to a question. I may also indicate to you when it's time to wrap up your thoughts so we can
          move on to another person or topic.

          2. Feel free to respond directly to each other. I'm here to facilitate the discussion, but you are
          encouraged to respond to the other participants in this group.

          3. We are recording the session today. This will ensure that we capture everything discussed. Your
          names will not be used in the reporting of this data and we will be using pseudonyms or codes
          instead when writing up results.

          4. Please be respectful of what other participants share. Due to the nature of focus groups, we
          cannot ensure confidentiality, but we do ask that you do not repeat what is discussed in
          this group to people who were not present. You should feel free to not answer a question if you
          don't feel comfortable answering.

          Do you have any questions before we begin?"

Setting up the focus group

In the past, most focus groups were conducted in person. Emerging technologies have enabled the conduct
of focus groups online, using teleconferencing and videoconferencing platforms. While it is more
challenging to conduct a focus group online - primarily because participants' body language is often not
seen - it can be a very useful method of collecting data. The benefits include low cost, greater access to
participants in different locations and time efficiencies.5 Participants who are less inclined to participate
                                                                                                                CHAPTER 14: FOCUS GROUPS | 86

verbally are able to use `chat' functions to contribute their comments. Whether the focus group is face-to-
face or online, the facilitator will need to help participants feel as comfortable as possible and encourage
discussion.

Focus group activities

Focus groups may incorporate activities in addition to, or to aid discussion; for example, sorting and
ranking activities to prioritise topics for discussion in the focus group; or a River of Life6 activity (see
Chapter 18).

Considerations for the conduct of focus groups

Confidentiality should be addressed explicitly; for example, using the Chatham House rule, which sets out
expectations about repeating what is said in a meeting without revealing the identities of who said it or
other participants.7 It is advisable to provide each participant with an explanatory statement to read, which
states that confidentiality is essential to the focus group discussions.

Expectations need to be communicated in advance. Many of the tips for interviews in Chapter 13 apply also
to focus groups, but it is important to communicate the researchers' and the group's expectations upfront.
Some, but not all, of the expectations of focus groups are included in Table 14.2. The facilitator should
explain these expectations before the focus group starts. Table 14.3 provides examples of studies using focus
groups for data collection.

Table 14.2. Dos and don'ts of conducting focus groups

Do                                           Don't

Ideas are encouraged; all ideas are valid.   React to perspectives, experiences or ideas that
                                             are different to your own.

Ensure the group is a judgement-free space.  Vocalise judgements about statements made.

Engage in healthy discussion.                Disrespect group members.
87 | CHAPTER 14: FOCUS GROUPS                    Don't

 Do

Each group member needs to be included -         Allow the loudest group member too much talking
individuals may need to be called on to provide  time; loud group members could be asked not to
their responses.                                 answer a question.

Facilitate free-flowing discussion.              Let group members talk over each other.

Power imbalances. When setting up a focus group, the facilitator should pay strict attention to how
homogenous the group needs to be concerning the topic, and how possible power imbalances might affect
the data collection. For example, if the research question seeks to understand why drug administration
errors occur in hospitals, it would not be a good idea to have doctors, nurses and pharmacists in the same
group. Why? Because they might not feel comfortable expressing views in front of the very people they
have seen make errors. Instead, you could run three separate groups: one with doctors, one with nurses
and another with pharmacists. Conducting separate group discussions helps to avoid the chance that a
powerful group might dominate the discussion and enables each group member to express their views
openly.

Participant identity. The facilitator should invite participants to introduce themselves to other group
members, to encourage familiarity; name tags can help participants remember each other's names. The
researchers will need to maintain a list of participants and any necessary demographic details.

Risk. The possibility of distress or harm occurring must always be considered in a focus group. Participants
may become distressed because sensitive topics are being discussed, and there is always a risk that some
participants might overshare their experiences. The facilitator will need to judge when to stop the
discussion if it becomes clear that one or more participants are distressed.8 Researchers should have a clear
protocol developed that provides advice about how to handle distress.

After the focus group

Once the discussion is concluded, participants should be thanked for their time and contributions. Explain
how participants might contact the researcher if they have any questions or would like to provide the
facilitator with follow-up information. If the focus group has covered sensitive topics or any participants
have become distressed during the discussion, make sure that you spend some time privately with the
participant to provide appropriate referrals and follow-up (see Section 6). Referrals and follow-up are
usually described in the protocol addressing distress.

Data analysis is discussed in Section 4, but it is important to know what to do immediately after each
                                                                                                                CHAPTER 14: FOCUS GROUPS | 88

focus group is completed. Download (or upload) the recording from the audio-recording device to ensure
it is saved in a secure location that can only be accessed by people on the research team (see Chapter
34). The recording should be transcribed; that is, reproduced verbatim, for data coding and analysis. The
transcription of data is an important step in the analysis process, and it is important to note that this is a
highly time-consuming task. Transcribing a 60-minute focus group discussion can take up to 10 hours.

Summary

Focus groups and (individual interviews) are the most common data collection techniques in qualitative
research. The success of a focus group depends on the group composition and the effectiveness of the
facilitator. It is important to formulate open-ended focus group questions that are understandable and easy
for participants to engage with. Setting up the focus group discussion guide, rules and other considerations
will enhance the experience of the focus group for the participant and the researchers, as well as the quality
of the data collected.

CHAPTER 15: PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION

   Darshini Ayton

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Know when to use participant observation in qualitative research.
             Create a participant observation guide.
             Understand how to conduct participant observations.

What is participant observation?

Participant observation is the hallmark data-collection method in ethnography (see Chapter 9).1,2 A major
feature of this method is that the researcher is embedded in the context of the research to conduct
fieldwork, and takes part in the daily life of the group. As an observer, the researcher studies the activities,
events, rituals and interactions of the group or community, or its culture.2 According to Bernard,
`[p]articipant observation... puts you where the action is and lets you collect data... any kind of data that
you want, narratives or numbers'.3(p343)
Participant observation is an umbrella term for methods that include observations, formal and informal
interviewing and the collection of documentary data such as photographs and diaries.1,2 Participant
observation is an appropriate method when the research question seeks to understand group culture,
behaviours, attitudes and the overall human experience of a particular context and in the reality of everyday
life. It provides a holistic understanding of the phenomena under study.2 Participant observation is a
helpful first phase in data collection, and can be helpful in orienting the researcher to the setting, context,
participants and behaviours. Researchers often find that participant observation provides the foundations
for the research questions to be asked, and that this, in turn, informs the development of more structured
data collection, such as interviews.4
In ethnography, participant observation is the main form of data collection and hence it is done intensively
95 | CHAPTER 15: PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION

(see Chapter 9, Table 9.1). However, participant observation can be used in other forms of qualitative
research to complement other forms of data collection. This type of participant observation is less intense.

The key features of participant observation are outlined as follows.

`Insider' viewpoint. The researcher seeks to gain a perspective of the phenomena under study. They might
be an `insider', which gives an emic perspective through shared experiences and membership of the group
of people under study, or an `outsider', which is an etic perspective, or that of a person external to
the group. Hence, the researcher needs to participate in the life of the group to observe and experience
the meanings and interactions of the group, and to explore the meaning of the lifeworld of the group.
Participation by the researcher may be passive or active, depending on their role in the group, which ranges
from marginal (etic) to membership (emic) roles.5

Unstructured data. The researcher may not know what data they might encounter on any given day. While
they may record observations across key dimensions (see Table 15.1), they need to be ready to record
insights, ask questions and listen actively as events, activities and interactions occur.1 When participating
in activities or events, the researcher needs to listen and note (mentally or by writing unobtrusively) what
is being said, and to prompt conversation where appropriate when further information may be relevant to
the research topic.

Field notes. The researcher typically may take short written notes or mental notes while conducting their
observations. Once the researcher exits the field they write up their observations, including where possible
verbatim quotes, key phrases, the number of people who were present, maps of the space and details of
interactions. It is recommended that field notes are written up promptly before details are forgotten.6
Where appropriate, the researcher might use a device to record their observations and transcribe them at a
later stage.

How to undertake participant observation

Know when the phenomenon happens. Before starting participant observation, it is important to know what
and who is to be observed, and when these events, activities, processes and behaviours are likely to occur.
Consider whether it is a one-off event or something that happens regularly, and when, where and how
things may be occurring. Are multiple locations and times relevant? Often, it is best to start broad if unsure
and then to narrow the focus over time as the researcher gains familiarity with the setting, people and
phenomena.4

Gaining access to the setting. How the researcher gains access to the setting of participant observation can
vary. If the researcher is known to the people in the setting, this may be easy to navigate through letters
of permission and consent from leaders. However, if the researcher is an outsider to the setting, they may
need to approach gatekeepers and build relationships with stakeholders before permission may be granted
to enter the setting.6
                                                                                               CHAPTER 15: PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION | 96

Explaining the presence of the researcher. There are three main approaches in terms of explaining what
the research is doing in the research setting. The first is to let everyone in the setting know about the
presence and intention of the observer-researcher. This is known as `overt participant observation'7, which
reduces the risk of running into ethical problems. However, connection, trust and rapport with people in
the setting may take longer to develop because people know that the researcher is there to observe their
behaviours and conversations. In some situations, disclosing to everyone that research is being conducted
may not be practical.4

The second approach, known as `semi-covert participant observation'7 is when the researcher lets some
people know about their presence as an observer-researcher. For example, gatekeepers and leaders at the
setting may be told while others may not know that observations and research are being undertaken. This
poses the risk of people who know about the research disclosing this information to others in the setting,
which in turn can lead to mistrust of the researcher. Ethical issues in this approach are trickier to manage,
particularly regarding informed consent.4

The third approach is when the researcher does not disclose to anyone in the setting that they are
undertaking observations and research; this is `covert participation observation'.7 This approach poses
the highest risk in terms of ethical issues, as people have the reasonable expectation of privacy and
confidentiality, and covert observations may compromise their dignity and wellbeing. The extent to which
covert participant observation is a concern also depends on how public or private the research setting is.
There may also be safety concerns for the researcher, who may be accessing risky settings and may be
required to adopt a persona that goes against their natural tendencies. Hence, the risks and benefits of
covert participant observations need to be well considered. The benefits of covert participant observation
include that the researcher might gain access to a setting that may be off limits for research studies, and the
method reduces the risk of people changing or modifying their behaviours and can therefore reveal the true
nature of behaviours and the phenomenon under study. The researcher can take part in the everyday life of
the setting and experience the phenomenon in the same way as people in the setting.4

How to conduct data collection

Systematically observing and recording observations are key elements of the field notes to be documented
by a researcher. For the novice researcher, it can be overwhelming to figure out what to observe and
how to document these observations. Spradley8 outlined 9 observational dimensions to consider when
undertaking participant observation; these are outlined in Table 15.1.
97 | CHAPTER 15: PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION

Table 15.1. Nine observational dimensions and their
descriptions

Dimension Description

Space    The physical layout of the setting

Actor    Range of people in the setting

Activity Description of the activities that take place in the setting

Object   The physical things that are present in the setting

Act      Single actions people do

Event    Activities that people carry out

Time     The schedule of events or activities that happen

Goal     The purpose of activities or events

Feeling  Emotions that are felt and expressed

DeWalt and DeWalt described 3 components of participant observation2, which are outlined here and are
complementary to the 9 dimensions in Table 15.1.

Mapping the scene - mapping the physical and spatial layout and the social scene, including social
interactions and where interactions take place in the space.2

Counting - recording how many people are in the place in all the situations under observation. Categorise
groups of people and record the counts; for example, how many people are facilitating an activity, how
many children, how many women and how many attendees? How do the counts change throughout the
observation?2

Listening to conversations - attending to what is being said, by whom and when. Recording verbatim,
as much as possible, the conversations that are taking place. The researcher may also casually facilitate some
of these conversations, if appropriate.2

It may be helpful to use Table 15.1 to create a data collection sheet with notes being recorded next to each of
                                                                                               CHAPTER 15: PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION | 98

the dimensions. The unpublished data collection sheet in Figure 15.1 is from a study undertaken in surgical
theatres to understand decision-making on antimicrobial prescribing.9

Figure 15.1 Example of participant observation data collection sheet9
Box 15.1 is an excerpt from field notes from Ayton's PhD research10, which demonstrates how the 9
dimensions are recorded in narrative form. While this may seem lengthy, it provides a detailed description
of the space, the people in the space and their activities. When the researcher re-reads the field notes, a
strong and clear picture will be remembered about the community centre.
99 | CHAPTER 15: PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION

     Box 15.1 Observation excerpt - community centre10

       The red and blue building of the community centre is modern; the space is open and light.
       When I enter the building the reception desk is in front and slightly to the left. The
       receptionist, Nicole, greets everyone who enters and she is always smiling. Cameron, a
       volunteer, is hovering at the entrance, eager to be helpful to those who enter. He has cerebral
       palsy; he wears a neck brace and walks with a limp. Despite it being a cold day, Cameron
       is wearing shorts and a T-shirt. He has a bushy beard and he is difficult to understand,
       communicating in grunts and energetic arm movements. He seems enthusiastic about his
       role as a volunteer and does not leave his post the whole day.
       To the right are four large, comfortable blue chairs and a very big, comfortable, blue velvet,
       L-shaped couch. Cushions are scattered over the couch and chairs. There is a red circular
       carpet and a coffee table with the day's newspapers on it. Next to the couch and against the
       wall, near the entrance to the computer room, is a bookshelf with some books including a
       Bible and a range of Christian books including self-help books and books about the Christian
       faith; none are specific to the Salvation Army. The bookcase also has a shelf of pamphlets
       about health services, upcoming courses and training opportunities, and a variety of health
       promotion materials such as booklets on depression and anxiety, and drug and alcohol
       assistance. On top of the bookshelf is a collection of board games. The atmosphere feels like
       one of a home, a comfortable place to hang out, a place that is open to everyone. The chairs
       all face each other so that no one would be sitting on the outer. When I walk to sit on the
       couch, I feel like I'm entering their circle.
       On the other side of the computer training room, there is a table with Fair Trade tea and
       coffee. There is also a table with two large bowls of fruit. Notice boards are positioned on the
       main walls and these display newspaper articles about the centre, Salvation Army training
       college information, biographies of the officers-in-charge, a poster advertising the street
       soccer program coordinated by the Big Issue and a poster advertising a local drum school.

Advantages and disadvantages of participant
observation

Participant observation provides a holistic perspective of the research setting and people, and the
opportunity for the researcher to experience the everyday life of the group or community. Participant
observation provides a foundation for further enquiry as the researcher is embedded in the research
                                                                                              CHAPTER 15: PARTICIPANT OBSERVATION | 100

context. Hence, the researcher learns the relevant research questions to ask and the potential cultural
implications of the `how' of the research.4 However, there are many challenges, including navigating
the ethical issues of consent and access to the research setting. The time and resources to undertake
participation observation is often extensive and may not be easily covered in research budgets or
timeframes.4 Table 15.2 provides two examples of participant observation in qualitative research.

Summary

Participant observation is a hallmark of ethnography but can also be used in other qualitative research
designs. The aim is to understand group culture and the phenomenon under study. Careful planning
is required for participant observation, to ensure ethical considerations are addressed and processes are
established for gaining access to the research setting and systems for collecting participant observation data.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand the three different typologies of social media research.
             Identify the steps and key considerations in undertaking social media research.
             Articulate the ethical and legal challenges associated with social media research.

What is social media?

Social media are online platforms that allow individuals, communities and organisations to collaborate,
connect, interact and build community by enabling them to create, co-create, modify, share and engage
with user-generated content that is easily accessible.1 Examples of social media include Facebook, Twitter
(now known as X), Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn and Reddit. The global scale and use of social media
are huge: 57 per cent of the world's population uses social media (4.48 billion people) and 99 per cent of
these users access social media by smartphone.2 Social media connectivity is growing: from 2020-2021,
520 million more people joined at least one social media platform.3 Global populations using social media
represent a large and as yet mostly untapped source from which researchers can download, analyse and
interpret data on some of the world's most pressing research agendas.

Types of social media studies

There are no specific study designs for social media research, but researchers have developed three
typologies: extant, elicited and enacted.4 The three typologies are described in more detail below, and Table
16.1 provides examples of social media research based on each typology.

   Extant: Social media research that is extant seeks to use existing data through unobtrusive
                                                                                                 CHAPTER 16: SOCIAL MEDIA RESEARCH | 104

      observation. The key idea is to observe, so there is no direct contact between participants and the
      researcher. Example data types include existing materials such as blog posts, tweets, or Instagram
      photos.4
   Elicited: Social media research that is elicited seeks to use data from participants in response to the
      researcher. The key idea is to interact, so there is interaction between >1 consenting participant and
      the researcher. Example data types include responding to a researcher-initiated blog post, tweet, or
      Instagram photo.4
   Enacted: Social media research that is enacted seeks to use data generated with participants during
      the study. The key idea is to co-develop, so there is collaboration between >1 participant and the
      researcher. Example data types include creative interaction, vignettes, problem-centred or scenario
      interviews using video or text, chat or messaging features. Of note, enacted studies are more likely to
      be mixed methods in design.4

How to undertake a social media study

Given the variability in social media platforms and the type of data that can be collected and analysed, there
are as yet no standard guidelines as to how to conduct a social media study. A mixed-methods framework
designed by Andreotta et al5 enables the collection and analysis of social media data.

Phase 1: Harvest social media and compile a corpus

Researchers can use automated tools to find social media data, extract this data and compile it into a corpus
(a collection of written texts). Researchers might search for content posted in a particular time frame,
containing specific content or posted by users with certain characteristics. This all depends on the research
question and its aims and objectives.

Phase 2: Use data science techniques to compress the corpus along a dimension of relevance

Although researchers may want to examine the entire dataset, it is often more practical to focus on a
subset of the data. Researchers can use data science techniques (e.g. algorithms, topic modelling) or manual
qualitative methods (e.g. by narrowing the search strategy) to identify a representative subset of data to
analyse.

Phase 3: Extract a subset of data from the most relevant spaces of the corpus

Once the data from phase 2 has been identified, researchers can extract the data most relevant for answering
the research question. This may include all data in the compressed corpus, but the researcher may choose
to randomly sample from the corpus if this is too large to analyse. If the data is perceived to be too narrow,
the researcher can revisit phase 2 and adopt a more lenient search strategy.

Phase 4: Perform a qualitative analysis on this corpus of data
105 | CHAPTER 16: SOCIAL MEDIA RESEARCH

The final phase involves performing a qualitative analysis to address the research question, aims and
objectives.

What should be considered before conducting social
media research?

Franz et al have outlined 5 concepts to consider prior to conducting social media research: 6

   Participants: What kinds of participants, if any, will be included in the study? This generally applies
      only to the enacted social media typology. The researcher needs to consider the user characteristics of
      various social media platforms; for example, Facebook users tend to be older than Instagram users.

   Social media platform: There is a plethora of social media platforms, and each contains different
      types of data. Facebook, for example, collects a combination of public and private information about
      individual users. Twitter's advanced search filters can be used to select desired variables and data
      about social media users. Many Instagram users have a `hidden' profile that is inaccessible to
      researchers who are not `friends' with them. Some platforms may also prohibit researchers to use
      their data; the words `no research' may be indicated. When deciding what data is needed to address
      the research question, these factors need to be considered.

   Data analysis: Depending on the size of the dataset, researchers may prefer a manual versus an
      automated approach to coding and data analysis. Content, framework and thematic analysis, as
      described in Chapters 23-25, are methods often used by researchers to analyse social media research
      data.

   Data protection: ReCODE health7 is a US, web-based resource to help navigate ethical issues in
      social media research, which are outlined in the following section.

Ethical and legal challenges associated with social
media research

Several challenges are associated with social media research. To begin with, social media users are generally
unaware that their data could be used by researchers without their knowledge, which raises questions of
informed consent.8 Second, the terms and conditions of social media platforms define the relationship
between the platform and its users, but these legal agreements are often long and complex. It is questionable
as to whether users understand these terms and conditions.9 At the same time, the terms and conditions
of various social media platforms are always changing and will likely also change as the researcher's work is
underway. It is essential to constantly check this information to ensure that the research being undertaken
does not violate these rules.10 At a minimum, it is essential for the researcher to apply for ethical approval
from their institution's ethics committee to conduct a social media study. Such a committee will require
answers to the following questions:
                                                                                                CHAPTER 16: SOCIAL MEDIA RESEARCH | 106

   What action or process has the researcher implemented to ensure that the data used is published by a
      reliable source?

   Is it possible that social media users are the correct age or gender identity for the proposed study, and
      have the conditions, experiences or circumstances stated in their profiles?

   How will the data be extracted from the platform? It is important to be mindful when publishing
      research findings, as it may be possible to reverse-identify individual users.

Advantages and disadvantages of social media
research

There are several strengths and limitations in conducting social media research.

Advantages of social media research include the ability to:

   engage with or gain access to populations that are difficult to access through traditional recruitment
      efforts; for example, highly immunocompromised people, or those living in the most remote
      communities

   gain easy access to a large volume of data that would otherwise take researchers months or years to
      collect themselves

   collect data quickly through search functions on various social media platforms; for example, using
      the advanced search function on Twitter

Disadvantages of social media research include:

   problems in identifying participants - the researcher is never fully able to know who participants are;
      for example, a social media account may be a bot. At the same time, the researcher is never able to
      fully de-identify people either

   users' ability to delete or modify their content
   the highly curated nature of social media - posts are often not truly reflective of people's views and

      perspectives
   the monitoring or prohibition of certain social media platforms in some countries; for example, in

      China and Iran. This limits data collection from some parts of the world. Governments in Australia
      are also poised to ban TikTok from devices issued to staff, which means that obtaining data from
      some populations may also be restricted

111 | CHAPTER 16: SOCIAL MEDIA RESEARCH

Summary

Social media platforms can provide researchers with access to data that can be downloaded, analysed and
interpreted to understand some of the world's most pressing research agendas. There are 3 social media
research typologies: extant, elicited and enacted, each involving varying levels of participant involvement.
There is no definitive method of conducting social media research, and there are several ethical and legal
challenges that researchers need to address.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Know when it is most appropriate to use photovoice in qualitative research.
             Understand the steps involved in conducting a photovoice study.
             Create a study protocol for a photovoice project.

What is photovoice?

Photovoice was first conceptualised in the mid-1990s as a community based, participatory action research
methodology (see Chapter 7). It is grounded in the use of photographs produced by participants.1
Photovoice most often seeks to engage individuals and communities who are underrepresented in research.
It uses visual imagery to understand the subjective experiences of vulnerable and marginalised people,
in order to provide insights into their perspectives and the meanings they make about the world.1
Engagement in the process of photography encourages photovoice participants to critically reflect on the
issues and barriers they are confronted with, both individually and as part of their broader community; the
visual image therefore becomes a symbolic representation of their lived experience.2
In their article first introducing photovoice, Wang and Burris outlined that the three main goals of
photovoice are `(1) to enable people to record and reflect their community's strengths and concerns,
(2) to promote critical dialogue and knowledge about important community issues through large and
small group discussion of photographs, and (3) to reach policymakers.'1(p370) Put simply, photovoice
offers an opportunity to promote critical conversations on the problems or barriers experienced by
underrepresented communities. In doing this, the overarching objective is to build awareness of their
needs, with the intention of advocating for social change at the policy level.
                                                                                                                    CHAPTER 17: PHOTOVOICE | 114

How has photovoice been applied in research?

Early research was primarily conducted within the context of public health and social justice.3 The first

photovoice study sought to explore the reproductive healthcare needs and experiences of women living
in Yunnan, China, to inform local healthcare quality improvement in rural communities.1,4-6 Other early
photovoice studies sought to understand the everyday life conditions of homeless people7, the family
and maternal health concerns of community residents8, and young people's concerns about community
safety and neighbourhood violence.9 Since its conceptualisation by Wang and Burris1, photovoice has been

applied to explore concerns about social justice for underrepresented communities, including research
in education10; civic engagement11; disability and inclusion12; neurodiversity13; indigenous and First
Nations communities14; gerontology and ageing15; mental health16; caregiving17; gender-based violence18;
occupational therapy19; sustainability and climate change20; and its continued use in public health more
broadly.3 Table 17.3 provides an overview of two photovoice studies.

What are the steps involved in conducting a photovoice
study?

Wang outlined nine core steps that are critical in conducting a photovoice study (Table 17.1).6 Since
the first conceptualisation of photovoice, researchers have adapted, condensed and shifted the order of
the steps involved in photovoice projects.21 The importance of continuing consultation with participants
and community members at each stage of photovoice should be emphasised, and the protocol should
be adapted accordingly to their needs.22 Participants in photovoice studies are often referred to as `co-
researchers', to reflect their active role in generating knowledge and directing social change.23

Steps Tasks

6  Distribute cameras to participants and review how to use them.

7  Provide time for participants to take pictures.

8  Meet to discuss photographs.

9  Plan with participants a format to share photographs and stories with policymakers or community leaders.

Step 1: Identifying policymakers

One of the main goals of photovoice is to communicate the lived experiences of underrepresented
communities to policymakers who can mobilise social change.1 Intentional action planning that extends
beyond simple dissemination of research findings is therefore recommended.24 A first step in influencing
social and policy change is to identify a target audience of policymakers who can enact the desired change.6
Although researchers may initially conceptualise a photovoice project with a predetermined topic, and
may also have an existing network of policymakers or a preconceived notion of whom the findings will
reach6, the desired policy change and target audience are best selected and refined with full involvement
of participants throughout the project.25 Examples of policymakers who may be engaged in photovoice
research include key stakeholders working across various levels of government, community service
organisations, health departments or educational institutions.24

Step 2: Recruiting participants

Purposive sampling is recommended as a starting point, to target specific groups who are likely to have the
relevant knowledge, insights and experiences that relate to the research topic.26 It is useful for recruitment
to be coordinated by someone who already has a strong relationship with the community and can approach
potential participants to gauge their interest.25 A sample of 7 to 10 participants is often sufficient6;
however, larger groups may also be recruited.3

Steps 3 and 4: Introducing the methodology and obtaining
informed consent

Introducing the methodology typically involves an initial group `orientation' meeting with the participants,
to provide information about the photovoice methodology.6 Researchers must ensure that they
communicate all aspects of the methodology, with a particular focus on the risks and benefits, intention
to inform policy change and unique ethical considerations in photovoice.27 In communicating these
aspects, the researchers are also seeking informed consent. A broader discussion around obtaining informed
                                                                                                                    CHAPTER 17: PHOTOVOICE | 116

consent can be found in Chapter 30; however, obtaining informed consent in photovoice research also
involves ethical considerations specific to the use of visual imagery, including asking participants to (1)
agree to participate in the research project; (2) give permission for the release of photographs (i.e. by signing
photograph release forms); and (3) obtain consent from others who may appear in photographs (sought by
the participant themselves).28

Step 5: Posing an initial theme

In the initial meeting with participants, researchers should facilitate a discussion to brainstorm concepts
and pose a specific question (or theme) to guide participants in taking their photographs.6 The themes that
guide photography assignments need to be specific enough that they can be captured and represented in
a photograph, yet broad enough that they can capture a diverse range of experiences.25 In this space, the
researcher can also facilitate conversation between participants on what they might want to capture in their
photographs. It is imperative that participants' ideas drive this discussion.

Step 6: Photography instruments and training

Appropriate training (as part of a group or one-on-one) is delivered to participants regarding how exactly
they are going to be taking their photographs.6 Researchers need to consider which photography
instruments to select, based on factors such as their advantages and disadvantages, available resourcing (i.e.
funding) and technological literacy. Participants may be provided with:

   Disposable cameras - they are easy to learn and cost-effective; however, photographs cannot be
      reviewed before being developed.

   Digital cameras - these are reusable for future projects and capture higher-quality photographs
      than disposable cameras, but are more expensive and more complicated to use.

   Personal smart devices - there is no cost to researchers and minimal training is required; however,
      participants from resource-poor communities may not own such devices.

The amount of time spent training participants will vary according to the complexity of the selected
instrument and participants' familiarity with the device. The intention is to provide participants with
training on only the most basic of camera operations, as priority is given to the meaning of the photograph
rather than its quality.

Step 7: Time to take photographs

Once trained, participants are allocated a timeframe to capture their photographs (e.g. 2-3 weeks).6 This
timeframe may be predetermined by the researchers; however, consulting participants to gauge the
feasibility of the chosen timeframe is encouraged. It is also important to set expectations about:
117 | CHAPTER 17: PHOTOVOICE

   Checking in with the participant; that is, whether reminders will be sent, how frequently and in
      what format (e.g. text, email, phone call); offering additional time as needed; and finding out
      whether they are experiencing difficulties.

   Setting a maximum number of photographs to aim for; participants should be advised that only
      a limited number of photographs can be discussed and analysed.

   Sharing photographs and what methods they will use to do this. Participants may share
      photographs in real time (by text or email) or during their follow-up discussion.

Step 8: Discussing photographs

The focus of this step is to elicit the meaning that participants have attributed to their photographs and
to understand the underlying message that they are intending to convey.6 In meeting the second primary
goal of photovoice, researchers facilitate a discussion that encourages interaction between participants,
similar to a focus group (see Chapter 14).1 For example, the researcher might ask, `Did anyone else take a
similar photograph or has anyone had a similar experience to what was just discussed?'. Separate to group
discussion, some participants may prefer semi-structured interviews, but some level of group interaction
is recommended, based on the photovoice methodology. The group dynamic contributes to a shared and
collective representation of the community's lived experience.22

The SHOWeD technique is a commonly adopted line of questioning that researchers use at this stage
(see Table 17.2).29 This technique is applied for each photograph; however, participants may be asked
to select only a small sample depending on the feasibility of discussing all photographs. At this stage,
researchers are also encouraged to elucidate individual experiences by exploring how participants felt about
participating, what they learned about themselves and their wider community, how they have (or will)
apply the knowledge they gained and whether they encountered any challenges.30

SHOWeD Question

D  What can we do about it?

Step 9: Disseminating findings to policymakers

Researchers work closely with participants to develop recommendations to be communicated to
policymakers.25 The desired outcomes can range from improved efforts for advocacy, capacity-building
initiatives, distribution of funding, development of interventions, community resourcing, accessibility
of services and the introduction of new policies.24 Lofton and Grant explored how photovoice studies
have intentionally engaged in action planning, and common methods of dissemination have included
public forums, exhibitions and galleries open to policymakers and the community; presentations to local
organisations; meetings with key stakeholders; presentations at academic conferences; radio or television
events; and social media campaigns.24 It is also important to note that policy change is a time-consuming
process that often requires additional data to adequately support the need for change, and continuing
collaboration is needed between researchers, policymakers and the community following the conclusion of
a project.8

Data analysis

The underlying principles of qualitative data analysis (see Section 4) apply similarly to photovoice studies;
that is, data are transcribed, immersed, coded and themes generated. Visual data can introduce complexities
to the process of analysis, and researchers may use triangulation between photographs, transcripts and
other data sources (e.g. photograph titles, captions, journals, biographies, field notes).31 Capous-Desyllas
and Bromfield sought to develop a practical guide for analysing photovoice data; they proposed that
analysis involves `(1) a within-case analysis of each participant's transcript, (2) a cross-case analysis
comparing all of the participants' transcripts together, and (3) creating visual art to gain a deeper
understanding of the transcript data and corresponding photographs'.31(p4) Depending on feasibility,
resourcing and the target population, researchers may involve participants in codifying the data through
analysis workshops.32

Summary

Photovoice is a community based, participatory action research methodology that uses visual imagery to
understand the subjective, lived experiences of underrepresented communities. The goal of photovoice is
to inform social change through policy reform, by drawing attention to the collective needs and challenges
faced by marginalised groups of people.

CHAPTER 18: RIVER OF LIFE
STORYTELLING

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Know when to use river of life storytelling in qualitative research.
             Create instructions and questions to guide the river of life technique.
             Understand how to facilitate the river of life storytelling technique

What is river of life storytelling?

River of life storytelling is a qualitative research technique that invites a person to consider how they might
represent a particular experience, journey or event, as if it were a river.1,2 The river is used as a metaphor for
the person's journey. It enables them to consider what their river looks like, choose how it twists and turns,
and the features along the river.3,4
This creative technique has a history of use throughout the not-for-profit sector, including youth work,
community development, social care, religious organisations and international development. It is applied
as an interactive tool for deep reflection on people's experiences and events.2-7

What does a river of life diagram look like?

While there is no set format for a river of life diagram, several features will likely be included.1,7 An
illustration of the river itself, whatever shape that takes, is a central feature of the method, along with
features, such as rocks, rapids and waterfalls. Figure 18.1 provides an example river of life diagram.
                                                                                           CHAPTER 18: RIVER OF LIFE STORYTELLING | 124

For more detail about the person's story, it is good to include information about the specific people,
activities and events that occurred, as outlined in Table 18.1. Depending on the purpose of the activity, it
might also be helpful to identify the barriers and enablers they experienced.
The additional features along the river might be presented using drawings, text or images. They can also be
colour-coded to identify items: in Figure 18.1 items about family and friends are shown in orange boxes,
items about crucial events in blue circles, and barriers in black circles. Colour-coding features can make the
diagram easy to read and is helpful for analysis.
Completing a river diagram using an online storyboard program enables the participant or the researcher
to include drawings, text and sticky notes in different colours, along with relevant images.

How does river of life storytelling work?

The river of life storytelling technique can be used differently, depending on the purpose and audience.
The river of life technique has often been conducted in group settings, where each group member draws
a river using pens, pencils and paper to represent their journey.2,3 The technique has been adapted to the
research setting and can be used on its own or integrated as part of a qualitative interview.
This chapter examines three ways to facilitate the river of life technique in qualitative research.

In-person group activity

The river activity is conducted in person, in a group setting. The facilitator explains the purpose and
process of creating a river of life diagram. The group is provided with pens, pencils and paper to create their
diagram.3
125 | CHAPTER 18: RIVER OF LIFE STORYTELLING

The group setting enables participants to interact with each other and to share ideas and experiences. The
facilitator answers questions, provides prompts and encourages and supports each member of the group
to create their river of life diagram, reflecting an experience, journey or event. This type of activity is well
suited to people who can more easily attend an in-person venue and who find it comfortable to share with
others and design their river in a group setting. For example, a group of women from a local community
are invited to explore the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.1

Individual activity

A participant is invited to create a self-directed river of life diagram; they are provided with the instructions
and materials needed to develop the diagram independently.

The self-directed river of life may include sending each participant a pack of materials needed to develop
the diagram, including pens, pencils and paper, and a way to provide the researcher with a copy.

The individual river of life approach gives high autonomy and control to the participant. Still, it does
involve greater responsibility on the part of the participant, to complete the diagram in their own time and
return it to the researcher. A follow-up interview may be conducted with the participant about their river
of life activity at a later date. This type of activity is suited to people who are comfortable following the
instructions and completing their river diagram independently, particularly for participants across different
locations. For example, men across Australia may be invited to reflect on their experience of living with
prostate cancer.8

Facilitated interview activity

Through the facilitated interview activity, the river of life is used more subtly and integrated within a semi-
structured interview. This approach is effective when the in-person or individual options are not suitable or
feasible. It is also useful when there are additional questions the researcher may like to include. Interviews
using this approach can be done in person or by video call or phone.

The facilitated activity is well suited for use with communities who find it difficult to complete the river
diagram individually. This may include people who do not have English as not their first language, or
people less confident in literacy, or people living with a type of cognitive impairment, such as people living
with dementia.9

The river of life prompt questions are asked using an interview-style format. The researcher facilitates
the river diagram during the interview process or shortly afterwards. For the facilitated interview activity,
an online storyboard program can be used to create the diagram based on the guidance and responses
discussed during the interview.

The participant is provided with a copy of the river diagram shortly after the interview and asked to check
                                                                                           CHAPTER 18: RIVER OF LIFE STORYTELLING | 126

it to ensure that the diagram accurately reflects the conversation and their experience, that they are happy
with it and to make any changes or additions.

Conducting river of life storytelling

Once you have decided on the most suitable river of life activity for your purpose, you can begin planning
how to conduct your river of life activity.

Design
Begin writing the prompt questions to guide the river of life activity.1 Writing the prompts is especially
important for the facilitated interview, where you will generally include the prompt questions within the
broader interview questions.

Prompt questions will also be helpful to refer to during the in-person group activity. The prompt questions
can be integrated within the river of life instructions for the individual activity.
Example prompt questions are outlined in Table 18.1.2, 3, 5

Next, you need to write up the instructions to provide to participants, including instructions explaining
the purpose of the activity and how it works.

Facilitate

Remind participants about the purpose and structure of the river of life activity and ask if they have
questions. The activity can be described as a visual way to explore their personal journey, where the river
might change, have obstacles and other features.

Start the river of life discussion by exploring the first part of the river, seeking to tease out the different
elements and features. Some people will be comfortable discussing and drawing their river without much
assistance. Others may need more guidance and prompting. Have the river of life prompts and questions
ready to use as needed.

Those completing the activity without a facilitator will rely on having clear instructions and require an easy
way to return their completed diagram.

Feedback

Once the river diagram is completed, it is vital to confirm with each person that they are happy with their
river and to make any changes they wish to. Seeking feedback is especially important when the researcher
creates the river diagram.

Analyse
127 | CHAPTER 18: RIVER OF LIFE STORYTELLING

Content analysis (as described in Chapter 21) can explore key themes within and across the river of life
diagrams. They may also inform case studies or triangulate with other methods, including qualitative
interviews.

                                      Are there rocks or boulders along the river? (e.g. obstacles and life-altering
                                      moments)
                                      What does the other end of your river look like?

What are the benefits of the river of life storytelling?

The river of life storytelling technique is a creative approach to engage participants in the research process
in a meaningful way. It provides many benefits that differ from other qualitative methods, including:

   a creative and interactive structure for a participant to reflect on their journey. The process subtly
      guides the flow of questions and conversation, beginning at the start of the river (a person's
      experience) and considering all that happens along the way. Prompt questions enable the person to
      reflect on their story from start to finish

   enabling deep reflection about how a person felt throughout their experience by representing
      different emotions as features of the river, such as rocks, rapids and waterfalls2,10

   a supportive process to reflect on experiences that may be difficult to revisit10

The three types of river of life activities described in this chapter enable the researcher to cater for differing
needs, abilities, time availabilities, accessibility and levels of engagement.1

How long does the river of life storytelling take?

The time to complete a river of life story depends on how it is conducted.3 A facilitated river of life
interview usually takes about 60 minutes but will vary according to the number of additional questions in
129 | CHAPTER 18: RIVER OF LIFE STORYTELLING

the process and the detail the person provides in sharing their story. It is important to consider a suitable
duration for the people involved.

Summary

River of life storytelling is an innovative and meaningful technique that engages people in a creative activity
to learn about their experiences. Through the storytelling process, the person reflects on their experience
as though it were a river, and a river diagram is created to represent their journey. The chapter described
three types of river of life storytelling activities, each with strengths and limitations. The type of river of life
activity used will vary depending on your topic, community, location and time available. The river of life
technique is beneficial for encouraging deep reflection and exploring a person's experiences in detail.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe the different types of yarning.
             Discuss key considerations when undertaking yarning.
             Describe the advantages of yarning.
             Identify the challenges of yarning.

What is yarning?

Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars1 have maintained, for decades now, the need for First Nations
representation in the creation of knowledge. Indigenous community viewpoints have historically been
misunderstood, misrepresented in many cases ignored altogether. To achieve greater representation of
Indigenous peoples' live experiences, epistemologies and ontologies, Indigenous research methodologies
are becoming more recognised. Yarning is one of these methodologies. In this chapter, yarning is discussed
in the context of its use by Indigenous and Non-Indigenous researchers who are working with Indigenous
peoples.
Yarning is an Indigenous cultural form of conversation.1 Yarning can involve just two people, or in the
case of a `yarning circle', can involve a group of people. Yarning creates a culturally safe space in which
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants have authority and ownership in the process of sharing
information and places the researcher in the position of the learner.2 Yarning as a research method
privileges Indigenous ways of knowing, drawing on Indigenous ontologies rather than Western social
science ontologies.2, 3 For this reason, when research involves First Peoples, yarning is an effective alternative
to traditionally non-Indigenous formal interview techniques.

    Yarning in a semi-structured interview is an informal and relaxed discussion through which both the
                                                                                                                         CHAPTER 19: YARNING | 132

researcher and participant journey together visiting places and topics of interest relevant to the research study.
    Yarning is a process that requires the researcher to develop and build relationship that is accountable to
                              Indigenous people participating in the research.4(p.38))

The four types of yarning described by Bessarab and Ng'andu1 are described here.

Social yarning - an informal and unstructured conversation with the intent of purposeful exchanges
to build trust and relationship. Social yarning typically precedes research or topic yarning. While social
yarning is led by both the research participant and researcher, it is the responsibility of the researcher to
establish connection through authentic and meaningful interest in the participant's life while also sharing
information about themselves. Points of connection may stem from sharing of community news, advice
and whatever else people feel like sharing that is not related to the topic of the research.1

Research or topic yarning - an unstructured or semi-structured conversation with purpose. The goal of
research or topic yarning is to gather stories from the participant in relation to the topic while maintaining
a relaxed and interactive style of interviewing.1

Collaborative yarning - an unstructured or semi-structured conversation with purpose. A method
whereby two or more people explore research ideas and explanations of new concepts. The yarn may lead
to new understandings and discoveries relevant to the research topic.1

Therapeutic yarning - a conversation in which the participant shares a personal story that includes
memories of trauma or in some way evokes an emotional reaction. The researcher listens and provides
space for the participant to give voice to their story and to make sense of it. Therapeutic yarning is not
counselling; rather, it is the participant making meaning from the process of telling their story. Therapeutic
yarning requires facilitation by a skilled professional who has both clinical and First Peoples cultural
awareness knowledge. Therapeutic yarning can have empowering effects and enable participants to find
meaning from the process of sharing their story and feeling heard.1, 5

The four types of yarning are inter-connected and can all be part of the one yarning session. See Figure 1
in the article `Decolonising Qualitative Research with Respectful, Reciprocal, and Responsible Research
Practice'.3

Yarning is about relational connection with and between and with Indigenous peoples. It is about building
and maintaining trusting relationships. Therefore, in the development phase of any research project,
yarning in research with the Indigenous people or communities the research relates to, should start early,
to ensure that the Indigenous participants are research partners, and have the opportunity to direct the
research purpose, providing insights into local expectations and negotiating roles for the research. Yarning
is flexible, adaptable and diverse, and hence starting the yarn in the early phases of the research is important
in undertaking culturally safe and just research.4

Yarning with Indigenous communities with the purpose to establish an inquiry design was recently
exampled by The Yoorrook Justice Commission, in Victoria, Australia. The Yoorook Justice Commission
133 | CHAPTER 19: YARNING

inquiry, ongoing at the time of writing this chapter, is the first formal truth-telling Commission inquiry
into historical and contemporary systemic injustices committed against Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander peoples living in Victoria. In the period March to June 2022, in order to establish inquiry
approaches, five Commissioners conducted 29 Yarning Circles involving 200 Elders across Victoria. The
purpose of the Yarning Circles is described on page 18 of the interim report6(p18):

  The primary purpose of the Elders' yarning circles was to provide information to Elders about Yoorrook, to
 build trust in Yoorrook's approach, and to hear from Elders their priorities for the Commission's focus in the
  next phase of work. Elders also took the opportunity to share parts of their own experiences or stories of their
  families and ancestors. Many expressed frustrations with, and cynicism towards, prior government efforts

    and official inquiries, noting that nothing had changed as a result. Many Elders had questions about
Yoorrook, such as how it would be different, or expressed concern about how it is distinct from the First Peoples'

  Assembly of Victoria or government. These meetings were a powerful source of ideas and information that
                            have informed and will continue to guide Yoorrook's work.

Key considerations in yarning

   All research that concerns or impacts Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in any way should
      align with the principles of the AIATSIS Code of Ethics for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
      Research.7

   Many of the logistics and practicalities of running yarning sessions should be discussed in
      partnership and collaboration with Traditional Owners and Elders of the community. This includes
      determining who is appropriate to facilitate the yarning sessions; for example, someone within the
      community, a First Nations person external to the community or a non-Indigenous person, and the
      appropriate customs and protocols to follow. Payment for running the yarning sessions and
      participating in the yarning should also be discussed with Elders and incorporated into the research
      protocol.

   Before a researcher commences yarning, ways of providing a feedback loop for sharing research
      findings with the participating community, and especially the individuals who participated in the
      yarning, should be discussed and planned. When the yarning has finished and the research findings
      have been generated, this feedback loop should be enacted to ensure that the researchers'
      interpretations and understandings accord with those of the individual and community participants.
      This process can mitigate against non-First Nations peoples' worldviews being applied
      inappropriately to First Nations' ways of knowing and being.

   The use of culturally appropriate and respectful language is essential. There is great diversity across
      Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia, and thus there is no single
      Indigenous identity. Consultation with Traditional Owners, Elders and community members is vital
      in ensuring that the preferences of the people involved are respected. Researchers should recognise
      that First Nations languages are firstly oral, and hence when written the language needs to reflect the
      spellings of local traditional owners, elders and community members. Language needs to be specific
                                                                                                                         CHAPTER 19: YARNING | 134

      and strengths-based (focus on abilities, knowledge and capacities rather than what is lacking or
      deficits). If you are not sure, ask; for example, different individuals and communities may prefer to
      be named as Indigenous, Aboriginal, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander, First Peoples or First
      Nations. The Australian Government's Style Manual8 provides a good starting point for researchers
      to orient themselves to culturally appropriate and respectful language when writing with, for or
      about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples; however, it cannot take the place of meaningful
      consultation.
   When writing up yarning results, the elders and community members should be acknowledged in
      the report's credits. Researchers should ensure they are quoting yarning participants with
      appropriate credits, including their names and Country, to demonstrate that the knowledge came
      from them and not from the researcher. The project report More Than Personal Communication:
      Templates for Citing Indigenous Elders and Knowledge Keepers provides guidance on how to
      appropriately acknowledge Indigenous participants.9
   Be mindful of the principles of Indigenous data sovereignty - contributions by Indigenous people
      are not just data, they are stories. The principles can be found on the webpage of Maiam Nayri
      Wingara Communique.10 These principles assert that control and accountability of the data rests
      with First Peoples and as such data should be contextualised and made accessible at an individual and
      community level. This approach is consistent with principles of self-determination. Culturally
      informed data management should be considered to be a process of protecting and respecting
      individual and collective interests. People who participate in one-to-one yarning sessions or yarning
      circles should be given the opportunity to indicate how they wanted their stories used, whether they
      wanted to be named and be informed of any other relevant contextual factors. This process will
      uphold the participants' rights to their stories.
   First Nations peoples worldwide are over-researched, with research done to and on them rather than
      for and with them. Therefore, it is important that researchers work with First Nations communities,
      and that the research is initiated and led by the participating community, to ensure that it will be
      relevant and of benefit to the community. Community-Led Research - Walking New Pathways
      Together, by Rawlings, Flexner and Riley, provides guidance on how to build relationships and
      collaboration with communities, and the appropriate protocols.11

Advantages and challenges of yarning

Yarning fosters connection, establishes trust and enables the researcher to explore the research topic in
great detail. Yarning is an Indigenous way of doing things and recognises the importance of relationship,
responsibility and accountability, to create cultural safety in partnership with the people who participate
in the research.1, 4 A challenge of yarning is managing time. The unstructured nature of yarning, focus on
relationship and rapport-building and the researcher being the listener, can lead to an endless discussion.
Negotiating the time expectations for the research or topic yarn with participants through social yarning
can help to address this challenge.1

Summary

Yarning is a First Nations research method for sharing knowledge and is built on a foundation of
relationship and collaboration. Yarning should be initiated and led by the participating community so that
the research can be of benefit to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Working with Traditional
Owners and Elders will help to ensure that the process of yarning is culturally appropriate and respectful,
and recognises the diversity in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe coding.
             Describe inductive and deductive qualitative coding.
             Understand how to conduct qualitative coding.

What is coding?

Coding is a process whereby the researcher applies a label to describe the meaning of text and is the first
step in qualitative analysis. It is important to be clear about the terminology used in coding and analysis.
Erlingsson and Brysiewicz1 have provided the following succinct definitions, which can help the researcher
understand the three different, commonly used terms:

   Code - a label, a name (or tag) that describes the meaning of the text, usually in one or two words. It
      is about the meaning, not only the words in the transcript.

   Category - active grouping or organisation of codes that are related to each other through content
      or context. A category answers questions about who, what, when or where. Category names should
      be factual and short. Codes can be grouped into subcategories and then moved into broader
      categories.

   Theme - expresses the underlying meaning across categories. A theme is interpreted from the codes,
      categories and context or meaning of the transcript. It answers the questions why, how, in what way
      or by what means. Poetic and metaphoric language can be used; a theme is descriptive and uses verbs,
      adverbs and adjectives. A theme is more a statement than simply a word.
                                CHAPTER 20: CODING APPROACHES | 140

Deductive and inductive coding

There are two primary methods of coding: deductive and inductive.2 Deductive coding begins with a
set of pre-established codes, which the researcher applies to the data set (e.g., interview transcripts).
Deductive coding is more descriptive than interpretive, and is most often used for content analysis (see
Chapter 21). For example, in a study about `falls', a researcher asked participants for their perceptions and
experiences of falls, whether they believed falls were a problem, and to what extent they are a problem. One
participant stated:

Answer: I think they're an unsolved problem. I think they're something that we
certainly need to manage better, and that's not unique to [Hospital], it's across the
globe. And I don't think that we've paid enough attention to it in the past. And I
think we can learn from experiences, for instance, bacteraemia where there's been a
focus on prevention that's worked so greatly. And then when we think about where
we were 10/15 years ago with that, where we just more or less accepted that there's
going to be bacteraemia and people would be sick from them and die from them. And
so I think falls is in that bracket now, where we need to put that concentrated effort
into it. They should be preventable. We shouldn't have them. We need to implement
multiple, I think, projects or processes to prevent them. And I think you're correct,
there are many different types of patients, different environments, different type of
buildings, different equipment available, that makes it fairly unique in each situation
and in each ward even.

 (Anonymous participant in unpublished falls study dataset collected by the authors)

The following are some of the deductive codes that could be generated from this answer. Remember
that deductive codes come from the interview guide and prompts, and may also be also based on the
literature. These are the codes the researcher is actively looking for in the data, rather than the codes that
the researcher finds from the data (inductive).

 Attitudes or perceptions
 Unsolved problem
 Learn from past lessons
 Need to manage
 Preventable
 Ward layout
 Patient characteristics
 Access to resources.

Dacillo et al provided another good example of deductive coding. They examined `videoconferencing
fatigue and its relationship with online student engagement (OSE) during the COVID-19 pandemic'.3(p1)

The study examined existing concepts or ideas, informed by pre-existing theory - the surface meaning
141 | CHAPTER 20: CODING APPROACHES

of their data. Dacillo's first objective followed a deductive process because the themes had already been
identified from the literature and the scale used (the five domains of videoconferencing).

Inductive coding works the opposite way to deductive coding. Codes are created based on what is revealed
in the data set (e.g. interview transcripts). For example, inductive coding explores meanings and issues
raised by the participant, such as fear of dying from falling, or the unique nature of each fall across the
world. Inductive coding is more interpretive than deductive coding, and often leads to the development
of new theories. Inductive coding can be used in thematic analysis and framework analysis (see Chapter
22), and in grounded theory (see Chapter 25) as open, axial and selective coding. For a good example
of inductive coding, refer to Wang et al.4 Wang et al explored `the effects of initial contact with the
clinical learning environment on first-year nursing students' empathy levels and perceptions of professional
identity'.4(p1) Diary recordings about their clinical learning experiences were collected and a thematic
analysis was conducted on the content regarding professional identity in nursing students' diaries. Based on
the framework of grounded theory (see Chapter 25), the researchers adopted an inductive thematic analysis
approach developed by Braun and Clarke.3 Wang discovered that first-year nursing students' initial contact
with the clinical learning environment helped them to enhance empathy and shape professional identity.
Returning to Dacillo et al3, their second objective followed an inductive process because the themes were
formed on the basis of emergent, lower-level concepts gleaned from the narratives.

Nearly everything mentioned in an interview can be coded, including but not limited to:

   setting and context
   definition of situation
   perspectives
   ways of thinking about people and objects
   process
   activities
   actions
   events
   conditions
   consequences
   strategies
   relationship and social structure
   meanings.

How to code

Before commencing coding, the researcher must accept that they are the data analysis tool. Because
qualitative data analysis is subjective and inductive, the way the researcher sees the world will influence how
data will be collected and interpreted. To ensure accurate coding, the researcher needs to acknowledge their
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 20: CODING APPROACHES | 142

own influences, such as education, gender identity, social class, professional role, preconceptions, ethnicity,
and many more.

It is advisable to create a coding guide, which can be developed prior to data analysis, based on a literature
review. The coding approach can also evolve through the process of coding. Codes can be factual (content
analysis) or interpretive (thematic analysis or grounded theory). The coding guide will have names for
codes, categories and themes. These names can come from the researcher, the participants and/or the
literature. Most often, the researcher comes up with terms, concepts and categories that reflect what they
`see' in the data.

Coding can vary depending on the approach to data analysis. Coding for content analysis is most often
deductive and categorical. Coding for thematic analysis5 and grounded theory are most often inductive,
deductive, matrix and charting, open, axial and selective coding (see chapters 22 and 25). Thematic and
grounded theory coding entails examining the text for codes that are discovered in the data. Table 20.1
provides some examples of various types of coding.

Creswell10 developed a figure on page 244 of his book to demonstrate the coding process. While Creswell
demonstrates these steps as a linear process, in fact they do go back and forth to refine codes, categories
and themes. He commences the process by reading the text data and then dividing the text into as many
segments of information as possible. Then codes are assigned to the segments, the codes are reduced, and
finally codes are collapsed into themes. He presents a linear process that commences with many pages of
texts and ends with everything reduced to five to seven themes. Refer to his book for the figure.

It is advisable to create a coding guide that can be developed prior to analysis, based on a literature review.
Codes can be factual (content analysis) or interpretive (thematic analysis/grounded theory).

Coding can also be thought of as a simple, 3-step process involving deconstruction and reconstruction of
text.

Step 1: Deconstruction, or fragmentation2

Deconstruction begins by assigning a code word or phrase that accurately describes the meaning of the text
segment. Then line-by-line coding is conducted, first in theoretical research (grounded theory, framework)
or segmentation (applied thematic analysis). More general coding involving larger segments of text is
adequate for practical research. Deconstruction breaks down data and reconceptualises it, and makes
145 | CHAPTER 20: CODING APPROACHES

comparisons between events, actions and interactions. Then conceptual labels are applied, and these are
grouped into categories. Initial relationships between categories are developed.

Clustering is undertaken as the next action. After coding text, a list of all code words is developed,
whereby similar codes are brought together (clustered) and redundant codes are reviewed. The objective of
clustering is to reduce the long list of codes to a smaller, more manageable number (perhaps 25-30 codes).

The researcher should be looking for key phrases. Are there phrases that make some sense but are not
necessarily describable? People often circle through the same ideas in their answers: are there topics that
occur and recur? Are there local or common terms that are used in unfamiliar ways (e.g. `women's troubles',
`bad blood', or `difficulties')? Are metaphors or idioms used (e.g. `rock-solid marriage' or `cooking with
gas')? If yes, what do they represent?

Step 2: Reconstruction

Reconstruction involves specifying more rigorous codes than in the first step. Data is combined (put back
together) to demonstrate new ways of making connections between a category and subcategories. Table
20.2 demonstrates the code-to-category reconstruction.

Table 20.2. Interconnecting the data

 Deconstruction: code Reconstruction: category
 Attitudes or perceptions Barriers or challenges to falls prevention

  Ward layout
  Patient characteristics
  Access to resources

Step 3: Grouping

Grouping brings categories into a core category that is built from a core code. This is a point of theoretical
integration, used in selective or theoretical coding with grounded theory. The story is built from categories.

After you have created codes and categorised them, you have come to the end of the coding process. After
this process, you move on to creating and naming themes, and then describe the approach to the analysis
(see chapters 21-25).

Summary

Coding is a process of assigning labels to text. Coding can be inductive or deductive. Each coding approach
                                                                                                     CHAPTER 20: CODING APPROACHES | 146

has its own techniques but should be chosen on the basis of the researchers' approach to analysing their
data.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe the three types of qualitative content analysis.
             Understand how to conduct the three types of qualitative content analysis.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of each type of qualitative content analysis.

What is content analysis?

Content analysis is a widely used qualitative research technique to systematically classify codes and identify
themes or patterns within the data.1 Content analysis goes beyond counting words; it can be used to
examine data and to organise large amounts of text into an efficient number of categories that represent
similar meanings.2 This textual data can be derived from the transcripts of interviews or focus groups, from
the researcher's notes taken during participant observation, from documents such as medical or policy
guidelines, or from free-text responses to open-ended survey questions. There are three types of content
analysis, which are explored in this chapter1:

   Conventional - the inductive creation of descriptive categories (i.e. categories are not predefined)
   Directed - the deductive creation of descriptive categories using a structured approach (i.e.

      categories may be predefined if analysing data within an existing framework)
   Summative - the identification and quantification of words or content in the text, which aims to

      understand the contextual use of words or content, and to explore their usage.

Conventional content analysis

Conventional content analysis is used when existing theory or research literature on a phenomenon is
                                                                                                         CHAPTER 21: CONTENT ANALYSIS | 148

limited.1 Researchers should avoid using preconceived codes, instead allowing the codes and names for
codes to inductively arise from the data through the following steps:

   The researcher should be immersed in the data, to enable new insights to emerge. This might include
      reading all interview and/or focus group transcripts, or the field notes from a participant observation
      project. This enables the researcher to obtain a sense of the whole dataset. Notes can be made on the
      transcripts at this time.

   Once the researcher has read the dataset as a whole, the data should be read closely, sentence by
      sentence, to inductively capture key thoughts or initial concepts.

   The researcher should approach each of these sentences by making notes of their first impressions,
      thoughts and initial direction for analysis.

   As this process continues, potential categories should emerge that are reflective of more than one
      thought. These should be present directly within the text and become the initial coding scheme.

   Codes should be sorted into categories, based on how the categories are related and linked.
      Depending on the relationships between categories, researchers can choose to combine categories or
      organise them into a smaller number of subcategories.

   Definitions for each category, subcategory, and code should be developed.
   To prepare for reporting the findings, example quotes for each of the codes and category definitions

      should be identified from the data.
   Depending on the study's aims and objectives, researchers might decide to explore further

      relationships between categories.
   Before writing up results, the researcher should check the alignment of codes, categories and quotes.

Example of conventional content analysis

Heydari et al3 used conventional content analysis to better understand home-based palliative care for
people with terminal cancer. The researchers collected data through 17 semi-structured interviews and one
focus group with 8 participants. They describe reading the transcripts several times, extracting initial codes
and merging codes to form categories based on their similarities, before attributing quotes to the categories.
Two main categories (challenges and opportunities) and 10 subcategories were identified.

Directed content analysis

Sometimes, existing theory or prior research exists about a phenomenon that is incomplete or would
benefit from further description.4 In this instance, the researcher should choose to conduct a directed
content analysis.5 Directed content analysis is used to validate or extend conceptually a theoretical
framework or theory. For example, researchers used Watson's Human Caring Theory to analyse healthcare
workers' perspectives on human caring6, and the Information Motivation Behavioural skills model was
used to better understand adherence to antiretroviral therapy.7 Directed content analysis provides a more
structured process for data analysis than the conventional approach, through the following steps:
149 | CHAPTER 21: CONTENT ANALYSIS

   Using existing theory or prior research, the researchers begin by identifying key concepts as initial
      coding categories.

   Next, operational definitions for each category are determined using the theory.
   The researcher reads their data as a whole and highlights all text that on first impression appear to

      represent an aspect of the theory. This provides some reassurance that the researcher has captured all
      possible occurrences of a phenomenon.
   The researcher codes the highlighted passages using the predetermined codes from the selected
      theory.
   Any text that cannot be categorised with the initial coding scheme can be given a new code and used
      to provide new insight into the original theory or prior research.
   The findings from a directed content analysis offer supporting and non-supporting evidence for a
      theory. This evidence can be presented by showing codes with example quotes, and by providing
      descriptive evidence.

Example of directed content analysis

Purkey et al8 used the Life Course theory to understand and imagine public health and policy responses
to the multiple and varied impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on different groups. Data was collected
through participant-offered short stories and key informant interviews. The data was analysed using
directed content analysis; transcripts were read and coded according to definitions outlined in the Life
Course theory, which was identified as a theory with sufficient complexity to illustrate many of the impacts
of COVID-19. The Life Course theory is described by three constructs: (1) timing (related to cohort
effect and period effect), (2) trajectories (related to social pathways, transitions and turning points) and (3)
broader principles through which any impact can be examined (related to life span development, agency,
time and place, timing, and linked lives).

Summative content analysis

Researchers using summative content analysis start by identifying and quantifying certain words or
content in the data to understand the contextual use of the words. This quantification is not designed to
infer meaning, but rather to explore the usage and frequency of content.9

In a summative approach to content analysis, the researchers begin by searching the dataset for occurrences
of the identified words (this can be done manually or using assistive software). The word frequency for
each identified word is calculated, with the context also noted (e.g. the participant providing that data, or
the setting in which it was provided). Counting is used to identify patterns in the data and to contextualise
the codes. This enables interpretation of the context associated with the use of the word or phrase.1

Example of summative content analysis

Bender et al10 aimed to characterise the purpose, use and creators of Facebook groups related to breast
                                                                                                         CHAPTER 21: CONTENT ANALYSIS | 150

cancer. The researchers began by analysing the content of the first 100 Facebook groups to develop a
coding and classification scheme that could be applied to the entire set. This step led to the identification
of four main codes within which to categorise posts: (1) fundraising groups, (2) awareness-raising groups,
(3) support groups and (4) promote-a-site groups. The majority of posts related to fundraising (44.7%),
followed by awareness (38.1%). Through a summative content analysis, the researchers were able to learn
how Facebook is used to promote support for breast cancer.

Advantages and disadvantages of content analysis

Conventional content analysis

Advantages

   The ability to gain information directly from study participants without imposing preconceived
      categories

   The establishment of data credibility through activities such as triangulation, negative case analysis
      and member checking

Disadvantages

   There is potential for incomplete understanding of the context of the data, leading to codes that do
      not accurately represent the data

   This method of analysis can be easily confused with other qualitative methods that share similar
      analytical approaches

Directed content analysis

Advantage

   Existing theories can be supported and extended.

Disadvantages

   Researchers may approach the data with an informed yet visible bias based on the framework or
      theory that is being used. As a result, they may be more likely to find evidence that is supportive of,
      rather than non-supportive, of a particular theory

   An overemphasis on the theory can limit researchers' understanding of contextual aspects of the
      phenomenon

Summative content analysis
151 | CHAPTER 21: CONTENT ANALYSIS

Advantages

   A simple and systematic way to study the phenomenon of interest
   Provides basic insights into how words are used

Disadvantage

   Limited by inattention to the broader meanings present in the data

Summary

Content analysis is a widely used qualitative research technique to systematically classify codes and identify
categories or patterns within the data. There are three types of content analysis: conventional, directed and
summative. These three types cover the spectrum of content analysis, from inductive (conventional) to
deductive (directed and summative) techniques. Each type of content analysis has its own advantages and
disadvantages, but should be chosen based on the researchers' aims and objectives.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe the different approaches to thematic analysis.
             Understand how to conduct the three types of thematic analysis.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of each type of thematic analysis.

What is thematic analysis?

Thematic analysis is a common method used in the analysis of qualitative data to identify, analyse and
interpret meaning through a systematic process of generating codes (see Chapter 20) that leads to the
development of themes.1 Thematic analysis requires the active engagement of the researcher with the data,
in a process of sorting, categorising and interpretation.1 Thematic analysis is exploratory analysis whereby
codes are not predetermined and are data-derived, usually from primary sources of data (e,g, interviews
and focus groups). This is in contrast to themes generated through directed or summative content analysis,
which is considered confirmatory hypothesis-driven analysis, with predetermined codes typically generated
from a hypothesis (see Chapter 21).2 There are many forms of thematic analysis. Hence, it is important
to treat thematic analysis as one of many methods of analysis, and to justify the approach on the basis of
the research question and pragmatic considerations such as resources, time and audience. The three main
forms of thematic analysis used in health and social care research, discussed in this chapter, are:

   Applied thematic analysis
   Framework analysis
   Reflexive thematic analysis.
                                                                 CHAPTER 22: THEMATIC ANALYSIS | 154

Applied thematic analysis

This involves multiple, inductive analytic techniques designed to identify and examine themes from textual
data in a way that is transparent and credible, drawing from a broad range of theoretical and
methodological perspectives. It focuses on presenting the stories of participants as accurately and
comprehensively as possible. Applied thematic analysis mixes a bit of everything: grounded theory,
positivism, interpretivism and phenomenology.2

                Applied thematic analysis borrows what we feel are the more useful techniques from each
                theoretical and methodological camp and adapts them to an applied research context.2(p16)

    Applied thematic analysis involves five elements:

 Text segmentation involves identifying a meaningful segment of text and the boundaries of the
   segment. Text segmentation is a useful process as a transcript from a 30-minute interview can be
   many pages long. Hence, segmenting the text provides a manageable section of the data for
   interrogation of meaning. For example, text segmentation may be a participant's response to an
   interview question, a keyword or concept in context, or a complete discourse between participants.
   The segment of text is more than a short phrase and can be both small and large sections of text. Text
   segments can also overlap, and a smaller segment may be embedded within a larger segment.3

 Creation of the codebook is a critical element of applied thematic analysis. The codebook is
   created when the segments of text are systematically coded into categories, types and relationships,
   and the codes are defined by the observed meaning in the text. The codes and their definitions are
   descriptive in the beginning, and then evolve into explanatory codes as the researcher examines the
   commonalities, differences and relationships between the codes. The codebook is an iterative
   document that the researcher builds and refines as they become more immersed and familiar with
   the data.3 Table 22.1 outlines the key components of a codebook.3

                                     Look for `I think' and `I   falls
                                     believe' statements.

 Structural coding can be useful if a structured interview guide or focus group guide has been used
   by the researcher and the researcher stays close to the wording of the question and its prompts. The
   structured question is the structural code in the codebook, and the text segment should include the
155 | CHAPTER 22: THEMATIC ANALYSIS

      participant's response and any dialogue following the question. Of course, this form of coding can
      be used even if the researcher does not follow a structured guide, which is often the reality of
      qualitative data collection. The relevant text segments are coded for the specific structure, as
      appropriate.3
   Content coding is informed by the research question(s) and the questions informing the analysis.
      The segmented text is grouped in different ways to explore relationships, hierarchies, descriptions
      and explanations of events, similarities, differences and consequences. The content of the text
      segment should be read and re-read to identify patterns and meaning, with the generated codes
      added to the codebook.
   Themes vary in scope, yet at the core they are phrases or statements that explain the meaning of the
      text. Researchers need to be aware that themes are considered a higher conceptual level than codes,
      and therefore should not be comprised of single words or labels. Typically, multiple codes will lead to
      a theme. Revisiting the research and analysis questions will assist the researcher to identify themes.
      Through the coding process, the researcher actively searches the data for themes. Examples of how
      themes may be identified include the repetition of concepts within and across transcripts, the use of
      metaphors and analogies, key phrases and common phrases used in an unfamiliar way.3

   Framework analysis

    This method originated in the 1980s in social policy research. Framework analysis is suited to research
    seeking to answer specific questions about a problem or issue, within a limited time frame and with
    homogenous data (in topics, concepts and participants); multiple researchers are usually involved in
    the coding process.4-6 The process of framework analysis is methodical and suits large data sets, hence
    is attractive to quantitative researchers and health services researchers. Framework analysis is useful for
    multidisciplinary teams in which not all members are familiar with qualitative analysis. Framework
    analysis does not seek to generate theory and is not aligned with any particular epistemological,
    philosophical or theoretical approach.5 The output of framework analysis is a matrix with rows (cases),
    columns (codes) and cells of summarised data that enables researchers to analyse the data case by
    case and code by code. The case is usually an individual interview, or it can be a defined group or
    organisation.5

The process for conducting framework analysis is as follows5:

1. Transcription - usually verbatim transcription of the interview.

2. Familiarisation with the interview - reading the transcript and listening to the audio recording
(particularly if the researcher doing the analysis did not conduct the interview) can assist in the
interpretation of the data. Notes on analytical observations, thoughts and impressions are made in the
margins of the transcript during this stage.

3. Coding - completed in a line-by-line method by at least two researchers from different disciplines (or
                                                                                                        CHAPTER 22: THEMATIC ANALYSIS | 156

with a patient or public involvement representative), where possible. Coding can be both deductive -
(using a theory or specific topics relevant to the project - or inductive, whereby open coding is applied to
elements such as behaviours, incidents, values, attitudes, beliefs, emotions and participant reactions. All
data is coded.

4. Developing a working analytical framework - codes are collated and organised into categories, to
create a structure for summarising or reducing the data.

5. Applying the analytical framework - indexing the remaining transcripts by using the categories and
codes of the analytical framework.

6. Charting data into the framework matrix - summarising the data by category and from each
transcript into the framework matrix, which is a spreadsheet with numbered cells in which summarised
data are entered by codes (columns) and cases (rows). Charting needs to balance the reduction of data to a
manageable few lines and retention of the meaning and `feel' of the participant. References to illustrative
quotes should be included.

7. Interpreting the data - using the framework matrix and notes taken throughout the analysis process
to interpret meaning, in collaboration with team members, including lay and clinical members.

Reflexive thematic analysis

This is the thematic analysis approach developed by Braun and Clarke in 2006 and explained in the
highly cited article `Using thematic analysis in psychology'.7 Reflexive thematic analysis recognises the
subjectiveness of the analysis process, and that codes and themes are actively generated by the researcher.
Hence, themes and codes are influenced by the researcher's values, skills and experiences.8 Reflexive
thematic analysis `exists at the intersection of the researcher, the dataset and the various contexts of
interpretation'.9(line 5-6) In this method, the coding process is less structured and more organic than in
applied thematic analysis. Braun and Clarke have been critical of the use of the term `emerging themes',
which many researchers use to indicate that the theme was data-driven, as opposed to a deductive approach:

                This language suggests that meaning is self evident and somehow `within' the data waiting to
                be revealed, and that the researcher is a neutral conduit for the revelation of said meaning. In
                contrast, we conceptualise analysis as a situated and interactive process, reflecting both the data, the
                positionality of the researcher, and the context of the research itself... it is disingenuous to evoke a
                process whereby themes simply emerge, instead of being active co-productions on the part of the
                researcher, the data/participants and context.10(p15)

Since 2006, Braun and Clarke have published extensively on reflexive thematic analysis, including a
methodological paper comparing reflexive thematic analysis with other approaches to qualitative analysis,8
and have provided resources on their website to support researchers and students.9 There are many ways
to conduct reflexive thematic analysis, but the six main steps in the method are outlined following.9 Note
157 | CHAPTER 22: THEMATIC ANALYSIS

that this is not a linear, prescriptive or rule-based process, but rather an approach to guide researchers in
systematically and robustly exploring their data.

1. Familiarisation with data - involves reading and re-reading transcripts so that the researcher is
immersed in the data. The researcher makes notes on their initial observations, interpretations and insights
for both the individual transcripts and across all the transcripts or data sources.

2. Coding - the process of applying succinct labels (codes) to the data in a way that captures the meaning
and characteristics of the data relevant to the research question. The entire data set is coded in numerous
rounds; however, unlike line-by-line coding in grounded theory (Chapter 27), or data segmentation in
applied thematic analysis, not all sections of data need to be coded.8 After a few rounds of coding, the codes
are collated and relevant data is extracted.

3. Generating initial themes - using the collated codes and extracted data, the researcher identifies
patterns of meaning (initial or potential themes). The researcher then revisits codes and the data to extract
relevant data for the initial themes, to examine the viability of the theme.

4. Developing and reviewing themes - checking the initial themes against codes and the entire data set
to assess whether it captures the `story' of the data and addresses the research question. During this step, the
themes are often reworked by combining, splitting or discarding. For reflexive thematic analysis, a theme is
defined as a `pattern of shared meaning underpinned by a central concept or idea'.8(p39)

5. Refining, defining and naming themes - developing the scope and boundaries of the theme,
creating the story of the theme and applying an informative name for the theme.

6. Writing up - is a key part of the analysis and involves writing the narrative of the themes, embedding
the data and providing the contextual basis for the themes in the literature.

Themes versus codes

As described above, themes are informed by codes, and themes are defined at a conceptually higher level
than codes. Themes are broader categorisations that tend to describe or explain the topic or concept.
Themes need to extend beyond the code and are typically statements that can stand alone to describe and/
or explain the data. Fereday and Muir-Cochrane explain this development from code to theme in Table
22.2.11
                                                                                                        CHAPTER 22: THEMATIC ANALYSIS | 158

When I [the author] first started publishing qualitative research, many of my themes were

at the code level. I then got advice that when the themes are the subheadings of the results

section of my paper, they should tell the story of the research. The difference in my theme
naming can be seen when comparing a paper from my PhD thesis,12 which explores the

challenges of church-based health promotion, with a more recent paper that I published on
antimicrobial stewardship13 (refer to the theme tables in the publications).

Advantages and challenges of thematic analysis

Thematic analysis is flexible and can be used to analyse small and large data sets with homogenous and
heterogenous samples. Thematic analysis can be applied to any type of data source, from interviews and
focus groups to diary entries and online discussion forums.1 Applied thematic analysis and framework
analysis are accessible approaches for non-qualitative researchers or beginner researchers. However, the
flexibility and accessibility of thematic analysis can lead to limitations and challenges when thematic
analysis is misapplied or done poorly. Thematic analysis can be more descriptive than interpretive if not
properly anchored in a theoretical framework.1 For framework analysis, the spreadsheet matrix output
can lead to quantitative researchers inappropriately quantifying the qualitative data. Therefore, training
and support from a qualitative researcher with the appropriate expertise can help to ensure that the
interpretation of the data is meaningful.5
         CHAPTER 22: THEMATIC ANALYSIS | 162

Summary

Thematic analysis is a family of analysis techniques that are flexible and inductive and involve the
generation of codes and themes. There are three main types of thematic analysis: applied thematic analysis,
framework analysis and reflexive thematic analysis. These approaches span from structured coding to
organic and unstructured coding for theme development. The choice of approach should be guided by the
research question, the research design and the available resources and skills of the researcher and team.

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe discourse analysis.
             Understand how to conduct discourse analysis.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of discourse analysis.

What is discourse analysis?

Discourse analysis is a field of qualitative analysis that has its origins in disciplines such as linguistics,
philosophy, psychology, anthropology.1 It is an interdisciplinary field that deals with `language' and
meaning.2
According to Jaworski and Coupland, the purpose of discourse analysis is that it `offers a means of
exposing or deconstructing the social practices that constitute `social structure' and what we might call the
conventional meaning structures of social life. It is a sort of forensic activity'.3(p5) There are three domains
of discourse analysis: the study of social interaction; the study of minds, selves and sense-making; and the
study of culture and social relations.4(p5)
Discourse analysis is the study of texts such as transcribed interviews, websites, forums, books, newspapers,
government documents (and many more), and the analysis of those texts to understand different accounts
and the meanings behind those accounts. Qualitative researchers strive to understand the relationships
between text (discourse) and social constructs. As text is analysed, the meaning behind the text is also
explored, often as the `voices' in the text. For example, when a participant is asked about their eating
habits and they discuss their joy in eating as well as feelings of guilt from eating high-calorific foods,
they may be voicing their parents' disapproval of this eating behaviour. The relationship between text
and social constructs can also be seen in alcohol advertising: an advertisement may be promoting alcohol
165 | CHAPTER 23: DISCOURSE ANALYSIS

consumption as a fun behaviour, but also cautions listeners to drink `responsibly', because the advertiser
is required to do so by advertising standards authorities. This inherent contradiction in the advertising
is part of the meaning-making regarding alcohol consumption. This meaning-making is contextual and
differs between countries, such as Australia (a high alcohol consumption culture) and Canada (a lower
alcohol consumption culture). Another example of context is in the use of the word `just' by an interview
participant; the term can mean many things, but if the researcher is asking about job title, `just' may the
participant's implication or inference that the title does not reflect an important position (e.g. `I'm just an
editor'). In discourse analysis, texts, meanings and inferences are important.

Following is an example of media articles and two distinct discourses about violence towards women. The
first media article, published by The Guardian on 15 June 2018,5 presents a discourse about how it is the
responsibility of women to prevent men from being violent towards them. The second article about the
same incident, published by The Age on 25 May 2019,6 presents a discourse that it is the responsibility of
men not to be violent towards women.

Meanings of texts are particularly important when participants use metaphors. The researcher needs to
examine the implications of the metaphor, deliberate or inadvertent. For example, when the researcher asks
the participant how they felt about their life and the participant replies, `life is a highway', the researcher
needs to look beyond what was said to understand the participant's meaning.

As an interdisciplinary method, discourse analysis can be complex and intricate. Gee7 provides 72 tools to
assist with various types of discourse analysis, ranging from identifying what is being said and what is not
being said, to examining `how the person is using language, as well as ways of acting, interacting, believing,
valuing, dressing, and using various objects, tools, and technologies in certain sorts of environments
to enact a specific socially recognizable identity and engage in one or more socially recognizable
activities'.7(p201) Gee also includes a helpful table (see Table 23.1) populated with his 7 building tasks for
researchers to examine their discourses, and provides the answers.8

How to conduct discourse analysis

Discourse analysis, as in all other qualitative methods, is used depending on the research topic and
question(s) or aim(s). The following steps are recommended:

Step 1: Have a clearly defined topic and research question, because this informs the types of research
materials that will be used.

Step 2: Conduct wide-ranging searches for materials that will inform the research topic.

Step 3: Determine which theory and framework will be used as the underpinning foundation for the
analyses (see Section 1 chapters 1-4).

Step 4: Analyse the content of the materials. This analysis is different (but similar) to content analysis,
which is a research technique to systematically classify codes and identify themes or patterns within the
data. Discourse analysis is concerned with identifying themes and patterns within the texts that relate to
the social contexts reflected in the research topic and within the theoretical lens chosen for analyses.

Step 5: Interpret and draw conclusions. Reflect on your work and examine how the various texts use
language within the context of the research topic to answer the research question(s).
As an example, Table 23.3 includes a study on girls' experience of competitive dancing.9 The authors
progressed through the steps as follows:

Step 1: The topic is eating disorders and young dancers. The research question is `How does experience in
the world of competitive dance shape the relationship that young girls have with their bodies?'

Step 2: The author conducted wide-ranging literature searches on eating disorders, ballet dancers, body
image, thinness, Western culture, dieting, media influences and many more topics.
167 | CHAPTER 23: DISCOURSE ANALYSIS

Step 3: Feminism was the theoretical underpinning of the textual analysis. As described by the authors,
`a feminist post structural approach was chosen to provide a critical lens to explore the beliefs, values, and
practices of young dancers... aimed to provide an understanding of the dominant and competing discourses
present in the world of dance and discover how these discourses are constituted, perpetuated, and form
ways of knowing in relation to body and body image.'9(p7)

Step 4: The transcripts were analysed in 5 steps, following Aston10 and presented in table 23.2:

4. Respond     As you write about the discourses, you need to connect these ideas to the participant.How do the

               power' that the participant is feeling experiencing.

5.             You can also add in the participant's `subjectivity' (how they are positioned as a nurse, man, woman,
Subjectivity   teacher etc.) as well as their `agency' (how they choose to act in each situation by fitting in or
and agency     challenging).

Step 5: Results were first interpreted within an `environmental' context (competitive culture, ideal
dancer's body, mirrors, and dance attire and costumes), which was predominately negative due to the
competitive culture. The second context was `parents', which encompassed body monitoring, joking,
and parents and support. Although most of the dancers stated that their parents did not influence their
relationship with their body, discourse analysis demonstrated that parents did influence them. The third
context was `coaches'. Coaches had a very strong influence on participants' body image. While the dancers
believed their coaches were supportive, the discourse demonstrated that most coaches' comments were
negative. `Peers' represented in the final context for analysis. Again, the dancers believed their peers were
                                                                                                      CHAPTER 23: DISCOURSE ANALYSIS | 168

supportive; however, discourse analysis demonstrated that many peer comments were negative. The
conclusions drawn from the research were that `all participants experienced negative physical, mental, and/
or emotional repercussions throughout their competitive dance experience. It was also determined that
environment, parents, coaches, and peers largely shaped the dancer's relationship with body and body
image in the world of dance. These influences generated and perpetuated the dominant negative body
image discourse that dancers were often unable to resist, and consequently their relationship with body and
body image suffered.'9(pp22-23)

This is a good example of situating a topic (body image) within a context (young women dancing)
underpinned by a theoretical framework that explores the dancers' beliefs, values and practices.

Advantages and challenges of discourse analysis

Discourse analysis can be used to analyse small and large data sets with homogenous and heterogenous
samples. It can be applied to any type of data source, from interviews and focus groups to diary entries,
news reports and online discussion forums. However, interpretation in discourse analysis can lead to
limitations and challenges that tend to occur when discourse analysis is misapplied or done poorly.
171 | CHAPTER 23: DISCOURSE ANALYSIS

Discourse analysis can be highly flexible and is best used when anchored in a theoretical approach. Because
discourse analysis involves subjective interpretation, training and support from a qualitative researcher with
expertise in the method is required to ensure that the interpretation of the data is meaningful. Finally,
discourse analysis can be time-consuming when analysing large volumes of texts.

Summary

Discourse analysis is a process whereby texts are examined and interpreted. It looks for the meanings
`behind' text in cultural and social contexts. Discourse analysis is flexible, and the researcher has scope
to interpret the text(s) based on the research topic and aim(s). Having a theoretical approach assists the
researcher to position the discourse in cultural and social grounding.

CHAPTER 24: NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

   Darshini Ayton and Heather Craig

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Define a narrative.
             Explain the process of conducting narrative analysis and describe the elements of a
                story produced from narrative data.
             Describe the advantages and challenges of narrative analysis.

What is narrative analysis?

In simple terms, a narrative is a story with a beginning, middle and end or outcome. Bruner1 suggests that
narratives (stories) are ways of knowing:

                Telling stories is an astonishing thing. We are a species whose main purpose is to tell each other
                about the expected and the surprises that upset the expected, and we do that through the stories we
                tell. 1(p8)

In narrative analysis, the stories (narratives) participants tell are analysed and then `re-storied', or retold,
based on the research questions and frameworks of the research.2 Narratives may be unique, or they
may be representative. However, when writing a `group' story, the narrative should partially describe the
individuals while not specifically describing each individual.3 Narrative analysis may focus on what the
story is about (the thematic content of the story) or on the structural components of the story (structural
analysis).3

Constructing a narrative from data

The following 2 processes can assist the researcher to identify the structure and content of the narrative4:
173 | CHAPTER 24: NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

   Read and re-read the transcripts.
   Identify events in the transcripts as told by the participants - these are events that have happened.
   Identify the experiences of the participants and note any images, feelings, reactions or meanings

      ascribed to the experience by the participants.
   Note accounts, explanations and excuses as told by the participants.
   Identify the sequences of events, key characters, plot lines and imagery used in the narrative, and

      explore what this might represent (e.g. metaphors).
   Identify the beginning, middle and end of the story.

Coding for narrative analysis identifies the sequence or plot of the story. This process involves six codes that
are applied to the narrative:

Abstract - a few sentences to introduce the story and give an indication of the topic.

Orientation - the who (people involved), what (situation or activity), when (time) and where (location)
of the story.

Complicating action - the event that starts the story and sets up the plot.

Evaluation - sometimes called `reflection'; how the participant interprets the plot and their commentary
on why (for example) the complicating action is important or not resolved.

Resolution - the final part of the plot that resolves the complicating action.

Coda - a section that ends the story and completes the plot.

Following is a narrative sequence based on the author's story of being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.
When interviewing participants for the purpose of narrative analysis, the researcher needs to ask a question
that elicits a narrative from the participant. For example, in this narrative, the question from the researcher
could have been: `Tell me the story of how you were diagnosed with multiple sclerosis'. This invites
the participant to give a narrative response with a beginning (symptoms), middle (seeking help) and
(hopefully) end (the diagnosis). In the example, the author (Ayton) has coded the 6 elements of her story.

      We were at the movies on a Saturday night - watching The Simpsons movie with some friends. I remember
      sitting there feeling like I had sand in my left shoe. My toes felt gritty and weird. It was a weird sensation but
      I thought it would pass. My husband and I went home and when I woke up the next morning, the sensation
      was up to my waist. The sensation was like pins and needles - the type you get when you fall asleep on your
      arm and limit blood circulation. My skin was buzzing slightly. I was starting to freak out at this stage. I was
      wondering if I had a brain tumour. [Orientation] [Abstract]

      I went to work on Monday morning and, by this stage, the sensation was quite strong and was in both my
      legs and my torso up to my chest. It was uncomfortable but not painful. It was alarming, though. I was
      working at a university and my boss was a general practitioner. I told her about my symptoms and she said it
      could be stress, and to have a bath and breath in and out into a paper bag. When I got home that night I tried
      doing what she told me, but it didn't help. I had made an appointment with my normal GP for the next day.
                                                                                                       CHAPTER 24: NARRATIVE ANALYSIS | 174

      When I saw her she thought it could be neurological and gave me a referral to see a private neurologist. She
      also asked me to get more bloods done. However, the earliest appointment was in 3 weeks. I was starting to
      feel like I was going crazy and didn't feel like I could wait that long. [Complicating action]

      The next day I went to work but walked over to the hospital that was next to the university. I sat in the
      emergency department for a few hours and was seen by a registrar, who did the same blood tests as my GP.
      He didn't seem to think there was anything wrong with me and said while my white blood-cell count was
      slightly elevated, it wasn't enough to suggest that anything was wrong. He sent me home with instructions
      to come back if it got worse.

      Over the next few days, the sensation kept getting stronger. It got to the point where I felt I could cut off
      my leg and not feel it. I felt like some crazy marshmallow person and felt spongy and weird even though my
      body looked the same.

      I couldn't stand it any longer and so I stumbled back to the emergency department on Monday morning.
      I was seen by a different registrar and remember thinking that he was very good looking. He looked like he
      could be a character on Grey's Anatomy. He started doing some tests on me, including ones that tested my
      skin sensation. While he was doing the tests, I was recounting my experiences of the last week and said that I
      felt like I was going crazy. He looked me in the eye and said, "I believe you", and I promptly burst into tears.
      He called a neuro registrar - a lovely young woman. I remember she asked me to stand with my feet together
      and to close my eyes. I fell backwards straight away and was so shocked! She also asked me to walk as though
      I was balancing on a tightrope. I put one foot in front of the other but I couldn't swing my other leg around
      without falling over. I was amazed and scared at the same time. She admitted me straight away. I got my first
      MRI - a very traumatic experience. [Evaluation]

      My husband stayed with me that night as I was so freaked out. I had never been admitted to a hospital before.
      We huddled together on the hospital bed. Needless to say, we didn't get much sleep. I just kept hearing all the
      different beeps and alarms that are typical of a hospital ward. At 7 am the next morning the neuro registrar I
      had met the night before entered with a senior consultant. They explained that I had transverse myelitis and
      that I had lesions on my spine and brain that were causing the symptoms. They were going to start me on
      methylprednisolone and I was going to stay in the hospital until the end of the week. [Resolution]

      I was so relieved that it wasn't a brain tumour. However, both my husband and I were trained in
      biomedicine. When the neurologist was describing the lesions my husband asked - is this multiple sclerosis?
      The neurologist looked a bit surprised and then said - it could be, but I needed another "attack" before a
      diagnosis could be made. There was no way to tell if, and when, this would happen. And so the waiting game
      began. [Coda]

Another example can be found in Wang5, who applied narrative analysis to Hannah Gadsby's Nanette (a
show on Netflix).

Narrative analysis can be used to put together the various elements of data in a coherent and interesting
narrative, and to provide explanations.6 The researcher recursively moves between the data and the
emerging narrative. As the story is written, the researcher examines the data and develops or refines the
story if the events or actions do not align with the plot that is developing.6

The story that is developed by the researcher would not be the same as one the participant(s) would
construct if they wrote their own story. The story is constructed by the researcher and is therefore shaped
175 | CHAPTER 24: NARRATIVE ANALYSIS

by the researcher's personal views, experiences and priorities (i.e. the research objectives). Furthermore, in
the case of in-depth interviews, the story will be influenced by the dynamic and collaborative interactions
between the researcher and participants as data is collected.6 The narrative will also differ from that
which a different researcher might put together if they conducted a similar study. However, despite this
subjectivity, the narrative analysis does provide a credible interpretation of participants' experiences, with
quotes providing examples in the participants' own `voice'.6 So, while the analysis and subsequent story
should be close to the data and `fit' it well, the narrative also adds meaning and order that is not evident
from the raw data.6

Advantages and challenges of narrative analysis

Narrative analysis provides the stories of participants in narrative form to enable comparison between and
across key story elements. These narratives provide a holistic understanding of lived experience and can be a
powerful way to create policy change. However, narrative analysis can be a slow process and the researcher
needs to be able to pay attention to subtle details and interpret the story overall.6

Table 24.1 provides 2 examples of research using narrative analysis.

Summary

Narrative analysis, broadly speaking, is the process of making sense of stories. The coding process seeks
to identify key elements of the sequence of the story to identify the beginning (abstract and orientation),
middle (complicating action and evaluation) and end (resolution and coda). Although highly interpretive,
narrative analysis is a valid method of providing a credible interpretation of the participants' experiences.

ANALYSIS

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe grounded theory analysis.
             Understand how to conduct grounded theory analysis.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of grounded theory analysis.

What is grounded theory?

Grounded theory is both a study design (see Chapter 10) and an approach to data analysis. Grounded
theory aims to provide an explanation from the data about a phenomenon or concept. As noted in Chapter
10, there are methodological differences in the research design of grounded theory approaches, and hence
different processes of analysis align with the specific methodological approach undertaken. Researchers
need to ensure that the methodological and analysis approach are aligned.
Table 10.1 in Chapter 10 outlines three grounded theory approaches: Classical grounded theory, Straussian
grounded theory and Constructivst grounded theory.1 In this chapter we expand on these approaches,
specific to the analysis of data.

How to do grounded theory analysis

Classical grounded theory
The main focus of classical grounded theory as devised by Glaser and Strauss2 is to develop a theory that
explains the participants' stories or behaviours. The three steps of Classical grounded theory take the data
from the abstract to interconnected ideas. Classical grounded theory is positioned within the positivist
paradigm, and the steps for coding and analysis outlined here are objective and systematic:
179 | CHAPTER 25: GROUNDED THEORY ANALYSIS

Open coding is, as the name suggests, typically unfocused and seeks to explore all elements of the data.
The transcript is divided into comparable sections (e.g. comparing similar descriptions of the phenomena)
and these are given a code. This enables the researcher to group the codes, to create categories. As new
phenomena, incidents or situations are identified in the data, they are compared to the categories and are
either combined into an existing category or a new category is developed. This form of coding leads to the
identification of what is called the `core category', which is the most frequently occurring category that
explains most of the data.1, 3

Selective coding is a step in which the researcher focuses on the core category and codes data to this core
category. The purpose is to expand the core category and determine how it relates to other categories; to
validate and test the relationships; and to continue refining and developing the core category. Selective
coding continues until the core code is `saturated'; that is, no new data changes the core code. This may
require moving back and forth between codes or categories within transcripts to continue to look for how
the codes may relate to each other, or collecting more data to continue to develop the core category. Codes
and categories are then integrated, which leads to the development of the theory.1, 3

Theoretical coding is a step in which the researcher creates a theoretical outline of how the categories
developed in the earlier rounds of coding relate to each other. The researcher may choose to organise and
categorise codes using the Six Cs model: causes, contexts, contingencies, consequences, covariance and
conditions.4 It is important to include memos alongside the codes in this step. Memos are the researcher's
thoughts and ideas about the analysis, written during the research (following data collection, while reading
the transcription and throughout the coding process).1

Straussian grounded theory

Straussian grounded theory was developed by Strauss and Corbin,5 and is considered methodological
(pragmatic and post-positivist) rather than ontological and epistemological, and this is its main difference
from classical grounded theory. The coding process is as follows:

Open coding is the first level of coding and involves breaking down the data into smaller sections; this
is usually done through line-by-line coding, to identify concepts and key phrases. The researcher typically
applies codes to `who', `what', `where', `when', and `how' in the text as a first round of coding.

Axial coding is the second level of coding, which links the data conceptually. Axial coding refines and
aligns the open codes and identifies relationships or links between the codes. It seeks to pull the codes
back into the categories of the `conditions' of the data, looking for conditions, actions or interactions and
consequences. This is where the core codes emerge.6

Selective coding is the third level of coding, in which the researcher selects and integrates the axial codes
into a higher level of conceptual meaning. This coding step then leads to theory development.4
                                                                                         CHAPTER 25: GROUNDED THEORY ANALYSIS | 180

Constructivist grounded theory

The main focus of constructivist grounded theory, developed initially by Kathy Charmaz7, sought to move
away from the positivist and post-positivist paradigms of other grounded theory approaches to recognise
that reality, and consequently the research process, is socially constructed. It uses two main stages in coding:

Initial coding seeks to remain close to the data. Some researchers conduct word-by-word coding, which
is helpful when coding documents as it focuses the researcher on words and their meanings. Researchers
typically conduct line-by-line coding. It is during this initial coding stage that the researcher seeks to
code for participants' meanings, feelings and actions, and the consequences of the actions. The focus is
on the process, how it can be defined and how the process develops. During initial coding, the constant
comparative method is used to compare the codes within the same interview, to explore whether and
how the codes align or diverge. Then codes are compared across interviews of similar phenomena or
experiences.6,7

Focused coding is more directed and selective than initial coding, and focuses on synthesising and
explaining larger segments of the text. The most frequent codes are applied to these larger segments of text
to explore whether they can be maintained consistently and make analytical sense.

Note that initial and focused coding are not linear processes; the researcher often needs to move back and
forth between the two approaches.7 This is because the researcher may have coded the first three transcripts
with initial coding and then focused coding, and then in coding transcript four, a new concept becomes
more evident in the data. The researcher will then go back to the earlier transcripts to explore if the concept
can be identified.7

Axial coding, when used in constructivist grounded theory searches for links between experiences that
have been categorised. This process leads to more categories, subcategories and links, and is part of the
focused coding step. For example, in research involving older people who had experienced a fall, some of
the older people explicitly used the word `fall' while others avoided the word and instead used words such as
`stumbled', `tripped' or `went over'. When looking for links between these different ways of talking about
falls, the researchers found that participants who identified as `being old' (which had nothing to do with
chronological age!) were more likely to use the word `fall', whereas participants who rejected the label of
being old were more like to use synonyms. People who did not use the word fall explained the reason for
the fall as `I was rushing', and `I wasn't wearing the right shoes'. Axial coding in this instance examines the
socially constructed reality of the participant, such as their biographical details, social conditions, reasons
for sharing, who was present and the assumed consequences of describing their fall.8, 9

Theoretical coding follows focused coding and is a more emergent process in constructivist grounded
theory when compared to other forms of grounded theory analysis.6 Theoretical coding is the
conceptualisation of how the focused codes may be integrated into a theory - basically into an analytical
181 | CHAPTER 25: GROUNDED THEORY ANALYSIS

story.7 Charmaz cautions that theoretical codes may lead the researcher to believe there is objectivity to the
analysis, and hence advises to use theoretical coding only if it will sharpen and clarify the analysis.7

A contemporary example of grounded theory is Dr Bren Brown's TED Talk, titled The Power of
Vulnerability.9 At about the 6-minute mark, Brown describes her process of analysis. She describes having
divided her data set between participants who had a strong sense of worthiness and those who struggled for
it. She then conducted a constant comparative analysis between the two data sets, seeking to understand
participants' conceptions of vulnerability and shame. This process of constant comparison is a key element
in grounded theory analysis.

Advantages and disadvantages of grounded theory
analysis

Grounded theory analysis is rigorous and can lead to the formation of robust theory as it develops from
the micro to the macro layers of data. However, the process can be time and resource intensive, particularly
with the concurrent data collection and analysis required in theory generation (see Chapter 10: Grounded
Theory). The complexity of the interplay between the different phases of data analysis and can be
particularly daunting for students and new researchers, and the theory generated can be insubstantial if
insufficient data is collected and analysed.5 Table 25.1 provides examples of two grounded theory studies.

Summary

Grounded theory aims to develop theory about a phenomenon. The three main forms of grounded
theory stem from different ontological and epistemiological positions: classical grounded theory, Straussian
grounded theory and constructivst grounded theory. Researchers need to ensure that their research design
aligns with the analytical approach undertaken.

What is rigour?

In qualitative research, rigour, or trustworthiness, refers to how researchers demonstrate the quality of their
research.1, 2 Rigour is an umbrella term for several strategies and approaches that recognise the influence on
qualitative research by multiple realities; for example, of the researcher during data collection and analysis,
and of the participant. The research process is shaped by multiple elements, including research skills, the
social and research environment and the community setting.2
Research is considered rigorous or trustworthy when members of the research community are confident in
the study's methods, the data and its interpretation.3 As mentioned in Chapters 1 and 2, quantitative and
qualitative research are founded on different research paradigms and, hence, quality in research cannot be
addressed in the same way for both types of research studies. Table 26.1 provides a comparison overview of
the approaches of quantitative and qualitative research in ensuring quality in research.

                 these realities, using quotes and narratives.3

Below is an overview of the main approaches to rigour in qualitative research. For each of the approaches,
examples of how rigour was demonstrated are provided from the author's PhD thesis.

Approaches to dependability

Dependability requires the researcher to provide an account of changes to the research process and setting.3
The main approach to dependability is an audit trail.

   Audit trail - the researcher records or takes notes on the conduct of the research and the process of
      reaching conclusions from the data. The audit trail includes information on the data collection and
      data analysis, including decision-making and interpretations of the data that influence the study's
      results.8,9
187 | CHAPTER 26: RIGOUR

           The interview questions for this study evolved as the study progressed, and accordingly, the process was
           iterative. I spent 12 months collecting data, and as my understanding and responsiveness to my
           participants and to the culture and ethos of the various churches developed, so did my line of
           questioning. For example, in the early interviews for phase 2, I included questions regarding the
           qualifications a church leader might look for in hiring someone to undertake health promotion
           activities. This question was dropped after the first couple of interviews, as it was clear that church
           leaders did not necessarily view their activities as health promoting and therefore did not perceive the
           relevance of this question. By `being church', they were health promoting, and therefore activities that
           were health promoting were not easily separated from other activities that were part of the core mission
           of the church10(pp93-4)

Approaches to credibility

Credibility requires the researcher to demonstrate the truth or confidence in the findings. The main
approaches to credibility include triangulation, prolonged engagement, persistent observation, negative
case analysis and member checking.3

   Triangulation - the assembly of data and interpretations from multiple methods (methods
      triangulation), researchers (research triangulation), theory (theory triangulation) and data sources
      (different participant groups).9 Refer to Chapter 28 for a detailed discussion of this process.

   Prolonged engagement - the requirement for researchers to spend sufficient time with participants
      and/or within the research context to familiarise them with the research setting, to build trust and
      rapport with participants and to recognise and correct any misinformation.9

                  Prolonged engagement with churches was also achieved through the case study phase
                  as the ten case study churches were involved in more than one phase of data collection.
                  These ten churches were the case studies in which significant time was spent
                  conducting interviews and focus groups, and attending activities and programs.
                  Subsequently, there were many instances where I interacted with the same people on
                  more than one occasion, thereby facilitating the development of interactive and deeper
                  relationships with participants10 (pp.94-5)

   Persistent observation - the identification of characteristics and elements that are most relevant to
      the problem or issue under study, and upon which the research will focus in detail.9

                  In the following chapters, I present my analysis of the world of churches in which I
                  was immersed as I conducted fieldwork. I describe the processes of church practice and
                  action, and explore how this can be conceptualised into health promotion action10

                      (p97)

   Negative case analysis - the process of finding and discussing data that contradicts the study's
      main findings. Negative case analysis demonstrates that nuance and granularity in perspectives of
      both shared and divergent opinions have been examined, enhancing the quality of the interpretation
              CHAPTER 26: RIGOUR | 188

of the data.

Although I did not use negative case selection, the Catholic churches in this study
acted as examples of the `low engagement'10 (p97)

 Member checking - the presentation of data analysis, interpretations and conclusions of the

   research to members of the participant groups. This enables participants or people with shared
   identity with the participants to provide their perspectives on the research.9

                  Throughout my candidature - during data collection and analysis, and in the
                  construction of my results chapters - I engaged with a number of Christians, both
                  paid church staff members and volunteers, to test my thoughts and concepts. These
                  people were not participants in the study, but they were embedded in the cultural and
                  social context of churches in Victoria. They were able to challenge and also affirm my
                  thinking and so contributed to a process of member checking10(p96)

Approaches to confirmability

Confirmability is demonstrated by grounding the results in the data from participants.3 This can be
achieved through the use of quotes, specifying the number of participants and data sources and providing
details of the data collection.

 Quotes from participants are used to demonstrate that the themes are generated from the data. The
   results section of the thesis chapters commences with a story based on the field notes or recordings,
   with extensive quotes from participants presented throughout.10

 The number of participants in the study provides the context for where the data is `sourced' from
   for the results and interpretation. Table 26.2 is reproduced with permission from the Author's thesis
   and details the data sources for the project. This also contributes to establishing how triangulation
   across data sources and methods was achieved.

 Details of data collection - Table 26.2 provides detailed information about the processes of data
   collection, including dates and locations but the duration of each research encounter was not
   specified.

Approaches to transferability

To enable the transferability of qualitative research, researchers need to provide information about the
context and the setting. A key approach for transferability is thick description.6

   Thick description - detailed explanations and descriptions of the research questions are provided,
      including about the research setting, contextual factors and changes to the research setting.9

                  I chose to include the Catholic Church because it is the largest Christian group in
                  Australia and is an example of a traditional church. The Protestant group were
                  represented through the Uniting, Anglican Baptist and Church of Christ
                  denominations. The Uniting Church denomination is unique to Australia and was
                  formed in 1977 through the merging of the Methodist, Presbyterian and
                  Congregationalist denominations. The Church of Christ denomination was chosen to
                  represent a contemporary less hierarchical denomination in comparison to the other
                  protestant denominations. The last group, the Salvation Army, was chosen because
                  of its high profile in social justice and social welfare, therefore offering different
                  perspectives on the role and activities of the church in health promotion10(pp82-3)
                                                      CHAPTER 26: RIGOUR | 190

What is reflexivity?

Reflexivity is the process in which researchers engage to explore and explain how their subjectivity (or
bias) has influenced the research.12 Researchers engage in reflexive practices to ensure and demonstrate
rigour, quality and, ultimately, trustworthiness in their research.13 The researcher is the instrument of data
collection and data analysis, and hence awareness of what has influenced their approach and conduct of the
research - and being able to articulate them - is vital in the creation of knowledge. One important element
is researcher positionality (see Chapter 27), which acknowledges the characteristics, interests, beliefs and
personal experiences of the researcher and how this influences the research process. Table 26.3 outlines
different types of reflexivity, with examples from the author's thesis.

Summary

The quality of qualitative research is measured through the rigour or trustworthiness of the research,
demonstrated through a range of strategies in the processes of data collection, analysis, reporting and
reflexivity.

POSITIONALITY

Learning outcomes

Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:

      Understand the definition and dimensions of positionality.
      Describe insider (emic) and outsider (etic) research and their differences.
      Articulate your positionality in your research projects.

What is positionality?

Human perception is subjective: it can differ markedly between people who, when looking at the same
scene, will observe different things.1 Positionality describes an individual's worldview and the position
that they adopt about research and its context.2 Positionality encompasses beliefs about reality (ontology),
knowledge (epistemology) and values (axiology), which contribute to how researchers approach their
work.3 Beliefs can be influenced by parts of our identity that are fixed (e.g. age and ethnicity) and parts of
our identity that are fluid (e.g. political views, geographical location and life history). The positionality that
researchers bring to their work, and the personal experiences through which their positionality is shaped,
can influence the data collection and analysis.2 Secules et al.4 summarise 6 dimensions of positionality; this
chapter adds the 7th dimension of axiology (Table 27.1).

How does the researcher describe their positionality?

Researchers may undertake exercises in reflexivity to understand and articulate their positionality.
Reflexivity is a process by which researchers acknowledge and disclose themselves within their research,
seeking to understand their part in it, or their influence upon it (see Chapter 26).5 Positionality and
reflexivity suggest that the researcher is not separate from the health and social worlds they study. The use
of a reflexive approach to inform positionality acknowledges that health and social research are not separate
from wider society and the individual researcher. A reflexive approach suggests that, rather than trying to
eliminate their effect or influence, researchers should acknowledge and disclose themselves in their work,
with the aim of understanding their influence upon, and within, the research process.2 Table 27.2 provides
examples of positionality statements included in health and social care research articles.

An example of a researcher's positionality and its
influence on their work

Smales writes about their potential influence on their research with young people experiencing out-of-
home care.9 In the methods section they include a description with a subheading, `The researcher', namely
that they had `lived in a resident care unit and other forms of care for four years... and [have] had ongoing
experience working within the out of home care system'.9 The researcher acknowledges that their lived
experience shaped the interview guide, based on understanding the knowledge gaps in this area of research.
Smales also describes interacting with participants on a deeper level, through shared experience that
provided additional meaning and context to the study. They acknowledged that the shared experiences
between the researcher and participants was likely to influence the data collection and analysis, but sought
                                                                                           CHAPTER 27: RESEARCHER POSITIONALITY | 196

to ensure that ethical, moral and professional processes were followed, so as to minimise bias in the
reporting of results.

Emic and etic perspectives

Researcher positionality is discussed in the literature as a clear distinction between insider (emic) and
outsider (etic) perspectives. Insiders are considered part of the community within which the research is
conducted, while outsiders are considered to be outside of the group being studied.10 Some researchers
argue that the emic and etic perspectives are two ends of a positionality continuum along which researchers
move back and forth during the research process, rather than distinguishing binary, insider-outsider
perspectives. 11

The two categories of etic and emic remain largely theoretical, and the conversations about practically
applying the theories can be challenging. For example, having either an exclusively etic or exclusively emic
approach when conducting `outsider' research is paradoxical. On the one hand, an etic approach to data
collection would mean that the researcher is oblivious to how their presence, behaviours, attitudes or
methodological decisions influence insider responses. On the other hand, an exclusively emic approach
would mean the researcher internalises the preconceptions and assumptions of research the participants,
and therefore compromises their ability to be objective or to communicate the research findings.12

How does a researcher know if they are an insider or
outsider?

Bracketing is a method used in qualitative research to identify, examine and mitigate researcher
preconceptions that may influence the research process.13 Bracketing works by the researcher explicitly
noting their own beliefs and interactions with the research topic, in an attempt to remain impartial
throughout the research process. Bracketing promotes methodological rigour and trustworthiness in the
conclusions drawn from qualitative research. While bracketing is widely used to identify similarities
between researchers and participants to epistemologically distance the researchers from their assumptions,
an emerging method, diffraction, describes how researchers proactively engage within the research context,
and their differences from participants.4 This approach encourages researchers to interrogate aspects of
their influence that are unpredictable or unknown, thereby leading to research practices that are socially
just and ethical. Diffraction identifies the material realities and differences between the researchers and
participants, to ontologically anticipate and rectify issues such as `Othering'.

Articles in which researchers discuss their experiences with bracketing include Berkovic et al. and Drfler
et al.13, 14

In addition to bracketing, researchers Austin and Sutton15 outline 4 questions that researchers can ask
themselves to commence the reflection process:
197 | CHAPTER 27: RESEARCHER POSITIONALITY

   Why am I interested in this topic? Try to identify what is driving your enthusiasm, energy and
      interest in researching this subject.

   What do I think I am going to find? Seek to identify any preconceptions or assumptions you may
      have about your research, through honest reflection on what you expect to find in your data. You can
      then bracket those assumptions to enable the participants' voices to be heard.

   What am I getting out of this? Consider how your circumstances affect your interest in your
      research question/s or outcomes, and the amount of data you will need to collect and analyse. This
      question is particularly important if you have a pre-existing relationship with the research topic or
      participants.

   What do others in my professional community think of this work - and of me? Research is
      part of a complex social world. The influences within that world can shape your views and
      expectations of yourself and your work. Acknowledging this influence and its potential effects on
      personal behaviour will help to facilitate greater self-scrutiny throughout the research process.

Strengths and limitations of emic and etic perspectives

Conducting research as an insider (from an emic perspective) may be advantageous because the researcher
has established knowledge of the research topic and is immersed in its population. This may ease
recruitment efforts and, during data collection, participants may be less cautious or guarded than they
would be with an outsider researcher. However, being an insider can affect how the researcher is perceived,
the information that participants provide and the analysis of the data. Participants may assume that the
insider researcher will judge their responses to questions because of their shared identity, and may even seek
to impress or agree with the researcher, based on their perceived connection rather than their true beliefs.16

Summary

Qualitative researchers need to articulate their positionality. Qualitative researchers can be primarily
insiders (with an emic perspective), or they may be outsiders (with an etic perspective). Being an emic
or etic researcher each has strengths and limitations, but there are several examples in the literature with
strategies to help navigate these.

CHAPTER 28: TRIANGULATION

   Tess Tsindos

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand the definition of triangulation.
             Describe the four types of triangulation.
             Understand how to conduct triangulation.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of triangulation.

What is triangulation?

Triangulation is the combination or blending of more than one participant group, researcher, theory
and/or method in the same research. Its purpose is to understand the phenomenon under study1 by
determining consistency, or `truth'.1 Triangulation can be used to demonstrate the rigour, validity and
credibility of research findings.2 While the purpose of triangulation is not to confirm results, but rather
to understand differences, it can be difficult to explain inconsistent results when discussing the research
undertaken.
There are four main types of triangulation2:

   Theoretical triangulation is the use of more than one theory to guide the research process. For
      example, a researcher might analyse data on family violence by applying feminist and critical theory,
      and they might also apply structural functionalist theory (see Section 1) when examining family
      violence as part of a complex system. By applying different theories, the data is able to be interrogated
      through theoretical lenses, which can lead to deeper understanding of the findings and greater
      nuance than a single theory might support.

   Researcher triangulation is the use of multiple (two or more) researchers to collect and / or
      analyse data. The researchers may have different disciplinary backgrounds and experiences, and will
                                                                                                         CHAPTER 28: TRIANGULATION | 200

   also bring their professional and personal interpretations to the data. For example, research
   approaches to consumer and community involvement (or patient and public involvement) might
   advocate for patients to be involved in the analysis of data, to include patient perspectives in the
   interpretation of the data. In a study developing a `BroSupPORT' portal and examining issues facing
   men with prostate cancer,3 researchers found that health professionals were not sure that a Patient
   Reported Outcome comparator tool would be helpful in prompting health-seeking behaviour, but
   participants with prostate cancer welcomed such a tool. Focusing a patient lens on data in this study
   was important because it was able to highlight differences between perspectives of health
   professionals and patient participants. If only health professionals had been consulted the tool would
   not have been considered helpful and would have been ruled out as an option for the portal.
 Methodological triangulation is the use of multiple (two or more) methods to collect and analyse
   data. The data collection methods might include focus groups, interviews, photovoice, observations,
   field notes and more. In essence, it is bringing together the various methods used to collect data and
   can provide a more nuanced explanation of results. Methodological triangulation can include
   quantitative methods to support or harmonise results. Using quantitative and qualitative methods
   together enables the research to answer the questions of `what' and `why' (see Chapter 11: Mixed
   Methods). The BroSupPort portal study3 is a good example of methodological triangulation because
   it used a combination of workshops, interviews and focus groups to collect data.
 Data triangulation uses more than one data source and / or method of analysis to interrogate the
   data. Data sources may include interviews with people in a range of roles in an organisation, rather
   than only those in one particular role. Data analyses might include data from both inductive and
   deductive perspectives. Data triangulation might also include different data sources, such as
   qualitative (e.g. interviews) and quantitative (e.g. surveys). In the BroSupPORT portal study3 data
   were gathered at workshops, focus groups and interviews. Surveys, mind maps, River of Life
   activities and problem trees (in printed form), along with field notes taken at each workshop, were
   used to collect data. A range of techniques was used to analyse the data including, but not limited to,
   descriptive content analysis.

 Table 28.1 provides examples of the four main types of triangulation. Other types of triangulation,
 such as `time' and `space'3, are not covered in this chapter because they are used less often.

How to conduct triangulation

How triangulation is conducted depends on the type of triangulation.
203 | CHAPTER 28: TRIANGULATION

   Theoretical triangulation requires an introduction to each theory and can be written as a
      literature review. The theories are described and then compared, to elicit inferences that will form the
      basis of data interpretation. For example, a feminist theory will inform data collection in such a way
      that girls and women (and women's marginalised groups) will be deliberately sought out and
      included in the research study. Analysis would include a focus on gender identity, patriarchal
      oppression, diversity of culture and background, and would seek to demonstrate women's points of
      view through a feminist lens. If, for example, a study is about women patients, the data collection
      and analysis would focus on how or whether women are represented in the data, and how women
      are medically treated by healthcare practitioners. Women's own perspectives would be sought and
      analysed, to understand their perspectives.

   Researcher triangulation is often described in the type of data being analysed, and can often be
      read in the researcher's statement of positionality or in the reflexivity section of a journal paper or
      report9. Some forms of thematic analysis (not reflexive thematic analysis) requires more than one
      investigator to read, re-read, code and re-code interviews or focus groups. When it is not a
      requirement of the method of analysis, triangulation should still be considered, in order to address
      concerns about the rigour, validity and credibility of findings of a single researcher. Including more
      than one researcher and participant can leads to greater divergence and the potential for nuanced
      findings.

   Methodological triangulation is used often in the literature. A decision is made about how to
      conduct the research, on the basis of the research question or aim. Often in mixed methods research,
      a qualitative component seeks to answer the question, `Why?' and the quantitative component seeks
      to test a hypothesis or answer the question, `What?'. However, many qualitative methods might be
      included, such as interviews, focus groups, newspaper clippings, to answer the research question(s).
      When using methodological triangulation, the researcher is looking to expand their understanding
      of the findings. For example, if a survey and interviews are the mixed methods used in a study, the
      researcher would seek to compare and contrast the findings of both methods, to gain a
      comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon, and then would describe how the findings
      support or diverge in answering the research question(s). Thus, a study exploring barriers and
      enablers in the implementation of the 6-PACK falls prevention program10 incorporated a cluster
      randomised control trial, economic and program evaluations, and surveys and focus groups. The
      findings were triangulated and results suggested that regular, practical face-to-face education and
      training for nurses were key to successful falls prevention program implementation in acute
      hospitals, as were provision of equipment; audit, reminders and feedback; leadership and champions;
      and the provision of falls data .

   Data triangulation involves using and analysing more than one participant group. It is often
      considered an aspect of methodological triangulation because different methods usually involve
      more than one source of data. Data collection needs to be well-defined and conducted. Once the data
      from all participant groups has been examined, the findings are compared and contrasted to assist in
      answering the research question(s).
                                                                                                             CHAPTER 28: TRIANGULATION | 204

It's important to remember that triangulation can involve more than one type of triangulation, and this
is often the case with mixed-methods research. For example, in mixed-methods research, methodological,
investigator and data triangulation may be used to demonstrate the full findings of the research. While
Table 28.1 has listed each type separately, examining some of the example papers will show that there is
more than one type of triangulation in the studies. Strict adherence to only one triangulation type can
make researching the phenomenon more difficult.

Advantages and challenges of triangulation

Comparing and contrasting theories, data sources, methods and data analyses can ensure strong reliability
and validity in research results. However, this can also be time-consuming and resource-intensive.
Attention needs to be paid to the nuances of the research, to provide holistic explanations. There are times
when triangulation may not be considered necessary, and this also needs to be understood when addressing
the research question. For example, if the purpose of the research is to develop a new theory, there may be
no need to include more than one method, data point or theoretical foundation.

Summary

Triangulation is the use of more than one data source, investigator, theory or method in the same research.
There are four main triangulation types: each provides a means for examining the research from different
perspectives and for ensuring the rigour, validity and credibility of findings.

             Describe recruitment approaches.
             Understand how to conduct recruitment and sampling.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of recruitment and sampling.

What is sampling?

Sampling is defined as selecting a suitable group of people (population) for a study.1 Inviting people to
the study who have the information to address the research question is a key consideration in sampling.
Sampling is guided by the research question and will also influence data collection.
In qualitative research, different forms of non-random sampling, also known as non-probability sampling
(not everyone has the chance of being selected), are utilised.1 Using non-random sampling means the
likelihood of a potential research participant being selected is not known in advance. This form is limited
in generalisability; however, it aligns with qualitative research principles of sampling for meaning rather
than frequency. Qualitative researchers tend to say that qualitative research is not generalisable, but is
representative.1 While qualitative studies often include non-random sampling, simple random sampling
can be conducted when it is important to select a random set of participants from a large population, in
which everyone has the same chance of being selected. This could be done by randomly selecting names
from a telephone list or voter registration roll.
There are many ways to select a sample (sampling techniques). Among these are:
                                                                                         CHAPTER 29: RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLING | 208

Snowball sampling, whereby study participants recruit or refer people they know to the study. This
method is commonly used when potential participants can be hard to find through other means but
potential participants are likely known to each other. For example, drug users or patients with rare diseases
are likely to know others like themselves. This method may pose challenges for privacy because people may
not want to share their contacts.2

Convenience sampling, in which study participants are those most available to participate in the study.
Participants may be those who are easily accessible to the researchers - such as a practitioner who is a
member of a professional organisation and uses that organisation to recruit participants or patients at a
hospital where the researcher works. This method can introduce bias because participants are drawn from
within the researcher's own networks or spheres of influence.2

Purposive sampling, also known as purposeful sampling or selective sampling, involves the selection
of participants on the basis of their ability to provide in-depth and detailed information about the
phenomenon under investigation. For example, a study on the experience of working in a public hospital as
a frontline emergency nurse during the COVID-19 pandemic requires participants to be nurses, working
in an emergency department, having worked during the pandemic and at a public hospital. A general
practitioner, for example, could not provide in-depth information on the phenomenon being investigated.
This method may present challenges in locating potential participants because it can be difficult to find
participants who are able to provide in-depth information about the phenomenon being studied.2

Quota sampling is sometimes referred to as purposive sampling with more structure. Categories that are
important to the study and for which there is likely to be some variation are identified and then subgroups
are identified on the basis of each category. The researcher decides how many people to include from each
subgroup and collects data from that number of participants in each subgroup. This method requires the
investigator to have prior information about the sample. For example, in a study researching students and
their experience of attending university, many subgroups need to be considered; for example, those living
on or off campus, the course of study, faculty or discipline, age, gender identity, ethnicity and more. This
method can present a challenge to fill quotas for each category identified.2

Snowball, convenience purposive and quota sampling are the most commonly used techniques for
sampling in qualitative research. Other, less commonly used techniques include stratified sampling,
theoretical sampling, extreme case sampling, typical case sampling, systemic sampling and intensity
sampling. The technique used will depend on the research aim and questions.

Sample size in qualitative research

There are no clear guidelines for sample sizing in qualitative research. While researchers often propose
a sample size, in general it is not decided on prior to data collection, but rather when data
saturation occurs. Data saturation is a controversial concept because it is usually considered the point
at which no new data is identified in interviews or focus groups. Some qualitative researchers, such as
209 | CHAPTER 29: RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLING

Braun and Clarke4 hold that data saturation can never be fully achieved because each participant will have
something new to add to the data. For other researchers, data saturation is an acceptable concept, and
is often given as 8-17 participants.1,3 While 15 might be a proposed sample size for a study involving
interviews, when the researcher has completed 10 interviews they may feel they have reached saturation
as far as new themes or ideas are concerned. It is important to remember that sample size is not used to
generalise and validate findings5, but rather to ensure in-depth understandings of the phenomenon under
investigation.

Criteria for sampling

Another consideration in sampling is determining the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the study. This is
a standard practice in qualitative research and is used to define who will and will not be able to participate
in the study.6 For example, inclusion criteria might include gender identity, age and health diagnosis. People
who do not meet the inclusion criteria would not be eligible to participate in the study. Exclusion criteria
are more than simply the opposite of inclusion criteria; they cover specific factors such as not being able
to provide informed consent, using a specific type of medication, having a certain diagnosis and more.6
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are broad, and should not be so narrow that they limit the characteristics
of participants who can be recruited to the study.

Well-developed inclusion and exclusion criteria and well-considered sampling methods will assist
researchers with the next step, recruitment to the study.

What is recruitment?

Broadly speaking, recruitment to a research study involves presenting potential participants with detailed
information about the research to help them decide on whether to participate in the study. The
information presented during recruitment contributes to the consent process. Researchers who initiate
participant recruitment should have a basic knowledge about the research and be part of the study team.

Before any research is to commence, the study must have ethical approval from a human research ethics
committee. For academic researchers, this is the university's human research ethics committee. For
researchers outside the academic setting, it is the organisation that has been identified as the review agency.
For example, research conducted within a hospital setting is reviewed by the hospital's research ethics
committee or panel. Research ethics committees review applications against the benchmarks set out in the
National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Human Research.

As part of their data collection activities, researchers need to consider how they will invite research
participants (recruitment) and the process of consent (see Chapter 30).

Recruitment methods need to take account of whether participant contact information is available and
                                                                                         CHAPTER 29: RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLING | 210

if there is permission to use it for the purpose of the research. Having email, phone or in-person (e.g.
at a clinic) information will enable the researchers to correspond directly with potential participants,
to invite them to participate in the research. Most researchers do not have the contact information of
potential participants or are not able to contact them for the purpose of the research. In this instance, more
passive methods of recruitment are needed and need to take into account settings frequented by potential
participants, in-person or online. Passive methods of recruitment include advertising on social media,
posting flyers on clinic noticeboards to advertise the research, asking clinics, sporting clubs, social clubs,
schools, professional organisations, patient groups and other agencies to distrubute printed newsletters
or to send emails on behalf of the researcher. The author has been involved in many studies in which
contact details were not available. In a hospital study examining staff perceptions of how well a program
was implemented, the hospital sent out invitations to potential participants (hospital staff) on behalf of the
researcher. Staff who wished to participate were able to contact the investigators independently. In other
instances where no contact details were available, the author advertised for participants with the assistance
of peak bodies and community networks.

Recruiting participants through social media is increasingly common, but researchers need to be mindful
about privacy and public availability of information. For example, potential participants may believe their
comments in response to a recruitment advertisement on a social media platform are private, when in fact
the information they share is available or visible to all users on that platform, or to the public.

Problems that may be encountered during recruitment include (but are not limited to) participants who
are not fluent in English, participants who are hard to find and participants who do not trust research.
Researchers need to consider these challenges in their recruitment activities and adjust them as necessary.
Adjustments may include providing documents translated into the preferred language(s) of potential
participants, recruiting research staff who speak the language, being mindful of the gender identity of
research staff (e.g. women participants from some cultural backgrounds may prefer to deal with women
researchers) and ensuring the research purpose is clearly communicated.

Incentives for research participants

Sometimes recruitment can be enhanced by providing an incentive for participants. This approach must
be approved by the human research ethics committee before being offered to participants. Examples of
reasonable incentives include providing reimbursement for parking at a hospital, offering a gift/shopping
card or a coffee voucher for a nearby caf, in recognition of time spent participating in the study. Incentives
should not be excessive and therefore potentially coercive. The National Health and Medical Research
Council (NHMRC) provides guidance on incentives in research.

Examples of sampling and recruitment methods are presented in Table 29.1. Notice how often multiple
recruitment methods are used.

Strengths and challenges

Each sampling and recruitment method has strengths and challenges. The one chosen depends on the
study's research question(s) and aim(s). Choosing the appropriate methods will bring rigour to the
research, while choosing inappropriate methods will reduce rigour and affect the research results. Consider
a study in which women's experience of episiotomy is being sought.7 It may be possible to recruit many
women based on how relatively easy the birth was, or only a few women based on how willing the women
are to talk about the use of forceps during delivery. Or consider a descriptive qualitative study in which
up to 40 participants are recruited to provide slightly more generalisable results about an experience with a
health service.8 Each sampling and recruitment method is valid, depending on what is being researched.

Summary

Sampling refers to the selection of a suitable group of people from a broader population, to participate in
a study. Selecting the people suitable for the research study is important because that will affect the study's
findings. There are many ways to sample, and these depend on the research being undertaken as well as
the availability of participants. Recruitment refers to providing potential participants with information
213 | CHAPTER 29: RECRUITMENT AND SAMPLING

about the research and gaining their agreement to participate. There are many recruitment methods, and
the one(s) chosen depend on the research being undertaken as well as participant agreement to become
involved. Issues of privacy, confidentiality and consent need to be fully considered when sampling and
recruiting participants to a research study.

CHAPTER 30: ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND
CONSENT

   Danielle Berkovic

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand the 4 ethical principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and
                justice.
             Identify key challenges of informed consent in qualitative research.
             Articulate future directions for informed consent in emerging qualitative study
                designs.

What is consent?

In research, consent means that human participants enter research freely, with all information provided
about the research, and that consent is given before entering the research.1 The principle of informed
consent is formalised to ensure that relationships between the researcher and those participating in the
research are based on trust and integrity and to safeguard people's freedom to decide whether or not to
participate in research.1 There are 4 ethical principles that researchers must adhere to in health and social
care research: (1) autonomy, (2) beneficence, (3) non-maleficence and (4) justice.2 Consent needs to cover
each of these elements.

The origins of consent

After the Second World War, when it was discovered that doctors had conducted pseudoscientific medical
experiments on prisoners in Nazi Concentration Camps, the Nuremberg Code for research on human
subjects was established. The Code is composed of 10 principles, centred on the consent and autonomy of
215 | CHAPTER 30: ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND CONSENT

research participants, rather than researchers' objectives. The first principle of the Nuremberg Code is that
"the voluntary consent of the human subject is absolutely essential"3.

History is fraught with problems involving consent. One of the best-known studies is the Syphilis Study at
Tuskegee.4 In 1932, the United States (US) Public Health Service began a study in Tuskegee, Alabama to
record the natural history of syphilis in a socioeconomically deprived area known to have the highest rate of
syphilis in the US at that time. The study initially recruited 600 Black men. Participants were not given the
opportunity for informed consent; In fact, the researchers misled participants by telling the men that they
were being treated for `bad blood'. The researchers persuaded the men to participate in exchange for free
medical treatment, free meals and burial insurance. By 1943, when penicillin was discovered as an effective
treatment for syphilis, participants in the study were not told about or offered this treatment. Seven men
in the study died directly as a result of syphilis, and more than 100 are thought to have died from syphilis-
related complications.4

Today, consent is one of the most important considerations when recruiting participants for health and
social care research. The consent requirement serves the important function of safeguarding participants
from harmful interventions, and the provision of information is considered a prerequisite for potential
participants to make rational decisions concerning their involvement in research.5

Autonomy

Autonomy means that all persons have intrinsic and unconditional worth, and therefore should have the
power to make rational decisions and moral choices. Autonomy enshrines individual participants' rights
for self-determination. To maintain research participants' autonomy, researchers must ensure that consent
is informed. This means that prospective participants must be provided with detailed information about
what their participation will entail, with no undue influence.2

Informed consent

According to the Declaration of Helsinki,6 developed by the World Medical Association as a statement of
ethical principles for medical research involving human participants, adequate information for informed
consent must be comprehensible and meet the following criteria:

   The information should be given both verbally and in writing.
   The purpose and design of the research, what it means to participate, the advantages and

      disadvantages of participation, plans for the broader study overall, voluntary participation, and the
      unimpeded opportunity to withdraw, must be outlined to every participant.7

The term `informed consent' infers the past tense, or a completed process. This suggests that all
information is known and described at the onset of the study, which is a much clearer process in
                                                                                 CHAPTER 30: ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND CONSENT | 216

quantitative research than in qualitative research. This is because, as discussed in the data collection and
analysis sections of this textbook (section 3 and section 4), qualitative research is often iterative and evolves
as the research progresses. Some information about the research may therefore not be known at the start of
the study.8 To ensure that participants are provided with adequate opportunity to make autonomous and
informed decisions about their participation, the researcher can, for example, send the participant a list of
questions before the data collection takes place. Prospective participants can consider the tangential topics
that might ensue during the course of the study, and make an informed decision about their participation.

In her article, `The concept of informed consent in qualitative research',9 Dr Byrne describes semi-
structured interviews regarding compliance with antihypertensive medication. After a few interviews,
the researcher identified the need to investigate participants' sexual function, as sexual dysfunction is a
common side effect of these medications that can contribute to non-compliance. The researcher had not
included the subject matter of sexual dysfunction in the consent form initially provided to prospective
participants but had they known this private topic would arise, they may not have opted to consent.
This study exemplifies the dynamic aspects of qualitative research that require researchers' continuing
consideration of informed consent, in order to protect research participants. No participants withdrew
from the study, but the researcher reflected on the unforeseen discomfort caused to participants, in
contradiction to the principle of non-maleficence.

Beneficence

Beneficence means that researchers must act in the best interests of their participants - to their benefit. It
supports several moral rules to protect and defend the rights of participants, and to remove conditions that
will cause harm.2 The language of beneficence is positive; the principle calls for more than the avoidance
of harm: to purposely benefit research participants and to promote their welfare. Researchers consider
beneficence by:

   Assessing the risks of harm and the potential benefits of research to participants and to the wider
      community.

   Being sensitive to the welfare and interests of participants involved in their research.
   Reflecting on the social and cultural implications of their work.

Non-maleficence

Non-maleficence demonstrates the ethical tenet to do no harm to participants.2 The practical application
of non-maleficence is for the researcher to weigh up the potential benefits of the research versus the
potential burden on participants, to ensure that this balance is appropriate and to choose the best research
design and level of involvement for participants.

Until the 21st century, the concept of `do no harm' was primarily discussed among quantitative researchers
217 | CHAPTER 30: ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND CONSENT

following experiments conducted on humans and the risk of unforeseen physical and psychological harm.
In contrast, the harms appear to be minimal in qualitative research when researchers are talking to
participants, as opposed to executing an intervention. However, while the risk of physical harm is less
prominent in qualitative research, the risk of psychological discomfort is indeed present.10 Some qualitative
research is also interventional (see Chapter 7 on Action Research), and therefore non-maleficence must also
be considered in this context.

Justice

In general, justice is interpreted as the fair, equitable and appropriate treatment of research participants.2
Research that is just considers that:

   The scope and objectives of the proposed research, the selection, exclusion and inclusion of
      participants are fair.

   The process of recruiting participants is fair.
   There is no unfair burden on research participants.
   There is fair distribution of the benefits of participation in research.
   There is no exploitation of participants in the conduct of research.
   There is fair access to the benefits of research.

Informed consent in qualitative research

Houghton and colleagues have outlined 5 ethical challenges within the 4 principles of consent, specific
to qualitative research: (1) informed consent processes, (2) the participant-researcher relationship, (3)
continuously monitoring the risk-benefit ratio of the research, (4) confidentiality and (5) the dual role of
the clinician-researcher.11

Informed consent processes

As described earlier in this chapter, the traditional, one-off process of informed consent is not always
feasible in qualitative research, since the researchers may not be able to predict the direction of an interview
or focus group, based on the interpretivist nature of this approach. If previously unanticipated information
is discussed in the process of collecting data, the researcher should reiterate that the participant has the right
to withdraw from the study at any time. By reminding participants of this right, the researcher is bringing
the voluntary nature of autonomy and informed consent to the forefront and enshrining participants' right
to informed consent.

It can be challenging for researchers to know from whom consent is required. For example, ethnographic
studies (Chapter 9) often involve participant observation (Chapter 15). The question is whether the
researcher needs to gain consent from everyone being observed. What about people who are observed
                                                                                 CHAPTER 30: ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND CONSENT | 218

incidentally but are not part of the study? In her ethnographic study, Ethical conduct and the nurse
ethnographer: consideration of an ethic of care,12 Pauline Griffiths initially attempted to obtain written
informed consent from hospital patients while they were acutely unwell. Upon being approached patients
were apprehensive and concerned that they were about to experience additional medical intervention. It
was subsequently decided (in conjunction with the university and hospital human research ethic boards)
to seek verbal informed consent from certain patients who were not as unwell as others. This decision was
based on the principle of beneficence, and the fact that the researchers believed that written consent was
causing some participants needless anxiety.

In addition to the participants who are intended to be observed, conducting observational studies in a
public setting can pose other ethical challenges. There may be other people, such as visitors, who become
part of the observations, even if the intention is to only observe specific participants in the research. The
challenge lies in deciding from whom to obtain informed consent and by what means.11

The relationship between the researcher and the
participant

The relationship between the researcher and the participant is not as clear-cut in some qualitative research
settings as it is in quantitative research. When data is collected over a period of time, there is the
opportunity for participants and researchers to build a relationship. As the research progresses and
relationships grow, researchers must remain aware of the presence and nature of power, particularly power
imbalances between themselves and participants (and the potential effect of this on the participant), in
accordance with the principle of justice. Xu and colleagues, have reflected on this in an article examining
their experiences of obtaining informed consent in qualitative research.13 They identified that the
researcher-participant relationship should be discussed as part of the process of informed consent in
long-term qualitative studies, so that the researcher and the participant can decide together on a mutual
assessment of suitability for research participation.13

Risk-benefit ratio

Adhering to the principles of beneficence and non-maleficence involves calculating the level and extent of
risk, balanced with the potential benefits of research participation. It is important for researchers to convey
these principles to participants. That way, if unexpected topics arise within an interview or focus group
discussion, participants and researchers can have a conversation about whether this may cause harm or
distress, or whether the benefits of participation outweigh the potential harm.11 In essence, it is important
that the researcher is mindful of the effects of the research on the participant and should take appropriate
steps to minimise associated risks.
219 | CHAPTER 30: ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND CONSENT

Confidentiality

There are two main considerations for confidentiality in the context of qualitative research: when there
are multiple participants in a focus group, and when detailed descriptions are used to report participant
characteristics within a study.14 With regard to participant characteristics, researchers may need to use
pseudonyms and to be selective when describing defining characteristics of participants that could reveal
their identities. With regard to focus group confidentiality, the researcher should direct participants not to
discuss the focus group (including other participants and topics discussed) outside of the data collection
setting. At the same time, the researcher must stress that it is impossible to guarantee focus group
anonymity.

When it is difficult to gain informed consent

Up to this point, informed consent has been discussed in the context of potential participants who
are cognitively intact. However, many people who participate in research are from groups considered
vulnerable, or who may not have the capacity to provide informed consent. Some examples include, but are
not limited to15:

   Pregnant people
   People with cognitive impairment, intellectual disability, or mental illness such as dementia or

      schizophrenia
   People with impaired capacity for communication, including children
   People who are in hospital or reliant on others for care
   People who are incarcerated, or people on parole
   Children living in out-of-home care or foster care.

These populations should not be excluded from research based on their potentially limited capacity to
provide consent. Researchers have designed consent frameworks and checklists to facilitate participation
for these population groups. Following is an example of older people living with dementia.

Informed consent for people living with dementia

Dewing's consent framework for older people living with dementia16 prompts researchers to be mindful
during qualitative data collection of possible expressions of verbal, non-verbal and behavioural discontent,
disengagement and discomfort. This framework emphasises consent as well as the concept of assent, which
describes the ability to indicate a meaningful choice and a minimal level of understanding by those who
lack the capacity to provide obvious verbal or written consent.

Emerging challenges

Emerging data collection methods in qualitative research do not involve clear-cut participant involvement.
Examples include participant observation (Chapter 15) and social media research (Chapter 16), as well as
challenges that arise when working with vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations (Chapter 33). A group
of researchers aiming to identify considerations for making informed choices about engaging in qualitative
research in underrepresented populations identified 9 core values to consider.17

Conclusion

The 4 ethical principles of research are autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence and justice. Informed
consent must be included in each of these principles. Consent can be complex in qualitative research;
researchers must consider their relationship with the participant, the risk-benefit ratio and the processes
of continuous consent. Emerging populations and research designs have also given rise to new methods of
consent, which require consideration prior to conducting research.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand some of the factors that make populations hard to reach.
             Understand some of the ethical challenges associated with research involving hard-
                to-reach populations.
             Develop study protocols to mitigate some of the ethical challenges and to empower
                `hard-to-reach' populations to participate in research.

Who and what are hard-to-reach populations?

The term `hard to reach' is not well defined, but in general is used to refer to groups or populations that
are difficult to engage in research.1 The factors that make a population hard to reach are varied and may
reflect institutional barriers (e.g. gatekeeping by service providers or government bodies) and/or individual
characteristics of people within that population (e.g. homelessness, substance abuse, age, the presence
of disabilities, or people who highly dependent on medical care).1,2,3 Due to their hidden nature, these
populations are often excluded from research. This chapter focuses on the factors that can make certain
populations hard to reach and the ethical implications of not including vulnerable groups in research.

`Hard-to-reach' populations are typically considered vulnerable, marginalised and/or disenfranchised.
Normally, hard-to-reach populations are those that exist outside of the mainstream, such as people who
are homeless, children in Out-of-Home Care (OOHC), people in prison and people experiencing multiple
forms of disadvantage or hardship.3 Hard-to-reach populations can be characterised by significant histories
of trauma. Their interactions with systems of care and control have often exacerbated their trauma, leading
to increased wariness and suspicion of systems, services and institutions, including universities.3,4,5
                            CHAPTER 31: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CONDUCTING RESEARCH WITH HARD-TO-REACH
                                                                                                                                    POPULATIONS | 224

There are also certain personal characteristics, including age (specifically children) and the presence of
intellectual disabilities or cognitive impairments that can lead to groups being considered vulnerable and,
consequently, hard to reach.4,6,7,8

Contested terminology

While terms like `vulnerable', `marginalised' and `disadvantaged' are commonly used to describe hard-to-
reach populations, these terms are often ill-defined and contested.3,6 Vulnerability is not a static construct:
its definition depends on context and perspective. From a research governance perspective (i.e. research
ethics), vulnerability is equated with risk - risk to the vulnerable individual and risk to the organisation.7,9
This focus on managing risk creates its own set of challenges, including significant barriers that ultimately
exclude certain cohorts of people from research.

However, vulnerability - particularly when it is grounded in trauma - can coexist with risks that require
management or control. For example, children and young people who have experienced maltreatment are
considered highly vulnerable. These same children may exhibit challenging behaviours, including antisocial
and criminal activity.10 Vulnerability can therefore elicit compassion and protection, but only when it
conforms to certain stereotypes of what it means to be vulnerable.3

The attributions applied to vulnerable people may not reflect how people define themselves. The term
`vulnerability', for example, can connote weakness and frailty, or the need for protection. It can also be used
to imply that vulnerable people lack the capacity for self-protection and personal agency.4,6,11 Similarly,
the term `marginalised' has connotations of personal responsibility or personal failure.12 However,
marginalisation is a process of exclusion from the mainstream, driven by entrenched systemic and
structural inequities.13

The language we use to describe research participants is important and has implications for participants'
willingness to engage with our research. It may not be that populations are `hard to reach' but that our way
of thinking about and doing research needs to be more flexible, creative and inclusive.8

Table 31.1 provides a non-exhaustive list of groups that are typically considered vulnerable and
consequently hard to reach. It is important to note that many of the characteristics in the table are not
mutually exclusive. In fact, it is the intersection of multiple individual characteristics with institutional
barriers that render certain populations hidden and silenced.

                       research - perceived risk of causing distress.

As the information in Table 31.1 shows, from a research governance perspective vulnerability is framed
through a lens of risk: that participants will experience distress and trauma, that the safety of participants
and researchers is at risk and that there is potential for unethical conduct if the correct protocols are not in
place to ensure participants are able to provide free and informed consent.

Ensuring that risks are properly managed is an important element of all research. However, when
vulnerability is so narrowly equated with risk, people's agency - their right to determine whether they
want to participate in research - is eroded. In attempting to protect vulnerable participants from unethical
practices, we run the risk of excluding their voices from research, policy and practice.3,7

Institutional barriers

A group's perceived vulnerability can also be used by institutions - including research ethics committees,
service providers and statutory bodies (e.g. child protection, criminal legal systems) - to limit access to
participants. This is commonly referred to as `gatekeeping'.3,7,9

Often it is important to rely on the discretion of people who have a deep knowledge and understanding of
the group that is being approached to participate in research. As researchers, we may not always understand
the complexity of the lives of participants. Or we may be unprepared for the ways in which participants
respond to the research. `Gatekeepers' can provide important information to ensure that participants are
approached with sensitivity.

However, gatekeeping can also be a form of control, grounded in paternalistic ideals. This is particularly
evident with populations that are deemed simultaneously vulnerable and risky or dangerous. Box 31.1
provides an example of gatekeeping by statutory bodies on a project exploring the service needs and
experiences of mothers in prison.

Box 31.1: Barriers to recruiting criminalised women who have been pregnant and/
or given birth in prison
227 | CHAPTER 31: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CONDUCTING RESEARCH WITH HARD-TO-REACH
POPULATIONS

       This project involved in-depth interviews and focus groups with a range of stakeholders,
       including prison staff, lawyers, service providers and women with lived experience. Initially,
       ethics approval was sought to interview women in custody. Access to prisons was limited
       during multiple extended lockdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the corrections
       department's policies limited how criminalised women - including those on community-
       based orders or who had been released on parole - could participate in the study. For
       example, they could not be reimbursed for their time participating in the study. Women in
       custody could be invited to participate in the study, but their involvement had to be
       facilitated through the prison, and interviews had to occur online. This raised ethical,
       methodological and logistical concerns. For example, recruitment would need to be
       undertaken by prison staff as the researcher was not allowed on site. This meant that there
       was no way to guard against selection bias, or to minimise the potential for perceived
       coercion. It was also impossible to guarantee women's privacy during online interviews
       conducted within a custodial setting. This was especially concerning given the focus of the
       study on women's experience of the `care' they had received from the prison system during
       pregnancy and following childbirth. As none of these factors could be guaranteed, and as
       the prospect of future extended lockdowns remained the researchers decided to recruit
       women in the community, rather than attempting to access women in custody. The result
       was that the study did not capture the experiences of women who were in custody during
       the period of the study.

       Based on an unpublished research project undertaken by Tatiana Corrales (2021-2023)

Research involving vulnerable populations sometimes entails balancing competing ethical and practical
considerations. From a practical perspective, there are often external constraints linked to funding and
reporting timelines, that limit the amount of time that can be spent on recruitment activities. In these
situations, it is sometimes necessary to compromise certain elements of the study - in this case, giving voice
to women in custody - in order to safeguard the rights of vulnerable participants.

Gatekeeping may not represent an attempt to prevent certain groups of people from participating in
research. The reasons for gatekeeping are varied and in general are intended to protect vulnerable groups
from exploitation.9 However, whether intentionally or unintentionally, gatekeeping can contribute to a
population being hard to reach' This, in turn, can result in certain groups being excluded from research,
thereby diminishing their voices and making them increasingly hard to reach, in an endless loop.

The ethics of research with hard-to-reach populations

In Australia, the ethical conduct of human research is grounded in the principles of merit and integrity,
justice, beneficence and respect.17

There is a tension inherent in seeking to balance these principles. Ensuring that participants are not exposed
to, or directly caused, harm as a result of research is fundamentally important. However, participants also
have the right to decide whether they want to participate in research. This is embodied in the principle
of respect, which states that `respect for human beings involves giving due scope, throughout the research
process, to the capacity of human beings to make their own decisions.'17(p11) As researchers, we have an
ethical obligation to support vulnerable groups to be active participants in research.

Ethical research involves more than just managing risks. It is about genuine engagement with communities
and research participants, based on respect for their autonomy, dignity and expertise in their own lives. The
inclusion of people with lived experience in research project - from conceptualisation to dissemination
of findings - can be a powerful means of empowering vulnerable populations to be heard.18 The slogan
`nothing about us without us'18,19 highlights the importance of genuine engagement, ensuring that people
with lived experienced are consulted and included in every stage of research.

Additional ethical considerations with hard-to-reach
populations

   As far as practicable, engage people with lived experience early in the research process - preferably
      before you design the study.

   Include adequate and appropriate remuneration for lived-experience consultants and participants in
      the research budget. Consultants should be paid for their time as experts; research participants
      should be compensated for their time in a way that reflects their contribution. Participants should
      also be reimbursed for the cost of travel. Paying participants is a contentious area of research ethics.
      Some research ethics committees are not comfortable with high-value payments to participants, due
      to the risk that this will act as an inducement to participation, thereby limiting a participant's
      capacity to provide free and voluntary consent. What constitutes a `high-value' payment can be
      arbitrary, but in our research, $80 and $100 payments have been considered excessive by multiple
      ethics committees. However, high-value payments can be ethically justified as a means of recruiting
      and retaining research participants, and as a gesture that participants' views are valued.

   Develop thorough research protocols that explain how participant distress and participant safety, as
      well as researcher distress and safety, will be managed. Additional considerations may be needed,
      depending on the nature of the population. For example, when undertaking research with families
      involved in the child protection system, it is important to consider:
          the potential for extreme levels of distress among participants, including threats of suicide
          legal obligations on the research team to report suspected child maltreatment to relevant
229 | CHAPTER 31: ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN CONDUCTING RESEARCH WITH HARD-TO-REACH
POPULATIONS

            authorities, and how this will be managed
          how the research team will manage participant disclosures of harm perpetrated against them.
   Ethics should always be about more than managing risk. Ethical research with hard-to-reach
      populations is fundamentally about valuing the perspectives of people who are often excluded from
      research. It is about respecting their autonomy to choose whether they want to participate in a study,
      and about creating safe spaces that will enable their participation.
   There are unique considerations that apply to research with or about First Nations Peoples. Chapter
      19 explores this in more detail.

Summary

Undertaking research with hard-to-reach populations can be challenging. Despite these challenges, it is
important that researchers attempt to engage with these populations as they have too often been rendered
invisible in research and policy discussions. Rather than only seeing their vulnerability and marginalisation
as evidence of risk, we should be working to empower the silenced and invisible members of society to
contribute to and participate in research. The experiences and perspectives of hard-to-reach populations
are valuable in their own right. They also have the power to broaden our understanding and develop more
creative and meaningful solutions to entrenched structural problems.

CHAPTER 32: LOOKING AFTER YOURSELF

   Danielle Berkovic

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe the emotional burden of qualitative research.
             Identify strategies to cope with the emotional responses of participants in qualitative
                research.
             Learn how to look after yourself during the qualitative research process.

Why do qualitative researchers need to look after
themselves?

As described throughout this textbook, qualitative research for health and social care spans many
disciplines and topics. Each individual researcher brings their own lens and experiences to the qualitative
landscape, and some research topics may require the researcher to undertake emotional work. This type
of research can be highly demanding in terms of mental, emotional or physical energy, at the expense of
the researcher's health or wellbeing.1 For example, Chapters 9 and 10 describe two potentially emotionally
charged phenomenological and ethnographical studies: one investigating abused mothers' lived experiences
and another seeking to understand the perspectives of women who use drugs intravenously.

What types of emotions might qualitative researchers
experience?

The Economic & Social Research Council (ESCR), the ESCR National Centre for Research Methods
and Qualiti (all UK-based organisations) led the Commissioned Inquiry into the Risk to Well-being
of Researchers in Qualitative Research.2 They identified six emotional and psychological `risks' that
qualitative researchers should be aware of (Table 32.1):
                                                                                              CHAPTER 32: LOOKING AFTER YOURSELF | 232

Resistance
                 Working in unfamiliar settings can heighten a researcher's sense of isolation; for example, during
                 an extended period of data collection in an unfamiliar country. The research topic itself can also
                 have an isolating effect on the researcher.

                 Some participants can be uncooperative or obstructive to the research process, and gatekeepers
                 may represent barriers to access.

The role of bracketing

Given the emotional and psychological risks, it is important for those undertaking qualitative research
to understand their positionality (see Chapter 26) with regard to the research topic. Researchers should
undertake a bracketing exercise (described in Chapter 26) to identify their personal strengths and
weaknesses, and potential biases, so they might learn about the types of research that have potential to
cause distress. Fenge and colleagues found that researchers with social work or psychology backgrounds
who conduct research in the same field can especially benefit from identifying their positionality when
working with high-risk populations, such as sex offenders in the criminal justice system or survivors of
family violence.3

Summary

It is important for researchers to look after themselves, especially while undertaking qualitative research
that is emotionally challenging. There are different techniques researchers can use to help them cope with
research that is personally challenging, including finding the self-care methods that work for them.

PRIVACY

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Describe confidentiality and privacy.
             Understand how to ensure confidentiality and privacy in research.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of confidentiality and privacy.

What is confidentiality?

Confidentiality is an agreement to keep something private or secret. In research, it follows on from consent
in that seeks to protect participants' identifiable data. When participants provide informed consent to the
researcher, an agreement is formed that the participant's identifying information will not be available to
anyone outside the research team unless specifically agreed to.1
Identifying information includes names, personal information and responses to the research. Any private
information about a participant that they do not want shared with others is considered confidential.2
Researchers should provide the highest level of confidentiality, which includes defaulting data status to
anonymous, ensuring participants provide informed consent and enabling participants to review and
correct their data.2
There are many laws, regulations and conventions that must be adhered to when conducting research,
and confidentiality is covered under these legal requirements. In Australia, these include federal legislation
such as The Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), and state and territory regulations that apply where the research is
conducted, such as The Health Records Act 2001 (Vic.). The National Statement on Ethical Conduct in
Human Research (2007) (National Statement)3 sets out guidelines for research with humans, in accordance
with the National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992 (Cth).
                                                                                       CHAPTER 33: CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY | 236

Universities, hospitals and other healthcare organisations have ethical guidelines for research, protocols
for research governance and human research ethics committees, all of which include confidentiality and
privacy as an important consideration. For example, Monash University has published A Guide to Good
Research Practice4, which provides staff and students with the latest national and international guidance for
ethical and responsible conduct in research. The Australian departments of Defence and Veterans Affairs
have a joint human research ethics committee to approve any research undertaken with or about current
and past defence personnel and their families. Private organisations such as Bellberry Ltd5 act as human
research ethics committees for researchers who are conducting their research outside the academic and
hospital sectors. When research studies are approved by a research ethics committee, the confidentiality
considerations are fully scrutinised.

The importance of ensuring confidentiality cannot be overstated for researchers and healthcare
practitioners, and there are many ethical challenges associated with confidentiality. An example is a paper
by Duncan and colleagues6, in which a researcher interviewed a 15-year-old participant. The researcher
assured the young man that his answers were confidential, and the participant told the researcher that
he did not want his mother to know about the interview. During the interview, however, the participant
disclosed issues with adhering to medication that caused the researcher to question whether these issues
should be disclosed to the participant's mother and treating physician.

After lengthy discussion with the research team and examining all possible options, the researcher
telephoned the young man and suggested that he tell his mother about the medication adherence issue.
The ethics committee that approved the research was also notified of this ethical grey area and how it
was resolved. Ultimately, the research team remained unsure that they had made the correct decision
about maintaining confidentiality. They were not sure whose interests were being served by maintaining
confidentiality. It is important that researchers are acutely aware of issues regarding confidentiality and
autonomy when undertaking research with young people and hard-to-reach groups (see Chapter 31).

In a study by Veness and colleagues, more than 8000 public complaints to regulators, citing concerns about
healthcare providers and confidentiality, were examined. The study found that mental health practitioners
had significantly higher rates of complaints than other health practitioners about confidentiality.7 The
authors suggested that this may be due to the frequency with which mental health practitioners discuss
patient care with others. They also suggest, however, that the findings may be indicative of practitioners'
failure to explain the limits of confidentiality. Confidentiality with focus groups is discussed later in the
chapter.

Families can also influence confidentiality arrangements, such as when participants have not given
permission to share their confidential genetic information with family members. An example is a study by
Dheensa and colleagues8, in which researchers encounter a participant with prostate cancer and a family
history of breast cancer. The researchers needed to consider if and how information about the BRCA2
mutation could be confidentially communicated to the participant's sister. In the same example, a research
237 | CHAPTER 33: CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY

participant could breach confidentiality if they shared health information about another person with a
heathcare professional without that person's consent.

The number of people recruited to a study can also play a role in undermining confidentiality. In a study
with younger people9, Taylor and colleagues found the number of participants recruited to the study was
considered too small by some specific departments that were involved in recruitment. The concern was that
participants could be identified on the basis of their responses, and the departments refused to participate
in the study.

While confidentiality can appear to be straightforward, as with any ethical issue, there are many ambiguities
and nuances that researchers need to be able to work through successfully.

What is privacy?

In research, information privacy is the right to control how one's personal information is collected, used or
disclosed. Privacy is acknowledged as a fundamental human right in Australia.10 According to The Privacy
Act 1988 (Cth), personal information includes but is not limited to any personal information that a health
service provider collects, including health records, wishes about future health services, genetic information
and research data.

When conducting research, the primary concern is ensuring participants' involvement in research is
protected and the appropriate settings are considered for recruitment, enrolment and data collection.1
Researchers need to collect some personal information from participants, but human research ethics
committees usually recommend that the only data collected should be that which is necessary for the
research. Exemptions from specific requirements of the Privacy Act may be approved by a human research
ethics committee; however, such exemptions are rarely sought for qualitative research studies because
participants usually participate with the understanding that their information and status will remain
private as written in the patient information and consent form provided to participants. Privacy can
be ensured by only collecting personal information that is necessary for the study, and collecting that
information in a considered manner. Up-to-date data systems, policies and document management
protocols can ensure the quality of privacy in research.

In a systematic review of the perception of respect for and dignity of inpatients11, the authors found that
violations of patients' dignity and privacy were fairly routine. One example of a privacy violation included
providing a patient list to third parties for religious visits, without consent.11 While this may be a regular
practice, it is also a violation of privacy if the patient has not consented.

Purdue University in the United States has developed an excellent infographic1 that explains the differences
between confidentiality, privacy and anonymity.

Strengths and limitations of confidentiality and privacy

Confidentiality and privacy are enshrined in research activities as being of the utmost importance to
researchers and participants. When done properly, participants can be assured that their private
information will not be shared without their consent, and they will not be identifiable in research results.
A high level of concern for confidentiality and privacy can lead to greater trust between researchers and
participants. Australian government organisations such as the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the
Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) use the Five Safes Framework12, an internationally
recognised approach to considering strategic, privacy, security, ethical and operational risks. The
Framework is produced in Table 33.1. While not all research data needs this level of scrutiny for privacy
and confidentiality, the Framework is a good starting point for considering whether research data is private
and secure.

Confidentiality has limitations. Researchers must respect the promise of confidentiality while
disseminating results that participants may fear might identify them. It is not uncommon for researchers to
discover that participant concerns around privacy and confidentiality are barriers to recruitment.13

Focus groups pose an increased risk to privacy and confidentiality because participants may identify
themselves and provide private information in the group setting. Focus group guidelines (see Chapter 14)
about privacy and confidentiality should be made clear before discussion commences.

Some of the limitations of privacy include the use of digital platforms. Data leaks and the ability to identify
participants are potential risks.14 With more research being conducted online and recruitment taking place
through social media, there is greater risk of privacy breaches. Recruitment through a social network on
Facebook (Meta), for example, poses many issues for privacy because internet provider (IP) addresses could
                                                                                       CHAPTER 33: CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY | 240

be used to identify participants, and the phrases people use in their posts and comments could be searched
to identify participants.15

Summary

Confidentiality and privacy are core ethical principles for researchers and must be clearly discussed with
participants. Regulations must be followed, and approval must be sought and provided by human research
ethics committees. While there are limitations to confidentiality and privacy, when researchers follow
regulations and guidelines, they can assure participants that their information will be safe.

CHAPTER 34: DATA STORAGE AND
ACCESS

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand the importance of data storage and access in the context of qualitative
                research.
             Identify the types of data that require considered management processes.

Why do data storage and access matter?

Managing qualitative data requires designated structures and systems, for two main reasons: (1) to protect
participants' privacy, confidentiality and anonymity, and (2) to organise data in a way that makes it easily
accessible and retrievable. 1 Data may include, but may not be limited to, consent forms and demography
of participants, interview and/or focus group transcripts, audiotapes or videotapes, researcher notes and
other types of data described in Section 3 (e.g. River of Life drawings and diagrams, social media data).
Storing qualitative data appropriately enables researchers to manage data that may have been accumulated
in various forms, at different points in time and across multiple locations for different research purposes,
all while maintaining the security of the data. It is therefore recommended that researchers establish
appropriate data management protocols at the outset of a research project and use a reflective process to
better systemise their data (see Table 34.1).

Data storage policies

Researchers should be mindful of their university's or institution's data management policies. In Australia,
the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) provide guidelines supporting the
Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research, and researchers are required to adhere to the
243 | CHAPTER 34: DATA STORAGE AND ACCESS

access and storage policies outlined in the document. For example, the Code states that researchers must
`retain clear, accurate, secure and complete records of all research including research data and primary
materials'. 2 The NHMRC outlines two key reasons for appropriately storing data:

   Retention and publication: Enable the justification of the outcome of the research and facilitates
      sharing of the published findings. Primary qualitative data may be of cultural or historical value, or
      provide important insight into certain communities, so researchers should consider appropriate
      avenues through which to store their data. Published data also often requires some type of metadata,
      and although this is less applicable to qualitative research, data collection tools such as interview
      guides or researcher reflections may be appropriate to keep.

   Managing confidential and other sensitive information: Unless specified otherwise in the
      participant information sheet, prospective research participants usually participate in research with
      guaranteed endeavours to protect their anonymity. Researchers are responsible for enshrining this
      right by appropriately storing consent forms with names either in a locked filing cabinet or scanned
      and in a password-protected folder. Individual universities and institutions will have their own
      policies about this and it is always important to check this at the outset of your research when
      coming up with your data storage and access policies. What can also come under this is allocating
      pseudonyms for participants in interview transcripts.

Universities and other research institutions have policies that explain how qualitative data must be stored,
the length of time that it should be stored for, and guidelines on when electronic archives are to be
erased and physical archives are to be destroyed. In particular, electronic data should be stored on a
secure server that is only accessible by the researchers named on the ethics application. Some Human
Research Ethics Councils will not approve studies that use servers and/or storage services located outside of
Australia, for example, Dropbox. These are standard research governance policies, which researchers must
be aware of, and vital step in the research process that research ethics committees will also consider prior
to approval. In addition, most universities or other research institutions will mandate that data storage
and management processes are detailed in the participant information sheet or consent forms provided to
prospective participants. 3 What to do with these sheets, in addition to other research materials, is provided
in Table 34.1, based on the authors' experiences in conducting qualitative research.

Differences between sharing `raw' qualitative and
245 | CHAPTER 34: DATA STORAGE AND ACCESS

quantitative data

As qualitative research gains prominence and is increasingly published in high-impact journals, the concept
of data sharing is being discussed among journal editors, manuscript reviewers and researchers. Raw
qualitative data - data that has not yet been analysed or aggregated - is distinct from raw quantitative
data; how to adequately share qualitative data without compromising participant anonymity is a key
consideration. Four challenges and potential solutions for sharing qualitative data are described here:4

   Qualitative data is unique: Qualitative data lends itself to generating new theoretical or practical
      insights about a phenomenon of interest, in greater detail than is possible through quantitative
      research. This qualitative data is usually not collected in linear fashion. Thus, the measure of
      reliability in quantitative research (e.g. producing the statistical code used to analyse anonymised
      data) does not translate to qualitative data. Instead, researchers may describe verification strategies
      for how analytic codes were developed, produce reporting checklists or calculate inter-rater reliability
      for comparing similarities between data coders.

   Reproducible research and qualitative data: The iterative nature of qualitative data collection,
      analysis and interpretation means that the process of data verification is challenging. This is
      dissimilar to quantitative research, where enough detail about the methods should be described to
      ensure it is independently reproducible. This concept is not transferrable to qualitative research; for
      example, even if an interview or focus group is audio-recorded, the recording cannot show the body
      language of participants, which may contribute data on their emotional response to a particular
      topic of discussion. Sharing qualitative data for reproducibility purposes is unlikely to produce the
      same results, as each population group, and even the same population group on a different day, are
      likely to contribute different data.

   Preserving the anonymity of participants: Maintaining participants' anonymity is a pillar of
      qualitative research ethics, and so all data collected would need to be de-identified prior to sharing.
      Although this may be possible, it places undue burden on the participant to ask that their entire de-
      identified transcript be made publicly available, as their experiences alone may be identifying, or at
      least sensitive. De-identifying data for the purpose of data sharing also introduces unnecessary
      potential for human error and inconsistency, which in turn risks the participants' privacy and the
      broader population's confidence to participate in qualitative research. Certain types of studies are at
      particular risk of deductive disclosure, especially where participants are from easily identifiable
      minority groups or specialised professions. Instead of a data-sharing policy, researchers could be
      required to follow procedures that enhance transparency; for example, disclosing the transcription
      methods employed and the processes for analytic code development and determination of the final
      themes in the study's findings). Supporting the study's findings with an adequate number of quotes
      in research publications is also key.

   Other unintended consequences of qualitative data sharing: The burden of organising
      qualitative data to the extent that it is ready for external review is likely to exceed the time and effort
      required to write a report for publication. Given that qualitative research aims to convey people's
                                                                                            CHAPTER 34: DATA STORAGE AND ACCESS | 246

      experiences, it could be argued that the researcher's energy should first and foremost focus on
      displaying the data and interpreting its meaning. Journals should consider the possibility that, in
      response to data-sharing policies, participants and researchers may alter their questions and
      responses, similarly to how participants might alter their behaviour to be considered more `desirable'
      if they are being observed by a researcher.

Summary

Ensuring that qualitative data is managed, stored and appropriately accessible is a key part of the research
process, and should be considered by researchers at the outset of the project.

FINDINGS

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand the important elements to include when communicating your qualitative
                research.
             Describe approaches to presenting qualitative data.

Formats for communicating qualitative research

It is not uncommon for qualitative researchers to complete data collection and analysis and then to be
overwhelmed by the amount of data that has been collected. Presenting data in a meaningful way can be
a challenge. Unlike quantitative research, which can use tables, charts and figures to succinctly present
research results, qualitative research typically requires a narrative to describe and explain the themes and
findings of the research, which may involve the presentation of quotes to illustrate the themes or findings
(see Chapter 26).
The main formats for communicating qualitative research are:

   Research thesis - in Australia, examples include honours thesis (approximately 10 months of
      research, resulting in 10,000-15,000 words); masters thesis (12-24 months of research,
      10,000-30,000 words) and doctor of philosophy (PhD) thesis (3-4 years of research, 60,000-90,000
      words and may include publications). The benefits of presenting research in a thesis include having
      the space (word count) and flexibility to write about the qualitative research process and results. For
      example, in Chapter 26, all the examples about how to write about rigour were from a PhD thesis,
      which demonstrates that the student was able to write about rigour in greater detail than would have
249 | CHAPTER 35: COMMUNICATING YOUR FINDINGS

      been possible in other formats.
   Conference presentation - typically, the background, methods, results and discussion/

      implications of the research need to be demonstrated within a 10-20-minute presentation.
      Depending on the study, it can be challenging to present all the research in such a short time, and
      hence researchers often choose to address just one or two of the study's research questions and focus
      on the results that address these.
   Poster - a conference poster provides the opportunity to present study results visually, in charts and
      figures, and to incorporate quotes from participants to illustrate. As with the conference
      presentation, a poster is limited to providing a high-level summary rather than much detail (see
      Figure 35.1 as an example).

   Academic journal or book publication - most researchers wish to publish their research in
      academic journals and books. Journal requirements differ between disciplines. Throughout the
      chapters of this textbook, we have provided links to published qualitative research across health and
      social care journals. These articles demonstrate the diversity of qualitative research in published
      form. Every journal provides an outline of its focus and scope (see `About the Journal' on the
      journal's homepage), including the types of research it is interested in publishing. The Instructions
      to Authors page guides prospective authors on the types of articles the journal publishes (e.g.
      original research, opinion, short reports, letters to the editor), word limits, guides to writing style and
      formatting requirements. Examples of journal websites that provide journal information and author
      guidance include:

Styling and formatting qualitative research for
publication

The main structure for presenting research in any form is known as IMRAD, which stands for
introduction, methods, results and discussion. An outline of each of these sections is provided here,
tailored specifically to the presentation of qualitative research:

Introduction

The introduction covers the why of the research by describing the background, research problem, brief
literature review, the framework or theory (optional) and posits the research aim and/or question and/or
objectives. See, for example:

   Misconceptions and the acceptance of evidence-based non-surgical interventions for knee
      osteoarthritis. A qualitative study2

   Barriers and challenges affecting the contemporary church's engagement in health promotion3

Methods

The methods section details the research process (when, where and how the was study done), including
the research design and philosophical underpinnings, research setting, population, participant selection,
recruitment, data collection, analysis, reflexivity and ethical considerations and approval. As discussed in
Chapter 26, it is important to provide enough information about the methods so that the reader can make
sense of the results. A useful process, particularly in providing information about data collection, is to
include a table showing how data was collected, including relevant activities or questions. See, for example:

   Co-designing a patient support portal with health professionals and men with prostate cancer: an
      action research study4 (see Table 1)

   Barriers and enablers to intervention uptake and health reporting in a water intervention trial in
      rural India: a qualitative explanatory study5 (see Tables 1 and 2)

   The primary care experience of adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). An
      interpretative phenomenological inquiry.6 (The methods section includes a good example of how to
      write about reflexivity and researcher positionality.)

Results
251 | CHAPTER 35: COMMUNICATING YOUR FINDINGS

The results section explains and interprets the data generated from the research. The first part of the
results section describes the participants (demographics), dates when data were collected and duration of
interviews, focus groups or observations. The next part presents the themes of the study with a narrative,
explains the themes of the study and provides supporting quotes. There are several ways themes can
be presented: in diagrammatic form, tabular form and/or in narrative form throughout the paper. The
decision of how to present the results depend on the journal's word limit and table requirements. In
general, if the word limit is low (up to 3000 words), then quotes tend to be presented in tables. If the
word limit is higher (up to 8000 words), then quotes can be woven throughout the results section. See, for
example:

   When immunosuppression and COVID-19 intersect: an exploratory qualitative study of young lung
      transplant recipient perceptions of daily life during a pandemic7 (See supplementary table 1 for the
      themes and quotes. The results are presented in a narrative format, with an explanation of the theme
      with quotes in the text.)

   `I literally had no support': barriers and facilitators to supporting the psychosocial wellbeing of
      young people with mental illness in Tasmania, Australia8 (Figure 1 is a diagram with an overview of
      the themes.)

As you may observe in the examples given, qualitative researchers do not use percentages when describing
themes. Since data collection is flexible and adaptable to the participant group, not all participants may be
asked the same questions in the same way. Hence, it is not a structured form of data collection that enables
percentages to be presented. While researchers may indicate the number of participants who described a
particular experience, they rarely quantify this further; rather, they seek to describe, compare and contrast
participants' responses, using words such as some, others, most, all, a few.

Choosing quotes

The quotes in the narrative presentation and the tables should illustrate the study's themes. This includes
providing ordinary quotes, unexpected quotes, hard-to-classify quotes (or negative case quotes) and minor
quotes to illustrate minor themes.

Editing quotes

Quotes from the transcript may be hard to follow and messy to read. Researchers tend to edit quotes for
clarity, while being careful to not change the meaning of the quote.

For example, this original, unpublished quote from the 6-PACK pre-implementation study is lengthy, with
some statements that are irrelevant to the study's findings9:

         To some extent, some falls are unpreventable... But the majority of times, things can be done to
         prevent them. Accidents don't just [happen], you're walking down the street [and] your high
         heel breaks, you fall. You can't say you're going to prevent that... I think sometimes with some of
                                                                                    CHAPTER 35: COMMUNICATING YOUR FINDINGS | 252

         the elderly that, yes, they're elderly and they're demented, but we should be aware that they're a
         higher risk of falling and implement things so [they don't fall]. Having the buzzer close by, having
         adequate lighting, having adequate railing and stuff around [will help prevent falls]. [unpublished
         quote]

The same example has been edited; it uses ellipses (...) to indicate when a sentence has been redacted and
square brackets to indicate when the researcher has inserted their own words to provide clarity:

         To some extent, some falls are unpreventable... But in the majority of times, things can be done
         to prevent them... yes, they're elderly and [have dementia], but we should be aware that they're a
         higher risk of falling and implement things so [they don't fall]. Having the buzzer close by, having
         adequate lighting, having adequate railing and stuff around [will help prevent falls]. [unpublished
         quote]

Presenting the quotes

If the quote is 40 words or longer, it should be presented as a `block quote', which is an indented paragraph
placed after the description of the quote. If the quote is just a few words, it can be integrated into a
descriptive paragraph. This can be seen on page 9 of the article by Ayton and colleagues on the pre-
implementation study of the 6-PACK falls prevention intervention.9 The bold text in the block quote
following indicates the theme and the bold text in italics indicates a subtheme. Quotes in italics (or
within a single quotation mark) are woven into the explanation of the theme. The final quote is presented
separate from the main text as it is longer and brings together the points that have been made in the
descriptive paragraph.9

         Engaging staff in falls prevention. As highlighted by one senior staff participant, staff
         engagement is important and can be facilitated through `engaging hearts and minds'--both the
         emotional and logical aspects of falls prevention. Nurses described feeling guilty, stressed and
         distressed when a patient under their care experienced a fall. They also described the worry
         experienced if a patient suffered a fall-related injury. The emotional impact of a patient fall
         was seen as something that could be a motivating factor. A senior staff member at one hospital
         highlighted that nurses responded to interventions that emphasised the benefit to the patient.
         This also had implications for sustaining the project long term:

                  If you always promote it as best for the patient and patient-focused you'll get staff on-
                  board, and continuing to help drive the program. You've got to be able to sell it to them...
                  first of all say this is going to be so much better for your patient outcomes. (SS1, H1)9(p10)

Discussion

The discussion section revisits the study's aims, research questions and objectives and then presents the
implications of the results within the context of the broader academic literature base. The discussion
also includes the strengths and limitations of the study, and implications of the study or future research
253 | CHAPTER 35: COMMUNICATING YOUR FINDINGS

directions. In some social science journals and book, the results and discussion sections may be combined.
See, for example:

   Boundary breaches: the body, sex and sexuality after stoma surgery10 (The results and discussion are
      presented together with concluding remarks at the end.)

   Exploring the partnership networks of churches and church-affiliated organisations in health
      promotion2 (The results and discussion are combined, including the section on strengths and
      limitations, with a conclusion at the end. This paper also provides a good example of the use of
      diagrams.)

In the discussion section, it is important to demonstrate that the research questions and aims have been
addressed. Some researchers adopt their research questions as subheadings in the discussion. The
discussion positions the research within the research discipline and published research, and presents
research implications.

Considerations in determining publication of qualitative
research

   Explore different journal types. Look at the reference list you have included in your paper and
      note which journals are mentioned often. This will provide a good rationale for submitting to one of
      those journals.

   Research the journal. Once you have chosen a journal to submit to, consider whether it has
      published qualitative research. Does it have reviewers or an editorial board member who is
      experienced in qualitative research? Read the author guidelines closely for guidance on submitting
      qualitative research, in terms of word limits, presentation style and reporting tools required (see
      Chapter 36 for details on reporting tools).

   Check the journal's data-sharing requirements. Consider whether you can ethically meet these
      requirements. For example, Plos ONE requires authors to make their raw, de-identified data available
      (see https://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/data-availability)

   Find an example to guide your submission. After you have identified the journal you wish to
      submit your paper to, find a qualitative research article that has been recently published in that
      journal (it does not need to be in the same topic area as your research). Use this article as a template
      to guide how you prepare your introduction, methods, results, discussion and conclusion.

   Persevere. It is not unusual to have to submit to a few journals before finding the right home for
      your article. Take on reviewer feedback (see Chapter 37) and seek advice from colleagues and peers
      about where to submit.
         CHAPTER 35: COMMUNICATING YOUR FINDINGS | 254

Summary

Communicating qualitative research requires the researcher to consider the form of communication and
to tailor the data, results and presentation to suit the format (thesis, conference presentation, journal
paper) and the needs of the audience. When presenting qualitative research, typically the IMRAD format
is followed. Considering how to present data - whether in narrative form or using tables and diagrams - is
often contingent on the journal's requirements.

CHAPTER 36: REPORTING TOOLS

   Tess Tsindos

       Learning outcomes
       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:

             Describe the main reporting tools used in qualitative research.
             Understand how to use the main reporting tools.
             Identify the strengths and limitations of each reporting tool.

What is a qualitative reporting tool?

Generally speaking, a tool is something that helps someone complete a task. Qualitative reporting tools
are usually checklists or frameworks that help researchers demonstrate to publishing journals that they
have followed a comprehensive process in reporting on their research. Qualitative reporting tools provide
detailed information on the research team, study methods, context of the study, findings, data analysis and
interpretations. Although using these tools could be considered unnecessary, they can help in planning the
study as well as with reflexivity.

The main reporting tools used in qualitative research

There are three main reporting tools academic journals use to ensure comprehensive reporting and
transparency in reporting qualitative results. These are the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative
Research (COREQ),1 the Standards for Reporting Qualitative Research (SRQR)2, and the Johanna Briggs
Checklist for Qualitative Research (JBI).3 A fourth tool, the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP),
a qualitative research checklist,4 is also helpful for researchers, although not required by journals. While
using these checklists might seem onerous, they are very helpful in focusing the researcher on improved
reporting of qualitative research.
257 | CHAPTER 36: REPORTING TOOLS

COREQ

The COREQ1 is a 32-item checklist that is designed to help researchers report on their results. It is divided
into three domains: research team and reflexivity (8 items), study design (15 items), and analysis and
findings (9 items). Many journals request the author(s) complete this checklist and submit it with their
manuscript. While it is a lengthy checklist, it is not difficult to complete. The first step in completing
the tool is to ensure the manuscript is submitted with line numbers; this is easily done by clicking `Line
numbers' in the layout tab in Microsoft Word. Once the lines are numbered, the researcher is able to refer
to the line number(s) containing the information being requested. Once completed, the checklist should
be uploaded to the journal site as a separate document.

Strengths and limitations of COREQ

A strength of COREQ is that qualitative research is clearly and transparently presented. Reviews of
COREQ have highlighted ambiguity in reporting, which could be due to the subjective nature of the
items; ethical concerns not being adequately addressed in the checklist; and while the checklist might be
completed, the research may still be of poor quality.5

SRQR

The SRQR2 consists of 21 items and `aims to improve the transparency of all aspects of qualitative
research by providing clear standards for reporting qualitative research'(p1245). It includes the article title
and abstract; problem formulation and research question; research design and methods of data collection
and analysis; results, interpretation, discussion and integration; and other information. The checklist is
completed along the same lines as COREQ, by providing answers based on line numbers. Once completed,
the checklist is uploaded to the journal site as a separate document.

Strengths and limitations of the SRQR

Strengths of the SRQR are that it is moderate in length, highly transparent in purpose and claims to
consider all qualitative research methodologies equally. The tool was developed through a systematic
consideration of existing tools and is appropriate for use by experienced qualitative researchers. Limitations
are that it is unclear whether SRQR truly considers all qualitative methodologies equally10and that it does
not explicitly mention a conceptual framework.6

JBI

JBI3 provides a means for assessing the quality of a study for the possibility of bias in design, conduct and

research flow from the analysis and interpretation of the data. The tool does not ask for line numbers
as evidence; rather, it provides checkboxes to confirm items. This checklist is often used as supporting
evidence for systematic reviews (evidence synthesis).

Strengths and limitations of JBI

JBI's focus on congruity of results is considered both a strength and a limitation.7-9 This brings attention to
the study's philosophical perspective, methodology, research questions and researcher reflexivity but comes
at the expense of comprehensiveness. Brevity, ease of use and clarity mean that JBI can be used by less
experienced researchers.9

CASP

CASP comprises 10 questions divided into three categories: Are the results of the study valid? What are the
results? Will the results help locally?4 This checklist was designed to be used as an educational pedagogic
tool, and is used for quality appraisal in health-related qualitative evidence syntheses.

Strengths and limitations of CASP

CASP has been described as of the most commonly used checklist or criteria-based tools for quality
appraisal in health and social care-related qualitative evidence syntheses.8 CASP comprises only 10 items
and has been criticised for not including items that provide a rationale for sample size and recall bias,
and relatively minimal use of the participant voice.8 A further limitation is that the tool may prioritise a
quantification of quality over content, which can lead to questionable interpretations of quality. Another
limitation is that although it is promoted as a good tool for novice researchers, in fact the researchers need
help in determining what constitutes good quality qualitative research.8 A new question about the study's
underlying theoretical, ontological and epistemological frameworks could be incorporated to strengthen
the tool.9

Summary

Four qualitative reporting tools have been introduced with brief discussion of how to use them. Each is tool
has its uses, and journals usually request one of these tools be completed when submitting a manuscript
for publication. Each tool has strengths and limitations. The overarching limitation is that requiring all
researchers to adhere to a single standard is restrictive for such a broad field of enquiry. However, all
research should be transparently reported, and each tool presents a solid way of reviewing qualitative
research to ensure a study has been rigorously appraised.

     Learning outcomes

       Upon completion of this chapter, you should be able to:
             Understand the review process for manuscripts submitted for publication in academic
                journals.
             Prepare responses to common misconceptions about qualitative research that may be
                evident in reviewers' comments.

Submitting a manuscript for publication

When a researcher has completed writing up their qualitative research, it is time to prepare to submit the
research to the journal they have identified as suitable for its publication. The submission process can be
time-consuming; typically, it involves the following steps:

   Preparing all the relevant documents for review. Each journal provides instructions for submission,
      which may include:
          A cover letter to the editor, explaining the focus of the manuscript, the proposed format (e.g.
            original research article) and why it should be published in this particular journal.
          A title page providing details about the authors and their affiliations.
          An anonymised version of the manuscript. This will require the researcher to strip the paper of
            all identifying information, including author names and affiliations, and names of approving
            human research ethics committees. Depending on the journal, tables and figures may be placed
            at the end of this document or submitted as separate files and formats.
          A separate file with all the tables and another with the figures (depending on journal
            requirements).
261 | CHAPTER 37: THE JOURNAL REVIEW PROCESS

          Supplementary data documents, such coding trees, interview guides, additional tables with
            themes and quotes, and the completed qualitative research reporting tool (see Chapter 36),
            submitted for review but not for publication.

   Creating an author account on the journal's submission portal (if this is the first time you are
      submitting to this journal).

   Completing of an author profile, including institution details, main areas of research and keywords
      describing research areas (e.g. methods, topic areas)

   Creating a new submission for the manuscript in the submission portal. This typically involves:
          Entering the full title of the manuscript, including a short title.
          Entering the abstract into the journal's submission portal (not as a document upload).
          Selecting the type of manuscript (original research article, short report, letter to the editor).
          Selecting keywords to describe the structure of the manuscript (methods, topic area,
            population group).
          Uploading the relevant documents for review (see point 1).
          Listing all authors in the correct order, including their names, titles, institutions and email
            addresses.
          Uploading a publishing agreement, including the signatures of all authors agreeing to the
            submission.
          Declaring all funding sources for the research.
          Declaring conflicts of interest for each member of authorship team (this is sometimes included
            in the publishing agreement and funding declaration).
          Proposing at least two peer-reviewers who may be suitable to review the manuscript.

   Confirming the submission. The submission system or portal then generates a single PDF file
      including all the documents; the submitting author is then required to review and approve this file to
      confirm the submission.

The peer-review process

When a manuscript has been submitted for consideration, usually the journal's administrative team will
invite an editor to handle the submission. Every journal has its own protocols for submission, so the
handling editor may be the editor-in-chief, managing editor, associate editor or other personnel who may
accept or reject the submission. The first task of the editor is to read all the prepared documents and the
cover letter, and to decide whether the manuscript fits within the scope of the journal and warrants peer
review. If the editor's immediate decision is to reject the submission, this is known as a desk rejection.

If the editor believes the manuscript fits the scope of the journal and warrants further review, they will
invite peer reviewers. Peer reviewers usually receive an email inviting them to review the manuscript, with
a short abstract embedded within the email. This enables the peer reviewers to determine whether they
have the expertise to review the article. However, even if a peer reviewer is confident about the methods or
the topic area, this does not guarantee that they will accept the invitation to review. Recent research has
                                                                                      CHAPTER 37: THE JOURNAL REVIEW PROCESS | 262

indicated that 70% of invited peer reviewers decline the request.1 There are many reasons for this, including
a lack of training, lack of time and the unpaid nature of the role.1, 2 Journals typically require at least 2
peer reviewers per article, and in some cases this may be 5 or 6. Hence, the editor may send out 20 or
more invitations to review an article before securing the required number of peer reviewers. In the journal
submission system, there is a section indicating the status of the article; if the editor is finding it difficult to
find peer reviewers, the status may remain at `awaiting peer review assignment' (or something similar) for a
few months.

The role of peer reviewers

Peer review has a long history in academic publishing. The role of the peer reviewer is to provide a critique
of a manuscript, to ensure quality and rigour, and to assist the journal editors in their publishing decision.3
Once the peer reviewer has accepted an assignment, they are provided with the collated PDF of all the
submitted documents. Reviewers are required to log into a different section of the journal submission
portal, and are asked to indicate whether the paper meets certain requirements (e.g. is written well; is of
interest to the journal's readership; statistical tests are relevant and have been correctly performed). The
peer reviewer is required to read the manuscript and supporting documents, and to provide a report to
the editor and authors. Usually, this begins with an overall summary of the paper and then feedback and
questions on each section of the paper. The peer reviewer is required to recommend whether the article
should be accepted as is, revised with minor revisions, revised with major revisions or rejected. The peer
reviewer can also submit comments to the editor, which are not seen by the authors. Peer reviewers are
usually given 2-3 weeks to provide their review. While the peer reviewers are undertaking their review, the
status in the submission portal is usually listed as `awaiting peer review reports'. Once the reports have been
provided, the editor decides whether to accept the manuscript, invite the authors to revise it (either minor
or major revision), or to reject it. This decision is based on the editor's assessment of the reports and the
peer-reviewers' recommendations.

Strengths and limitations of the peer-review process

Peer reviews can strengthen a research article by highlighting areas where further explanation is required. In
qualitative research, this may include advice on the structure of the results and whether the quotes illustrate
the themes well. This author has received excellent advice from peer reviewers on how to coherently
integrate theory into results and how to meaningfully discuss the research within the broader context of
the literature. However, there is limited evidence on whether peer review leads to the publication of high-
quality research. Many concerns have been raised regarding the system and infrastructure for submission,
the varied roles and responsibilities of peer reviewers, the quality of peer-review reports and potential bias
on the part of peer reviewers (which journals attempt to minimise through the use of anonymised review).3
Read about some of the debates on the role of peer review:

   The limitations to our understanding of peer review3
   The evolving crisis of the peer-review process1
263 | CHAPTER 37: THE JOURNAL REVIEW PROCESS

For the researcher, anonymised peer review has the advantages and limitations of diversity in the reports
and the different opinions of the peer reviewers.

Responding to peer review

Regardless of the editor's decision to accept, revise or reject the paper, an email is sent to the authors with
the results of the peer review. If the paper is rejected, reports from peer reviewers can still be helpful in
strengthening the paper for the next submission. If the paper requires minor or major revision, then the
author team will need to respond to each of the peer-reviewers' points and demonstrate how they have
addressed these in their revised manuscript, or provide a rationale as to why a change is not required.

Usually, authors approach the response to reviewers in one of 2 ways:

 1. Separately list the reviewer's comment, question or suggestion, followed by a written response.
 2. Tabulate the response, with columns for the reviewer's comment, question or suggestion, the

      authors' response and changes that have been made in the manuscript.

Table 37.1 is an example of the tabulated format for addressing peer-reviewer feedback, although usually
the last column is titled `Changes to the manuscript'. This table is an aggregate of feedback received by
the author over years of publishing qualitative research and does not relate to any particular paper or peer
reviewer.

265 | CHAPTER 37: THE JOURNAL REVIEW PROCESS

Process for addressing peer-reviewers' comments

Peer reviewers' reports are typically provided to the corresponding author, or may be sent to all authors by
email. It can be confronting to read reviewers' feedback and difficult to formulate a meaningful response.
Taking time to read and digest peer-reviewers' reports before preparing a response can be a helpful start.
Typically, journals provide a deadline for authors to submit their response and amended documents. If this
timeframe is not achievable, it is advisable to let the journal know that more time is needed.

 1. Follow the journal's guidelines on how to prepare the amended manuscript. Some journals ask for
      changes to be tracked (using the Track Changes function in Microsoft Word), and for 2 versions to
      be uploaded: a tracked-changes version and a `clean' version. Other journals ask for changes to be
      highlighted in the text, using the text highlighting tool.

 2. Prepare a separate document to respond to the peer reviewers. Start by thanking the reviewers for the
      time they have taken to review the manuscript and for the feedback they have provided. Then
      respond to each of the reviewers' points in a table or document (see for example Table 37.1).

 3. Be clear and concise, and provide evidence for your decision in the response. If appropriate, integrate
      this evidence into the manuscript.

 4. Do not make changes to the manuscript that do not relate to reviewer or editor feedback.
 5. Ensure all the changes are made across all the documents that are being submitted for re-review.
 6. Ask a co-author or colleague read the response, to check for tone and clarity.
 7. Resubmit the manuscript and supporting documents through the journal submission portal. It is

      common for papers to be sent to the same peer reviewers for a response, but new reviewers may be
      invited for an independent round of review.
 8. Be aware that responding to reviewers' comments and resubmitting an article does not guarantee
      that it will be accepted.

Summary

Submitting a manuscript for publication can take time, as does the peer-review process. Ensure you have
read the journal's submission guidelines thoroughly, and allocate sufficient time for the submission process.
There are advantages and limitations to the peer-review process, but regardless, this is the current process
used in academic journal publishing. Responding to reviewers' reports is an important part of the process
towards publication, and can help to strengthen a paper before publication.
