Identify Skills for Self-Directed Learning

Though all university courses ask students to apply independent learning strategies, online learning requires an
even higher level of self-directed learning skill.

   Many students have experience in teacher-directed classrooms. In these classrooms, the teacher is the central
figure, and the students take direction about what to learn directly from the instructor. In these environments,
students might spend time taking notes on an instructor's lecture, and might focus much of their learning time on
memorizing concepts in preparation for recalling them on an exam.

   Online university courses are different. The instructor is no longer the central figure in the learning
environment. You, the student, become the central actor in your own learning journey. As you undertake this
journey, you are supported by your community of fellow students. Your instructor serves as your guide, using
their knowledge and experience to direct you to learning experiences that will lead you to your learning goals.

   As you begin the workshop, reflect on your current self-directed learning skills. The quiz below will help you to
get started. Complete the quiz before continuing on in the workshop below. If you are unable to view or complete
the quiz, please access this activity in an alternative format.

   Skills for Independent Learning

                                                                                       5

   Independent learning requires the following skills:
        Defining your learning goal for your program, each course, and each assignment you complete.
        Identifying the steps you must take to move towards your goal. What content do you need to know? How
            will you learn it?
        Choose strategies that will support your own learning.
        Reach out for the support you need from your instructor, classmates, and university support services.

In the next section, you will explore the ways that a skill called metacognition supports you in becoming an
independent learner.

Apply the Plan-Monitor-Evaluate Model for Assessing Your
Learning Progress

What is Metacognition?
Have you ever wondered what the most successful students do differently from other students? Students who have
developed effective ways of learning have mastered a skill called metacognition. In simple terms, metacognition is
understanding your own thinking and learning processes. In other words, it is "thinking about your thinking".
Metacognitive skills include planning your learning, monitoring whether your current learning strategies are
successful, and evaluating results of your learning. Improving your metacognitive skills is associated with
increased success in all of your academic life. To learn more about how metacognition applies to student life,
watch the video below.

   Learning Choices: Videos and Text

      At several points in the workshop, you will have the opportunity to learn key skills by watching a short video. If you prefer reading
   to watching videos, you will find a video transcript located directly below each video. Scroll past the video to read if this is your
   learning preference.

                        One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                        https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/learningtolearnonline/?p=29#oembed-1

   How do you gain the skill of metacognition? One way to think about developing metacognition is gaining the
ability to plan, monitor, and evaluate your learning.

                                                                                       7

                                                    Planning involves two key tasks: deciding what you need to learn, and
                                                    then deciding how you are going to learn that material.

                                                       Monitoring requires you to ask "how am I doing at learning this?". In
                                                    monitoring, you are constantly tracking what you have learned, what
                                                    you don't yet know, and whether your study strategies are helping you
                                                    to learn effectively.

                                                       Evaluation involves reflection on how well you met your Learning
                                                    Objectives after completing a unit of study, or receiving feedback (such
                                                    as a test or assignment).

                                                    Key Questions to Improve Your Learning

The Learning Cycle (Image Credit: Christina Page)   At each stage in the learning cycle, there are key questions that you will

                                                    ask yourself to support your learning process. In the chart below, you

will identify the key question for each stage in the cycle, along with the other questions you will want to consider.

Use Critical Questioning to Support Your Learning

Learning in an online environment requires you to move beyond simple memorization of course concepts. To
gain knowledge that will support you in your growth as a lifelong learner and in your future career, you will want
to interact with course concepts deeply and in ways that are personally relevant to you.

   One way of picturing deeper learning is Bloom's Taxonomy.

   The levels of Bloom's taxonomy build upon each other. While you need to be able to remember key concepts,
your courses will spend more time developing your ability to apply, analyze, evaluate, and create using this

                                                                                       10

knowledge. As you encounter new concepts, you will want to use critical questioning to understand the concepts
at all levels, moving from surface to deeper knowledge. The chart below includes some questions that might be
relevant at each level.

              One method for creating study questions or planning active learning activities is to move step-by-step through each level
           of Bloom's Taxonomy. Begin with a few questions at the Remembering level. If you don't yet know the technical language
           of the subject and what it means, it will be difficult for you to apply, evaluate, analyze, or be creative. Then, go deeper into
           your subject as you move through the levels. Learning at university requires you to learn the basics of your discipline by
           remembering and understanding; however, you will spend much more of your time applying, analyzing, evaluating, and
           creating.

              Here is an example of what this might look like. What questions can you create for your topic?

Manage Information for Online Learning

As you develop your identity as an online learner, you will want to consider the role of information management
in your learning process. Strong independent learners actively read, evaluate, and use information for current
course tasks, but more importantly, to develop a resource file of information that will support professional growth.

   Many online learners feel overwhelmed at the volume of reading and the wealth of online resources available
to them. Managing information well requires you to develop skills in identifying the purpose for your reading
(What do you need to learn from this reading? Why is it important to you personally and professionally?), and the
strategy that will help you achieve your purpose (skimming, reading key portions, a close reading). In the Strategic
Reading module of this workshop, you will discover additional ways to manage the reading process.

   Early in your learning journey, you will want to select a system for managing information. As you will frequently
work with electronic texts and articles, selecting a system that allows you to store, search, and retrieve readings and
notes from current and past courses. Online note systems, such as OneNote or Evernote, are highly effective for
this purpose.

   Benefits of Using an Online Notebook
   Online notebook platforms allow you to do the following:

        Create individual notebooks for courses or assignments, creating additional sections or pages for weekly
            module topics

        Create flexible notes that include text, images, audio, and video files
        Store PDFs and other course documents for your own records (note: you will eventually lose access to

            Moodle pages when courses are complete)
        Clip and store relevant information from the web
        Search stored content to quickly find relevant information, making connections between courses and

            your previous learning
        Sync notes across all of your devices

   Choose a Notebook
   Two fully-featured and common software platforms are Onenote and Evernote

                                                                                       14

Who am I on my Learning Journey with?

Image Credit: Graeme Robinson-Clogg

   While you are on your own unique learning journey, much of your learning will come through your interactions
with your fellow students. In preparation for your future career in a collaborative professional context, much
of your learning will take place in groups. In some disciplines, this process is referred to as becoming part of a
community of inquiry or community of practice.

   By the end of this module, you will be able to:
        Define the role of a the learning community in your online program.
        Understand processes that shape effective team interactions.
        Plan your strategy for working effectively in teams.

Go to the next chapter to move on in the workshop.

Define Your Learning Community

When you join an online course, you become part of what is known as a Community of Inquiry. In the
Community of Inquiry, you will have an Instructor, content to process, and a learning community in which to
grow.

   This is a learning community that fosters your learning (cognitive growth), in a way that allows you to apply new
insights to your life and work. Within a Community of Inquiry, learners have two key roles:

         1. Maintaining a cognitive presence in the community. This requires a continual process of critical
              thinking.

        2. Developing a social presence in the learning community. This involves creating the open and mutual
              relationships that allow for learning and collaboration to occur.

   Social Presence
   If learning occurs in a collaborative community, how does this take place online? Maintaining a social presence
in an online environment involves allowing for open communication. Social presence allows you to risk
expressing your ideas online, based on the knowledge that your classmates will be respectful and supportive. All
members of the community commit to supporting each other in their learning. Though it may be difficult to
express some nuances and emotions online, using emoticons can help. 1

Understand the Principles of Effective Teamwork

Alice Macpherson

Now that you have identified what you hope to achieve through teamwork in your learning community, consider
how you will form effective teams.
Five Basic Elements of Effective Teams

Image Credit: Rawia Inaim

   Effective teams share five key characteristics:

Positive Interdependence   Members believe they are linked together; they cannot succeed unless the other members of the group
                           succeed (and vice versa).
Individual Accountability
Group Processing              They sink or swim together.
Skills in Communication
Promotive Interaction      The performance of each individual member is assessed and the results given back to the group and the
                           individual

                           At the end of its working period, the group processes it's functioning by answering two questions:
                                   What did each member do that was helpful for the group?
                                   What can each member do to make the group work better?

                           Necessary for effective group functioning.
                           Members must have - and use - the needed leadership, decision-making, trust-building, communication,
                           and conflict-management skills.

                           Members help, assist, encourage, and support each other's efforts to learn.1

Plan for Successful Teamwork

Alice Macpherson and Christina Page

Tuckman suggested that teams move through stages in their life cycle: forming, storming, norming, and
performing. At each stage, the group will work through a series of interpersonal tasks, as well as a series of project-
related tasks.

Image Credit: Alice Macpherson and Rawia Inaim

   In the first section of this module, you explored the components of a Community of Inquiry. Both cognitive
presence and social presence are required in the online learning community. Tuckman's model of team
development also indicates that both components are needed. In a class-based team, it may be easy to focus
only on the cognitive output of the group - the creation of the project, paper, or presentation. However, as you
can observe from Tuckman's model, a well-functioning team requires its members to exhibit social presence
throughout, communicating well in interpersonal interactions.

   In the days ahead, you will likely find yourself on a newly forming team in an online environment. Consider

Progress Through the Stages of Team Development

Alice Macpherson and Christina Page

As your group moves through these stages, stay aware of the patterns that tend to occur at each stage. For example,
many teams falsely assume that their group cannot function when they find themselves at the storming stage.
However, this stage is a normal part of team development, like the others. The info-graphic below indicates what
steps you and your group members can take together to move to the next stage in your work together. Ultimately,
you want to achieve a performing team that supports your learning in community

   Becoming a Team
   A Team is two or more people; working together; on a Common Goal (or goals). Groups become Teams if the common
goals are clear and attention is paid to both interpersonal and task functions.

   The Team must Decide how to Communicate Effectively (Interpersonal)
   Each Team must set up their own guidelines for good communication and a Team Charter. Through discussion and
negotiation the members choose the items that are most important for their clear communication as a Team. These often
include commitment to:

           Respect and Listen to others
           Not blame (work hard on the problem, not on the person)
           Group members and Project process
           Supportive and Constructive Feedback
           Agreed upon Goals and Clear Timelines
           Positive interdependence (sink or swim together)
           Individual Accountability (say what you will do and do it)
           Analysis of work done and Planning for next steps
           Process for conflict and Problem Management

   The Team must Decide what is Important and Measure This (Task)
   Early in the formation of the group, the members must decide what will be measured in the process. These items are
generally critical to success and for the group to become an Effective Team. A team that has succeeded shares the
following characteristics. Its members:

           Came prepared
           Offered ideas and suggestions, Provided information
           Asked for clarification/feedback
           Identified resources
           Solicited others' participation
           Kept group on task
           Was easy to work with
           Prepared materials
           Made presentation
           Participated in discussions
           Managed group conflict

   The Team must Acknowledge Success and Aim for Improvement
   What have we done (individually and collectively) to meet our goals and keep the Team Charter?
   How can we do better for next time? (Next steps)

   The Team Celebrates!
   Celebrate what you have accomplished and then refocus your efforts for greater success!

Framework for Working Together

Core Values

Your personal beliefs are the core values that affect and drive how you look at the world, your behaviour in the
world and your interaction with others. They are how you do "business" with the rest of the world. In other words,
they are the basis for everything that you are and do. These beliefs about appropriate behaviours, attitudes and
strategies also guide every working group and need to be explicit and understood.

Mandate

It is useful to know what you are expected to do in a group situation. This is often delivered or requested from
an administrative or political level and appears in the form of a "job description". The group which is mandated
may not be able to effect the general outline of the mandate. The context in which the group operates has critical
effects on what can be done.

Identifying a Mission Statement

A mission statement embodies the group's current purpose and intent and answers (within the mandate of the
group) questions such as: What are we about? Why are we working together? What do we want to achieve? It
describes the business that you are in. This may be a statement developed by the whole organization or it may be
more localized in a department, program, class, work group or individually. It gives direction to actions. Without
knowing your mission, you may not be able to get started.

Developing Shared Vision

Vision is a future oriented statement of a group's purpose in a task, project or work team. Having the members
shared a vision that aligns with their personal values and aspirations is a solid basis for production. Time spent at
the beginning in dreaming and discussing what the final result will be is time well spent. If it is not possible to have
a shared vision of the end product and the goals and milestones that must be reached then the team may also have
difficulty identifying whether they have accomplished their purpose.

   Sometimes, when the project is open ended or ongoing, the final product cannot be totally "visioned" at the
beginning. A shared vision will then be one that all of the team members agree are the elements of where they
want to get at this time and the direction that they will start moving towards to achieve these elements.

   Visions should be revisited and refined over time. If the team is not heading in the same direction, then it may
not get anywhere.

Determining Appropriate Goals

What are the individual tasks and goals that will build to making your vision manifest? Goals lead towards
the realization of the vision. It is important to develop appropriate goals, make them explicit and share an
understanding of each one.

   Goals have:

        Targets - where we expect to get to realistically balanced with time and resources.
        Objectives - identifiable, measurable and achievable steps.
        Tasks - ways of reaching the objectives.
        Indicators - ways of measuring progress.

Like our vision statement, goals need to be realigned with reality on a regular basis. Evaluation and adjustment
drive this process.

Improving Continuously

Knowing where you are going and how you intend to get there is a good start. The final step is continuous
improvement. Planning, implementation, and verification are tools for analysis and change as the process unfolds.
                                                                                                                                          Learning to Learn Online 31

Improvement is continual but the steps are small. Pick changes that can be made now that will have a positive
effect - 1% is enough each time.

   The online learning journey requires a different relationship to instructors than you may have experienced in
the past. You may not see your instructors as regularly face to face, yet you can still develop effective relationships
with instructors that support you in your learning. By the end of this module, you will be able to:

        Describe the role of an online instructor.
        Develop an effective student-instructor connection.

Describe the Role of an Online Instructor

   As you have already learned, when you join an online
course, you become part of what is known as a Community
of Inquiry and you take on an important role in this online
learning environment.

   What is the role of your instructor in this learning
environment? Your online instructor provides the teaching
presence to create design significant learning experiences
for you and your fellow students. Instructors also
thoughtfully facilitate the content that will support your
learning in the class. They also direct you by answering
questions and challenging your assumptions to help you
grow in your knowledge and skills.

   In

coi-model/

online classrooms, your instructor takes on the following
roles:

 Designer: In a museum, a curator locates the best                  Image credit: Christina Page
    artifacts to create an effective experience for those
    who visit. In an online learning environment, your
    instructors take on the role like that of a curator as
    they design the course. They will guide you
    towards readings and other learning materials that
    will serve your learning goals. Based on their
    experience in their field, they are able to help you
    focus your attention on learning resources that are
    accurate and relevant.

 Facilitator: Your instructor carefully creates
    opportunities for you to learn the skills you need for your future career, and designs assignments and
    learning activities to lead you towards intellectual, personal, and professional growth. As you review the
    course presentation, consider each of the learning activities and assignments. Think about the reasons
    why your instructor may have selected these course components to contribute to your development.

 Director: Online instructors are available to answer questions along the way. As you learn, you will
    inevitably find areas that are unclear to you, either related to the course content or your learning
    process. By communicating with your instructor effectively, you will take full advantage of their role in

Develop an Effective Student-Instructor Connection

Image Credit: Rawia Inaim

   Now that you have developed a picture of the role that your instructors will have in your online learning journey,
how might you develop an effective relationship with them. Consider the following suggestions:

         1. When you look at a course reading, activity, or assignment, try to put yourself inside the mind of your
              instructor. Why do you think they chose this particular learning experience for you? What do you think
              they intend for you to learn? Understanding the purpose of a learning activity can increase your
              motivation and help you to stay on track in your work.

        2. Take advantage of opportunities to connect with your instructor, either face to face or during online
              office hours. You can attend office hours to clarify course difficulties, but also to build your relationship
              with your instructor and demonstrate your interest in the course material.

        3. Check the course site regularly. Your instructor is likely to post announcements and other key messages
              for the class. This provides another point of frequent contact.

        4. Use email effectively to connect. You will learn more about how to construct an effective email in the
              section on professional communication in this workshop - but if you are curious, you may choose to
              view the chapter on how to email an instructor now.

        5. When you receive feedback on an assignment, consider it carefully. How does your instructor want to
              see you grow in your academic or professional skills?

                                                                                       37

Time Management for Online Learning

Image Credit: Graeme Robinson-Clogg

   Online learning requires effective time management skills. You may not have the structure of a weekly class
to help you organize your time and prioritize your assignments. If you are in a blended course, you will be
responsible for a higher number of independent self-study hours than in traditional classroom courses.

   How will you manage your time? In this module, you will explore strategies for organizing work throughout
the semester, developing a realistic study schedule, and balancing your online learning with your work or other
commitments.

Use Your Course Presentations to Understand the Shape of
Your Semester

Online courses often provide you with a great deal of flexibility in organizing your time. This can be a tremendous
asset, particularly if you are balancing study with work, family, or other commitments. However, this also requires
you to accurately determine how much work you must complete over the semester, and to develop a plan that
allows you to complete this work effectively.

   Many students find it helpful to develop a semester schedule that provides an "overview at a glance" of what will
be required. You will find the information you need for this in your course presentations.

   The following video will help you to better understand how to read your course presentation and how to plan
for the semester ahead.

                        One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:

   Video Transcript: Creating a Semester Schedule
   Creating a master schedule for your whole semester can help you to see the big picture and to stay on track. In
this video, you will learn how to compile the information from your course presentations into one master
schedule that will allow you to see your semester at a glance.
   Here are 3 STEPS you can take to use your course presentations to create a semester schedule.
   Step 1: Create a table with 7 columns, one column for each day of the week, and with one rows for each week of
the semester. Label the days, Monday, Tuesday, and all the way along, across the top of the table. Then label the
weeks, across the side of the table. At this point you can also add specific dates for each week of the semester. You
can download a ready-made semester schedule by clicking in the description of this video.
   Step 2: Next, gather up all of your course presentations for the semester. You should have one for each course
you are taking, which includes details about the weekly schedule and readings, assignment due dates, and exams.
If you have a part time job, and know your schedule, and if you have family commitments which have a regular
schedule, gather up these schedules as well.
   Step 3: Now, go through the course presentation looking for important details and commitments that will take
place in Week 1 of the semester. This could include required course readings, homework and assignments. On
your semester schedule table, find the day of the week these commitments need to be completed by and write
them down. Make sure to include the course name, the details of the commitment, and what it is worth if it is
a graded assignment. Now keep working through your course presentation, through each week of the semester.
Keep following these same steps for each of your courses, until you have completed your schedule.

                                                                                       41
42 KPU Learning Centres

   Now, add important life events to your semester schedule - this might include work events, family events, trips
and special occasions.

   In summary, once you have completed these 3 steps using your course presentations to create a semester
schedule, you will now have a central and easily accessible schedule that includes all of your commitments, in
one place. You won't have to go searching through piles of paper, or back online through the course website, to
remember what you have to get done each week. As well, being able to see, in one place, what your commitments
are today, this week, and in the upcoming weeks, can help you organize your time in the most efficient way
possible.
[13]

Create a Semester Schedule

A semester schedule gives you a visual picture of the assignments, projects, tests, exams, presentations, and
practicum requirements that will happen during the semester. If you are taking a number of classes, this is a tool
to be able to see what is coming up next.

   By having the "big picture" in view, you will be able to proactively manage busy periods in your semester. If you
have flexible due dates, you will be able to schedule your assignments for the optimal time in the semester. For
example, you may notice that you have a larger than typical number of major assignments due in week 6. This
allows you to schedule work on some of these projects earlier in the semester.

   Look at the example semester schedule below. What do you notice about what the student chose to include?
What will you include on your semester schedule? After viewing the example schedule below, download the
semester schedule template to create your own schedule. When you have completed your schedule, go to the next
chapter to move ahead.

                                                                                       43

Develop a Weekly Schedule That Works

Your next step is to create a weekly schedule. This will include your class times for face to face or blended classes,
work commitments, volunteer roles, practicum placements, as well as any other regular events in your week. A
weekly schedule is a good tool to evaluate whether your time use allows you to meet your overall goals. Do you
have enough time for study? Is there time to maintain a healthy lifestyle? Analyze the example student schedule
below. What do you notice about how this student has planned their week?

Image credit: Rawia Inaim

   Download the weekly schedule template here. The following principles will guide you as you create your weekly
schedule:

         1. Record your regular weekly commitments on the schedule template. This includes any face to face or
                                                                                       45
46 KPU Learning Centres

              blended class times.
        2. Designate regular study blocks for each of your classes. Remember that university courses typically

              require at least 9-12 hours of weekly study. Remember that it is more effective to study for multiple,
              shorter blocks of time during the week than to plan for one extended study block. Shorter study periods
              will allow for greater focus. Regular review will help you retain information well.
        3. Record meal times, family times, laundry times, etc.
        4. Record all regularly scheduled personal activities such as meetings, employment and athletics.
        5. Record any special activities you need to do or want to do on a regular basis.
        6. Schedule to start your study period with the courses you like least or that you're not doing well in. Try
              to study the same subjects at the same time each study day. Although this seems to be a mechanical way
              of scheduling, you will find that such a routine can help you develop a pattern for efficient and effective
              learning.
         7. Schedule a weekly review (WR) for each course. Do it at the end of the week if possible. This weekly
              review gives you an opportunity to go over the past week's notes along with the reading assignments to
              see what you have been learning in the past week during class and study time for each course. You can
              also look ahead to plan the next week and determine how much reading you need to do, what projects
              are due, and if any tests are scheduled.
        8. Keep open some time for daily physical activity. Remember, research indicates that regular exercise will
              not only give you a general sense of well-being, but can reduce tension and help you accomplish a
              tough class, study, and work schedule.
        9. Label some empty blocks of time as OPEN for academic or personal needs.
       10. Schedule some time during Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for you to play, relax, or do whatever you
              want to do. This is your reward for sticking to your schedule. In addition, you'll enjoy your free time
              more. Because it is scheduled you do not need to feel guilty.

                                                                                                                     Try it!

      Download the weekly schedule template. Create your weekly schedule based on the principles you have explored in this chapter.
   Follow your schedule for a two week period. Then, evaluate and make adjustments.

Manage Daily Tasks

Now that you can see the big picture of your semester and weekly priorities, the next step is to create a daily to-do
list to prioritize your tasks. The video below introduces you to some principles for creating daily task lists. When
you are finished, move to the next section to choose strategies for managing your tasks.

                        One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:

   Managing Daily Tasks Video Transcript
   By the time you've finished the day today, what will you have accomplished? In this video, you will learn to
create a system to manage your daily to-do list, so that you can prioritize effectively and use your time efficiently.
For every task you have to complete, you need to decide:
   1. When do I need to finish this by?
   2. How much time will it take?
   3. Is this task a priority, or can it wait until later?
   A good to-do list helps you make sure that you complete all of your high priority tasks, and that you allocate
a manageable amount of work to each day. So, how do you make a daily task list? First, you will want to find the
format that works best for you. Some people prefer to use a paper planner. Others prefer to use the reminders
function on their phone, or another task list app. Choose the format that meets your needs the best. Second, you
will need to divide your work into tasks that are specific, measurable, and achievable. In general, a task should
be anything that you can complete in a single work period - for example, in an hour or less. If you have a large
project, break it down into smaller tasks.
   Third, you will need to assign your tasks to a specific day. Make sure that each day's task list is reasonable and
achievable.
   Fourth, prioritize each day's tasks. What tasks must be finished today. Be sure that you complete these before
moving on to lower priority tasks. After the most important things have been done, move on to the less urgent
tasks.
   At the end of the day, decide what to do with any tasks that aren't yet complete. Most often, you will move the
task to another day. You might also decide that the task isn't important, and delete it from your list.
   Finally, be sure to reward yourself for a day's work well done. If you are able to create an effective motivational
system for yourself, you will be less likely to procrastinate, and more likely to finish your most important work
each day.
   To summarize, a daily to-do list can help you stay on track and achieve your most important goals. Choose a
tool that works for you, organize your tasks, prioritize them, and work through your list each day.

                                                                                       47

Consider what kind of task management system will help you most in your current study program:

         1. What kind of time management system do you prefer? Paper or technology-based?
         2. Do you plan to keep your current time management system, or make some changes to support your online learning? If

               you are trying a new system, when will you evaluate how effective it is for you?
         3. When will you organize your daily tasks? Will you set aside a longer block of time on a weekly basis for planning, or set

               aside a few moments for planning at the beginning or end of each day?

Make Use of Small Blocks of Time

Through using smaller blocks of time you can cover material in chunks (more on the next page) and not have to
worry about the larger whole. A mistake that many people make is that they try to cram information into their
minds in one large session. This isn't a successful strategy for most students.

   Look for smaller blocks of time to study. If you are a public transit user, you can likely spend 20 minutes on
your bus ride to read or review for your upcoming class or exam. You could even listen to an audio recording of
your notes. In the evening, instead of watching three episodes of your favourite TV show, you could watch one and
spend the remaining time preparing for your studies. Going out to eat often? Consider making something simple
at home that you could put in the oven to cook without needing tending to; that time could be used doing some
work for class and still leave you time for other activities once dinner is done.

   Making time for your studies can be overwhelming. The following video introduces you to ways to use smaller
blocks of time to get your tasks done, while not using up numerous hours at once.

   Click on the video to learn more as you continue down this pathway. Answer the questions (by clicking on the

   Video Transcript: Using Small Blocks of Time Productively
   One trick to balancing work and study is taking advantage of small blocks of time to get things done.
   In this video, you will consider the small blocks of time in your schedule, and identify strategies to increase your
productivity during these moments in your day.
   Often, we think we need to have a lot of time available for study, or we think that we can only study at home or
in the library. By adjusting your thinking, you'll be able to open up additional productive learning time.

        Do you commute by transit? Though it wouldn't be ideal to try to master detailed or complicated reading
            material on the bus, perhaps you can do some initial scanning or skimming while in transit, to prepare
            yourself for class or deeper reading later.

        Consider creating flash cards for material that you need to learn. You can take a set of flash cards with you
            and work whenever a few minutes become available. If you use one of the many flash card or self-testing
            apps available on your phone, you'll be able to easily pull out your phone and make use of those small
            blocks of time.

        Self-testing is one of the most effective ways to learn. Create a list of study questions for your course. Pull
            out the list when you have time available, and review a few questions. Keep track of those you answer

                                                                                       49

            correctly, and those you need to study more.

        Does your course include access to online videos that explain and review key concepts? Watch a video or
            two to review, or to improve your understanding of a key course idea.

        Some courses also include access to online self-study questions. Try answering a few review questions in
            your spare moments. These online quizzes usually provide immediate feedback on what you understand,
            and what you should study further.

        Do you like to learn by listening? Make an audio recording of the important points you want to
            remember, and listen while you commute or exercise. Maybe audio books are for you - are any of your
            course materials available in this format?

Use Email in the Online Learning Environment

In an online learning environment, communicating by email is an important part of getting things done. For
many students, emailing instructors can be intimidating, at least at first. The video below, which includes an
interactive quiz, will provide you with some tools for sending a clear and professional email. You will use many
of these same principles for your communication with classmates, and in other work settings.

   Video Transcript
   Communicating with your instructor throughout the semester is an important part of being an active and
engaged post-secondary student. Email is by far the most popular means by which this type of communication
takes place. For students, emailing instructors is particularly appealing because it is familiar, easy and convenient.
But messages sent via email can easily be misunderstood unless special care is taken in their composition.
   To avoid confusion, and to make it as easy for your busy instructors to read and understand your email as
possible, there are a few basic principles to keep in mind when sending an email message to your professor. In this
video, we are going to cover five of these principles that will help ensure that your email communication is clear,
effective, and professional.
   First, it is important to use a formal, professional tone when emailing your instructor. Include an informative
subject, and avoid simply saying "hey" or "hello" For example, if your instructor's name was Tom Smith, an
email to them might look something like "Dear Professor Smith." You may wish to conclude with a closing like
"best regards". In general, don't worry about being too formal with your instructor. Think of your email as a
professional, business communication.
   Second, make sure that your email is grammatically correct. You should think about your email as a chance
to show your instructor that you care about the class, and that you are willing to take the time to proofread
your message before sending it. It is also a good idea to break your message up into multiple paragraphs with
appropriate punctuation. This makes your email easier to read, and it helps to avoid unnecessary confusion.
Remember, your instructor is much more likely to help you if they are able to understand what you are saying.
   Third, it is helpful to keep your message brief. Avoid long emails that go into too many unnecessary details or
that appear to be long-winded rants. Keep your tone friendly and respectful, and keep your emails concise and to
the point. With that said, it is also not a good idea to be too short with your message, as shortness can sometimes
be misinterpreted as rudeness.
   Fourth, it is a good idea to make sure that you actually need to send the email in the first place. Sometimes,

                                                                                       53

simply reading through your syllabus, assignment description, class website, or lecture notes can answer many of
the questions you might have.

   Finally, it is important not to expect that your instructor will response to you immediately. Unlike with instant
messaging, email responses can take anywhere from one to three days. Your instructors have a lot of email to
respond to, along with their other responsibilities, so patience is advisable. Moreover, it is important to only re-
send an email after at least five days have passed.

   In this video, we covered five key principles that, if followed when writing an email to your instructor, will help
ensure that you communicate clearly, effectively, and professionally.

 Communicate in Online Forums

   Many online courses include forums, either as a required assignment, or to support your learning process. How
   can you use forums to support your learning in the best way possible?

      Earlier in the workshop, you encountered the social presence and cognitive presence elements of the
   community of inquiry you are building in your course. Forums are a tool for creating collaborative learning
   relationships. They can also be a low-stakes way to express your developing ideas, and to get feedback on the ways
   in which you are learning the course material as you work towards larger assignments.

      What Makes a Good Forum Post?
      The rubric below outlines what distinguishes stronger online posts from those that are less successful. Review
   the chart below. What do you notice? If your instructor has provided a rubric for online posts, read the rubric,
   and identify your instructor's criteria for success.1

                  Tips for Participating in Forums
                            1. Develop a clear understanding of the expectations and ground rules for the forum. Review your course
                                 presentation (syllabus) to guidance on how often to post, the type of content to include in each post, and the
                                 best way to respond to others' posts.
                            2. Make connections between your posts and the content you are learning in the course. A forum post is often
                                 an excellent place to engage in critical reflection. Make connections between the course content and the ways
                                 that your growing understanding are shaping your present and future practice.
                            3. Set a regular schedule for posting and commenting on forums. This prevents the amount of content from
                                 becoming overwhelming, and allows you to develop stronger relationships in the course by regularly engaging
                                 with classmates.
                            4. Include resources that might be useful to other classmates or your instructor in your posts.
                            5. Use language that is appropriate for an academic environment. Avoid writing in a way that is too informal (ie.
                                 writing that resembles a text message).
                            6. Make sure that each post is clearly written and well structured. Take time to clarify the message you want to
                                 communicate in your post, and organize your content into clear and concise paragraphs. This is easier for
                                 your reader than a long or disorganized post.
                            7. Respond to others' posts in a supportive and challenging way. In writing, messages may be unintentionally
                                 misinterpreted. Be sure that your responses to others are respectful, positive in tone, and do not appear
                                 angry, even when you wish to disagree or present an alternative viewpoint.
                            8. Participate in the community discussion. Read others' comments before posting, and connect your ideas with
                                 what you are hearing from your classmates. 2

                                                                          For Reflection

          Read through your course presentations and find any guidelines for posting to forums. Create a checklist for yourself based on
       these guidelines and the rubric above. What do you need to do to create successful forum posts in your course? Keep this checklist,
       and refer to it regularly as you post to forums.

Give and Receive Feedback

Alice Macpherson and Christina Page

Good communication and learning in an online environment requires giving and receiving feedback. You might
give feedback to classmates in a group project, or receive feedback from your classmates and instructors. What
strategies can help you use feedback most effectively?

                                                                                      Effective feedback must include:
                                                                                      What is being done correctly and well.
                                                                                      How it can be improved.
                                                                                      What the next steps might be.

                                            Receiving Feedback

                                            If another person offers you feedback, it may sound like

                                            criticism. It may be that they intend to be positive but they

                                            may not know how to say something positively. It may also

                                            be that their self-esteem is low and they are being defensive

                                            or aggressive towards you. Most importantly, you may

Image credit: Rawia Inaim                   become defensive or aggressive if you see their feedback as

                                            critical or negative, no matter what was meant.

Attempt to suspend your reaction until you understand the information that is being given. Paraphrase what

you hear. If it seems unclear, ask for clarification. Having it presented in other words or from another point of

view may increase your understanding about what is being said.

Explore and discover the reasons for the comments.

 Is a change by you indicated?
 Is it an evaluation of the past or an indication for the future?

Think about and cope with your possible defensive reaction.

 Do you see wants as demands?
 Do you feel guilty or obligated?
 Are you hearing more than is being said?

Ideally, listen to his/her comments and find the positive side of them. Then, explain your position or point of view
without feeling that you must justify yourself. Determine the importance of the message to you. You may choose
not to change.

      Any discussion will profit from more information. You can wall yourself away from information and change by
   being defensive. You may open new lines of communication by being open.

      Giving Positive Feedback
      It is easy to criticize and to think that we are helping a person deal with a situation. To give the right commentary,
   at the right time, to the right person, with the right reasons, in the right way, and to the right degree is very
   difficult.
      You first need agreement to interact. If the other person is not ready to hear your comments, you set up a
   negative interaction that will cause them to block you and your opinions out. If you do not have permission to
   comment, you may be seen as aggressive and the other person may respond by being aggressive or defensive
   towards you.
      Ask if the other person wants your feedback. If they say no, then you will have to discuss or problem-solve that
   before you say anything more, or you will say nothing at all.
      Search out all the facts you can prior to giving your feedback. Ask the people involved about what they feel is
   happening and how they see the situation. This may solve or help to solve the problem.
      Time the discussion so that you are all reasonably unstressed. Leave time so there is another chance to talk
   before a parting of ways. This will help to avoid or clear misunderstanding or confusion.
      Be Positive. Try to begin and end your feedback with comments about what is working, correct, or right about
   the situation. No matter how bad you perceive things to be, there will be good points to comment on.
      Avoid using absolutes or negative words, words like always or never or don't. Each situation tends to be many
   shades of grey rather than black and white. Actions taken are seen by each person in the light of his/her own
   experiences and perceptions. Use alternative positive words and phrases. Avoid comparing the person involved to
   other people in other situations. The where, when, what, and who of each situation are different. Comparisons tend
   to produce resentment and frustration.
      Be Specific in your description of the problem. Avoid vague or misleading statements. If attitude seems to be a
   problem, show specific instances and then take one point at a time so as not to overload or overwhelm the other
   person. Make sure that it is something that can be changed.
      When you tell someone that you feel they could improve or change, then also make suggestions on how you
   think they might go about making those changes, and what behaviour would be observed if the changes were
   made. Be prepared for no change.
      Feedback can be positive if it:

            is offered at the right time and place,
            is offered with comments on good points as well as possible changes,
            is connected to facts and not rumours,
            is directed to behaviour that can be changed,
            is specific and one point at a time, and
            gives information and possible solutions to change the situation.

   You will not use all of these items in all circumstances, but all of them can be used in some situations.

Learn with ePortfolios

   Many online courses include the opportunity to learn and demonstrate your learning with ePortfolios. To get
started with your ePortfolio, you may need to learn to use an online tool: Mahara and WordPress are two
commonly used tools. Though ePortfolio assignments differ from class to class, there are some advantages to
producing portfolios -- both for your classes, and to extend your professional learning. Eportfolios offer the
following benefits:

        By recording your learning regularly, you are able to show your growth as a learner and a professional
            over time.

        Eportfolios allow you to show and reflect on your learning process. While other assignments focus on
                                                                                       60

Identify Learning Goals for Assignments

You need a clear understanding of what the instructor wants before starting on any assignment of project. Then
you will want to translate assignment terms and requirements into useful clues as to what your instructor expects.
When you are not sure, remember to ask the instructor.

   The first step is to read the assignment carefully as soon as you receive it.

                 Image Credit: Rawia Inaim

   Interpreting the Assignment
   Ask yourself a few basic questions as you read and jot down the answers on the assignment sheet:

        What is the task you need to do in this assignment?
        Why did your instructor ask you to do this particular task?

                                                                                       65
66 KPU Learning Centres
        Who is your audience?
        What kind of evidence do you need to support your ideas?
        What kind of writing style is acceptable?
        What kind of referencing style must be used?
        What guidelines must you follow?

   Terms that might be used to determine the task
        Identification Terms: cite, define, enumerate, give, identify, indicate, list, mention, name, state.
        Description Terms: describe, discuss, review, summarize, diagram, illustrate, sketch, develop, outline, trace.
        Relation Terms: analyze, compare, contrast, differentiate, distinguish, relate.
        Demonstration Terms: demonstrate, explain why, justify, prove, show, support.
        Evaluation Terms: assess, comment, criticize, evaluate, interpret, propose.

   Begin with Background Content
   Most assignment will be related to the materials you have studied in the course up to the point of the assignment.
As you read the assignment or project requirements, start by identifying which theories, formulas, and graphics
relate. Consider what research you will need to do to complete the project.
[23]

Use a Rubric to Evaluate Your Work

What is a Rubric?
   When you receive many of your course assignments, you may also receive a copy of the rubric the instructor will

use to grade your work. The rubric provides information on what criteria shape a highly successful assignment.

   How to Use Rubrics
   Your assignment instructions and rubric are two of your key tools throughout the process of completing the
assignment. These provide an outline of the criteria that the instructor has set out for a successful assignment.
There are two key times to use the rubric and assignment instructions:

         1. Before you start writing: Unfortunately, time may be lost writing something that does not meet the key
              guidelines you must follow. To avoid this problem, take time to read both the assignment instructions
              and rubric carefully before beginning. Clarify any areas of confusion with your instructor.

        2. After you have written a draft, but before you submit the assignment: At this point, grade your work
              according to the rubric. Think carefully and critically. Are there areas where you may not have met the
              criteria well? If so, edit your work accordingly, making the needed revisions before submitting the
              assignment.

The video below provides additional strategies for using rubrics. When you are finished the video, scroll to the
bottom of the page for a reflective activity. Then, go to the next chapter to move on in the workshop.

                        One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:

   Making Rubrics Work for You: Video Script
   When you receive an assignment, you may notice that it includes a rubric or checklist that indicates how your
instructor will mark your work. Have you ever thought that this could be a powerful learning tool for you?
   In this video, you'll learn how use a rubric to its maximum potential to support your learning.
   The first time you want to look at the rubric is when you first begin working on your assignment. You want
to avoid making the unfortunate make of putting a lot of time and effort into an assignment, only to miss an
important element of the assignment requirements.
   Analyze the rubric carefully. What is your instructor looking for? Which sections receive more marks? What
elements are worth fewer marks? Use this information to determine how you want to focus your efforts.
   Not sure what a term on the rubric means? Now is a great time to ask!

                                                                                       67

   Now, imagine that you've finished writing the first draft of your assignment. How does the rubric help now? As
it turns out, there are some powerful things you can do with a rubric at this stage in your work.

   One secret to student success is learning to accurately understand how your work meets the expectations of your
course. One way that you can do this is to put yourself into the place of your instructor, and try to grade your own
assignment according to the rubric.

   Does your assignment meet expectations? If it doesn't quite yet, you still have time to consider what changes you
want to make.

   After you receive the marked assignment from your instructor, compare how your self-evaluation with the
rubric compares with how your instructor graded your work. Where did you notice differences?

   As you continue to use this process, you will work towards using a rubric to self-evaluate accurately - so that
your self-evaluation closely matches your instructor's evaluation of your work.

   So, as you can see, a rubric can be a powerful tool for learning. By using your rubric effectively, you will be able
to produce work that accurately meets the expectations of your course. Make the rubrics work for you!

                                                                                                      Reflection and Application

      Take out your assignment instructions and rubric. Use them to answer the following questions:

              Describe in one sentence your task on this assignment: What do you need to do?
              What resources will you use to complete this assignment? Review any textbook materials, handouts, or class notes that relate

                 to this assignment.
              How many additional resources do you need to find to complete the assignment task? (consider books, peer reviewed

                 articles, websites, or other resources).
              What content do you need to create for this assignment?
              What guidelines do you need to follow related to the format of the assignment?
              What format do you need to use for citations and references (APA, MLA, and Chicago are the most commonly used).

Create an Assignment Plan

Now that you have a clear idea of what you need to do, the next step is to break down the assignment into
manageable "chunks". The idea of completing a major research paper may seem overwhelming, but if you can
divide the task into achievable steps you will be on your way to success.

   Use the chart below to break your assignment into smaller steps. You will want to create steps that can be done
easily in one day, and preferably in a single work period. Consider the following example breakdown for a research
paper.

Assignment Task                                      Target Completion Date  Complete?
Read assignment instructions and rubric              October 2               Y
Review course materials and choose topic             October 3               Y
Library research -- find 3 peer reviewed articles
and two books                                        October 5
Read and take notes on two articles
Read and takes notes on final article and books      October 7
Organize notes; write thesis and outline             October 8
Write body paragraph 1                               October 9
Write body paragraph 2                               October 10
Write body paragraph 3                               October 10
Write body paragraph 4                               October 11
Write conclusion                                     October 11
Write introduction                                   October 12
Self-edit content and organization (use the rubric)  October 12
Writing tutor appointment                            October 14
Edit and proofread assignment                        October 15
Submit final assignment                              October 16
                                                     October 18

   In the above example, the assignment is divided into smaller pieces, with a manageable amount to complete
each day. It is also clear when each task has been completed. A daily work goal like "work on research paper" is
not well-defined, and can seem overwhelming. This can make it easy to procrastinate. By choosing specific and
achievable goals, you may become more motivated to get started, and you will be able to measure your progress
each day. Remember to reward yourself for meeting your goals along the way.

Use Feedback to Move Forward

"We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve." - Bill Gates
   During the learning process, we have many opportunities to receive feedback about the quality of our learning

and work. In the university environment, this often comes in the form of grades and instructor comments on
assignments and exams. By using this feedback to evaluate your learning strategies in light of your goals, you will
be able to make adjustments to move you towards your goals in current and future courses.

   Consider the Purpose of Feedback
   Many people find feedback difficult to receive, particularly when it indicates areas for improvement. Shifting
your mindset as you receive feedback can be a catalyst for personal growth. View feedback as a gift that is
intended to allow personal growth, stronger future academic performance, and professional development. When
you receive feedback, take time to reflect on the comments given. Direct the feedback towards future assignments;
rather than considering what you might to differently on the current assignment, use the feedback to inform your
future goals and work on subsequent projects.

   Reflecting Mid-Course
   An excellent time for self-evaluation is after you have received feedback on your first midterm exam or major
assignment. Consider the following reflection questions at this stage in your course:

        What grade do I hope to achieve in this course? ________
        To what extent am I meeting my goal for the course at this point?
        What about my exam/assignment preparation worked well?
        What about my exam/assignment preparation did not work well? What do I want to change?
        How will what I have learned help me in the second half of the course?
If you have identified an area for growth that requires change, consider new learning strategies. Consider the
resources available to you: online learning, workshops, tutoring, support from classmates, and your instructor.
Identify the people on your "team" that can help you respond to feedback and move towards your new goals.

   Reflecting at the End of a Course
   The completion of a course is also an excellent time for reflection and evaluation. In addition to the questions
in the midterm evaluation, consider the following:

         1. How will what I have learned help me in my next courses?
        2. How will I use what I have learned in my future career and other aspects of my life?
By reflecting on feedback and evaluating your learning regularly, you will avoid getting stuck in unproductive
patterns. You will contribute to your own ongoing personal growth and development, supporting your success in
future courses and other life endeavours.

                                                                                       71

   One of the challenges that many learners in online environments face is learning how to read and process
large amounts of text -- textbooks, articles, and other reading material. The materials in this module provide
information on how to become a more strategic reader. These skills allow you to read with a purpose, selecting
the most important material to support your growth, and reading it strategically. By the end of this module, you
will be able to:

        Assess the place of reading in your learning journey.
        Evaluate your reading skills.
        Review and apply the SQ3R method for reading.
        Read journal articles strategically.
        Take effective notes on online readings.

Assess the Place of Reading in Your Learning Journey

                        Photo credit: Emily Tan

   Reading and the Online Learning Journey
   Online learning typically requires you to interact with a larger amount of written material than traditional in-
class courses. This can benefit your growth as a lifelong learner by developing your skills in selecting relevant
reading material, approaching it purposefully, and managing the information you read. Consider the following
principles as a guide as you approach reading:

         1. Not all reading material requires equal time or attention. Unlike a novel, where you give most pages
              equal time in order to understand the story, much of your professional reading is focused on finding
              and using relevant information. This means that you may not read every word in available readings.
              Some information may require a close and careful reading, while other information may be skimmed
              to find key points.

        2. Before you begin reading, identify your purpose for reading. What do you need to learn from this
              reading? This will determine how you approach the reading material.

        3. Use questions to guide your reading. In the next sections of this module, you will learn a strategy called
              SQ3R that can guide you through the process of using questions to guide your reading.
                                                                                       75
76 KPU Learning Centres

        4. Develop a system for identifying important information and taking notes. You have already explored
              systems for online information management. Consider how you will mark key learning in the texts that
              you read, and organize this information in a form where you can easily access it again.

Go to the next chapter to explore reading strategies in more detail.
[27]

Evaluate Your Reading Skills

Now that you have identified the place of reading in your online learning journey, the next step is to explore your
current reading strategies. What do you do now?

   Complete the quiz below. You will receive feedback about the effectiveness of your current preferred strategy. In
the next sections of the workshop, you will learn some additional strategies to make your reading more effective.
After you complete the quiz, go to the next chapter to move on in the workshop.

Review the SQ3R Method for Strategic Reading

In this chapter, you will watch a short video that describes a method called SQ3R that provides a way to read
efficiently and purposefully. After the video, you will complete a quiz that tests your knowledge of the content you
learned. If you prefer reading to watching a video, scroll below the video to find a transcript.

   Video Transcript
   Now that you've thought about your personal reasons for reading textbooks, how can you read them effectively?
One of the barriers to reading for many students is the time it takes. So, what strategies can help you read more
effectively and efficiently?
   First, it's important to know that you can approach a textbook very differently than a novel. You don't need to
read everything right in order. You will also pay more attention to some sections, and less attention to others.
Here's a process to guide you in your reading. It's called the SQ3R strategy. What does that stand for?

        Survey
        Question
        Read
        Recite
        Review
Let's talk about each step.
   S - Survey. This step allows you to get an overview of the chapter as a whole - what will you learn by reading?
In this step, you will:
        Read the Learning Objectives or chapter introduction
        You will read the chapter summary and the end (you don't have to wait until you're finished the chapter

            to read the summary)
        You'll skim the study questions at the end of the chapter
        And you'll skim the chapter headings, and any important diagrams or charts.

                                                                                       78
                                                                                                                                          Learning to Learn Online 79

At the end of this step, you should know how this chapter is organized and what you will learn by reading. You
might find it helpful to end this step by making an outline of the chapter on a separate page.

   Q - The in S3QR stands for question. This is a key step in reading for a purpose - you need to know what you
hope to learn by reading each part of the chapter. Look at the first chapter heading. Now, make up a question that
you will answer by reading.

   Use who, what, where, when, and why questions.
   R - The first R stands for Read. You will read to answer the questions you just created. This will help you to stay
focused on your purpose for reading.
   R - The second R stands for Recite. After reading each section, say the answer out loud. Now, write this down in
your notes. This step helps you to summarize the material in your own words, which will support your learning
and remembering. Explaining a concept in your own words demonstrates that you understand it.
   R - The last R stands for Review. Look at your notes from the whole chapter. Think about how different concepts
fit together, and fill in any gaps.
   Now that you know the steps in the method, it's time to think more deeply about how this method supports your
learning. You'll do that by completing the quiz in the next section of the workshop. The real test will be applying
the method to your actual reading - try it out, and see how it works for you.

Identify the Purpose of SQ3R Steps

In the previous section of the workshop, you watched a video or read about a reading method called SQ3R. To
strengthen your knowledge of what you learned in the video, take the quiz below. To complete the quiz, drag the
words to the correct places in the paragraph. When you are finished the quiz, move on to the next topic.

      Commit to trying the SQ3R method once this week as you complete your course readings. As you do, consider the following
   questions:

               1. How does the SQ3R method change how you approach your reading?
               2. How will you adapt and personalize this process to your own learning strengths and the specific requirements of your

                     courses?

Video Transcript
Now that you have learned the five steps in the SQ3R method, how will you apply them as you read? In this
video, you will view a demonstration of how this method is applied to the type of reading you might encounter
in a course textbook. I'll focus on the first three steps in the method: surveying the chapter, formulating
questions, and reading to find key information. Today I'm going to read a chapter in an Organizational
Behaviour Textbook on need-based theories of motivation - the same principles would apply to reading in other
courses. My first step is to survey. I'll skim the chapter quickly to get the main idea.
The first place I will begin is the Learning Objectives. I notice that in this textbook, they are located at the
beginning of the chapter. I read these carefully to discover the main concepts that I will learn by reading. The
next part of the chapter I'll review is the key takeaways at the end of the chapter. Remember - there's no rule that
says that I need to read each page in order. By reading the key takeaways, I gain a sense of the most important
information in the chapter. This will help me to focus my reading later.

   Now, I'll go back to the beginning of the chapter, and briefly skim the contents. I'll pay particular attention to the
headings and to any key diagrams. I'm noticing a key diagram for both Maslow's hierarchy of needs and the ERG
theory. I also notice two other key headings as I skim: I now know I will read about two factor theory, and acquired
needs theory. From the information I've gained in the survey step, I've determined that my goals for reading are:

                                                                                       81

        To be able to describe the four theories of motivation.

        To identify how these theories are similar and different.

        And to understand how each theory explains employee behavior.

My next step is to begin questioning and reading. I'll base my questions on key headings I notice. The first heading
I read is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. What questions can I ask about this? You may want to pause this video here,
and try to create 3-4 questions you might want to ask. Then, resume the video to see how the questioning process
works.

   Here are the questions I've developed:

         1. What is Maslow's hierarchy of needs?

        2. What are the levels in Maslow's hierarchy? (I remember that there are levels from my survey step)

        3. Why are there different levels in the hierarchy?

        4. How does Maslow's theory explain employee behavior?

I've added my questions to my notetaking page. I begin reading looking for the answer to my first question. I
find the answer here, in the first paragraph. The theory is based on a simple premise: Human beings have needs that are
hierarchically ranked. There are some needs that are basic to all human beings, and in their absence nothing else matters. As
we satisfy these basic needs, we start looking to satisfy higher order needs.

   Now, I want to add this information to my notes. To get the most benefit of this step, I will recite the information
in my own words, then write it down. The step of putting information into my own words ensures that I
understand it clearly.

   I pause and think about how I can express what I've read in my own words. I can say it like this: Maslow's theory
states that everyone has levels (a hierarchy) of needs. When our basic needs are met, we move to fulfill our higher levels of need.
I'll now add this information to my notes.

   You will notice that I have left a wide margin on my note-taking page. This space allows me to add additional
thoughts, images, and questions about the material later on. I may want to add additional information I learn in
class.

   I'll move through the same steps to answer my other three questions. You may want to pause this video here,
and try these steps out for yourself.

   As I'm reading, I will also take note of key terms in bold letters. For example, I see that physiological needs is a key
term in this chapter. These are words that I want to be able to define, as they are important to my understanding
of the course material.

   I will work through the chapter, following the same steps for each main chapter section: create questions, read
to find the answers, recite my answer, and write it in my notes in my own words.

   Now that you have seen how the SQ3R method might be applied to a textbook chapter, try it! Notice how this
changes your reading process? How do you want to use this information to read in the future?

Read Journal Articles Strategically

Throughout your academic career, you will read a variety of journal articles as you complete coursework and
conduct research for assignments. Journal articles may seem daunting, but by understanding how journal articles
are organized and written, you will be able to choose relevant articles and find the information you need.

Parts of a Journal Article

Abstract and This is a concise summary of the article. Read this first to decide if the article is relevant to your current research topic. Below the abstract

Keywords    you will find 4-5 keywords. These indicate the subject area of the article.

Literature  Most articles will have a literature review early in the paper. This summarizes the past research done on the topic. Note that this is not a
Review      discussion of the research in the current article. However, the literature review may point you to other material relevant to your project.

Research    This section describes the way in which the research was conducted. Who are the participants? Is the study qualitative or quantitative? How

Methodology was the data gathered? Where was the study conducted?

Results     This section discusses the findings of the study in detail. It often includes statistical information, charts and graphs.

Discussion  In this section, the researchers discuss the significance of the results. What do the results mean? Are they significant? What are the
            implications of what was found? The authors might also indicate areas for further study.

References Skim the reference list. This may lead you to other key articles that are related to your topic.

            How to Approach Journal Articles

                     1. Begin by reading the abstract and keywords. Decide if this article relates to your current research project.
                           If the article does not fit well with your research, stop reading.

                     2. If the article seems relevant, scan the article briefly. Look at the headings, as well as terms in bold and italics.
                           Also, look at charts and graphs.

                     3. Before you begin reading the article, note the bibliographic information. You will need this for your Works
                           Cited or References page.

                     4. Now, read the discussion section closely. This is key to understanding the article well.

                     5. On a separate sheet of paper, create questions that you will answer by reading the article. Include questions
                           such as: "From what you know, does this author agree with other researchers and what you understand
                           about the topic? Does this article support or contradict your thesis?"

                     6. Read the article purposefully, answering your questions. Do not be afraid to change your questions as you
                           read and discover more.

                     7. When you find the answers to your questions, write them down, along with the page number where you found
                           the information. You will need the page numbers to properly cite your sources when you write.

            As you learn to approach journal articles systematically, you will become skilled at extracting important information as
         you read.

                                                                   83

Take Effective Notes on Online Readings

Why take notes on online content? After all, you can easily search for it and read it again. However, re-reading
is not always the most effective use of time. Taking good notes helps you to quickly review the key points in the
material that you have read.

   Taking notes is also an effective learning strategy. Intentionally annotating the texts that you read requires you to
critically engage with the material. You are doing the work of identifying the important content, and considering
its implications for your course and your professional practice. This practice facilitates deep learning, and ensures
that you remember key material.

   Choose the note taking method that is most effective for you. You may prefer traditional notebooks. Many
readers underline, highlight, and put key notes in the margins of their books. You may prefer to create typewritten
notes, and to store these notes in using your electronic notebook/ information management system. Another tool
for engaging with digital texts is Hypothes.is. Watch the video below, and consider how this tool might work for
you. If you prefer reading to watching videos, scroll to the bottom of the page for a transcript. When you are
finished, go to the next chapter to move on.

                        One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:

   Video Transcript
   So, you have your texts for your course - but they're not regular textbooks. You'll be using online texts and other
articles as the primary readings in your course. What strategies can you use for making effective notes that will
help you retain what you are reading, prepare for exams, and note key information for use in your assignments?
   One tool that can help you take notes electronically is Hypothesis. Hypothesis is a free tool that you add to the
Chrome browse that allows you to highlight and add notes to online text. In this video, you will learn how to install
Hypothesis, create notes and highlights, and create a group to work collaboratively with your classmates.
   To get started with Hypothesis, you will first create a free account. Type hypothesis into the search bar to visit
the page. On the top right, you will find a "Get Started" button. Click here to create your account. You will provide
your email address, create a user name, and password. Then, check your email and click on the link to activate
your account.
   The second step is to install the Hypothesis extension in your web browser. In this case, you will use the Chrome
browser. To install the extension, go to the "Get Started" section of the Hypothesis page. Then, click the Chrome
extension button. This will guide you through the steps of installing the extension.
   When the extension is installed, you will see a square icon at the top left of your screen. When you click this
icon, you will see a new menu on the far right of your browser. Click the arrow to open the menu and login.

                                                                                       85

   Next, you will choose where to store your notes. Be aware that the default setting is public. You will likely want
to create a private group for personal notes or group projects. To create a group, click on Public, and then create a
new private group. For each text you highlight, you can choose which group can see your notes. This feature can
be especially helpful for group study and projects. You may also wish to create a group that only you can see to
store personal notes.

   Now, begin reading and taking notes. Today I'm going to read and take notes on this chapter on procrastination
from an online text.

   When I highlight some text, I have the option to highlight or annotate the text. When you click on highlight, the
text is marked with a yellow highlight, as you might expect. This can be helpful in identifying key points in the
document. However, be careful not to over-highlight - be very selective in highlighting only key information.

   I assumed that procrastination was always a time management problem. What might be a different reason that I
procrastinate?

   Finally, I can choose to add a page note that summarizes my key learnings or questions, or indicates how I might
use this information in the future. As I read this page, I found the information on the Pomodoro technique useful.
If I was reading this text together with a group of classmates, I might add something like this to the notes:

   I found the Pomodoro technique interesting - has anyone else used this method successfully?
   My group members can then respond with their own insights.
   Reading purposefully requires you to actively interact with texts. In this video, you learned how to use
Hypothesis as a tool for engaging with online texts. You learned how to create an account, install the extension,
and use the basic highlighting and annotation tools.
   How might you use Hypothesis to support the reading in your courses?
