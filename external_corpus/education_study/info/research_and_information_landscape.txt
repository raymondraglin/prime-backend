Introduction: Research and the
Information Landscape

This open textbook accompanies the University of Missouri -St. Louis
class INTDSC 1010: Research and the Information Landscape. Intended
for undergraduates new to academic research, the course covers practical
search and evaluation skills as well as a basic introduction to the world
of scholarly communication. In Fall 2025, the course's learning objectives
were:

 1. Evaluate whether a source is appropriate for college-level research.
 2. Navigate library search tools to find relevant results and improve

      research efficiency.
 3. Analyze the goals and limitations of non-library tools in the research

      landscape.
 4. Explain the basic history and current broad practices of scholarly

      communication.
 5. Contribute to a small-scale version of the "scholarly conversation."

Future versions of this book will reflect significant edits and restructuring
in response to instructor reflection on the success of previous semesters.
This version is our first iteration, used in Fall 2025. We preserve this version
of the text to accompany the Fall 2025 Student Bibliography, available at
the end of the book, which includes the sources cited and annotated by
students for their final project. The course was taught by UMSL Librarians
Libby Wheeles and Helena Marvin, who developed this textbook with
contributions from Tim Nelson.

WHAT IS RESEARCH?

What is Research?

At its most basic, research is the process of "finding things out." You have
a question, or a topic you'd like to learn more about, and you go out into
the world to find what, or who, can give you the answers to that question.
Rather than a thing you discover, it is the activity of brainstorming,
searching, evaluating, and synthesizing. You are actively engaging with the
world around you - bringing your own ideas and experiences to the table -
to build and sometimes share knowledge.

   Along the way, you interact with materials (both physical and digital),
people, organizations, and larger systems that are steeped in history and
impacted by social, economic, and legal norms and expectations. Some
of these structures are visible, and some are not. All of them influence
how information is created, preserved, organized, and shared. Learning
these influences will help you navigate the research process successfully and
thoughtfully.

   Not only is this "information landscape" deceptively complex, but the
act of research is sometimes like an iceberg - simple at the surface, but
much larger-scale than your initial expectations as you dive deeper. You
may find yourself overwhelmed by the massive amounts of information
available. Where do you start? What makes one source better than another?
What do you do with all that information once you have it?

   Don't worry. We aren't expecting you to become advanced researchers
in eight weeks. Finding, navigating, evaluating, and even producing
information is a skill you'll be developing your whole life as society and
technology changes around us. Plus, some of you may pursue research as a
career, in which case you'll get rigorous training on expectations for your
field in later coursework.

   Our goal is to focus on the essential skills you need to get started, plus
some background knowledge that will help you think critically about the
"information landscape" as it exists today. We are focusing on just a few
steps of the larger research process.
12 | WHAT IS RESEARCH?

Steps of the Research Process

Saying that research happens in "steps" is a bit too simple. In reality, you'll
probably bounce between different steps as you discover new knowledge,
make new connections, and decide to pursue different paths. However, it is
helpful to know what these steps are as a starting point:

 1. Choosing a topic. Before you can start searching, you need to know
      what information you're looking for! Keep in mind that your starting
      topic may adjust or change entirely based on what you find once you
      start searching. You may get new ideas, find a more specific topic you
      find interesting, or have trouble finding sources on your original idea.

 2. Getting background information. If you're new to a topic, you
      may need foundational knowledge before doing deeper research. You
      may use either the Internet or library resources (like encyclopedias) to
      define new vocabulary, explore historical timelines and contexts for
      an issue, learn about important people and places, and more.

 3. Finding sources. This is the process that most people are referring
      to when they say "research," and it's also going to be a significant
      focus in this class. Finding sources requires knowing what different
      source types are, where and how they're organized, and how to locate
      them with modern search tools.

 4. Evaluating sources. In other words, how do you decide whether a
      source is trustworthy and relevant to your research? We'll also cover
      evaluation basics in this class.

 5. Synthesizing information. This stage - where you make
      connections between sources and use those ideas to support your
      own argument and voice - is closely linked to the writing process, or
      whichever other medium you use to share your findings.

 6. Citing sources. This stage is often forgotten by beginner
      researchers, but it is VERY IMPORTANT. Research builds on the
      work of scholars who came before us and involves sharing our own
      findings with our peers. To do so, it's crucial to correctly share which
      sources we used to create our own work.

Again, for this class we're focusing on just some of these stages - finding,
evaluating, and citing sources - plus taking a broader look at why the
"information landscape" works the way it does. We hope these new skills
and knowledge base will provide a helpful support for you as a beginner
researcher!

Key Takeaways

· Navigating today's information landscape requires
   interacting with seen and unseen social, economic, and
   legal structures that influence how information is created,
   preserved, organized, and shared.

· Research is a process with steps that include include
   choosing a topic, finding background information, finding
   sources, evaluating sources, synthesizing information, and
   citing sources.

· Moving back and forth between research steps is common
   as you use new knowledge to adjust your original ideas.
14 | THE SCHOLARLY CONVERSATION, CITATIONS, AND
PLAGIARISM

4.

THE SCHOLARLY
CONVERSATION, CITATIONS,
AND PLAGIARISM

The Scholarly Conversation

Research involves finding what other people (hopefully experts) have said
about the topic you're investigating. In fact, these experts may have been
talking about your topic - doing research, sharing their findings, reading
each other's work, and then using that information to do new research -
for many years.

   Jumping into this conversation can be overwhelming! Each article, book,
video, or other source you find is someone's contribution to that
conversation. When you use that information as part of your own
assignments, you are now part of the conversation! If you publicize
your own work eventually, someone else interested in the topic might find
it and use your ideas as part of their research. Thus, the conversation
continues.

Citations

Citations are an essential part of the scholarly conversation. In order to
give credit to other people's contributions, and so your readers can find
the sources you used, you must provide citations for any information you
include that isn't your own work. This information includes quotes,
paraphrased ideas, images, data, and more.

   Later, we'll learn how to properly format a citation. (You are, of course,
encouraged to watch our citations overview video ahead of time if you like.)
For now, it's just important to know that they are not optional. If you're
ever not sure how to format a citation, do your best instead of skipping
it. At minimum, include the title, author, and date if you can find it. For
online sources, include a link.
                     THE SCHOLARLY CONVERSATION, CITATIONS, AND
                                                                      PLAGIARISM | 15

     Examples

     Here's a couple examples of what citations look like:
        Vancouver Aquarium. "Sea Otters Milo and Otis Holding
        Paws." YouTube, September 30, 2011,
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHIIzcWqsP0.
        Jorgensen-Wells, M. A., Shawcroft, J., Taylor, L. D., & Spencer,
        E. (2025). Romantic ideas and ideals in popular music: A
        content analysis of the Taylor Swift musical
        catalog. Psychology of Popular Media. https://doi.org/10.1037/
        ppm0000606

Plagiarism

Plagiarism is including information from outside sources without credit
or claiming someone else's work as yours. It is a very serious academic
offense. Do not submit work that isn't yours or skip citations for outside
sources. You risk losing credit for your assignment, not to mention more
serious consequences from the university.

   Please reach out to your professors, the writing center, the library, or
another appropriate person on campus if you're not sure whether part of
your assignment constitutes plagiarism. We're happy to work with you.

   All that sounds scary, but good news - if you don't already know how to
cite outside sources, you'll learn in this class!

     Key Takeaways
16 | THE SCHOLARLY CONVERSATION, CITATIONS, AND
PLAGIARISM

         · The scholarly conversation involves researchers sharing
             their findings on a topic and others responding to/building
             on those findings to create a larger body of knowledge.

         · Citations acknowledge where you found outside
             information and are an essential component of the
             scholarly conversation.

         · Plagiarism is claiming other's work as your own.

UMSL LIBRARIES

Your Library: An Introduction

Many people consider the library the heart of a campus. At UMSL, we are
a primary hub of research and learning for students, faculty, and staff. We
facilitate access to essential research materials, teach students how to find
and evaluate sources, provide study spaces, and more.

   Before we jump into the nitty-gritty of research, it's important to
understand the library's role on campus and how we can support you
during your time UMSL (and maybe, beyond).

What do libraries do?

As we've covered already, the "information landscape" is enormous and
complex. It includes people, organizations, print and digital materials, and
the systems that link them together. When you do research, you navigate
this complicated network to find the specific information you need.

   A university library has several roles in supporting this process:

 1. Collecting and providing access to reliable materials that
      are relevant to the research needs of our students and faculty. We
      purchase books, we subscribe to databases, and we recommend
      reputable free online resources. We can't buy everything (and we
      don't have space for it), so we focus our efforts on the assignments
      and research endeavors of our UMSL community.

 2. Guiding students and faculty on how to find materials and navigate
      library search tools. We visit classes, we host workshops, we hold one-
      on-one research appointments, we create online guides and tutorials,
      and more. And, we teach this class!

 3. Providing space for individual and group work on school
      assignments, research activities, and more. The library building at
      UMSL is in the final stages of an exciting renovation. When
      everything is completed, we'll have open work spaces, computers,
      study rooms, a floor for silent study, and an information desk to help
      you navigate or answer other research questions. Many of these
      spaces are open already!
18 | UMSL LIBRARIES

Facilitating access, helping patrons use and evaluate materials, and
providing space are the major goals of any library, whether it's an academic
library (in other words, at a college/university), a public library, a K-12
school library, or one of many "special" libraries (for example, a medical
library). They provide an essential service in a world where information is
complex, often expensive, and possibly inaccurate.

What materials does a university library
have?

We have more than you think! The specific materials a library owns differ
by library and the needs of their college/university. Most of our materials
are:

  · Books (print and digital)
  · Academic journal articles (print and digital)
  · Newspapers (online or on a special preservation material called

      microfilm)
  · Special print materials like music scores or government documents
  · Other digital materials accessible through online databases (including

      primary sources, streaming video or audio, and more)

Many libraries also have special collections - usually older documents,
photographs, and other materials that require special care - related to the
unique focus of their library or institution. At UMSL, there are multiple
libraries that share one building, and two of them hold unique special
collections. (See more detail below!)

Library materials: are they free?

Although books, articles, and other library materials are usually free to
patrons, most of them are not free to the library. If patrons tried to access
them outside the library, they would cost money (often a LOT of money,
especially resources for academic research).

   We talk more about the "information economy" - who profits from
limiting and selling access to information - in Week 6. For now, we want to
introduce few concepts:

 1. Paywall. If you try to access most academic research materials online
      - for example, scholarly books and articles - outside of your library
      access, you'll hit a paywall. For example, you may see a screen asking
      you to pay $30 for individual access to one academic article. Don't
      pay this fee! Instead, reach out to the library to see if we already pay
      for access to this item. We can even often get access through other
                                                                UMSL LIBRARIES | 19

      libraries if we don't have it ourselves.
 2. Open access (OA). Some materials are available for free online.

      There is a growing movement to make scholarly research (and other
      materials) available for free. Again, we talk more about OA in Week
      6.
 3. Open educational resources (OER). OER are free resources
      created by educators to support student learning. They replace
      traditional costly textbooks. We are building an OER in this class!
      As the class progresses, we are publishing most of the week's content
      online so that you and future students can access the material for
      free. Part of your final project will involve a small contribution
      (anonymous, if you wish) to this resource. Like OA, the OER
      movement is an exciting and steadily growing movement to made
      education more affordable and accessible.

Libraries at UMSL

Though we share the same building, there are actually three libraries on the
UMSL campus. Knowing the basics about each one will help you navigate
our resources.

Thomas Jefferson Library (TJ)

TJ is the main campus library. Your instructors are both reference
librarians at TJ Library. We provide access to print and digital materials
to support UMSL students, faculty, and staff, we schedule research
appointments, we work with different departments on campus, and we
provide work space in the library building.

Important TJ Library Services

The library offers several crucial services to support research and learning
on our campus.

Research Appointments

Meet with an UMSL Librarian either in person or over Zoom. We meet
with students at all stages for a variety of research needs or questions. We
help students adjust their research topics, navigate library search tools, and
20 | UMSL LIBRARIES

choose which resources are best for their project. You can schedule an
appointment based on availability or select the librarian assigned to your
subject area.

Other Research Help

You can also get research help by visiting the Public Service Desk (we even
have librarians available on most weekends) or using the online chat. Find
the chat by visiting our website and looking in the lower-right corner. The
chat is best for quicker questions rather than in-depth research help. It is
NOT a bot: real librarians are available to assist you!

Events

We host a combination of fun events and workshops to level up your
research skills. Visit the calendar on our website for details.

Interlibrary Loan

If we don't have access to something you need, we can help you get it (at no
cost) from another library. There are two options to make requests:

 1. MOBIUS. MOBIUS is a consortium of academic, public, and
      research libraries that work together to share materials. You can
      search for print books on the MOBIUS search, then log in to request
      specific items. You'll receive an email notification when the item is at
      the TJ Library front desk for pickup.

 2. Interlibrary loan. For articles or books not available through
      MOBIUS. Fill out the online request form, then keep an eye on your
      UMSL email address. Digital materials will come in as a scanned
      PDF. Print materials will be sent to the TJ Library front desk for
      pickup.

The St. Louis Mercantile Library

The Mercantile Library is the oldest general library in continuous
existence west of the Mississippi. Founded in 1846, it relocated to the
UMSL campus in 1998 from its original home in downtown St. Louis.
                                             UMSL LIBRARIES | 21

The Mercantile is a research

library with collections

concentrated on Western

Expansion  and  the

history, development, and growth

of the St. Louis region and of the

American rail and river

transportation experiences. You

can find the Mercantile on the

lower two floors of the library building under the signature glass pyramid.

UMSL students are welcome to schedule appointments with Mercantile

curators for specialized research assistance and access materials (again, by

appointment) in the Reading Room. Also, keep an eye out for the opening

of the new art gallery on Level 2 of the library building. Along with the

ABOUT WEEK 2

Week 2: Foundations of Academic
Research

In Week 2, we introduce the building blocks of academic research:
information sources and how we categorize them. We cover important
vocabulary (for example, what is a "scholarly source"?) and discuss the
basics of why you use different source types. We also discuss the structure
of academic sources so you can read them effectively and begin building
your own citations. Finally, we provide a brief overview of peer review, a
major factor in searching for and evaluating scholarship.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this week, you should be able to:

         1. Identify common source types used in academic research
        2. Choose an appropriate source type based on a research

             need
        3. Identify the structure of scholarly books and journal

             articles
        4. Explain (briefly) the purpose of peer review

The knowledge and skills you acquire this week will help you understand
26 | MAPPINGINTRO

what you're seeing in the results list of a library search tool (or Google
search!) and choose appropriate sources for college-level research.

Introducing Source Types

A major goal this week is introducing common source types in academic
research. We think about these source types in two ways:

 1. Purpose of the source (Who created the source and why?)
 2. Purpose of the researcher - that's you! (What type of

      information do you need from this source? How do you plan to use
      it?)

There is some overlap in different definitions of source "types."
Additionally, although it is tempting to label different source types as
good/bad (or reliable/unreliable), the truth is that the same source may
be more or less appropriate for your research depending on your specific
need. Take, for example, a questionable Instagram reel recommending
peanut butter as a cure for the common cold. This source would be
inappropriate for personal health or academic medical research, but it
might be an excellent example in a research paper on social media
misinformation.

   This chapter covers foundational vocabulary you will see throughout
this course. We encourage you to refer back to this chapter at any point for
a review.

Expertise

As we discuss different source types, we use the terms expert or expertise.
There are many ways to think about expertise, including academic
expertise, lived experience, professional experience, etc.

   We explore the complications of expertise later in this course (in Week 4:
Source Evaluation). For now, we focus primarily on academic expertise -
i.e., an advanced degree and research experience in a given field.

       A popular source aims to inform, entertain, or persuade the
                            POPULAR AND SCHOLARLY SOURCES | 29

  general public. Most popular source creators are not scholarly
  experts on the topic in question.

  A scholarly source is written by an academic expert to
  communicate original research or other academic discourse
  with other scholars.

Key Takeaway

College-level research will almost always require or benefit
from scholarly sources like articles or book chapters. Scholarly
sources are written by and for other academics and they offer
well-researched, in-depth information designed to support
further research on the topic.

SCHOLARLY BOOKS

Scholarly Books Overview

       Scholarly books are written by academic experts and cover
       niche topics on an in-depth, scholarly level. They consolidate,
       explain, and evaluate previous research in their field primarily
       for an audience of other researchers or professionals.
       Students or the general public may also find these books
       useful for deeper reading on a topic of interest.

Organization of Scholarly
Books

Unlike popular books, scholarly books often do not follow a single
narrative from start to finish. Instead, many are a collection of essays
related to a larger theme. Although one or more editors oversee the entire
work, each chapter may have different authors and their own reference lists.
Even books with a single author may include chapters on different topics
that don't need to be read front to back.

   This structure means that (with some exceptions) you do not have to
read the entire book to get helpful information. You may find that 1-2
chapters are useful, while the others are irrelevant to your project.

topic. It is common to read and cite a single chapter from a

scholarly book in your reference list.

Activity: Skim a Scholarly Book

The library has many examples of scholarly books both in print and
digitally. Since we have not yet learned how to search the library site, here
are some examples that are available open access. Choose one and quickly
browse the Table of Contents plus 1-2 chapters. You can read in depth if
you like, but the goal here is to get familiar with the overall organization,
style, and scope.

  · Bandits in Print: "The Water Margin" and the Transformations of
      the Chinese Novel, Scott W. Gregory (2023)

  · Synthetic Frontiers: Ocean Plastic and the Persistence of Trash Islands,
      Kim de Wolff (2020)

  · How the World Changed Social Media, Daniel Miller et al. (2016)

Additional Notes

  · Textbooks do not count as scholarly books. Textbooks
      communicate well-known information in a field that typically does
      not need to be cited unless you are quoting directly. Additionally,
      their primary audience is students rather than other scholars. Keep in
      mind that not every book assigned for class reading is a textbook.
         Check with your professor if you are not sure whether a book
            you're assigned to read for class is a traditional textbook or
            another scholarly work. They can help you determine whether
            the information in the book can be cited for an assignment.

  · Myths about print books:
         Myth 1: print books are out of date. Academic libraries still
            purchase plenty of new books in print for a variety of reasons.
            The percentage of books available in print vs. online may vary
            by institution, but if you discount print resources, you may be
            missing out on valuable information. Also, older ideas and
            information are not automatically less useful (depending on
            your field of study and research topic).
         Myth 2: book sources will take too long to read. First, we
            encourage choosing sources based on their relevancy to your
            topic, not how quickly you can read them. Second, as we
            explain above, it is common to cite just one relevant chapter
            from a longer work. Many book chapters are not meaningfully
            different in length than a journal article.

JOURNALS AND JOURNAL
ARTICLES

Overview

Journals (and the articles they contain) are one of the primary formal ways
that researchers communicate with each other. Scholars keep up with
current research by reading journals that are important in their field, or
even by reading articles published by a specific scholar. When they share
their own research, they typically write about it in a journal article for
publication in a journal they know their colleagues will read. By reading
and publishing articles, they contribute to the scholarly conversation.

Scholarly Journals

       A scholarly journal publishes articles written by academic
       experts on topics relevant to the theme of the journal.

Journals, just like newspapers, publish periodically - meaning they
publish a collection of new articles on a regular schedule. This schedule
could be once a month, every three months, once a year, etc. The journal's
name will usually give you a clue to what the articles are about. The Review
of Educational Research, for example, publishes education articles. The
Journal of Fish Biology publishes research on fish and fisheries.

   Unlike most newspapers, scholarly journals offer rigorous, in-depth
information - often original research from experts in a given field. Scholars
become very familiar with which journals are important to read to keep up
with new research and where they should publish their own ideas so their
                                   JOURNALS AND JOURNAL ARTICLES | 37
colleagues will read them. If you pursue a degree or a career that requires
reading or publishing your own research, you'll also start to recognize
certain journal names (and certain scholars' names as well).

   In addition to articles with original research or reviews of past research,
journals publish:

  · book reviews
  · editorials (short essays sharing the personal opinion of a researcher

      on a topic related to the scope of the journal)
  · other non-peer-reviewed content

More articles get submitted to scholarly journals than are actually
published. It is a competitive process for a researcher to get their article
accepted in a prestigious journal. We talk more about this process in the
chapter on peer review.

Scholarly Journal Articles

       A scholarly journal article is an article published in a
       scholarly journal to communicate research or other academic
       ideas. You may also see the term academic journal article.

Journal articles are one of the primary ways that researchers communicate
with each other. Most journal articles follow a similar structure, which can
be helpful to understand to make reading them quicker and easier.

   Before we explore articles in depth, complete the following activity:

     Activity: Skim a Journal Article
38 | JOURNALS AND JOURNAL ARTICLES

     Follow the link. Then, read the title and skim each section of
     the article.

        Reira-Sampol, A., Rodas, L., Martínez, S., Moir, H., & Tauler, P.

        14(8), 1661. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/
        PMC9029267/

Notice the layout and section headings of this journal article. They are very
similar to the organization of the scholarly article about cats you saw in
the chapter about popular and scholarly sources. In the next chapter, we'll
discuss the purpose of each section and point out how to use information
about the article to create citations.

     Key Takeaways

         · Publishing articles in scholarly journals is one of the main
             ways researchers communicate with each other.

         · Scholarly journals publish articles relevant to the topic of
             the journal on a regular schedule.

ANATOMY OF A JOURNAL
ARTICLE & CITATIONS

Reading Journal Articles

Academic journal articles can seem long, dense, and tedious to beginner
researchers. They may describe research strategies you are unfamiliar with,
include complicated graphs or data tables, use field-specific vocabulary (we
call this jargon), or assume you have background information on the topic
that you don't actually have yet. This is because these articles are written by
experts for other experts to read.

   Don't worry! Every researcher out there was once in your position. It's
okay if you don't understand everything in an article right away. As you get
more familiar with research, you'll improve in your ability to comprehend
articles and know which parts are the most relevant to your work. It
takes practice.

   To start with, it helps to know two categories of information:
information about the article and sections within the article.

   To demonstrate, we'll look in detail at the article you skimmed in the last
chapter. If you didn't skim it then, please do so now:

Information About the Article

Another name for information about an article, book, etc. is metadata. You
should be able to find the following information by skimming a journal
article:

  · Article title
  · Journal title
  · Publication date
  · Volume and issue number
  · Page number(s)
  · DOI (or, digital object identifier)

         The DOI is simply a unique number attached to an article to
            identify it. You can think of it like your student ID number.

You need all these pieces of information to create a citation for an article.
For the Reira-Sampol et al. article on undergraduate caffeine intake (2022),
we can find all this information near the top of the screen:
                   ANATOMY OF A JOURNAL ARTICLE & CITATIONS | 41

   Here's the full citation for the
article again. This time, we're
including the DOI instead of a
link. See if you can find each piece
of metadata:

We'll go into more specifics about creating citations later. For now,
comparing each piece of information should give you an idea of where to
look for it and how it fits into a bigger citation.

Parts of a Journal Article

 2. How are articles different in the humanities vs. sciences and social

      sciences?

Definition Recap

       An abstract is a short overview of an article's purpose,
       research methods, and main takeaways. It's the first part of a
       journal article you should read to get an overview of the
       content and decide whether the article is relevant to your
       research.

Some other video takeaways:

 1. Journal articles are tough! Give yourself time and grace when reading
      a new article, especially if it's in a field outside your area of expertise.

 2. You don't always have to read the entire journal article for it to be
      useful, nor do you have to read it in order. You might read different
      sections for different reasons:
       1. Results/Discussion/Conclusion: For the main results of the
            study and the authors' primary takeaways.
       2. Literature Review: For a helpful summary of previous research
            on the topic.
       3. Methods: For details on how the study was conducted.

 3. Journal articles in the humanities are less rigidly structured than
      those in the sciences/social sciences. It might make more sense to
      read humanities articles from start to finish.

Let's review the parts of a sciences/social sciences journal article by
reexamining Reira-Sampol et al. (2022). Were you able to find the following
sections?

PEER REVIEW

Introduction

Peer review is an important step in the publication of scholarly articles.
We introduce peer review now so that you know what this term means
when we start exploring library search tools next week. We'll also be doing
a small-scale version of peer review as part of our final project for this class.

Peer Review

As we discussed earlier this week, scholarly sources are written by academic
experts for other academics to read. Scholars share information in a variety
of formats. We've covered scholarly books and research articles, but
academic journals may also publish other types of content like editorials or
book reviews.

   Everything published by an academic publisher goes through review
by a professional editor. However, research articles often go through an
additional process called peer review.

       Peer review is the process by which academic journal
       articles are reviewed by experts before they can be
       published. Reviewers with experience on the topic evaluate
       whether the article presents original ideas, uses sound
       methodology, and comes to reasonable conclusions.

For an introduction to peer review, please watch the video below (run time
4:08):

        information/?p=185#oembed-1

We will talk more about peer review in Week 4: Source Evaluation. For now,
it is just important to know the following:

  · The primary goal of peer review is to promote the publication of
      high-quality, reliable research.

  · You may need to seek out peer-reviewed articles for an assignment or,
      eventually, your own research.

     Key Takeaways

         · Peer review is when experts review research before
             publication to make sure it is high quality.

         · Despite valid criticisms, peer-reviewed research is still
             considered the "gold standard" of scholarly publications.

         · You may need to find peer-reviewed research for some
             assignments.

Other Source Types

Popular and scholarly sources represent most of the source types you'll
use as beginner researchers. However, you may see other source types in a
results list or use them yourself. Here's a quick look at other source types
you may come across:

Reference

       A reference source provides introductory or background
       information about a topic, directed at students or the general
       public.
50 | BEYOND POPULAR AND SCHOLARLY

   Examples of reference sources
include:

· Encyclopedias
· Dictionaries
· Maps
· Your class textbooks

These sources provide overviews

and timelines, define new             An advertisement for the 11th
vocabulary, and sometimes even        edition of the Encyclopedia
recommend additional reading          Britannica, published in the May
material.                             1913 issue of National Geographic

   Use these sources to review facts

and get ideas for further research,

but do not include them as sources in your assignments. Their contents are

considered common knowledge (aka, not original ideas), and therefore the

information does not usually require citation unless you quote it directly.

If you make a direct quote it should be in quotes and cited. When in doubt,

check with your professor or a librarian.

Do we still need reference sources in the age of Google (or AI?)

Short answer: yes. Reference materials offer reliable information that has

been reviewed by a real person - plus, they sometimes direct you to

additional helpful sources.

Wikipedia

Wikipedia is a reference source. (It is also a popular source.) Unlike most
encyclopedias, it does not go through a traditional editorial process, nor
are many of its authors considered experts in their field (though some are).
Instead, volunteer editors contribute to articles in their area of interest,
leading to a crowd-sourced hub of information that is free to access and
updated much quicker than a formal encyclopedia.

   Caution is warranted when relying on information from Wikipedia.
Without the same oversight as other reference sources, Wikipedia articles
may contain incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information. Depending
on the popularity of the article, and how many volunteer editors are
keeping an eye on it, a mistake may live on the site for some time. (Note:
Some popular articles limit editing access due to frequent "vandalism.")
However, it's also true that Wikipedia's reliability and comprehensiveness
has increased dramatically since its founding in 2001.

Example

During the 2014 FIFA

World Cup, the US men's

soccer team played and lost

against Belgium. However,

US goalkeeper Tim Howard

managed an impressive 16

saves against the Belgian    Image credit: Jared Campbell
offense. Admiration for

Howard quickly spread across the Internet. Shortly afterwards, a

mischievous Wikipedia editor changed the entry for the U.S.

Secretary of Defense from then-Secretary Chuck Hagel to Tim

Howard.

The joke was caught and corrected quickly. However, this
example demonstrates how quickly and easily an anonymous
Internet user can edit articles on a site that many rely upon for
quick, accurate information.

Government Information

Government information is any documents, data, laws/
policies, etc. produced, collected, or disseminated by a
federal, state, or local government.

   This category includes a variety
of information types and formats:
laws and regulations, data (e.g.,
census data), agency reports,
government websites, etc.
Examples of information you
could get from government
sources include:

· changes in demographic

trends over time (from               Photo credit: NASA/Jordan Salkin,

census data)                         2024

· current policy or laws on

federal student loans (from

the Department of Education website or Congress.gov)

· photographs of the 2024 solar eclipse (from the NASA Image and

Video Library)

· local zoning ordinances/maps (e.g., St. Louis Zoning Map from the

St. Louis city government website)

Did you know? You can search for government information by going
to specific .gov sites or typing your topic into Google with the
phrase site:gov.

Professional or Trade Publications

A trade publication communicates recent news and trends
in a profession to members of that field. Trade publications
are less formal than scholarly journals.

   In addition to articles about
major trends and updates, trade
publications include other
information of interest like
targeted advertisements, job
postings, or conference
announcements. The author of an
article in a trade publication may
be a practitioner in that field or
possibly a journalist with field
expertise.

the following examples of trade
publications (accessible freely
online):

Conference Proceedings

       Conference proceedings are collections of research papers
       or other information presented at a conference.

Conference proceedings may or may not be peer-reviewed (we cover peer
review in an upcoming chapter). Sometimes, they offer an early glimpse
of research findings that will be published again later as an independent
journal article or in another publication. You are not likely to use
conference proceedings in an undergraduate research assignment, but you
may see them when searching library databases or Google Scholar.

Theses and Dissertations

       Theses and dissertations are intensive student research
       projects completed as requirements for a master's degree or
       Ph.D.

These publications are student works and, although they are supervised, are
not peer-reviewed (we cover peer review in an upcoming chapter). In most
cases, they are not appropriate to cite in your research assignments.
However, if you find one relevant to your research topic, they can be
excellent guides to additional sources relevant to your topic. Again, you
may see these sources in the results list of a library database or Google
Scholar.

Key Takeaways

    · You'll find many source types in the results list of a library
        search tool or other search engine. Even if you don't use
        all of them for your research assignments, it's helpful to
        recognize what they are and their target audience.

    · Reference sources (including textbooks or Wikipedia) are
        helpful for gathering background information on your
        topic, but you shouldn't cite them as sources for your
        assignments because they usually don't contain original
        research or ideas.

    · Unlike reference sources, government information, or
        (possibly) trade publications, you might not use
        conference proceedings or theses/dissertations in
        undergraduate research. But, you might still see them in a
        results list.
56 | PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES

PRIMARY AND SECONDARY
SOURCES

Firsthand information or expert
analysis?

In addition to understanding a source's origin and target audience, we
can also consider how that information contributes to your topic. Would
your research benefit from a firsthand account of an event? Do you want
to support your argument with an expert's well-researched opinion? Do
you need help finding new sources? You may need a combination of
primary, secondary, or even tertiary sources for a given research project.

   Memorizing this terminology is less important than understanding that
you, a student and beginning scholar, can and should approach each source
with an idea about how you intend to use it. What type of information do
you need? What kind of source would be the best place to get it?

Primary and Secondary Sources

For an overview of primary and secondary sources, watch the video below

                                 PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES | 57

Definition Recap

       A primary source is a firsthand, original account of
       information. It is captured or recorded as the topic in
       question is happening, in the immediate aftermath of an
       event, or from a person with a direct connection to that
       information.

       A secondary source is a discussion or interpretation of
       information that originated somewhere else. Rather than
       providing a direct connection to the topic, it reviews or builds
       on that information.

Tertiary Sources

       A tertiary source summarizes information available in other
       sources; it does not provide additional new information or
       content. Reference materials (e.g. encyclopedias) are
       examples of tertiary sources.
58 | PRIMARY AND SECONDARY SOURCES
Tertiary sources simply restate information which originated elsewhere or
is commonly known: there is no new analysis or interpretation. You can
use journal articles or book chapters (or Wikipedia) as tertiary sources by
searching their reference lists for new sources on a topic!

     Key Takeaways

         · Primary sources offer firsthand information about a topic.
             In addition to historical materials, images, literature, etc.,
             primary sources include original research data or ideas
             published in academic journal articles.

         · Secondary sources review or analyze primary information.
             They include books, documentaries, or the literature
             review section of journal articles.

         · When searching for sources, consider your research on a
             broad scale. What kind of information would best
             demonstrate or explain your topic?

STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW
ABOUT GOOGLE

Why We Talk About Google

You've almost definitely used Google before for personal information needs
- to look up basic facts, to find websites, to get directions, etc. It's so
ubiquitous that "Googling" has become its own verb.

   Because it's so frequently used, most people are unaware of how Google
works "behind the scenes" or of what they can't find on Google. Much of
this lack of awareness is by design. Like other large tech companies, much
of Google's technological underpinnings and corporate decisions are kept
private. Of course, it would be unusual for a company to advertise its own
limitations.

   However, as a researcher (and as a personal user), it's important to be
aware of the basics of how a search engine like Google works, what it's well-
suited for, what it's NOT well-suited for, and some other major criticisms.
In this chapter, we offer a short introduction to things we think you should
know as you decide which search tools to use in class and at home.
64 | STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GOOGLE

Google: The Basics

Google is the most widely-used search engine in the world.

       A search engine takes your query - in other words, what
       you type into the search bar - and gives you a list resources
       relevant to your search. To provide the list, it compares your
       search with its own index of resources, which it compiles by
       periodically "crawling" billions of websites.

The basic steps of Google's process are:

 1. Google "crawls" the web and retrieves text, video, images, etc. This
      process is largely automated.

 2. Google indexes the content it finds. It stores information about this
      text and media in a large database.

 3. When you submit a search, Google compares the words in your
      search with the information in its database. If there is a match, a link
      to that source shows up in your search results.

Your Search Results

Search tools use algorithms to decide what shows up on your search page
and in what order.

       An algorithm is a set of rules a computer uses to do
       calculations and solve problems. At its most basic, an
       algorithm takes the form of "if X, then Y." Or, "if you receive X
       input, give Y output."
                      STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GOOGLE | 65

Google's algorithm uses many criteria to decide how high a result shows up
in your results list. These criteria include 1) information about the web
page and 2) information about YOU.

Web page information

Google's algorithm will prioritize sites that meet the following criteria
(among others):

 1. Other sites link to it. If many other sites link to this source, it is
      more likely to be useful and reliable (in theory).

 2. Older publication date. Well-established sites are prioritized over
      newer sites.

 3. Keyword frequency. The algorithm will prioritize web pages that
      include your keywords multiple times (vs. just once on the page).

 4. Keyword location. The algorithm will prioritize pages where your
      search terms are included in the title/headings vs. the body of the
      text, for example.

Google will also prioritize sponsored results, meaning that companies who
have paid Google a lot of money will have their sites promoted at the top of
the results list for any searches relevant to their content.

Information about YOU

Google tracks certain information about you, and that information can
influence your search results. (It's important to note that tracking is still
possible even if you're not signed in to a Google account.) This information
includes:

 1. Your geographic location. For example, a search for restaurants will
      return results that are close to you.

 2. Your search history. Your history includes past searches as well as
      the types of pages you click on. For example, a page you've clicked on
      multiple times in the past will show up at the top of the results list for
      any relevant searches.

 3. Your search settings. You can adjust the types of sites you get in
      your results by modifying your search settings.

And what else...?

It is important to know that Google's algorithm is proprietary. In other
words, their automated hierarchy of rules that generates your results list -
66 | STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GOOGLE

what you see and don't see about your topic - is not transparent, and
it changes over time. Are you comfortable relying on Google to show you
the information you need? Are you comfortable with all the data they track
about you?

Problems with Google

Bias

Google results depend on cues like keyword frequency, company
sponsorship, and other stand-in indicators for reliability, rather than
thoughtful, well-informed evaluation and curated resources. Sometimes
these indicators provide appropriate results...and sometimes not. Often,
material related to marginalized communities can be overlooked or
misrepresented.

   While watching, keep in mind:

 1. This video uses examples from over 10 years ago. Your Google results
      today won't look like how they're described in the video.
      Nevertheless, the processes that result in either accidental or
      intentional bias still impact search engine results today (as well as
      "information" you get from AI tools trained on web content).

 2. CONTENT WARNING: There is no graphic content in this
      video, but links to graphic content and a couple suggestive
      photographs are shown in screenshots as examples of sexism and
      racism in search results. Skip the video if this content is of concern
      for you.

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from
                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=212#oembed-1

Again, though the examples provided in the video are older, similar
examples with different topics and groups can still be found in Google
results today. If this topic interests you, we recommend Dr. Noble's 2018
book Algorithms of Oppression (available at UMSL online and in print).
         STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GOOGLE | 67

Privacy

By default, Google tracks your search history, the results you click on,
and even your behavior on other websites. This information, collected
and associated with your account and/or IP address, allows Google to
adjust your search results to better match your "profile" and target you
with personalized ads. These personalized ads will even show up on other
websites besides Google. One of Google's sources of income is AdSense,
which allows websites to host ad content powered by Google and
influenced by your online activity.

   Did you know you can turn off the "search personalization" setting?

Google & AI

Google's AI Overviews - concise, AI-generated responses to your search
query - launched in 2024. They provide an overview of your topic
generated from content within your search results, alongside links, images,
or other media. A major goal of these overviews is to consolidate and
organize helpful information without you having to explore multiple
sources, with a goal of saving you time and energy.

   As you might expect, there are some major and valid concerns about
Google AI. One criticism (which applies to all AI-generated content) is
that, rather than Google driving traffic to helpful sites and thus benefiting
the people who created them, AI trains on and repackages the content
other people put together to provide answers without users actually visiting
the original sites.

   A second major issue is accuracy. As we cover in more detail in Week
7, generative AI does not "know" the answer to your question. Instead,
it predicts language based on patterns in its training data that is mean
to look like an answer. As a result, this technology can offer incorrect
information or misrepresents content, even in sites it links to directly.

   Below, we highlight a humorous example, but the implications of people
relying on AI-generated content can be very serious. For now, we do not
recommend relying on information in AI overviews, even for personal
research. We have seen too many examples of false information. Clicking
actual links will at least give you the context for the information provided,
allowing you to evaluate whether you trust the creator.

   Note: This example seems to have been corrected since our screenshot
(taken Feb. 17, 2025). The original error was available for months. The AI
recommendation was generated from a webpage from ResFrac, a software
company that linked to an Onion article which used a photograph of one
of their employees. (For those who are unfamiliar, The Onion is a satirical
news site). Anyone reading either site would have likely had enough context
to know that no, geologists do not in fact recommend eating rocks
regularly.

Is Google Useful for Academic
Research?

Yes and no.

Scholarly Sources on Google

Google is a poor choice to search for academic sources (like scholarly books
or journal articles) for several reasons, including:

 1. Too broad in coverage. Google is built to scan as much of the web
      as it can. Therefore, your results may include some academic results,
      but they will also include many non-scholarly sources like news
      articles, blog posts, YouTube videos, Reddit threads, other websites,
      etc. Unlike the library website, Google is not set up to easily sift
      through these materials to locate actual scholarly sources.

 2. Paywalls. Even if you do find an academic source through Google, it
      will probably be locked behind a paywall (in other words, you need
      to pay to read it). Access to most scholarly research is extremely
      expensive. Your library/university pays for access to these kinds of
      sources, but only if you access them on campus, through a link on
      your library's website, or via your university's VPN. This way, the site
      hosting the resource knows you are affiliated with a specific school
      that has paid for access.

 3. Harder to evaluate results. Anyone can publish anything on the
      Internet. More importantly, anyone can design their website so that
      Google finds it easily (called SEO or search engine optimization).
      Well-designed websites, or sites that come up first in your Google
                      STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GOOGLE | 69

      results, might look appealing and be easy to access. However, it does
      not necessarily mean that these sources are appropriate for your
      research or even offer accurate information. By contrast, the library's
      search tools only include sources (both scholarly and non-scholarly)
      that have been evaluated for their relevance to academic research and
      the accuracy of their information.

       Search Tip: To find scholarly sources, it's best to avoid the
       general Google search.

Non-Scholarly Sources on Google

Google can be an excellent tool to find non-scholarly sources, including
news articles, government information, multimedia, and more. Whether
Google is the best place to find sources depends on the type of research
you're doing and the type of source you need.

   Some notes on different source types:

 1. News/Magazines
       1. Google can be a great place to find popular and easily accessible
            news and magazine articles. However, it's important to keep in
            mind:
             1. Paywalls. You still might not be able to access news/
                  magazines that require subscriptions. Good news
                  though: the library offers access to many major news
                  outlets! You can either a) use the main library search tool
                  to locate news articles, or b) search an individual news
                  outlet via your library access. You can read popular
                  national newspapers like the New York Times or local
                  papers like the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
             2. Reliability. Not all news outlets are equally reliable. A
                  Google search does not limit its results to well-respected
                  outlets, making it harder for the general public to decide
                  whether a given source is accurate, politically biased, etc.
                  We cover the basics of source evaluation online in Week 4.

 2. Government Information
       1. Google can be a helpful tool to search for government
            documents across many government websites (in addition to
            exploring specific sites - for example the Centers for Disease
70 | STUFF YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT GOOGLE

            Control and Prevention [CDC], National Park Service [NPS],
            or National Aeronatics and Space Administration [NASA]
            websites).

       Search tip: You can conduct your search across only
       government sites, rather than all of Google, by targeting the
       .gov extension that all government websites have in
       common. In the Google search bar, type your search, then
       type site:gov. Now, your results will only include hits from
       sites hosted by the US government.

"Free"* Alternatives to Google

*These tools make money from advertising revenue. These ads may or may
not rely on tracking your online activity.

 1. Bing: the major search engine competitor for Google. Bing offers its
      own independent indexing.

 2. DuckDuckGo: a web browser/search focused on privacy. They do
      not collect/save your search history, track you across different
      websites, or target you with personalized ads (ads are still present).
      They do not offer automated lists of search suggestions as you type.
      They also block 3rd party trackers. DuckDuckGo results rely on
      Bing rather than Google's index.

 3. Ecosia: an "eco-friendly" search engine. A significant portion of
      Ecosia's profits, which rely on ad revenue through Microsoft, are
      donated to plant trees around the world. Ecosia's search results also
      rely on Bing. Their financial reports (and donation amounts) are
      public on their website.

 4. Brave Search: another search engine focused on privacy. Like
      DuckDuckGo, Brave is also a web browser. Brave offers its own
      indexing rather than relying on Google/Bing, though you can
      simultaneously (and anonymously) search Google. Brave does not
      save IP addresses by default.

Key Takeaways

    · Google is not the best search tool for scholarly sources,
        but may be appropriate for sources like news or
        government information. Don't forget, you can also find
        many of these sources through your library.

    · Google tracks information about you to influence your
        search results.

    · We do not recommend relying on Google AI overviews.
    · Bias in search recommendations and results + privacy

        concerns are two major criticisms of Google.

SEARCHING THE LIBRARY

Introduction

The UMSL TJ library provides access to millions of resources, of all types
- journal articles, scholarly and popular books, government documents,
images, you name it. These resources come in different formats, "live" in
different places, and may use different names than you are used to. So, how
do you sift through this trove of stuff to find the specific stuff you actually
need?

   This chapter introduces you to some foundational search strategies that
will help you through your entire academic career, and probably in your
personal life as well. We cover these strategies because library search tools do
not work like Google. There are some similarities, but the library's search
tools search a different collection of materials and offer more sophisticated
options to find what you need.

   We cover two main topics:

  · How to search, including an introduction to keyword searching with
      Boolean operators

  · Using a general-purpose library discovery tool like Discover@UMSL

These skills will get you started and also transfer to searching databases,
which we cover in the next chapter.

Keywords & Boolean Operators

For an introduction to keywords and operators, please watch the video
below (run time 4:45):

                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:

        information/?p=214#oembed-1

To recap, here's some important vocabulary:

       Keywords represent the main concepts of your research
       topic. Searching for keywords in a library search tool looks for
       those words or phrases in the resource's title, author list,
       abstract, and other metadata (and sometimes, the full text).

       Boolean operators like AND and OR can narrow down or
       expand your search results. Adding keywords after AND
       gives you fewer results, while using OR gives you more.

Here's a more visual way to think about our operators:

   In addition to keywords and Boolean operators, we can also use
parentheses and quotation marks to create a more precise search.
74 | SEARCHING THE LIBRARY

  · Quotation marks allow us to search an exact phrase, e.g. "William
      Shakespeare" or "national debt." Without the quotation marks,
      the results list includes resources that use these words separately.

  · Parentheses tell the search which words go together in an OR list, e.g.
      (school OR education OR teaching).

IMPORTANT: There's no such thing as a perfect search. Test different
versions of your search using new keywords or combinations of terms to
see how they impact your results.

Examples of Well-Formatted Searches

Example A: How did the industrial revolution
impact American women?

Well-formatted searches:

  · "industrial revolution" AND "American women"
  · "industrial revolution" AND America AND (women OR girls)

Example B: Should using ChatGPT for writing
in college count as cheating?

Well-formatted searches:

  · "college writing" AND ChatGPT
  · AI AND cheating AND (college OR university)
  · (ChatGPT OR AI OR "artificial intelligence") AND (cheating OR

      plagiarism) AND writing

Discover@UMSL

Now that we know what to type, where should we begin searching?
   Most academic libraries offer a general-purpose discovery tool - an easy

search bar that lives on the library's home page that you can use as a starting
point for your research.

   At UMSL, this search tool is called Discover@UMSL. It allows you to
search print materials that UMSL owns plus digital resources like articles,
videos, images, etc. that we have access to through annual subscriptions.
                                                   SEARCHING THE LIBRARY | 75
   For an introduction to using the Discover@UMSL search, please watch
the video below (run time: 4:47):

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from
                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=214#oembed-2

   Another term for the Discover search is the discovery layer. Discovery
layers are common at many libraries. We use them because libraries have
many collections of information - our print books, our online journal/
database subscriptions, and more. A discovery layer allows you to search
many of these places at once, rather than searching each individual
collection.

     Activity: Test Searches

     Follow these steps:

         1. Scroll back up to the section labeled "Well-Formatted
             Searches." Choose either Example A or Example B.

        2. Copy and paste the search examples into the
             Discover@UMSL search tool and explore how the
             different keyword choices impact the results.

        3. Then, test out some of the limiters you learned from this
             video (e.g., publication date, peer review, source type).
             Skim the search results to explore how each limiter
             impacts the listed resources.
76 | SEARCHING THE LIBRARY

Important Things to Remember About
Discover@UMSL

As the video mentioned, Discover is a great starting point for your
research. It's important to know that there are some downsides:

 1. Discover searches many, but not all, of our databases. Therefore,
      you will not see every source you have access to as an UMSL student.

 2. Some databases "talk" to Discover better than others. Therefore,
      results from some library vendors (the companies that sell libraries
      things like books/journal access) will show up more easily in the
      results list than others. Some results may have odd or incorrect
      labeling (for example, a video listed as an eBook).

 3. Because it is built to search many information collections, with
      different source types and subject coverage, it offers very general
      search features. For advanced research options, try a database. We
      cover databases in the next chapter!

     Key Takeaways

         · Library search tools work differently than Google or other
             general-web search engines. Therefore, you have to be
             more thoughtful about how you type your search into the
             search bar.

         · Keywords represent the most important parts of your
             research question.

         · Connect your keywords with AND to narrow your search
             results. Use OR to expand your results.

         · Use the library's main search tool, Discover@UMSL, to
             search many of our print and online resources at the same
                                     SEARCHING THE LIBRARY | 77
time. It's a helpful starting point.

DATABASES

Introduction to Databases

A library database offers access to sources like journal articles, newspapers,
data/statistics, multimedia, and more. Importantly, they offer access
to resources that don't show up in the main Discover search as well
as advanced searching options.

   For an introduction to databases, please watch the video below (run time
4:59).

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from
                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=217#oembed-1

Let's recap some important vocabulary/points:

       A database is a digital, searchable collection of articles,
       primary sources, eBooks, and other information. They can be
       multidisciplinary or focus on a specific subject/source type.

Databases also offer advanced searching capabilities. As beginner
researchers, some options that you may find helpful are:

  · Unique search limiters. For example, if you are searching an
      education database, you may limit your results by school year/
                                                                    DATABASES | 79

   education level. In a business database, you may see a search bar that
   allows you to search by company name. A psychology database may
   allow you to search by research method or participant age group.
   There are also unique limiters for various source types - for example,
   a newspaper database that allows you to search by geographic
   location. Explore databases in your subject area to see what search
   options are common for researchers in your field.
· ILL integration. You may have noticed that some results tell you a
   resource's title, authors, subjects, publication date, abstract - but
   without giving you access to actually read the source. This is because
   some databases provide access to metadata - or, information about
   a source - without providing the source itself. Why? Not providing
   the full text is usually due to budget constraints. However,
   discovering that a source exists is still helpful for your research! Don't
   miss out on sources - click the "Request this item through
   Interlibrary Loan" button to auto-fill the request form.

  Activity: Exploring Databases

  Familiarize yourself with how to navigate the library's database
  options:

      1. Visit the library's A-Z Database List.
      2. Use the Subjects drop-down menu to see databases in

          your subject area/major.
      3. Click into at least 2 of the databases. Explore the unique

          search features available in that database and what types
          of resources are offered. How is the search function
          different than the main Discover@UMSL search?
80 | DATABASES

     Key Takeaways

         · Databases are digital, searchable collections of resources
             to support your research.

         · Databases offer more advanced search options than the
             main Discover@UMSL search, and they also provide
             access to resources that sometimes do not show up in the
             main results list.

         · You can search databases in your subject area for a more
             specific search.
              MOBIUS & ILL | 81

18.

MOBIUS & ILL

Introduction

As you search, you may come across materials that would be useful for your
research topic, but we don't own them here at UMSL. Either they are print
resources that are not in our collection, or they are digital resources that are
unavailable through any of our databases.

       Through a system called interlibrary loan (ILL), libraries
       work together so researchers can access materials beyond
       their home library.

In addition to regular interlibrary loan, many libraries participate in groups
called consortia. Your library's consortium is a network of libraries
(typically within the same state) that coordinate to make sharing materials
smoother.

   Whether your library charges for this service depends on their unique
policies and which groups they are members of. At UMSL, there is no
charge for borrowing from other libraries, since you already pay to attend
the university. The university allocates a budget to the library every year,
part of which supports our ILL staff (both full-time professional employees
and student workers), shipping costs, consortium membership dues,
software costs, and supplies.
82 | MOBIUS & ILL

MOBIUS

       MOBIUS is a consortium of academic, public, and research
       libraries, mostly in the state of Missouri, that work together
       to share print materials.

You can search the MOBIUS catalog online either for a specific book or for
a general topic. If you find a book you're interested in, sign in and indicate
that you want the book shipped to the UMSL TJ Library Public Service
Desk. When the book is ready for pickup, you'll receive a notification to
your UMSL email address.

   Did you know: Public libraries also participate in MOBIUS! That
means you can get books for casual reading as well as other public library
materials sent to UMSL via MOBIUS.

Interlibrary Loan

Use the regular interlibrary loan request form to ask for materials
unavailable in MOBIUS.

  · print materials from non-MOBIUS libraries
  · electronic resources unavailable at UMSL (mostly academic journal

      articles)
  · digital scans of book chapters (either from UMSL or non-UMSL

      books - usually limited to 1 to 2 chapters for copyright reasons)

Make sure to select the correct type of material at the top of the request
form. Articles usually come through as a scanned PDF, while print
materials will be shipped to the library. You'll receive an email notification
when the item is ready for viewing or pickup.

Auto-Filling the Request Form

Sometimes, you'll come across a link in a library record that says "Request
                                                                    MOBIUS & ILL | 83
Item." Usually, that means we have access to the item's metadata (name,
authors, date, etc.), but not the full text. Clicking the "Request Item" will
usually auto-fill most of the ILL form for you. Simply add in your student
status and department, then click "Submit."

Things to Know About ILL

  · Not all materials can be loaned or digitized. There are limitations on
      unique or older print materials, digital materials that have access
      restrictions, popular items that need to remain available to the
      original library's patrons, and more.

  · Timelines to receive ILL materials can vary. Print materials will
      typically take longer to arrive than digital scans because of the
      amount of time it takes them to go through the mail system.

       Search tip: Search for non-UMSL materials early in your
       research process. Make requests in enough time for those
       items to arrive before your assignment due date.

     Key Takeaways

         · ILL is an important library service that helps researchers
             access materials outside their home libraries. Though it
             may not require payment from patrons, it still relies on
             funding through the university or other sources for staff,
84 | MOBIUS & ILL

             supplies, dues, and more.
         · MOBIUS is a Missouri consortium of academic, public, and

             research libraries that lend materials to each other.
         · Regular ILL is useful for requesting journal articles, non-

             MOBIUS print materials, and digital scans of 1-2 book
             chapters.

19.

GOOGLE SCHOLAR

Introduction

       Google Scholar is a search engine, free to the public and
       run by Google, that exclusively searches scholarly work on
       the web.

Search results include typical scholarly sources like journal articles and
books, but also student works (like theses/dissertations) and other
resources. If you are searching for scholarly sources (vs. news, gov info, or
other sources), Google Scholar is much more useful than regular Google.

Google Scholar vs. the Library

There are some benefits to adding Google Scholar to the list of search
options for your research project. These include:
86 | GOOGLE SCHOLAR

 1. You may find links to sources that are unavailable through the library
      or don't come up in the library search (especially if they are open
      access).

 2. The Google Scholar search is sometimes easier to navigate using
      natural language (vs. a formal search structured with keywords and
      Boolean operators)

 3. You can connect Google Scholar to your institutional library access,
      letting you read materials behind a paywall if your school subscribes
      to it.
       1. In Google Scholar, visit Settings.
       2. Click "Library Links" (on the left side)
       3. Search for "University of Missouri - St. Louis"
       4. Check the box next to UMSL

However, there are some major drawbacks/considerations:

 1. No print access. Many disciplines rely heavily on print resources.
      You will need your library to find and access these materials.

 2. Possibly no digital access. Many Google Scholar search results offer
      an access link to the right of the screen. Some of these materials are
      available free online, while others have been uploaded (by the authors
      or otherwise) in a pre-published version (aka, a preprint) or on a
      hosting platform other than the original publisher's. Some of these
      uploads are technically breaking copyright. If there is no access link,
      you'll need to go through your library to access the resource. (Good
      news: You can link Google Scholar to your home library to make
      searching easier! See instructions below.)

 3. Includes student works. Student publications like theses and
      dissertations can be fascinating to read and offer niche bibliographies
      to explore for your own research. However, because they are not
      published through traditional avenues and are written by students,
      they are often not appropriate to cite in your research assignments.
      If you are new to scholarly research, it can also sometimes be difficult
      to tell the difference between these materials and regular scholarly
      publications. Check with your professor or a librarian if you're not
      sure if a specific source is appropriate for your assignment.

 4. Lack of search limiters/subject searching. Google Scholar allows
      you to limit your results by publication date, but does not offer other
      limiters that would be helpful to new researchers, like the ability to
      search by a source type (articles, books, etc.) or whether a source is
      peer-reviewed. You also cannot limit your search to a specific subject
      (e.g., psychology, business, art).

We recommend starting your search at the library. However, especially
for advanced researchers, Google Scholar can be helpful to be aware of as a
supplementary tool.
               GOOGLE SCHOLAR | 87

Key Takeaways

· Google Scholar is a free-to-the-public search tool, run by
   Google, that searches scholarly sources on the open web.

· Benefits of using Google Scholar include a slightly
   friendlier search bar and the ability to link it to your
   institution.

· Major drawbacks of Google Scholar include a lack of
   important source types in the results (e.g., print materials),
   a lack of sophisticated search limiters (e.g., source type or
   peer review), and the inclusion of source types that might
   not be appropriate to cite in an undergraduate research
   project.

CREATING CITATIONS

Introduction to Citations

As we've already established, citations are a crucial part of participating
in the scholarly conversation. By now, you've seen multiple examples of
citations for various types of sources as part of the reading for this class
(books, journal articles, videos, etc.).

   If you do not cite your sources properly, it can appear as though you
are claiming someone else's work is your own. This is called plagiarism,
an extremely serious academic infraction. Therefore, we ask you to give
your full attention to creating your citations, both for this class and others.
Giving your best attempt at a well-formatted citation is preferred to
not attempting the citation at all.

   For our students who are experienced with creating citations, we hope
this chapter will be a helpful refresher for you. For those of you who are
brand new to citations, please give careful attention and reach out to your
librarians for assistance if needed. We know citations can be tricky, and we
want to help you.

   For a overview of why we cite and how to format citations, please watch
the video below (run time 4:44):

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from
                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=647#oembed-1

Citation Tips

  · Recommended steps for manually creating citations:
         1) Identify the type of source you are citing.
         2) Identify the citation style required for your assignment.
                                                        CREATING CITATIONS | 89

         3) Search the citation style guidance for instructions on creating
            a citation for your source type (e.g., journal article or newspaper
            article).

         4) Follow the provided template and plug in each piece of
            information in the correct spot.

         5) Make sure to format each part of the citation exactly how
            you see it in the template. For example, if the journal name is
            italicized in the template, it should be italicized in your citation
            too. If there are parentheses around the date in the template,
            include the parentheses in your citation.

  · It is okay to use citation generators through the library or online
      (e.g., EasyBib) if you double check the result against the official
      style instructions. Citation generators can often make small
      mistakes.

  · When in doubt, reach out to the library in person or online.

Citations For This Class

We recommend using APA style for this class. You can find the full APA
style guide at the library front desk. Or, you can use shorter guidance you
can find for free online. We recommend the Purdue OWL website.

ABOUT WEEK 4

Week 4: Source Evaluation

In Weeks 1-3, we covered library basics, what types of sources you might
use for academic research, and how to search for them using library search
tools. Now, it's time to decide what to do with all those sources you found!

   Source evaluation is an important step in the research process. It's
when you decide whether a source is relevant, trustworthy, and rigorous
enough for your unique research need. This week offers some important
considerations, a step-by-step method for navigating the complicated
digital world, and basic markers of credibility and rigor in scholarly
research.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this week, students will be able to...

         1. Identify different sources of expertise (academic,
             professional, lived experience) and understand their value
             to scholarly research.

        2. Apply the SIFT method to quickly evaluate a digital
             source's credibility.

        3. Choose appropriate scholarly sources using basic markers
             of credibility and relevancy (e.g., publication date, peer
             review).

EXPERTISE

Introduction

For beginner research assignments, you will mostly be searching for
information other people have created or collected, rather than generating
your own data. There are many factors to consider when deciding whether
a source is trustworthy and relevant. One of these factors is expertise - the
knowledge or skill the author(s) specialize in and how they developed that
skill. In other words, does this author know what they're talking about?
How do you know?

   Deciding whether an author has relevant expertise helps you answer the
question: Is this the best source I could use for this information, or should
I look elsewhere?

   This chapter briefly covers three dimensions of expertise you could
consider when gathering sources. We cover these categories to help you
understand what "counts" as expertise more broadly than just "they have a
Ph.D." - although that is certainly a good starting point.

   For this discussion, let's pretend you are researching college students
with physical disabilities. Which people or organizations have expertise on
this topic?

Academic Expertise

As we've mentioned before, college-level research assignments (and
beyond) usually require scholarly sources. Scholarly sources are written by
and for people with academic expertise

       People with academic expertise typically have advanced
       degrees in their field, giving them in-depth knowledge of a
96 | EXPERTISE

       specialized topic and training on appropriate research
       methods. They often work at a university or another research
       center, conduct research in their field, and publish their
       findings so other scholars can read them.

Many topics are interdisciplinary, which means you may find scholars in
a variety of fields publishing on that topic from different viewpoints. For
example, specialists in education, architecture, health, or technology (and
more) may publish relevant research on the topic of college students with
disabilities.

     Activity

     First, skim the article below. Then, Google the authors. Note
     their degrees and previous publication record. These authors are
     examples of scholars with academic expertise.

                        EXPERTISE | 97

Professional Expertise

Your research may also benefit from people or organizations who do work
on your topic. Longtime professionals and respected organizations often
have in-depth knowledge of the day-to-day realities of doing work in a given
field, may have produced/collected data, reports, and other publications,
and may have helpful connections or additional resource
recommendations.

   For our research on college students with disabilities, entities
with professional expertise could include:

  · professionals who work in a university disability office (along with
      any web pages, publications, videos, etc. they produce)
         this category may include admin, but also specially trained aides
            like interpreters

  · organizations such as:
         National Center for Collect Students With Disabilities
         Association on Higher Education and Disabilities
         Other organizations which focus on a specific condition or
            group of people

Keep in mind there may be overlap between professional and academic
expertise. Academics with degrees and research experience in a given
subject, for example, may also be involved in a reputable organization and
contribute to their data collection, publications, outreach efforts, and
more.

Lived Experience

Finally, people with lived experience related to a topic can provide
invaluable perspectives. Their input can be particularly crucial for topics
that aren't well represented in academic research, either because they are
new areas of interest, they are related to very recent events, or they relate to
underrepresented groups.

   You can get information on a topic from a person with firsthand
experience in a variety of ways. If the person is living and willing, you
could directly interview them, or analyze any other words, images, etc.
they produce. Examples could be a book they've written, interviews they've
given to someone else, photographs or videos they've either taken or been
featured in, etc. If the person or event you're researching is historical, old
photographs, newspapers, and even objects can serve as useful primary
sources.
98 | EXPERTISE

Bringing It Together

Different research topics will benefit from different types of sources. While
most college research assignments should use scholarly sources, many may
also incorporate other sources of data and information, including from
firsthand perspectives.

       Search tip: When considering the best sources for your
       project, consider whether each creator has relevant expertise,
       and if so, how that expertise adds to your topic.

     Key Takeaways

         · Depending on your topic, your research may benefit from
             a variety of sources of expertise, including academic
             expertise, professional expertise, and lived experience.

         · Considering an author's expertise will help you identify
             trustworthy and relevant sources. If a source's author or
             creator does not have any form of expertise relevant to
             your topic, look for a different source.
     THE SIFT METHOD: EVALUATING WEB SOURCES | 99

THE SIFT METHOD:
EVALUATING WEB SOURCES

Introduction

In both your research assignments and personal life, you need to locate
information online. Unlike library resources, web-based content (e.g., web
pages, YouTube videos, social media posts) is usually not vetted by scholars
or other professionals with relevant expertise. High-quality, relevant
information can feel difficult to find amidst confusing, misleading, or even
malicious content.

   Increasingly, poor-quality and incorrect information is available in
formats that look appealing. They've been recently updated, they have
professional-seeming graphics, websites, or videos, and they use language
that mimics reputable organizations or people. As we mentioned in this
week's intro, older markers of reliable content (recency, .org or .gov
domains, a lack of spelling or grammar errors) are not exclusive to well-
researched material. This content shift means that you cannot just look
at a domain name or how professional/up-to-date a website looks to
determine whether it's accurate.

       Search tip: Do NOT rely on the following criteria to decide
       whether a source is appropriate for research:

            · Flashy and/or professional images, graphics, or video
                quality

            · The domain name (e.g., .org)
            · The About page from the organization's own website

                (helpful to read, but sometimes provides misleading
100 | THE SIFT METHOD: EVALUATING WEB SOURCES

                information or obscures an organization's real purpose,
                especially regarding controversial topics)
            · Well-written text without spelling/grammar errors

Not relying on easy visual cues can make vetting online information seem
overwhelming. However, you can't just skip using digital resources either.
The Internet is still an important gateway to all kinds of information,
including complex and/or controversial topics. How can you be sure you're
getting information or advice from a reputable source?

The SIFT Method

For evaluating digital content, we recommend the SIFT method.
Developed by researcher Mike Caulfield, the SIFT method allows you
to quickly and reliably evaluate information online by relying on the
defining feature of the Internet - its easy interconnectedness to other
sources.

   The steps of the SIFT method are:

 1. Stop.
 2. Investigate the source.
 3. Find better coverage.
 4. Trace claims back to the original source.

Watch each of the four videos below for an introduction to the SIFT
method. These videos are short, straightforward, and practical. In
other words, for a short time investment, you can gain essential skills for
navigating the modern world.

        information/?p=315#oembed-2

       Leaving a source to investigate its reputation from other
       sources/sites is called lateral reading. This is different
       from vertical reading, which involves evaluating
       information or cues from the source itself.

STEP 3: FIND BETTER COVERAGE

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from
                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=315#oembed-4
                 THE SIFT METHOD: EVALUATING WEB SOURCES | 103

       Search tip: In addition to finding coverage from reputable
       news outlets, try a fact-checking website like Snopes.

STEP 4: TRACE CLAIMS BACK TO THE
ORIGINAL SOURCE

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from
                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=315#oembed-3

To recap, the goal of the SIFT method is to use the structure of the Internet
to our advantage. We leave the original source to explore the creator's
reputation (lateral reading), see if other reputable sources are covering
that topic the same way, and identify the actual originator of the
information. For a more detailed, but still accessible, discussion of these
strategies, we recommend Verified: How To Think Straight, Get Duped Less,
and Make Better Decisions About What To Believe Online (2023) by Mike
Caulfied and Sam Wineburg (Find at UMSL).

     Key Takeaways
104 | THE SIFT METHOD: EVALUATING WEB SOURCES

         · Because both reliable and unreliable (and sometimes,
             malicious) sources can have professional websites/videos/
             graphics, "reputable" domains such as .org, and well-
             edited recent content, you cannot rely on these cues
             alone to determine whether a source is reliable.

         · The SIFT method relies on using the interconnected web
             to leave the original source to:

                   explore a person or organization's reputation
                      from other sources

                   see whether other well-known sources are covering
                      a topic in the same way (or at all)

                   trace a quote, claim, etc. back to the person who
                      originally said it

EVALUATING SCHOLARLY
SOURCES: THE BASICS

Introduction

Just like popular sources you can find on the Internet, scholarly sources
can vary in their purpose, quality, and relevancy to your work. Evaluating
scholarly work can seem daunting as a beginning researcher, but there are
several criteria you can use to get started. In this chapter, we cover some
evaluation basics that you can use alongside your assignment instructions
to get started with choosing appropriate scholarly sources.

   Good news: you've encountered some of these topics already!
   Note: The evaluation criteria below are not listed in any particular
order. They may be more or less applicable to different assignments or fields
of study.

But First: Is It Scholarly?

In Week 2, we covered how to identify several source types, including
scholarly and popular sources. In Week 3, we covered how to search for
these sources in a library search tool. Remember that by default, your
search results may include both scholarly and non-scholarly sources.

       Reminder: Scholarly sources are written by academic
       experts for an audience of other researchers. Checking
       whether your source meets both these criteria is part of the
       evaluation process.
106 | EVALUATING SCHOLARLY SOURCES: THE BASICS
Most college-level research assignments benefit from (or require) scholarly
sources. Before evaluating a scholarly source, make sure it is in fact scholarly
(and meets any other criteria from your assignment instructions) using the
guidelines we provided in Week 2. When in doubt, ask the library! (Or,
your professor.)

Topic (AKA, Is It Relevant?)

This category may seem self-explanatory - of course your source should be
on the same topic as your research question! However, deciding whether an
article or book covers a topic relevant to your research can be tricky.

Common issues for beginner
researchers

Looking for Exact Vocabulary

It's easy to get stuck looking for articles or books that use the exact same
words as your research question. However, like we talked about in Week 3,
including alternative terms in your search can help you find sources that
are useful even though they use different terms or even cover a different, but
related, topic. (For example, research about young adults may be relevant
to a research question about college students, even if the article doesn't
mention the words "college" or "university.")

       Search Strategy: If you are struggling to find sources on
       your topic, don't limit your search to the exact words from
       your research question. Looking for synonyms or similar
       concepts can help you find additional relevant sources.

Only Looking at the Title

For some sources, it may be obvious from the title that it is unrelated to
                EVALUATING SCHOLARLY SOURCES: THE BASICS | 107
your research topic. For others, it may be unclear. It's also important to
note that part of an article or book may be relevant to your topic,
even if the entire work isn't - these sources can still be helpful for your
research! If you're not sure of the exact coverage of an article or book, use
the following strategies:

For Articles

       Search Strategy: Read the abstract. This short overview of
       the article's purpose, methods, and main takeaways can give
       you more information on its subject matter and scope than
       just the title.

For Books

       Search Strategy: Read the book summary and the Table of
       Contents. This information can help you determine the scope
       of the book and also whether a specific chapter is relevant to
       your needs.

Peer Review

We covered peer review briefly in Week 3. For a refresher, re-watch our peer
review tutorial video.

   Not all scholarly research is peer reviewed. A lack of peer review can
happen for several reasons, and it doesn't always mean the work is of lesser
quality. Some sources that are published in academic journals - for
example, book reviews - don't go through the peer review process, because
they don't reflect original research and serve a different purpose in the
108 | EVALUATING SCHOLARLY SOURCES: THE BASICS

world of scholarly communication. Some books also do not go through a
peer review process.

   Unfortunately, it is also true that the scholarly landscape includes low-
quality or predatory journals which do not facilitate peer review (or the
review process is perfunctory).

   In general, peer-reviewed research is considered higher quality than non-
peer-reviewed work. Two ways you can determine whether a source is peer-
reviewed are:

 1. Look in the library record for the article. Often, the record will say
      whether the source is peer reviewed.

 2. Search for the journal website. The journal usually indicates its peer
      review status or process in the about page, an editorial page, or
      another notable place on the website.

       Search Strategy: Use the "peer review" limiter in your
       library search tool/database to search only peer-reviewed
       works.

Publication Date

How recently a source was published can be a significant factor in whether
it is appropriate for your research. Whether you need an up-to-date source
can vary significantly depending on your field of study as well as your
specific topic.

Publication date by discipline

Humanities (e.g., art, literature, philosophy)

Older sources are typically more useful and common in the humanities
compared to other disciplines. For example, a philosophy paper may
reference a text from Ancient Greece alongside a scholarly article written in
the early 1900s. Both of these works may provide a valuable perspective on
philosophical issues still being debated in the modern day.
                EVALUATING SCHOLARLY SOURCES: THE BASICS | 109
   Remember that perspectives change over time. For many humanities
research topics, you may still want some or exclusively newer sources. For
example, if you are looking for an explicitly feminist critique of a work of
literature, you may want to include more modern articles or books. Even
the priorities of a feminist analysis may have changed from, for instance, the
1980s to the current decade.

Social Sciences (e.g., psychology, political
science)

Social science research can advance quickly, but not quite as quickly as
some science and technology fields. Assignment instructions in the social
sciences commonly say to use research published within the past 5-10 years.

Science & Technology (e.g., biology, computer
science)

These fields can advance more rapidly than other disciplines. More recent
publications are usually better, if you can find them. Some assignments
may accept research in the last 5-10 years, while others may need research
from the last 1-3.

Not sure where to start?

When in doubt, check with your professor or your assignment
instructions.

       Search Strategy: Use the publication date limiter in your
       library search tool/database.

Discipline Criteria

If you pursue advanced research in your field, you'll learn unique criteria
110 | EVALUATING SCHOLARLY SOURCES: THE BASICS

that will help you evaluate scholarly articles, books, and other materials in
an in-depth way. For beginners, we won't spend much time on this topic.
However, we offer the following examples as an introduction of the type of
evaluation you might do in scholarly research down the road.

Examples of Advanced Evaluation
Criteria

Methodology

Advanced undergraduate or graduate research assignments may ask you to
look for studies that follow a specific research or analysis method. Some
examples of research method vocabulary are:

  · qualitative or quantitative
  · case study
  · textual analysis/close reading
  · ethnography
  · longitudinal study

...and so on. Different methods are more or less appropriate for different
disciplines and different research purposes. If you pursue advanced study/
research in your field, you'll likely take research methods courses or
otherwise receive training in what methods are common in your field and
how to evaluate a given work's methodology.

   As a beginner researcher, it is just important to be aware that you may
encounter different approaches in your field of study.

Journal Audience & Reputation

Different academic journals, even in the same field of study, have different
audiences, goals, standards, content, etc. As a result, journals vary in their
prestige and relevancy to your own research. Publishing articles in a highly-
ranked journal can be very competitive.

   As a beginner, it is impossible to tell the reputation of a journal just from
the title. While there are metrics (the Journal Impact Factor or JIF) that
advanced researchers can use to evaluate how "good" a journal is, the best
way to gain familiarity is just time spent studying the field and input from
experienced researchers.

   It is worth noting that academic publishing has a complicated history,
and it is very much a for-profit operation. Just like with people, relying
only on a journal's "stats" can obscure other considerations of what counts
                 EVALUATING SCHOLARLY SOURCES: THE BASICS | 111
as "good" scholarly work and prioritize perspectives that are already
established in academia.

   We don't recommend worrying about a journal's "prestige" for most
undergraduate research purposes. But, if you decide to pursue graduate
study, and especially if you ever want to publish your own research, this
information is worth considering. We'll touch on this topic again when we
discuss the landscape of academic publishing in Week 6a.

     Key Takeaways

         · Basic evaluation criteria for scholarly sources include peer
             review and publication date.

         · Appropriate publication dates to include in your research
             varies by discipline. Humanities research often includes
             older sources, sciences research frequently limits to very
             recent sources, and social sciences research is usually in
             the middle (~5-10 years).

         · More advanced evaluation criteria include research
             methodology and journal reputation.

         · Reading the article abstract, book summary, or Table of
             Contents are good strategies to decide whether all or part
             of a source has relevant information.
112 | IS NEUTRALITY A MYTH?

25.

IS NEUTRALITY A MYTH?

Introduction

Neutral, impartial, objective, unbiased. These are all adjectives that many
people use to describe the ideal information resource and the ideal library.
It is common to argue that librarians, journalists, researchers, etc. should
not be biased in favor of a political opinion, a moral stance, a group of
people (categorized by socioeconomic class, ability, race, and so on), or
any number of other considerations. Information should be fact-based,
without an agenda.

   In theory, neutrality seems like a good goal. Whether we are conducting
academic research, keeping up with current events, or making personal
medical decisions, we want unbiased sources that offer real evidence
without prioritizing anyone's preexisting opinions. We want "the truth."

   The reality of our information landscape is that some sources are better
than others for most purposes. These sources offer evidence-based advice,
real-world data, rigorously fact-checked news, and other helpful
information from experts who know what they're doing. This week, we've
discussed basic strategies to help you decide whether a specific article,
website, video, etc. is one of these high-quality sources.

However...

It is also true that when people say neutral, what they often mean is how
we already do things or what we already "know." Neutral information
can often mean information produced by, and for, people in positions of
privilege in academia or the world at large, whether that is due to wealth,
ability, race, gender/sexuality, nationality, etc. or a combination of factors.

   This statement may seem extreme. Academic research often relies on
hard data - surely numbers are as neutral as it gets? Surely scholars, who
follow rigorous methods and mean well, would produce reliable, unbiased
research that applies to everyone?

   An in-depth exploration of "neutrality," privilege, and bias in the worlds
of libraries, news, research, etc. would be deeply complex and beyond the
scope of this course. Our goal below is to peek behind the curtain of
so-called neutral information - not to argue that well-done research or
                                                   IS NEUTRALITY A MYTH? | 113

other sources are not useful, but instead to advocate for a more inclusive
approach to which perspectives "count."

The Single Story

The talk below, from Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie,
introduces the "danger of a single story." While she does not reference
academic research, the main points are still relevant: that it can be difficult
to identify when our own perspectives are limited, that globally prominent
perspectives (i.e., Western) might not be universal, and that lifting unheard
voices makes this world a richer, kinder place (run time: 19:17).

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from

The Single Story in Academic
Research

As we mentioned above, critiquing the idea of "neutrality" in academic
research is a complex endeavor. For beginner researchers, let's start by
examining what the "single story" can look like in research data and
analysis.

   Either conscious or unconscious bias can influence:

  · who is able to do research
  · what research topics get funded
  · what types of people/groups are "worth" studying

Many times, the complicated nature of scholarship can produce results
that appear "neutral" or "universal" to the untrained eye, but have a more
limited scope upon closer inspection.

   This concept can be examined in different ways depending on your field
of study. For now, let's look at an example of (often unintended) bias
in psychological research. Watch the video below for an introduction to
114 | IS NEUTRALITY A MYTH?
WEIRD research and its implications for generalizing study results (run
time: 4:36):

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from

                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=321#oembed-2

Pointing out a lack of inclusivity in research participants is NOT to suggest
that research on young, white, male, American college students isn't worth
doing, or that those results aren't important. We simply mean that research
on other groups is also important, because the results of studies on white,
healthy men don't always apply to everyone else. And, this oversight can
have real consequences - in fields like medicine, for example, where a
historical lack of women in clinical trials has resulted in issues like improper
medication dosages or a lack of awareness of different disease/condition
symptoms.

       Search Strategy: Be inclusive in your research. Intentionally
       consider which perspectives your own research, and the
       research you're citing, may be missing. Your projects, not to
       mention your outlook on the world, may benefit from
       additional points of view.

     Key Takeaways
                                         IS NEUTRALITY A MYTH? | 115

· It is difficult to describe academic research as truly neutral.
   Individual perspectives or bias as well as larger cultural
   and economic systems can influence which research topics
   get funded, who is able to achieve advanced degrees and
   pursue research, and who is included as study
   participants.

· Actively consider inclusivity in your own research.
   Consider whether your topic could benefit from additional
   perspectives, and be aware of potential limitations in the
   studies you cite.

ABOUT WEEK 5

Week 5 Overview

In Week 5, we introduce important developments in the history of
information organization and retrieval. We cover this history to help you
understand how and why information is organized the way it is today and
how that organization influences a researcher's relationship to
information. Finally, we provide a brief overview of how data relates to
information, knowledge, and wisdom.
Note: This week is something of a catch-all in terms of content. Don't
forget that you can always refer back to each page later rather than
worrying about memorizing a bunch of new vocabulary and concepts.
Our goal is to just introduce some broad themes to provide context for
your research.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this week, you will be able to:

         1. Identify historic and recent milestones in the development
             of information technology.

        2. Identify the different parts of a URL.
        3. Describe the physical foundation for the Internet/the

             digital information landscape.
        4. Perform a reverse citation search using Google Scholar.
        5. Consider how different information formats, such as print,
120 | ABOUT WEEK 5

             microfilm, and digital formats, impact preservation, access,

INFORMATION BEFORE THE
INTERNET

Introduction

In this chapter, we discuss (very briefly) some major developments in
information technology - the formats in which words, images, sound, etc.
were preserved and transmitted before the advent of the Internet. In Part
One, we touch on some foundational historical milestones; in Part Two, we
focus in greater detail on the technologies of the near past (specifically, the
19th and 20th centuries).

   How will knowing this information make you a better researcher?
   Each new development builds on the expectations and conventions of
the technology that preceded it. With a basic understanding of how one
advancement led to the next, you'll be better equipped to understand
research vocabulary, apply advanced search strategies, and consider the
value of source formats beyond just articles and books.

Part One: A Few Important
Developments

Oral Traditions

Humans have been communicating and preserving information across
generations orally for thousands of years. Language and storytelling are
ancient and culturally universal human traits.

   Like the written word, spoken language can also be conveyed and
preserved in different formats - not just regular speech, but also chanting,
spoken poetry, ballads, and more. The combination of diction with
122 | INFORMATION BEFORE THE INTERNET

rhythm, rhyme, music, or physical movements can not only create beautiful
and engaging works of art, but also aid in memory.

   Many modern-day traditions and stories trace their roots to information
transmitted orally for generations before eventually being written down.
These include religious texts (e.g., the Old Testament) and ancient epics,
like the Iliad.

   Oral traditions are still an important art form and cultural
preservation mechanism today. Genealogy, folklore, songs, and more are
still transmitted orally, but they are also recorded in the form of audio or
video in various mediums.

Writing

The independent invention of writing systems in several locations/cultures
(Mesoamerica, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China) represents a dramatic
change in our abilities to communicate and preserve information. A
(relatively) stable, visual representation of spoken language meant that
information could:

  · be communicated consistently across farther distances
  · include more information than a single person could reliably

      memorize
  · be more easily preserved and standardized over long periods of time

How effectively early writing samples were preserved is dependent on a
variety of historical and environmental conditions, one of which is the
physical medium on which they were inscribed. Today, our primary (non-
virtual) medium for the written word is paper, first invented in China
around the 2nd century CE.

   Other materials include:

  · clay tablets or pottery
  · papyrus
  · stone tablets or monuments
  · parchment
  · fabric
  · wood

need for libraries, in two parts: (a)
physical spaces to store and
                               INFORMATION BEFORE THE INTERNET | 123

organize tablets, scrolls, etc. and (b) staff to do the collecting, organizing,
and retrieval of those items.

   The very first (known) library was that of Ashurbanipal, an Assyrian
king in the 7th century BCE. This royal library held clay tablets on all kinds
of topics, gained through both the copying work of his own scribes and
military conquest. The famed Epic of Gilgamesh is the most well-known
surviving work from this library.

   Since then, libraries have played a crucial role in supporting research and
preserving history. Historically, many libraries were funded and managed
by governments, religious institutions, or wealthy private individuals. The
first truly public library, funded by taxpayers rather than individual
subscriptions or other sources, opened in America in the 20th century.

The Printing Press

Johannes Gutenberg (of Germany) invented the printing press in the 15th
century, which again revolutionized the information landscape. Books not
only became more affordable, but were more easily standardized. The result
was an explosion of increasing literacy rates and the more rapid spread of
new ideas across the European continent and beyond, impacting culture,
education, scientific advancement, and more.

   Notably, the printing press resulted in what we now call "mass
communication." Communication to enormous audiences was no longer
limited to those with traditional wealth or authority, such as political or
religious leaders, ushering the new "middle class" to a more prominent role
in information consumption and dissemination.

Part Two: 19th and 20th Century
American Libraries

Now, we take a big time jump to America. We're focusing on this time
period and cultural context to cover some important technological
foundations in how libraries and research were organized. Although you
may not use these technologies, the precedent they set has influenced how
information is organized in the digital world, and knowing this vocabulary
will help you navigate research online.
124 | INFORMATION BEFORE THE INTERNET

Card Catalogs

       A library catalog is an organized record of all bibliographic
       items found in a library's collection.

Prior to the mid-1700s, these records were kept in lists (e.g., on tablets,
scrolls, paper, etc.) or handwritten/printed ledgers. As the sheer amount of
items in most libraries escalated, these ledgers were replaced with slips or
individual cards to represent each item.

   In fact, card catalogs use multiple cards for the same item. This system
allows users to browse the card collection organized in different ways: by
titles, by authors, or by subjects.

   Card catalogs become popular in libraries by the mid-1800s. There were
multiple advantages to the card system, the main being:

  · Flexibility: Using individual cards for each item made items easier to
      add, edit, or remove.

  · Easier discovery: Library patrons could browse for books by author,
      title, or the subjects covered in the material.

Although many modern-day libraries have moved to digital catalogs, some
others do still have functional card catalogs to support research, especially
to locate older materials. Here's a short video highlighting the current
status of the card catalog at the Library of Congress, the world's largest
library (run time: 2:20):

MARC and OPACs

Henriette Avram, a computer scientist, created the MARC standard in the
1960s.

       MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging) is a standardized
       rule set for how to format the descriptions of library items so
       they can be read and shared by computers.

MARC has become the international standard for formatting and sharing
bibliographic data, although there are several versions of it.

   When you look at a MARC record, you'll see numerical fields that each
correspond to the type of information you're supposed to enter into that
field. For example, the main author goes in field 100. In field 260, you put
the publisher.

   MARC allowed for the computerization of the card catalog system and
the development of online public access catalogs (OPACs), which
allowed patrons to search for materials on a computer rather than printed
cards. Dynix is an example of a popular, early-days digital and searchable
catalog.

Indexing

The continued rapid uptick in library content, especially in academic
journals, increased the need for formal indexes.

       An index is a list of names, subjects, and other notable
       content discussed in a larger work alongside the specific
       location those entries can be found (e.g., page numbers).
       Indexes which cover multiple works (e.g., many journals in a
       given field) often used standard vocabulary to refer to the
       same concepts, even if unique language is used in those
       journals or articles.

The purpose of many 20th-century print indexes was to help researchers
                               INFORMATION BEFORE THE INTERNET | 127

locate articles on specific topics or from specific authors in their field,
even if they were published in different journals or different issues of the
same journal. They could go to the print index, search for their topic (or
authors' names, or another criterion), and find the specific location of
relevant articles.

   These indexes were the precursor to modern-day databases. Like we
learned in Week 3, databases allow you to search millions of journal articles
by typing in a subject, title, author, etc. without needing to search through
individual journals in your field, which could cover a variety of topics in
each issue.

Technology Preservation

When discussing preservation, it's common to think of older historical
materials, often paper-based. Modern technology (specifically, the Internet)
is touted as the obvious way to digitize and preserve these documents.

   However, there are two considerations that impact this transition:

 1. Digital access is not foolproof. It is less accessible for people who
      struggle with or can't afford technology, it often relies on 3rd-party
      platforms that may decide to stop hosting that material, and it can be
      extremely expensive for libraries to either purchase digital materials
      or digitize materials themselves.

 2. Technology is not just a tool for preservation. As we continue to
      make scientific advancements, we must consider preservation of
      technology.

Throughout the 19th and 20th century, rapid technological developments
meant that information was created and stored on a variety of non-paper
and non-digital formats. Some of these mediums include floppy discs,
cassettes, CDs, and VHS. Not everything can or should be converted to
a digital format, and deciding the best way to store and prevent the
degradation of these materials is an ongoing discussion.

Microfilm

Microfilm is an excellent example of an older technology that is still a
preferred and frequently-used tool for accessing historical materials even in
the digital age. It preserves documents in a compact and stable format.
128 | INFORMATION BEFORE THE INTERNET

       Microfilm comes in plastic reels of very small-scale
       photographs, typically of extensive and hard-to-preserve
       documents like old newspapers or government documents. A
       researcher can feed the reel through a reader, which
       increases the size of the image on a screen for easy viewing.

     Key Takeaways
                     INFORMATION BEFORE THE INTERNET | 129

· The modern-day research landscape is dependent on (a)
   major developments in how humans communicate, and
   (b) specific, pre-Internet technologies that influence
   today's digital research organization.

· We cannot take the importance of writing, print, or
   libraries for granted, no matter how ubiquitous or
   inevitable they seem today. Nor can we discount the
   influence that oral traditions still have on preservation and
   the transmission of knowledge.

· Card catalogs, the MARC standard, and indexes are all
   examples of technology from the recent past that, even
   though we don't often interact with them physically
   today, are important to be aware of to understand the
   back end of how digital research systems are organized.

· The interaction of technology and information
   preservation includes both how we can use technology to
   preserve older materials as well as how we preserve
   technology itself.

THE INTERNET

A Very Short History of the Internet

A full history of the Internet could cover an entire class. For now, let's
cover some important developments that will help you understand why the
Internet works the way it does today.

A Short Timeline of the Internet, 1957 -
early 2000s

  · 1957. The Soviet Union successfully launches the Sputnik satellite,
      catalyzing US government investment in scientific and technical
      projects in a "space race" with the Soviet Union. One major goal was
      to discover a reliable way to transmit information in the event of a
      nuclear attack.

  · 1960s. The US Department of Defense and scientists develop
      ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), a
      computer network that lays the foundation for today's Internet. The
      first two computers connected are at UCLA and Stanford. Later,
      additional research institutions, government agencies, and businesses
      are connected.
         ARPANET is decentralized, meaning that if one node of the
            network fails, the remaining computers can still communicate
            with each other, providing a safeguard against missile attacks or
            other damage.

  · 1973/4. Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn develop a standardized protocol
      that allows different networks to communicate (TCP/IP).
      ARPANET later adopts TCP/IP.
         Internet Protocol (IP): provides unique but standardized
            addresses for every device so that messages arrive at their correct
            destination.
         Transmission Control Protocol (TCP): a system to guarantee
            that all parts of a message are delivered and in the right order.

  · 1983. Debut of the Domain Name System (DNS), allowing users to
      type domain names (e.g., abcd.com) rather than numerical IP
                                                                 THE INTERNET | 131

      addresses.
  · 1989. Tim Berners-Lee develops the World Wide Web (WWW)

      while working at CERN. The WWW relies on hyperlinks, allowing
      users to easily access interconnected resources. Visit the world's first
      website!
  · 1995: The Internet commercializes. Digital financial transactions
      become safer through encryption. (Two examples of businesses that
      start in 1995 include Echo Bay, later eBay, and Amazon.)
  · 1997: The advent of Wi-Fi allows users to connect devices to the
      Internet via radio waves.
  · 1998: Google debuts. Although other search engines have created
      user-friendly portals for finding and accessing web sites, Google
      pioneers PageRank, aka, an algorithm to better return relevant
      results.
  · 2000s: Broadband speeds up Internet connections beyond former
      telephone-based lines, increasing the use of graphics, video, games,
      etc.

Organizing the Internet

The Internet and the World Wide Web, often used interchangeably, are not
actually the same thing.
132 | THE INTERNET

       The Internet is the connected computer network that
       provides the infrastructure for the World Wide Web
       (WWW), as well as email, file transfers, private databases,
       and other non-WWW content, to work. It allows computers
       to talk to each other. The WWW is all the public websites
       and pages you access through a browser like Chrome or
       Firefox.

All content on the Internet - WWW or otherwise - is hosted on servers.
Servers are physical computers, typically hosted in large data centers that
depend on a significant amount of power and cooling infrastructure. When
you access a resource online through a browser, it determines the server
"address" and requests a copy of the site, page, app, etc. to be sent to your
device. The content is sent from the server to your device in small data
packets, then reassembled by your browser for viewing.

The Hierarchy of the Web

The WWW is largely organized into websites, like wikipedia.com or
google.com. The top-level domain (e.g., .com or .org) depends on the
purpose of the site and the type of organization hosting it. The domain
name (e.g., "Google" or "UMSL") is the name of the site.

   Within each website are various web pages, which act as files organized
in relation to each other and the site's home page. The specific organization
of the site depends on type of content. A common structure is similar to a
"tree," where a main page branches into multiple lower-level pages.

   Although what you see on a web page is typically well-formatted text,
graphics, and other content, the underlying code is primarily HTML, a
standardized way to tell a browser how to format and display the page
content (for example, indicating that text should be in bold or italics).

   You can often follow the organization of a website by looking at
the URL.
                                                                 THE INTERNET | 133

       URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is the string of
       text, punctuation, and sometimes symbols you type into a
       web browser to visit a website or access a file on the
       Internet.

   For example, the content of this page is pulled from a freely-available
online textbook (if you are reading it in Canvas - otherwise you're already
directly on the textbook site). The textbook is hosted on a larger site called
Pressbooks, which hosts many other open educational resources.
Pressbooks is both the site name and the main domain that hosts all that
content. Its top-level domain is .pub, which is often used for sites that
host web-based publication. The "umsystem" portion of the URL is the
subdomain - in other words, the portion of the site that hosts publications
from the UM System. The "/information" path refers to our specific book.

The Deep Web

Most content on the Internet is not actually publicly accessible on a web
browser. The deep web refers to content that is hosted on a private server
or protected by login credentials. Importantly, this material is not indexed
by public search engines (like Google). Therefore, you won't typically find
these resources with a regular Google search.
134 | THE INTERNET

        This diagram visually distinguishes between the Internet, the World
        Wide Web, and its various layers: the Surface Web, Deep Web, and
        Dark Web, also highlighting the position of Library Databases
        within this structure.

       The deep web includes subscription-based library databases.
       (Other examples include your personal email account or
       medical records.) Takeaway: a LOT of helpful scholarly
       information is NOT easily discoverable on Google. Instead,
       use a library search tool.
               THE INTERNET | 135

Key Takeaways

· The modern-day Internet relies on several important
   developments from the latter half of the 20th century,
   including the creation of ARPANET, standardized
   communication protocols, the advent of the WWW, and
   user-friendly ways of finding and interacting with
   websites (such as the domain name system and ranked
   search results).

· Internet content is stored on physical servers and relies on
   physical connections to transfer from one computer to
   another.

· A URL can give you clues to how a website is organized.
· Not all Internet content is publicly accessible on the

   WWW.

FORMAT INFORMS
INFORMATION

Introduction

Throughout history, the format in which we store information has shaped
what gets saved, what gets forgotten, and how we access knowledge.
Whether recorded on parchment or preserved in the "cloud," the format of
information affects how we read, cite, and discover ideas.

   In libraries today, you'll encounter a wide range of formats: physical
books and journals, digital eBooks, microfilm, PDF articles, and more.
These formats reflect how technology has evolved and how our ways of
preserving and accessing knowledge have changed. It is easy to assume
digital = best, but many factors influence whether the sources we need
are available in the format of our preference. A print book, for example,
may be easier for one researcher to annotate, while another appreciates the
ability to increase the font size on their eBook. Another book may only
exist in print; there are many sources out there that have not been digitized.
Perhaps a microfilm reel is the only surviving copy of the old newspaper you
need. A digital article may be easily discoverable via a library databases, or
maybe you need to request it as a PDF scan from another library.

   Each format shapes what is visible and what might be overlooked.

Containers of Knowledge

   Most people's first thought of
libraries is as physical spaces where
information is organized in
"containers": books on shelves and
journals bound into numbered
volumes. Before the advent of
digital databases, researchers could
find articles in a print journal and
then find related articles by
flipping through the same issue or
exploring other volumes on the
shelf. Book readers could achieve
the same goal. These physical
containers helped give information
a place and structure, making it
clear to researchers where their
information was coming from.

a library database without it always being obvious to you what journal it

came from or what else was published alongside it. Digital search can speed

up research, but it can also create loss of context. You might miss an

editorial that introduced a journal issue's theme, or not realize an article was

part of a special collection on a specific topic.

For researchers, the takeaway is this: if you're only using open web
searches, you're missing out on a huge portion of high-quality,
credible information that lives below the surface.
138 | FORMAT INFORMS INFORMATION

The Role of Metadata

       Metadata is "data about data": the information that
       describes and provides information about an item.

  · Descriptive metadata is information like the author, title, or
      publication date: information that tells you about an item and which
      allows a researcher to search for and retrieve it.

  · Structural metadata identifies the organization of information within
      the item (e.g., a Table of Contents).

  · Technical metadata includes information like file type or size.

Identifying metadata about a source allows you to effectively search for that
item as well as cite it. You don't need to memorize these terms - just be
aware that all these types of information about individual resources exists
and can be useful for research purposes.

The DIKW Pyramid

The illustration below is the Data-Information-Knowledge-Wisdom
(DIKW) Pyramid. It provides one framework for understanding how raw
data transforms into meaningful insights. The HTML can be understood
as data, unprocessed, and your browser is rendering it into information.
Knowledge is what you gain when you read and learn from this material,
and wisdom is what you do with that knowledge.
                                      FORMAT INFORMS INFORMATION | 139

   Data can be hard or impossible to understand on its own because it is
raw and unprocessed. Information is when data is provided with more
context and meaning. Knowledge is the result of information being
interpreted by you. Wisdom is what results when you put that knowledge
to use.

   Think of research as a journey up a pyramid. At the bottom, you have
tons of raw data. As you go through it and find context, it becomes useful.
When you understand that information and how it connects, you gain
knowledge. When you can apply that knowledge in a meaningful way,
you've reached wisdom. Good research isn't just about collecting or
presenting a pile of data. It's you using your critical thinking skills to climb
the pyramid, and join the scholarly conversation.

   The Internet and libraries, with our immense range of content, provides
resources that exist as data and as information; what you do with it turns it
into knowledge and wisdom.

     Key Takeaways

         · Format heavily influences which sources are visible (or not
             visible) via various search tools and strategies, including in
140 | FORMAT INFORMS INFORMATION

             a library search tool. Relying only on the open web means
             missing out on (a) potentially helpful sources and (b)
             important contextual information for why and how your
             source exists.
         · Metadata offers information about a source, and it is a
             critical component in information organization and
             discovery.
         · Constructing large-scale information from individual data
             points is a complicated process, and mirrors how the

             digital knowledge.

BEYOND A SINGLE SOURCE:
PAST AND FUTURE

Introduction

So far, we've covered a bit of information history at large, focusing in
greater detail on how the technological advancements of the 20th century
have informed how we organize and access information today. We've also
discussed the foundations of the Internet, an indispensable tool for
navigating information in the 21st century.

   However, information history can also refer to the history (and future)
of individual sources. In this short chapter, we cover two important
research strategies: exploring the bibliography and reverse citation
searching.

Strategy One: Exploring the
Bibliography

As we covered in Week 2, most scholarly books and journal articles (and
even some popular sources) include a bibliography: a list of sources at the
end of the work that tell a reader which other articles, books, and other
materials the author referenced.

       Search Strategy: Reading an author's bibliography can give
       you clues about additional sources that might be useful for
142 | BEYOND A SINGLE SOURCE: PAST AND FUTURE

       your own topic. Sometimes, this strategy can be quicker and
       more useful than a keyword search in a library search tool.

Researchers have been using this strategy for a long time. It's part of the
reason proper citation is so important. Even before the ease of digital
searching, scholars could find a print article in a bound journal on a library
shelf, read the bibliography, then locate the journal, volume, issue, and
page numbers of a different but still relevant article somewhere else in the
building. Today, a quicker strategy might be to copy and paste the new
article title into the library search to see whether we have access.

   Though the bibliography is only a small selection of what has likely been
written on the topic, it offers a peek into the history of that field of research.

Strategy Two: Reverse Citation
Search

Historically, journal articles and book chapters could be found physically
anchored to the journals or books they were published in. If you wanted to
find out who later used that source in their own articles (i.e., the article's
future, rather than its past), it would be a cumbersome task, requiring
sorting through massive print indexes. This task was rarely undertaken by
anyone but the most dedicated specialists.

   In the modern information landscape, individual journal articles or
book chapters are often visually decoupled from their larger context (i.e.,
the journal or book they were published in). They are independent digital
objects with unique identifiers, like a DOI. This new paradigm means
that digital tools can more easily track when an article is cited in a later-
published work. This strategy, which has several names (reverse citation
search, forward citation search, or citation tracking), allows you to find
updated publications relevant to your research topic. You search the
"future" of the article's influence on its field post-publication.
                  BEYOND A SINGLE SOURCE: PAST AND FUTURE | 143

       Search Strategy: Use reverse citation search to see
       which publications have come out after your original source
       that use your source as a reference. This strategy can give
       you updated information on your topic.

There are some library databases that make this strategy relatively easy (e.g.,
Scopus), but you can also achieve the same goal through Google Scholar.

   Take the following steps:
 1. Find your source in Google Scholar. The easiest strategy is to copy

      and paste the title, if you have it.
 2. Find the entry for your source in the search results.
 3. Click the blue "Cited by" link.
Note: This strategy doesn't always yield helpful resources (especially if
you've selected a newer publication that hasn't had time to accumulate a
high citation count), but it is a worthwhile tool to have in your searching
tool belt.

   Remember: You can connect UMSL Libraries to Google Scholar -
review the Google Scholar reading to find out how.

     Key Takeaways

         · Exploring a source's "past" and "future" can help you get a
             wider picture of research in your field of interest and
             identify new relevant sources.
144 | BEYOND A SINGLE SOURCE: PAST AND FUTURE

         · Exploring a source's bibliography will help you identify
             previously published work that was foundational to the
             source you already found.

         · A reverse citation search will help you identify newer
             publications that use your source as a reference, possibly
             giving you updated information on your topic.

ABOUT WEEK 6

Week 6 Overview

Our primary goal this week is to cover where the money goes in academic
scholarship. This information is helpful for beginner researchers for several
reasons:

 1. It will help you understand why research access is expensive.
 2. It will situate the role of the library in mediating between researchers

      and publishers.
 3. It will help you begin thinking critically about traditional models of

      scholarly publishing.

As part of this discussion, we also introduce the idea of open materials: why
and how some scholarship (along with other works) are freely accessible
online, while others are not.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this week, you should be able to:

         1. Describe the roles of authors, reviewers, editors,
             publishers, and librarians in the scholarly publishing model.

        2. Explain what a paywall is and the library's role in providing
             research access.

        3. Explain the goal of interlibrary loan services.
148 | ABOUT WEEK 6

        4. Identify Creative Commons licenses as a common
             mechanism for open publishing.

SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING

   Libby Wheeles; Helena Marvin; and Tim Nelson

Introduction

This chapter offers a brief overview of scholarly publishing, the process
by which scholarly articles and scholarly books are created.

   As a reminder:

       A scholarly source is written by an academic expert to
       communicate original research or other academic discourse
       with other scholars.

We cover the basics of scholarly publishing for two reasons:
 1. To review what scholarly sources are and where to find them.
 2. To introduce the main players in the publishing process, including

      the researchers, reviewers, publishers, and librarians.

The Basics of Scholarly Publishing

For the purposes of this discussion, we'll focus on how scholarly journal
articles get from an idea in a researchers' head to the written article you can
read through the library website or on the web. As a reminder, scholarly
(or academic) journal articles are written by scholars to share their
research with other experts.
150 | SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING

Steps to Publication

 1. Research and writing. First, the authors conduct their original
      research and write an article to share their results. This article usually
      combines previous research in the field (to provide background and
      support their methodology) and their own original work.

 2. Submission to a journal. The author(s) find a journal that
      publishes articles similar to the theirs. This similarity is a good
      indication that the journal would be interested in their article and
      that they would reach their target audience (e.g., scholars who
      specialize in their field) by publishing in that journal.

 3. Editor review. An editor who works for the journal decides
      whether the article is well-written and appropriate for that journal's
      scope. If it does, they send the article to peer reviewers who are
      experts on topics relevant to the article.

 4. Peer review. Peer reviewers do not typically work for or get paid by
      the journal. Instead, peer review work is considered part of regular
      faculty responsibilities. Often, reviewers assess the strength of the
      argument, the clarity of the writing, and the overall contribution to
      the subject area. The final decision on whether to publish, however,
      rests with the publisher. Important: Not all journal articles are
      peer reviewed.

 5. Final revisions and publication. The journal staff (who work for
      the publisher) facilitate final edits and make the final decision on
      whether to publish the article. If the article is accepted, it gets
      published alongside other articles in an issue of that journal. As a
      reminder, journals (which are a type of periodical) usually get
      published on a regular schedule, or periodically (similar to
      newspapers).

 6. Acquisition. Access to academic research is very
      expensive. Librarians use their budgets to purchase journal issues or
      to subscribe to online databases that offer access to those journals.
      Importantly, libraries cannot purchase access to everything. They
      make decisions on what to purchase based on their budgets and the
      research topics that are important to the faculty and students at their
      university.

A review of most of this process is offered in our peer review tutorial:

Important Roles

Authors/Researchers

The article's authors are the people who conducted original research and
then wrote an article to share their results. The authors are paid to do
research with the salaries from their universities and research grant funding
that they have to apply for (for example, from federal government
programs).

Journal Editor

When authors want to publish their work, they usually submit it to an
academic journal. An editor who works for the journal makes the first
decision about whether the article passes basic standards and is a good fit
for their usual audience. They also facilitate the peer review process. The
editor is paid by the publisher of the journal.

Peer Reviewers

Peer reviewers do not work for the journal, and they do not get paid extra
from their universities for the labor of peer review. It is considered part
of their responsibilities as researchers in their field. They review the article
for originality, significance to their field, writing quality, and other criteria.
They make recommendations to the journal about whether or not the
article should be published.
152 | SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING

The Publisher

Publishers act as the gatekeepers and managers of the publishing process.
They are responsible for acquiring and selecting manuscripts with
potential. Once a manuscript is accepted, the publisher invests financially
in its production, which usually includes editing, proofreading, design,
formatting, and printing. They handle the critical functions of marketing
and distribution to ensure the work reaches its audience. The same
publisher may publish many journals.

       Once a manuscript is published, the publisher (usually, but
       not always) owns the rights to that work. That means that
       the publisher, not the researcher, is the one getting paid
       when people purchase access.

Librarians

Libraries provide access to journal articles and other works by purchasing
them (or licenses for them) from scholarly publishers. And, of course,
they work hard to set up their websites and physical collections to make
materials easy to find. They also spend a lot of time teaching students how
the library works, what kinds of materials we have, and whom they can ask
for help.

           shelves of bound journals. The systematic
           arrangement by title, volume, and year
           highlights the importance of organization in
           accessing information for academic
           research and demonstrates how print
           resources are managed in a library setting.

In addition to librarians who teach and provide research help,
other librarians work hard behind the scenes. Staff and
faculty who work in acquisitions do things like navigating
complicated purchase agreements with publishers and
making decisions on research priorities with tight library
budgets. You might not ever see them, but they are working
154 | SCHOLARLY PUBLISHING

       hard to help you access the materials you need to learn and
       conduct student research.

     Key Takeaways

         · Scholarly publishers are gatekeepers and managers in the
             scholarly publishing process. They own and publish
             academic journals, in which researchers publish articles to
             communicate their work, along with other scholarly
             manuscripts.

         · Authors, editors, reviewers, publishers, and librarians all
             play important roles in the scholarly publishing process.

         · Often, publishers own the rights to and get paid for access
             to the scholarly work they publish (as opposed to the
             people who did the research).

THE PAYWALL & OPEN
ACCESS

   Libby Wheeles; Helena Marvin; and Tim Nelson

Introduction

As we've mentioned in previous weeks, access to scholarly research can be
very expensive. This chapter covers some important concepts to help you
understand:

  · who profits from high cost barriers to academic research
  · why doing academic research on the open web is challenging

      (compared to using the library)
  · why some research is available for free
This information will help you make informed decisions about where to
search for scholarly sources. It will also provide you with helpful
foundational information about the scholarly publishing landscape if you
decide to pursue more advanced research.

Paywalls

Artist: David Revoy (2015), licensed CC-BY 4.0.
156 | THE PAYWALL & OPEN ACCESS

       A paywall refers to the cost barrier between a potential
       reader/viewer and the content they wish to access. In other
       words, when you have to subscribe to a newspaper or
       streaming service to see content, or pay to individually access
       a journal article outside your library, you are encountering a
       paywall.

In theory, paywalls are not inherently a bad thing. Many people work hard
to get scholarly materials from the idea stage to the well-formatted,
accessible document/video/etc. that you view in print or on your
computer. See the previous chapter for a review on the roles people play
in the process of scholarly publishing (researchers, editors, reviewers,
publishers, and librarians). Just like any other job, these people engage
in labor and reasonably expect compensation for their time, skill, and
materials.

Who Profits?

The traditional scholarly publishing model means that publishers, rather
than researchers, see most of the profits from this work:

  · Researchers receive salaries and grant funding to complete their
      research. (Much of this grant funding has historically come from the
      federal government.) Once the research is completed, they are
      typically no longer making money from that research.

  · Peer reviewers do not receive any compensation for their work.
      Traditionally, it has been considered part of their responsibilities as
      fellow researchers in their field.

  · Publishers do add value to the research process, which does require
      compensation. They facilitate the peer review process, often provide
      final editing and formatting, and publish/host/market the final
      product (in print, through digital platforms, or both).
         Typically, publishers, not researchers, own the rights to the
            final version of a scholarly manuscript. When individuals,
            libraries, or other institutions pay for access, that money goes to
            the publisher.

Many people consider this system unfair for several reasons. These include:
                                         THE PAYWALL & OPEN ACCESS | 157
  · Many academic publishers set high prices for access to the research

      they publish. As an industry, academic publishing has high profit
      margins.
  · Publishers are benefiting from work provided to them for free (from
      researchers and peer reviewers).
  · Taxpayers are paying twice over for research: once, in the form of
      grants awarded to researchers to complete their work, and twice, in
      the form of libraries/institutions paying publishers to access that
      research, with government funds funneled to public institutions and
      library budgets.
Important: These disparities differ by individual publisher
and academic field.

158 | THE PAYWALL & OPEN ACCESS

The Role of the Library

A significant portion of a library's budget goes toward purchasing
individual materials as well as subscriptions to databases or packages of
journals on an annual basis. Access to research is a requirement for a
university to function well, and being the go-between between researchers
and publishers is one of the library's most important jobs.

       Using the library's search tools helps you (a) find scholarly
       materials and (b) access those materials for free. You will
       not find everything that might be useful to your research
       topic available on the open web.

The Future of Library Budgets

Year to year, libraries face a rising challenge with affording the cost of
scholarly research. Because libraries purchase access on an annual basis, the
price can be increased every year, and libraries must do their best with flat
or sometimes decreasing budgets to afford to keep the same journals they
provided for their institution in previous years. These rapidly escalating
prices are referred to as the serials crisis (the words serials and periodicals
- things published periodically, like academic journals or magazines - are
often used interchangeably).

   The problem is especially apparent in sciences research (as compared
to humanities). Here's a chart illustrating the price escalation in two
disciplines from 2001 to 2025:

Nelson licensed CC0 no attribution required.

The price of library subscriptions has been rising faster than inflation for
several decades, and the funds available to libraries have generally been
declining. The chart above uses the average prices of History journals (one
of the least expensive) and Chemistry journals (one of the most expensive)
to demonstrate how quickly these costs have risen. Both are more than
four times as expensive in 2025 as they were in 2001. In comparison, the
Consumer Price Index (CPI), a general measure of inflation for everyday
customer products like food and gasoline, only went up by 81%
(https://www.bls.gov/cpi/) during this period.
160 | THE PAYWALL & OPEN ACCESS

An Alternative Model: Open Access

Scholarly sources that are published open access are
available digitally for free under one of several license types
(e.g., Creative Commons). Sometimes, articles are available
open access because researchers have paid a fee up front to
publish their work.

   Open access is an increasingly popular option for
publishing. It has several benefits:

  · Research that is published open access often gets    Open access
      more exposure, since more people can read it for   logo
      free.

  · Researchers from less well-funded institutions
      (either in the West or from developing countries)
      can access more materials.

Often, open access materials are marked with the open
lock symbol (shown on the right).

Search tip: If you rely only on publicly available search
engines (like Google or Google Scholar), a lot of the research
you find is probably going to be materials that were
published open access. This opportunity can be extremely
helpful, but remember, do not only rely on open access
materials if you have access to a library. A lot of
scholarly research is still published under the traditional

       model and you will miss valuable materials by not learning
       how to use your library for research.

Problems with Open Access

Increasing the amount of scholarship that can be accessed free online is a
162 | THE PAYWALL & OPEN ACCESS
lofty goal. There are, however, some complications with different models
of implementing open access. These include:

  · Concerns about the quality of material published open access vs.
      through traditional publishing routes.

  · Placing a financial burden on researchers hoping to publish their
      work. Often, materials are made open access because the researchers
      pay a fee (sometimes an exorbitant one) to the publishers to make
      their work open. This model costs more to researchers and prevents
      work from less well-funded institutions (including those in
      developing countries) and in less well-funded fields from being
      published.

COPYRIGHT AND
INTERLIBRARY LOAN

   Libby Wheeles; Helena Marvin; and Tim Nelson

Introduction

In previous chapters, we covered one of the basic truths that governs
traditional scholarly publishing: in many cases, publishers, not researchers,
own the rights to a final published scholarly manuscript.

   This chapter covers what it means to "own" the rights to ideas, writing,
images, etc. (copyright) and how that legal structure impacts a crucial
library service, interlibrary loan. This information will help you
understand why an important library function exists. It may also help
inform where and how you publish your own work in the future.

What is Copyright?

       Copyright is a legal right that gives the creator of a work
       (written work, art, music, etc.) ownership over their own
       material. Other people can't replicate it, make money off it,
       edit it, or (with exceptions) share it with others without the
       permission of the copyright owner.

In the modern US, you don't need to register anything with the
government to have copyright over your own work. You automatically have
it once you record your idea in a fixed form.
                               COPYRIGHT AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN | 165

   This concept can be tricky to think about when comparing ownership
of ideas versus ownership of physical things. If you have a loaf of bread and
give it away, you no longer have the bread. Afterwards, the other person can
do what they like with the bread. But, if you write a poem about bread and
share it, you still have the poem (and, they do too). Copyright is intended
to ensure that you still "own" the rights to your poem even if you, for
example, share it online. It would be illegal for someone else to print copies
of your poem and sell those - even if they found the text online, they don't
own the copyright for your poem. It is your intellectual property.

Copyright and Academic Research

Copyright becomes trickier when you go through a publisher to share
your work. Until they publish it, researchers retain copyright for their
manuscripts (with some exceptions - sometimes, their employer considers
it "work for hire," and the employer instead retains copyright).

   In the traditional publishing model, authors rarely get to keep their
copyright if they want to get their work published. Instead, they transfer
the rights to their work to the publisher in a Copyright Transfer
Agreement. The publisher now has the right to replicate, edit, and
disseminate that research. That is how the publisher continues to make
money from research rather than the original authors. The manuscript
is now the intellectual property of the publisher, rather than the
researchers. The publisher holds the copyright.

Why would researchers give up their
copyright?

In short, they have to in order to advance their careers. Publishing
scholarship is a requirement for tenure at pretty much any institution.
Right now, publishers offer the main avenue through which academics'
work can be disseminated to their colleagues and help them become
recognized as reputable scholars in their field.

Licensing

Licensing is the legal tool used to define exactly how a copyrighted article
can, or can't, be used by others. It is also the mechanism by which libraries
gain access to scholarly material through a publisher, especially for digital
works. When purchasing a license (for example, for an eBook), libraries
are told the rules they must follow when providing access to their patrons.
These rules could include how many people can access it and under what
166 | COPYRIGHT AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN

conditions (e.g., How many people can read it at once? Does the patron
have to physically be on campus? Is access limited to a particular group of
faculty/students?) as well as whether the library can share that item with
other libraries via interlibrary loan. Any use outside the paid license could
be a violation of the publisher's copyright.

Interlibrary Loan

       Interlibrary loan is the process by which libraries lend
       materials to each other. It is a crucial service that expands
       access for patrons whose home libraries may not own or
       license all the materials they need for their research topic.

We have already established that most articles have paywalls that prevent
people from accessing them on the open web. By using a library search
tool and logging in with your university credentials, you gain access to
materials that your library has licensed from academic publishers. When
you use interlibrary loan to get something, you are experiencing an escape
hatch built into the legal framework to balance the restrictive nature of
the economics of research. It is an extremely important (and sometimes
underutilized) service that allows you to read materials even if your library
has not purchased or licensed them.

If publishers own most copyrights, how
can libraries send articles to each other
without paying?

ILL is a right built into copyright law. Section 108 of the U.S. Copyright
Act allows libraries to make and share copies of works for non-commercial,
educational purposes. It is a provision that ensures knowledge isn't locked
away because a single library can't afford it. When a researcher uses ILL,
they are participating in a century-old tradition of library collaboration
that, like open access, is operating in opposition to the idea that access to
knowledge should be determined by what you can afford to pay.
                               COPYRIGHT AND INTERLIBRARY LOAN | 167

Interlibrary Loan at UMSL

There is no charge to place interlibrary loan (ILL) requests at UMSL.
There are two main ways to place requests:
 1. Clicking a "Request this Item through Interlibrary Loan" button

      you see in a library search tool. Using this button auto-fills a request
      form that is processed by our ILL staff.
 2. Manually completing an ILL request form. Make sure to select
      which type of resource you need using the tabs at the top of the
      form.

       Search tip: No library provides access to everything.
       Especially as you progress to more advanced research,
       consider expanding your scope to materials that you can get
       from other libraries.

Important: Just like managing budgets and handling complicated

Introduction

In previous chapters, we discussed the increasing popularity of publishing
scholarship open access: making materials freely available online. Open
access publishing is just one aspect of the larger open movement: a
movement (both within and outside of academia) to make materials free
for viewing, for reuse, and for adaptation. Open materials include not just
scholarship, but images, software, audio, video, data, and more.

   One common mechanism for making materials open is publishing them
under a Creative Commons (CC) license. CC licenses allow authors to
make their materials open while still specifying certain conditions under
which their work can be reused by others.

   You may see some academic works published under a CC license. It's
also helpful to be aware of as you become a more advanced researcher
and, perhaps, publish your own work online. This chapter offers a very
short overview of different types of CC licenses you may encounter or use
yourself.

Creative Commons

       A Creative Commons (CC) license allows an author to
       make their work open for reuse, adaptation, or dissemination
       by others (or, some combination of these permissions).

CC licenses are standardized and recognizable by a common logo. You may
recognize one of the CC licenses that UMSL uses for its video tutorials:
170 | CREATIVE COMMONS

         CC-BY-NC-SA license

Watch the video below* (from the University of Houston Libraries) for an
overview of what Creative Commons licenses can do for your work:

*Did you notice: If you look in this video's description on YouTube,
you can see that it was created using content they adapted from another
university's video. That original video was under a CC license, which gave
permission for the librarians at the University of Houston to adapt their
ideas to create their own version. The new version is also under a CC
license!

   Below, read through a very short description of the different types of CC
licenses. If you ever want to publish your own work under a CC license,
carefully consider which permissions you'd like others to have when reusing
your material.

CC Licenses

CC0

A CC0 license places no restriction on how someone else may reuse your
work. They do not have to give you credit, they may adapt your work, and
they may make money off their version of your material.
       CREATIVE COMMONS | 171

CC BY

CC BY requires only that someone else credits you when they reuse your
work. They are free to edit, share it under different permissions, and make
money from your material.

CC BY-SA

CC BY-SA requires that someone reusing your work must (a) credit you
and (b) reshare the work they created by building on your material under
the same license you used (SA = "share alike"). SA requirements promote
the publication of more open materials by people who use your work. They
are still allowed to adapt your material or make money from the product
they create using your work.

CC BY-NC

CC BY-NC prohibits someone reusing your work from making money
from whatever their final product is. They can only reuse your work for
noncommercial purposes. They must still credit you.

CC BY-ND

CC BY-ND (a) requires that people reusing your work must credit you and
(b) are prohibited from editing your work in any way. They must use what
you created in its original iteration (ND = "nonderivative").

CC BY-NC-ND

CC BY-NC-ND combines several of the previous license characteristics.
This license requires that users must credit you and prohibits derivative
works as well as commercial uses.

CC BY-NC-SA

CC BY-NC-SA combines several of the previous license characteristics.
This license requires that users must credit you and share their own work
under the same license. They are also prohibited from reusing your work
for commercial purposes.

     Key Takeaways

         · Creative Commons are a frequently used tool in the open
             movement to publish works that can be reused by others
             under certain conditions.

         · Different CC licenses have different permissions. Common
             requirements include having to credit the author or share
             their work under a similar license; common prohibitions
             include restricting commercial use or creating derivative
             works (i.e., adapting it from the original).

ABOUT WEEK 7

Overview

This week, we cover a rapidly advancing technology that is likely to
significantly impact both personal and academic research: generative AI.
Our goal is to help you understand what generative AI is, cover its
limitations as a tool for emerging researchers, and discuss ethical
considerations you should be aware of (whether you use AI or not).

   Understanding AI can seem daunting. Please know that you do not have
to have a computer science background to master the basics of how genAI
works. You are capable! And, understanding these concepts will help you
navigate the changing world around you, both in the classroom and after
you graduate.

   Also: you are not required to actually use AI to complete the
assignments this week. Some of you may be coming to this class already
informed about the ethical complications of AI use (such as heavy
environmental impacts, biased output, or the use of pirated training data).
We support your decision, and our discussion board this week offers both a
chance to experiment with AI AND an alternative discussion prompt.

   We do still encourage you to thoughtfully engage with the material this
week. Understanding how AI works will help you navigate an information
landscape in which genAI is likely to be increasingly integrated - in the
future, you may not always have the option to not use a resource built with
generative AI.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this week, you will be able to:

KEY CONCEPTS IN AI

Introduction

This chapter introduces basic concepts underlying AI, particularly popular
language models like ChatGPT. Our goal is not to encourage or discourage
the general use of AI, but instead to help you understand its foundational
mechanics. We believe this information will become more and more
essential to your education and work as AI rapidly becomes integrated into
various technologies in our day-to-day life.

AI, Algorithms, & Machine Learning

       Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that mimics
       human intelligence by completing tasks that would normally
       require a human to achieve: perceiving the world, learning
       from recognized "rules," and making decisions.

Older AI relied on humans designing complicated but explicit instructions
for how to interpret input and generate output. At their most basic, these
instructions, or rules, take the form "if X, then Y." "If a traffic light is green,
then cars can go." "If text includes the phrase `Dear So-and-so', then it is
a letter or email." "If someone listens to Lana Del Ray, then they may also
like Billie Eilish."

   Sophisticated sets of rules governing AI "decisions" and output are called
algorithms. You are probably familiar with algorithms in the form of social
media feeds or recommendation services. Algorithms influence what you
see in your Google search results, on your TikTok "For You" page, and
in your Spotify recommendations. They are also the foundation to other
178 | KEY CONCEPTS IN AI

widely-used technologies, like image filters or "shortest path" calculations
by your GPS. Recent tools like ChatGPT have popularized awareness of
AI, but this technology has been in our lives for a long time.

   Since the 1950s, AI has become more sophisticated through machine
learning: processing extraordinary amounts of data and identifying
patterns without explicit human programming. In other words, machine
learning allows AI to work with more information, at greater speeds, and
with more complex detail as it teaches itself (with human supervision)
about the patterns found in its training input (text, images, code, audio,
and more).

   AI models that independently "learn" at high speeds, and with truly
copious amounts of data to "learn" from, do tasks like categorize, write,
calculate, summarize, prioritize, etc. in ways that seem closer to what an
average human, with an average knowledge of the world around them,
could do. As a result, we have seen the advent of new AI tools and rapidly
improving capabilities for familiar ones. Increasingly complex AI tools,
with mass troves of data, do things like interpret finer details in images,
process and produce language for niche situations, and build/run
complicated mathematical models, among other tasks.

   AI models require guidance from people. Technology which is built
on data patterns is only as good as that data and its own programming.
We cover this topic in more detail in the next chapter, but AI can
overgeneralize, make mistakes, and miss important details. It is common to
assume AI is more capable than it actually is, sometimes in ways that can
harm our learning, health, relationships, and more.

       Our takeaway for now is: AI tools are more closely

       approximating human capabilities, but they cannot replace

       our powers of perception, logic, creativity, or moral

       reasoning.
                                                        KEY CONCEPTS IN AI | 179

Generative AI & LLMs

       Generative AI (GenAI) uses patterns learned from training
       data to produce new text, audio, video, images, or other
       content.

GenAI models learn complicated networks of "rules" that they use to
interpret input from a user and generate a unique output. The "unique"
part is crucial. In theory, GenAI should not reproduce any of its training
data, instead producing a new combination of words, images, and more
that are nevertheless still dependent on the training data. (We briefly
explore this replication concern and its implication for copyright in the
Ethics chapter this week.)

   Watch the video below for a short visual overview on generative AI (run
time 5:01):

                   One or more interactive elements has been excluded from
                   this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                   https://umsystem.pressbooks.pub/
        information/?p=393#oembed-1

Large Language Models (LLMs) are a type of GenAI focused on
language. ChatGPT, currently the most widely used standalone AI tool,
is an example of an LLM. One reason for the popularity of LLMs, and
skyrocketing public awareness of AI, is their the capacity for natural
language, not just in output but in input. In other words, you can "talk" to
the AI the same way you would talk to another human being. This feature
allows you to use AI without needing to learn computer code or limiting
yourself to a set of predetermined options. The only limit to your input
(often called a prompt) is your own creativity, while the sophistication of
outputs are continually evolving.

   ChatGPT and similar tools work as though you are having a
conversation with the AI. You type in a prompt, the AI responds, and
then you can ask it to complete a new task or edit its previous responses
based on further instructions from you. To a certain extent, it remembers
your previous input as well as its own responses and can make adjustments
180 | KEY CONCEPTS IN AI

without you needing to repeat instructions in their entirety. Again, this
feature more closely approximates a real human conversation, making the
AI both more accessible and deceptively human-like.

   Here's a screenshot of what a basic ChatGPT prompt and response
looks like:

ChatGPT basic prompt and response screenshot, August 2025

As the response text suggests, you could then type in instructions and
have ChatGPT adjust the tone of the text, make it longer, include specific
language, and more. This example is basic, but people use conversational
LLMs to do any of the following tasks:

  · Generating text. People have asked LLMs like ChatGPT to
      generate emails, essays, scripts, and other text-like outputs like
      computer code. Whether you should use AI to do these tasks is a
      topic we cover in the next chapter.

  · Summarizing. LLMs can - mostly effectively - summarize longer
      texts or groups of texts, including documents that you upload.

  · Translating. LLMs can serve as reasonably accurate auto-translation
      tools, with caveats. For example, their accuracy may vary especially
      when translating less common languages underrepresented in their
      training data.

  · Interpreting and generating tone. In addition to basic text
      generation, LLMs can "perceive" the tone of your input and follow
      instructions in generating output to match a specific tone, context,
      or intended audience.

  · Editing. In addition to tone adjustments, LLMs can offer
      suggestions for basic grammar and spelling edits alongside more
      significant restructuring improvements for longer texts.

  · Providing information...maybe. A major task people
                                                         KEY CONCEPTS IN AI | 181

      frequently try to use LLMs for is answering questions or otherwise
      providing information. However, as we see below, the function of
      LLMs is predicting words, not fact-checking, evaluating sources, or
      often even linking to real web pages. Finding real information,
      especially for college-level research, is generally not an
      appropriate use for an LLM!

Training LLMs

AI models are trained on massive datasets of text, art, video, audio, and
more. They "learn" rules for interpreting input and generating output
through analyzing training data patterns, making guesses, and making
corrections under human supervision. Through this process, they improve
in their ability to generate "correct" responses.

   Important points:

  · AI models do not "create" content. Instead, they predict language,
      art components, etc. based on learned patterns.

  · AI companies are often not transparent about their training data.
      Their use of copyrighted material without creator permission may
      violate ethical and legal standards. (See the Ethics chapter this week.)

Training data for LLMs include books, web pages, discussion boards, social
media, computer code, and more. LLMs "learn" via a transformer that
processes text as a sequence, analyzing word frequency in the context of the
words and sentences around it. (A generative pre-trained transformer - a
GPT - is the basis for the name "ChatGPT").

     Activity

     Scroll through this helpful explanation of transformers from the
     Financial Times for an understanding of how various LLMs,
     including ChatGPT, were trained. This information will help you
     understand what popular tools like ChatGPT can, and can't, do.
182 | KEY CONCEPTS IN AI

       The fact that LLMs merely predict the next words in a
       sequence mean that they cannot fact-check themselves or
       truly understand the content they produce. They are helpful
       tools for generating language, but not for replacing true
       research, especially at the college level and above.

     Key Takeaways

         · AI is technology that mimics human capabilities. Modern
             AI models rely on machine learning, in which they teach
             themselves patterns from enormous datasets (guided and
             corrected under human supervision).

         · Generative AI is AI that generates new content (as
             opposed to, for example, merely categorizing). LLMs
             (Large Language Models) like ChatGPT are a type of
             GenAI that focus on language.

         · LLMs work by predicting the next likely words and
             phrases in a sequence. They cannot fact-check or truly
             understand their training data, input, or output in the way
             a human can.

LIMITATIONS OF AI FOR
RESEARCH

Introduction

If your exposure to AI has primarily been through friends, hype from the
general Internet or news, or even teachers actively encouraging you to use
it, you may view AI as an obvious go-to resource for anything from writing
essays to finding sources to asking real-life advice. The fact that you can
ask questions of a chatbot, which then appears to synthesize information,
respond, and edit based on your feedback in a personalized and
authoritative-sounding way, makes AI tools a more tempting option than
using search engines, the library, individual resources like books or articles,
or even asking a real person.

   It's easy. It's free (for now). It answers your exact question in a confident
and "well-written" response - sometimes with links! Why wouldn't you use
it?

   Our goal here is not to argue there aren't uses for AI, even in an
educational setting. We leave that determination up to each professor and
their goals for their own class. However, there are several essential points
we'd like to cover:

  · AI is not better than you. Even if you perceive your critical thinking
      or writing skills to be insufficient, they are automatically better than a
      machine's because they are real.

  · AI tools have serious limitations that are not obvious, even
      sometimes to experienced academics. Their outputs are specifically
      designed to sound confident, accurate, and well-formulated, and yet,
      we have countless examples of false or misleading or poorly-
      supported AI output. It can be extremely challenging to navigate this
      reality as a beginner researcher or even just a regular person.

  · Deciding whether to use AI for a given task is difficult in a world
      where (a) technology is changing rapidly, (b) expectations are
      different in different classes and different workplaces, and (c) AI
      companies are not up front about their tools' limitations or ethical
      decisions that might make you question whether you engage with
      their product.
184 | LIMITATIONS OF AI FOR RESEARCH

Our goal with this chapter is to introduce some of these considerations
so you can make well-informed decisions about what is right for you as a
person, as a student, as an employee, or in other relevant areas of your life.
Keep in mind this content is not comprehensive. We highly recommend
further research (somewhere other than an LLM...) on any topics of
interest.

AI For Research

A common use for tools like ChatGPT (or even the AI overviews on
Google) is finding information. As we covered already, using ChatGPT
(or Claude, Perplexity, etc.) is appealing because, unlike using the library
search or even a search engine, you can type your question in a way that
makes sense to you and get a response that (in theory) combines
information across different sources. You don't have to click into a bunch
of resources to piece together an answer, and if you do want to explore
further, most of these tools link out to the "sources" they "pulled"
information from - things like social media posts, websites, and even
academic articles.

   So what are the downsides? Turns out, there's a lot.

Hallucinations and Misinformation

The biggest problem with using AI for research (either personal or
academic) is hallucinations.

       AI hallucinations are AI-generated content that is false or
       inaccurate. Examples include fake sources, links that lead
       nowhere, and false facts.

Other forms of misinformation from AI includes summaries that
misrepresent the sources they are "referencing" and facts taken out of
context.

   LLMs like ChatGPT or Google's AI Overview feature are vulnerable
to hallucinations because they are prediction machines. Rather than
asking what the answer to your question is, they instead ask what an answer
                                    LIMITATIONS OF AI FOR RESEARCH | 185
to your question would look like. You get responses that appear helpful at
first, but are incorrect (or entirely made up) when you explore further.

   Therefore, you get issues like:

  · Incorrect facts
  · Claims that are removed or rephrased from their original context,

      and therefore are entirely misleading
  · Completely fake sources and links

These issues occur alongside problems like not accurately identifying key
points of a source or even claiming a fact came from one source when it
actually came from a different one.

Examples of AI Hallucinations

ChatGPT source recommendations, Fall 2023

The image above is from a workshop held by UMSL Libraries in the '23-'24
school year. Though AI models have advanced rapidly since then,
hallucinations as seen in the response are still very common.

   Importantly, they would not be obvious to a newer researcher.
Hallucinated citations follow a pattern of being unusually well-suited to
the proposed topic, sometimes with the names of real authors and article
titles that are very similar to actual papers. However, a search to read the
full text reveals that the article does not actually exist. The tool may even
"hallucinate" a DOI or a link that leads to nowhere.

   Importantly, this issue does not only happen with academic articles.
AI will also generate fake but plausible-sounding news articles, web pages,
books, etc.
186 | LIMITATIONS OF AI FOR RESEARCH

Screenshot of Google AI overview, February 2025

It's also important to remember that AI does not "understand" or "read"
the sources it cites. This limitation can result in misleading claims and a lack
of important context.

   In the Google screenshot above, the AI Overview claims that geologists
recommend eating rocks to get valuable vitamins and minerals. However,
by exploring the sources cited by the AI tool, we find an article from
ResFrac, a software company, thanking The Onion for using a picture of a
geophysicist who advises their company. Importantly, The Onion is a satire
site (the original article was titled "Geologists Recommend Eating At Least
One Small Rock Per Day"). Google's AI considered ResFrac to be a
reputable site, but could not pick up on the context of an amusing
reference back to a satire article. It would probably be worth second-
guessing some of the other claims as well.

Source Type Limitations and
Accessibility

LLMs are improving in their ability to link to real sources. Some tools (e.g.,
Perplexity) are even designed for online research and allow you to focus
your efforts on particular types of sources. However, most of these tools
are still insufficient to rely on for college-level research for multiple
reasons:

  · Most of these tools are bad at identifying the type of source they are
      referencing. As a new researcher, you may struggle with
      distinguishing sources types. Your generic AI tool is worse at it.
                                    LIMITATIONS OF AI FOR RESEARCH | 187

  · Links are often limited to materials that are available open
      access online. We don't mean to suggest that if something is
      available for free online, that means it's inappropriate as a source for
      academic research. However, you would also be missing a TON of
      helpful research on your topic that you could be finding by using a
      library search tool. This content includes:
         Materials that are digital, but locked behind a paywall so you
            can't actually read them. Just reading a summary or abstract
            is not sufficient for college-level research. Visit your library
            for access to paywalled articles.
         Print materials. Plenty of helpful and up-to-date content is
            still published and purchased in print. Tools like ChatGPT will
            typically not reference these sources, nor will their content be
            included the training material used to generate its answers (the
            same is true for a lot of paywalled content).

Bias

AI can generate biased content as a result of its training data. LLMs like
ChatGPT train on human-created texts, much of which reflect stereotypes
and misinformation about various groups of people. Other types of AI that
rely on non text-based data for tasks such as categorizing, recommending,
and otherwise making decisions can also be impacted by unrepresentative
training materials.

   Finally, the decisions that people make using AI-generated content is also
vulnerable to bias (as are most human thoughts and actions), especially if
the people using these tools assume they are infallible and "neutral."

   The video below provides a short overview of this issue (run time: 8:37):

188 | LIMITATIONS OF AI FOR RESEARCH

AI Misinformation and Research:

Real Consequences

As a student, it may be understandably difficult to grasp why professors
and others are so averse to relying on AI for in-depth research. However,
it's important to remember that the information gathering, source
evaluation, and comprehension skills you develop throughout your
college classes are meant to prepare you for navigating the real world.

   Our examples of AI hallucinations so far have been, technically,
accidental. Untrue facts are the result of limitations of the AI model, not
someone maliciously creating fake content. However, it's important to
keep in mind that both unintended and intentional misinformation
have the potential to have real negative consequences.

   We have reached an era where some research articles, websites, and even
government reports (that influence real policy and public opinion) have
included fake citations (note: the goal of this example is not to critique
a specific political party, but to illustrate the natural questioning of
credibility that results from work built on sources that don't exist). Think
about how you feel as someone whose health, finances, relationships,
voting patterns, and other real and important decisions could be
impacted negatively because someone in a position of responsibility
inappropriately relied on AI rather than real research.

   Eventually, you will be the person with responsibility. We encourage
you to learn the source gathering and fact-checking skills you need to bear
that responsibility with integrity.

   These skills will also serve you well as we face a world where bad actors
intentionally use generative AI to create fake content, either as a prank or
for more malicious goals (like influencing elections, scamming people, etc.)
Watch the video below for a short discussion of this problem (run time:

                               LIMITATIONS OF AI FOR RESEARCH | 189

Key Takeaways

    · Most generic AI tools like ChatGPT are not well-suited for
        research, either academic or personal.

    · Significant research-related limitations of popular AI tools
        include frequent hallucinations, limitations in available
        sources, and possible bias.

    · Relying on tools that can either intentionally or
        accidentally generate fake content can have real-world
        consequences. It is important to be aware of these
        limitations so you can manage your personal, academic,
        and work responsibilities with integrity.

OTHER ETHICAL
CONSIDERATIONS

Introduction

So far, we have covered the basics of how AI works and whether popular
tools are appropriate for academic research. However, other ethical factors
may influence your decision on whether or not to use AI, either in the
classroom or outside it. This chapter provides introductions to these
considerations so you can make an informed choice.

Copyright and "Stealing"

Training Materials

AI training depends on machine learning - the ability for a model to
teach itself about patterns found in its training materials. Successful
machine learning depends on a truly vast amount of data. More extensive
and diverse data points typically result in better-tuned models.

   However, the exact sources that popular tools like ChatGPT, Claude,
Gemini, and others use for training are not fully disclosed. While some
of these datasets are materials that are free for reuse or are old enough to
no longer be subject to copyright, a significant portion of training data is
likely copyrighted material that has been copied and used to train
AI models without the creators' permissions. This material includes
not just publicly available text on the Internet (which is still the intellectual
property of its creators, regardless of whether it's been published online),
but also the text of pirated books. The same concern applies to artists whose
works have been used to train AI for image generation.

   Many people have concluded that any AI use is ethically wrong in
solidarity with the artists (in various mediums) whose work has been used
to train highly profitable AI models without compensation.
        OTHER ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 191

Output

AI-generated work cannot be copyrighted. If you create text, images, or
other content with generative AI, you do not have rights to that work.

Liability and Citation

An essential foundation to fields like academia and journalism is the ability
to cite sources. When authors share data or make claims, they support
those statements by sharing where or from whom they gathered that
information. This practice means that authors SHOULD rely on credible
sources, resulting in better information sharing; it also allows readers to
evaluate sources themselves and track down sources for their own research.

   AI tools taking others' words and ideas and remixing them for new
output (that frequently contains errors) means that there is no trail
of responsibility to the original source of information. Readers cannot
fact-check an information source because there isn't one there. There is
no author or organization whose reputation we can research; there is no
research methodology we can critique.

   If an AI tool produces incorrect facts - possibly with harmful
consequences for a user who doesn't know that hallucinations are even
possible - who is responsible? Is it the company who created the tool? Is it a
specific person at the company? Can they wash their hands of liability and
say "well, it's just a risk of the model"? This uncertainty has both ethical
and legal ramifications that are still unfolding.

   Note: There are ways to cite various AI tools or otherwise acknowledge
that you used AI in a project. For specific assignments, check with your
professor. One example strategy is the AI Acknowledgement tool created
by Helena Marvin, UMSL Libraries, licensed CC0.

Power

Training and running AI requires an enormous amount of power and
resources (e.g., water). This resource consumption has significant
environmental and power bill ramifications, especially for individuals who
live near AI data centers. Powering and cooling data centers has been a
concern before the recent escalation in AI use - now, it is significantly
increasing. See the video below for an example of recent conversations on
this topic here in St. Louis:

        information/?p=818#oembed-1

Privacy

Content You Share With AI

AI companies are not always forthcoming about when and how they
harvest, retain, and use personal data submitted by their users. Some tool
policies restrict what they do with user input (i.e., what you type into
the prompt bar), but they may track your activity in other ways. Once
collected, it's even more unclear about what these companies do with your
data - store it indefinitely, use your conversations for review or training, or
even sharing your information with other companies (possibly for profit).

Content You Share Online

AI is built on data scraping to extract massive amounts of data from the
Internet in order to train models. You may never know if any information
you put online has been used to train AI.

Your Other Activity

It is becoming more common for AI tools to request broad access to
features on your device(s) in order to function, including calendars, photos,
contacts, email, and more. Even if this data is stored locally on your phone
or laptop, granting a tool access allows it to essentially capture a snapshot
of your most personal information. In this way, you may never know what
data it has gathered from you or what is done with that information.
       OTHER ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS | 193

Labor

Impact on Future Employment

AI can make some jobs more efficient, but its growing capabilities may also
lead to unemployment. The Future of Jobs Global Report 2025 indicated
that 41% of companies are planning reductions in workforce as artificial
intelligence tools and models continue to expand, causing many to fear
replacement by AI and the loss of their jobs. Current sectors most at risk are
ones that lend themselves to automation, like customer service, banking,
insurance, and even transportation. Other roles that could be impacted
include factory/warehouse workers, research analysts, and computer
programmers.

   Yet in the same aforementioned report, AI was also identified as one of
the fastest-growing core skills sought out by employers. This means workers
will likely be expected to have a familiarity with and working understanding
of AI moving forward, which can box out those who have had minimal
experience with this technology. Skill divides may become even more
exacerbated, and information literacies (technology literacy, AI literacy)
will be more valuable than ever. While the future is very much uncertain,
it is clear that AI implementation and reliance will impact and shape the
labor market over the next several years.

Exploitation

Despite appearances, AI does still require human labor in order to perform
effectively, especially when it comes to training and improvement. This
industry, referred to as "crowdwork," "data labor," or "ghost work," has
boomed with the increase in AI models requiring training and testing.
People are needed to manually review, tag/label, annotate, and moderate
data, which often results in exposure to disturbing and psychologically
damaging content. In other cases, their roles involve inputting provocative
prompts and assessing bias and/or offensiveness of the model's responses.
Doing these tasks for hours a day can take an immense toll on one's mental
health, and unfortunately, most of the time these workers are contract hires
who receive minimal compensation. They do not have access to health
benefits, cannot earn enough for the resources they may need, and can
be indiscriminately fired from their jobs. These workers are considered
"invisible," as their labor is largely unacknowledged by the companies they
work for while also going unseen by consumers. When companies market
AI tools/features as if they simply work like magic, it is easy to overlook the
very real human cost.

   Related to exploitation, see also the section above on Copyright
regarding training models on content without compensating creators.
194 | OTHER ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Best Practices

  · Consider each usage of AI and whether another non-generative tool
      could be used.

  · Be conscientious of your use of AI tools.
  · Consider if your AI task is worth potentially giving up access to your

      personal information.
  · Thoroughly review the privacy or data use policy of any AI tool

      you're considering using.
  · Avoid putting any personal information (yours or anyone else's) into

      a chatbot or other AI tool.
  · Do not upload any proprietary information or work (yours or

      anyone else's) into an AI tool, especially without permission.
  · Acknowledge your use of AI.

     Key Takeaways

         · There are many ethical considerations to consider when
             choosing whether or not to use AI for a given task. These
             include potential harms for other people, yourself, and the
             environment. Some prominent topics are:

                   Copyright violations and lack of compensation
                   Liability and academic citation standards
                   Power use and environmental impacts
                   Privacy
                   Job market impacts and labor exploitation

Overview

This week, look ahead to your future as an academic researcher. As you
explore areas of interest and grow your research skills, you will encounter
specific topics and sources that you'd like to save, organize, refer back to,
and cite during your studies and possibly after you leave UMSL.

   Therefore, our final skillset to impart is citation management: the
process of organizing and referencing your sources in an efficient way.
There are multiple citation management tools out there, some free and
some that cost money. In this class, we cover Zotero, which is both robust
and free.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this week, you will be able to:

         1. Identify the purpose of citation management tools
        2. Use the Zotero software to:

                 1. Save sources to your Zotero library via a browser
                      plug-in

                 2. Organize sources in a way that makes sense to you
                      and your work

                 3. Auto-generate citations from your Zotero library
                      sources in a word processing tool like Word

This week, you also complete your final annotated
bibliography and research reflection. The goals of these assignments are
200 | ABOUT WEEK 8
to practice skills and reinforce new concepts you learned throughout this
class.

Overview

       Citation managers are software tools to help you save and
       organize sources and generate both individual citations and
       bibliographies.

Popular citation managers are EndNote, Mendeley, and Zotero. These
tools can be invaluable assets to support your research as you accumulate
helpful sources, explore diverse topics, and continue your research beyond
UMSL and UMSL Libraries.

Zotero

Zotero is a free citation manager. In the recorded workshop below (hosted
Fall 2024), your instructors Libby and Lena introduce how to install the
software on your computer, how to easily save sources to your library while
researching online, how to organize your sources, and how to connect your
Zotero library to Word to easily generate citations and bibliographies.

       Tip: Use your personal email address when signing up for a
       Zotero account. That way, you won't lose access to your
       Zotero library when you graduate and can no longer use your
       school email.
202 | GETTING STARTED WITH ZOTERO
     Activity
     Watch the recorded Intro to Zotero workshop. Follow along on
     your own device to install Zotero + the browser plugin, save

RIL Annotated Bibliography:
Assignment Overview

Students submitted a short annotated bibliography as part of the final
project for this course (alongside a research reflection). This project was
heavily scaffolded across the 8 week course. Students first selected a topic
of interest related to libraries, research, or information, then narrowed that
topic as their search process progressed. Sample topics from this semester's
students include:

  · Health misinformation on social media
  · How video game music conveys information
  · Documentation methods to preserve endangered languages
  · The impact of misinformation on Christian-Muslim relations in

      Nigeria

For their final annotated bibliography, they submitted two annotated
sources cited in APA format. For each annotation, they were asked to
summarize the source, evaluate its reliability, describe an interesting detail,
and identify possible limitations.

   Students in this entry-level course were, with some exceptions, brand
new to academic research and, in some cases, brand new to creating
citations. As part of their submissions, students selected their preferred
Creative Commons license and name format. Not all students chose to
publish their annotations.

   The annotations below are presented exactly as students submitted
them. Everyone received feedback and guidance on correcting citation
errors, misunderstandings about their chosen articles, etc. for one of their
two citations before submitting their final project. They also received
feedback after their final submission, which is not reflected in the content
below.

Goals and Lessons

Our goals in including our student bibliography as part of the published
class textbook are to (a) allow our students to participate in the scholarly
conversation through to publishing phase and (b) share our own lessons
learned as instructors. To address the frequency of AI-generated
"hallucinated" sources and misunderstandings of the chosen articles, we
206 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

plan to make significant adjustments to the future content and structure of
this class.

   Major future revisions include:

 1. Significantly more time investment in how to read and comprehend
      academic journal articles;

 2. Relocating necessary information about the limitations of AI to the
      beginning, rather than the end, of the course; and

 3. Requiring students to link to sources from the main library search or
      individual databases.

AI-Generated Sources

AI-generated sources, annotations, discussion board posts, and other
content was a significant challenge in this class. We will not be identifying
individual students who submitted AI content. In the interest of growth
for our own course and others, we want to share patterns of AI-generated
sources submitted for this assignment:

  · Accurately formatted citations. The submitted sources looked
      very real, followed APA formatting, and even included DOI links.

  · Real or realistic journal or newspaper names - for example, the
      New York Times.

  · Article titles that are very similar to, but do not exactly match,
      real sources, making it more challenging to identify whether a
      student used AI or just misread the article title in question.

As AI-generated content grows more sophisticated, ensuring students are
engaging with real sources and achieving learning outcomes grows more
challenging. We hope the revisions we mention above will provide more
support for students in future semesters.

210 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       This peer-reviewed article explains how radio became one of
       the main ways people got information in 1920s America.
       Crawford-Franklin and Robinson describe how it started as
       military and ship technology but soon became a tool for
       public communication. They note that early laws like the
       Radio Acts of 1912 and 1927 were written before lawmakers
       fully understood how radio worked, treating it more like land
       or oil than a new form of media. The authors also show how
       radio connected to education, farming, and culture farmers
       used it for market and weather reports, and schools used it
       to reach students in rural areas.

       This article explains how radio reshaped the way people
       shared and received information in 1920s America. It shows
       how radio connected to different parts of society technology,
       culture, and policy and how it transformed communication
       much like the internet does today. The authors also compare
       the radio revolution to today's digital revolution, showing
       that each generation has its own "information age."

       This source is a good choice because it was published in a
       respected academic journal and uses both primary and
       secondary research, making it trustworthy. It provides strong
       historical evidence and gives a deep understanding of how
       new communication systems can change society. It also
       offers valuable context for understanding the long-term
       impact of technology on learning, culture, and connection.

       This citation was likely generated by AI. It referenced a real
       source, but the DOI link did not lead anywhere and the
       volume/issue/page numbers were unrelated to the article in
       question. The publication year was also wrong. These errors
       were entirely off-base, rather than a result of typos. A likely
       cause is either searching for sources using an AI tool or trying
       to use AI to generate a citation for a real source.

   https://virtualtreasury.ie/archive-fever/construction-destruction

       This source is a short academic article published in 2018,
       within The Virtual Record Treasury of Ireland's "Archive
       Fever" series, edited by Dr Peter Crooks. Its primary focus is
       the construction and destruction of the Public Record Office
       of Ireland (PROI). It dives into the history of how records
       were kept before the PROI, and its significant impact on the
       way Ireland as a country kept its records past 1867. This
       article describes not only how the building itself was
       constructed, but also the architectural structure of the
       original building. This not only provides a deeper
       understanding of which records were kept in which portion
       of the office, but also what safety precautions were put in
       place to prevent fires. This aids in providing background
       knowledge as to why the fire only impacted specific offices,
       as the fire-breaks found within the building were found
212 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       effective in 1922, but worked oppositely than intended. The
       source then dives into the collection of resources found
       within the PROI, including, but not limited to: land ownership
       records, copies of wills, census records back to 1841, records
       of the Irish parliament before 1800, and records of the Chief
       Secretary's Office. Finally, it focuses on the destruction of the
       record office and the large explosion that took place in the
       Four Courts complex in the building opposite the Record
       Treasury. The ensuing fire spread to the Record Treasury and
       consumed the building, destroying a significant portion of
       the records found within. The fire, which was sparked during
       the opening battle of the Irish Civil War, created a permanent
       gap in the historical record, impacting everything from the
       study of medieval law to modern family history.

       This source is considered a reliable source because it was
       published by a state-funded initiative and is found on the
       Virtual Treasury website. The Virtual Treasury is a digital
       recreation of Ireland's Public Record Office and its lost
       collections. It was created to digitally restore and make
       accessible the historical records that were destroyed. The
       project is an online, open-access resource for researchers,
       genealogists, and the public to explore a vast digital archive
       of Irish history. A researcher would use this source if they
       were either looking into the structure of the building or
       isolating this specific event from the Irish civil war, as it
       provides a good background on the architectural history of
       the building, and it would be relevant for anyone attempting
       to research the downfall of the PROI. This source focuses
       more on the actual building itself rather than the political
                                FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 213

       tension that caused the conflict, unlike The Origins and
       Development of the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland,
       1922-1948. Some limitations to this source naturally include a
       lack of perspective from the political front (as this was a
       significant factor in the destruction), and may provide a
       limited perspective due to the article being released on the
       website that acts as a digital recreation of the PROI. One
       fascinating detail is the introduction to figures that
       influenced the PROI, such as Sir Samuel Ferguson, as it
       provides a more human aspect of the destruction, showing
       that real people were involved and were impacted.

       This is a journal article by Demartini, Mizzaro and Spina
       (2020) tells the reader the concept of human-in-the-loop
       artificial intelligence as a method to crack down on the
       misinformation on the internet. These authors propose a
       system where an AI model captures possible misinformation,
       crowd workers label the misleading info, and experts verify
       what the results should be. In the journal article they tell the
       readers some of the major challenges like data bias and
214 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       limited expert availability for their model. They also argue
       that adding human judgment with AI automation can
       improve accuracy and the reliability when filtering the
       misinformation online.

       I say this source is reliable because it's an article that's been
       peer reviewed in a well-respected technical journal which is
       The Bulletin of the IEEE Computer Society Technical
       Committee on Data Engineering. This tells us the research is
       original, and it provides us with solutions that takes both
       computer science and human behavior into consideration.
       This resource would be helpful for someone whose studying
       misinformation or AI ethics because this journal article
       demonstrates a balanced and hybrid approach to decrease
       the amount of misinformation that spreads because of AI.
       One detail that stood out to me that I thought was
       interesting was how the authors imagined using "crowd
       workers" as a layer of security between AI and experts which
       could make fact checking for AI a powerful source for
       overcoming misinformation. The author did mention things
       that could hold the model back like human bias but still the
       model remains a valuable source for combating artificial
       intelligent's spread of misinformation.

       This article focuses on how one can take the correct
       measures into tackling fake news. The study uses survey
       data from U.S. respondents to conclude on how individuals
       who are more literate in recognizing fake news are more
       likely to take corrective actions. The authors point out that
       being familiar with news media does not necessarily
       translate to corrective action -- you need to have specific
       literacy about misinformation. I find this source to be credible
       in that it appears to be in a peer-reviewed journal, provides
       empirical evidence, and expands its methodology and
       definitions.
       This source would be used by a researcher since it is a build
216 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       on the first source by touching on the individual behavioral
       side of misinformation. One nugget that I found interesting:
       in accordance with the research, people's need for cognition
       crosses with fake-news literacy -- so that two people might
       know equally as much about fake news literacy, but the one
       who tends to think harder about what they read will be more
       likely to act.

       This is a peer-reviewed academic journal article. This article
                         FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 217

discusses that although AI does possess an added benefit to
the nursing practice, it cannot fully replace the human aspect
of nursing. Some of the benefits AI can give the nursing
profession are a relief from burnout and turnover rates due
to some of the burden being taken on by streamlined
communication, improvement in medical treatment, getting
diagnoses, prognosis, and treatment plans faster, aiding in
research, and reduction of costs. AI, in collaboration with the
nursing profession, can ease some of the pressures placed on
nurses to provide quality care while dealing with increased
responsibilities due to the shift in nursing practice. This
article gives us a different perspective on nursing care from
someone in another country (Korea); the general underlying
values of nursing are still the same care and compassion,
which comes from the human side and is something AI
cannot give.

I believe this is a reliable source due to its being peer-
reviewed and published in the Women's Health Nursing
journal, and it has evidence of research being used to support
her position. A researcher would use this source to explore a
cross-cultural understanding of nursing and AI since the
writer is talking about nursing and Korea; however, the
fundamentals of nursing care and practices are generally the
same everywhere, with the focus being on the patient. There
is a limitation to the source as it is opinion-based. One thing
that I found interesting is the ethical issue of collaborating AI
with nursing, how the article even suggests that AI lacks the
capacity to embrace the nursing philosophy that is grounded
218 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

in human dignity, and cannot be held accountable for its
actions.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/misinformation-

ai-twitter-facebook-guide/

This article is a popular-press piece (a major newspaper
article) from The Washington Post that explains how
misinformation and conspiracy theories spread on social
media and offers practical strategies for everyday users to
show and resist them. It covers why misinformation exists,
how emotional reactions like outrage play a role, and how
platforms' design (like algorithms and engagement metrics)
help false material spread unchecked. The article is reliable
because it comes from a well-established, reputable national
newspaper with editorial review and uses research findings
and expert commentary to support its claims. A researcher
would find this source useful because it offers a current,
universally accessible overview of how misinformation
changes the public, complementing scholarly literature by
showing how the issue plays out in real-world settings. One
limitation is that it does not go deeply into academic method
or complex statistical analysis--its aim is public education
rather than academic rigor. A particularly interesting detail I
                                FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 219

       learned is the advice to "slow down before you share" on
       social media, because instantaneous sharing is one of the
       major enablers of viral false claims.

   Scoping review. Journal of Medical Internet Research, 26,
   https://doi.org/10.2196/56931

       This source is a peer-reviewed journal that analyzes how
       misinformation spreads during the outbreak of the COVID-19
       pandemic as well as how this misinformation influenced and
       impacted the public health sector. In the journal, the authors
       describe the spread of information as an infodemic and
       emphasizes how it is misinformation can spread quickly. It
       also mentions that upon research social media was found to
       have played a big role in how misinformation about the virus
       spread.

       The journal also addresses and clarifies some of the most
       common myths about the virus that people have put out on
       the internet. Some of these myths include fake cures and
       vaccines as well as where the virus originates from.

       I believe that this source is reliable since it is peer-reviewed
       as well as published by a reputable institution. One
       interesting detail I found out was that misinformation can
220 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       cause people to become extremely anxious. This anxiety may
       prevent persons from getting vaccines or obeying other
       medical protocols like wearing masks.

       This is a peer-reviewed journal article that analzes how
       exactly people interacted on social media as it relates to
       tweets about the COVID-19 pandemic. These tweets included
       both true and false information (misinformation) about the
       virus which the authors of the article took time to study the
       reason behind why people interacted with them whether
       that be liking or reposting/sharing.

       While studying, they realized that tweets or posts that had
       more emotion to them were often shared more than the
       ones with no emotion attached. These emotional posts or
       tweets were often ones that had an angry or frigtened
       undertone. What I understood was that tweets and posts
       are more likely to be shared whenever high emotions are
       involved, therefore increasing the spread of misinformation.

       I believe that this source is reliable because, like the first
       source, it is peer-reviewed as well as published by a
                                FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 221

       reputable institution. One interesting detail I found out from
       this article was that it may not be the actual misinformation
       that is being spread but it may be how exactly that
       information is shared. What I mean is that if misinformation
       has an emotional undertone, it is more likely to be spread
       than misinformation with a formal undertone due to the
       appeal to emotions whether through fear or anger. One
       limitation for this source is that it only focuses on one social
       media platform, Twitter.

       This scholarly article is a systematic review that examines
       how academic research on public health and social media
       misinformation has developed from 2000 to 2023. The
       authors use a method called main path analysis to trace key
       studies and show how knowledge in this area has grown.
       They found that misinformation on social media can strongly
       affect people's health decisions and shape public health
       policies. The article also explains how false information
       spreads quickly online and how it can lead to confusion and
       mistrust among the public.

       This source is reliable because it was published in Current

       because it provides a clear overview of how misinformation
       studies have evolved and connects social media behavior to
       real-world health impacts. One limitation is that it reviews
       existing studies rather than collecting new data. An
       interesting detail I learned is that misinformation on social
       media can leave lasting effects on public attitudes toward
       health advice, even after the false claims are corrected.

   educsci13070688

       The second source I chose is also a peer-reviewed article. It
       focuses on the ongoing conflict in Nigeria surrounding
       Muslim students who wear hijabs in Christian-named
       government schools. The authors used a qualitative case
       study and interviewed both parents and teachers to
       understand how they view the issue. They found that most
       participants were against the use of hijabs in these schools,
       claiming that it disrupts the school's Christian identity and
       unity. The study also highlights how these tensions can grow
                                FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 223

       into larger religious conflicts if they aren't addressed. The
       authors recommend that school leaders and government
       officials hold open discussions with all parties involved and
       create policies that respect religious diversity while
       maintaining peace and inclusivity in schools.

       This source connects to my topic on misinformation and
       Muslim-Christian relations in Nigeria because it shows how
       misunderstanding and biased narratives can lead to mistrust
       between groups. Even though this particular conflict is
       centered around school dress codes, lots of the tension
       comes from assumptions and misinformation about each
       religion's intentions. I believe the source is reliable because
       it's published in a peer-reviewed academic journal and based
       on direct interviews. A researcher might find it useful
       because it provides insight into how misinformation and lack
       of communication can shape real-world conflicts. I also chose
       the source because as opposed to the first one, it highlights
       the positives and focuses on solutions to the tensions. This
       source also brings in the feedback from those who are
       actually affected by the religious conflicts in schools. One
       thing I found interesting was how something as simple as a
       school's name can carry such deep religious meaning and
       create strong divisions within a community.

       This source is a peer-reviewed research article published in
       2019, focused on the origins and development of the Public
       Record Office of Northern Ireland, and is classified as a
       secondary source. This article discusses the destruction of
       Ireland's Public Record Office during the Irish Civil War, the
       subsequent separation of the Isle of Ireland into Northern
       Ireland and Éire, the tension between the PROI and PRONI,
       and the efforts put forth to create a new Public Record Office
       in Northern Ireland to re-establish the history that was lost
       in the fire. One detail I found particularly fascinating was the
       communication between Northern Irish scholars and Irish
       scholars after the civil war, and the dedication that PROI and
       PRONI scholars showed in sharing condolences and
       preserving records, even in the face of high political tensions.
       It proved that people's passions for history and preservation
       can extend beyond personal political beliefs.

       This source is considered a reliable source because it was
       published in a scientific journal alongside a series of articles
       and is peer-reviewed, meaning that other scholars have
       verified its content to some extent. It also contains a list of all
       the sources used to compile this section of the journal,
       demonstrating that ample research has been conducted in its
       compilation. A researcher would likely use this source if they
       were specifically studying Ireland and Northern Ireland's
       history of record-keeping after the 1922 Four Courts Fire, as
       compared to a few of the other sources found that related to
       record-keeping in Ireland but in later time periods. Some
       limitations of this source include its publication date, as it
       discusses Northern Ireland's response to the destruction of
                                FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 225

       resources, but lacks research on the newer efforts made in
       2022 to recover artifacts lost in the fire. Having a resource
       that explains both the history of record-keeping and more
       recent recovery efforts would provide a more well-rounded
       source to draw from, rather than having to consult multiple
       sources for information about the period from 1922 to 1948
       and from 1948 to the present day.

       This article is a peer-reviewed journal article that presents
226 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       the creation and development of the Pangloss Collection, a
       digital archive hosted by the french research group LACITO in
       the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS). The
       archive acts to preserve and provide open access to audio
       recordings, transcriptions, and annotations of endangered
       and under-documented languages from around the world.
       The authors describe how the collection combines linguistic
       research and language documentation, providing details
       about its technical structure, metadata standards, and long-
       term digital preservation strategies. The article also
       emphasizes the breadth of its geographic range in terms of
       languages and accessibility for both academic researchers
       and language-speaking communities, and comments on its
       diverse language range from Asia, Oceania, Europe, Africa,
       and the Americas.

       This article is credible because it was published in a peer-
       reviewed academic journal and was written by linguists who
       are affiliated with CNRS and other prominent institutions.
       This reference could be of use to researchers because it ties
       linguistic theory to the emerging practices of modern
       technology, demonstrating how contemporary digital
       technologies can be applied to documentation and archiving.
       One drawback is that it focuses fairly heavily on the
       technological framework, rather than upon cultural
       revitalization components of language preservation. I was
       particularly intrigued by the fact that the Pangloss Collection
       supports speaker communities by providing access to and

       The second source is a YouTube video. The main points of the
       video are that music in video games is used to tell the player
       of various important events when music is presented and
       how music must accommodate the game's world to convey
       that information. The reason this is a reliable source is
       because of both the creators of the video and the presenters'
       examples. The creators are Nintendo Life, a news website
       source of Nintendo-related content that was founded in
       2005. Over the years, they have produced 75,000 articles, as
       mentioned on their about page. In addition, the video was
       made last year, making the information relevant.
       The examples in the video tie to why researchers should
228 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       consider this a good source, as it provides visual examples of
       how music is providing information to the player while also
       working with the game's world to achieve it. However, there
       are limitations as it is non-scholarly; thus, there is no peer-
       reviewed material, and it recites facts. But despite that, the
       information recited is improved through the use of visual
       representation of those facts. A personal example I can think
       of relating to the video is the song "Blood Feuds, Ancient and
       Modern" from the game Red Dead Redemption 2. Set in the
       wild west of 1899, the song plays during a mission of the
       same name where an outlaw group must rescue a kidnapped
       member. The music that plays over the mission tells the
       players of the stakes involved and emotions that the group is
       feeling that culminates to a shootout with the kidnappers.

   https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1806781116

       This article is a scholarly source that is peer-reviewed and
       published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
       Sciences. The authors conducted two large-scale
       experiments testing whether crowdsourced ratings of news
       sources could be used to separate trustworthy outlets from
       fake ones. Participants rated news sources for familiarity and
                                FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 229

       trustworthiness, and their ratings closely matched
       professional fact-checker scores. The results showed that
       most people could identify credible outlets, and the authors
       suggest that social media platforms could use this kind of
       data to reduce misinformation.

       I view this as a reliable source because it's published in a
       respected journal and uses large groups of participants for
       testing. A researcher would use it because it doesn't just
       describe the problem of misinformation it offers a possible
       solution. One limitation is that people gave better ratings
       when they already knew the source, which could make it
       harder to judge smaller or new outlets. I found it interesting
       that, even with political differences, participants still agreed
       on which outlets were credible, showing that people can
       recognize trustworthy news across different viewpoints.

       This journal article by Pilati and Venturini (2025) tells the

       disinformation by a model in which it maps online networks
       of organizations or programs that use AI for this purpose.
230 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       The author shows the reader how different regions approach
       the problem and how they use AI to stop false spread of
       information.

       In the journal article they tell us that European regions focus
       on preventing misinformation before it starts to spread
       which they call this upstream strategy. In the us they detect
       false information after it appears, and they identify this as
       downstream strategy. The journal article points out the
       issues of being bias, censorship and the lack of
       representation from nations in the global south.

       This source is reliable because it has been peer reviewed and
       published in Frontier in Political Science which is a well-
       known academic journal. This source uses real data and
       research methods to tell us how AI is added in real lifetime to
       show the spread of misinformation. Researchers can use this
       journal article if they are studying how different regions of
       the world use AI or how they try to stop the spread of
       misinformation. An interesting detail I found was the
       difference between upstream and downstream strategies
       which tells me different regions use different ways to combat
       AI misinformation. The study mentions how they might miss
       smaller or offline projects as a downside, but it does give us
       the readers an overview of how the world deals with AI
       misinformation.

fanaticism in Nigeria. Informology, 4(1), 41-56.
https://informology.org/2025/v4n1/a47.pdf

    This source is a peer-reviewed article that examines how
    social media has affected the relationship between Christians
    and Muslims in Nigeria. The authors argue that platforms like
    Facebook and Twitter make it easier for misinformation, hate
    speech, and propaganda to spread. One of the main points is
    that misinformation spreads faster and more widely on social
    media because of the way algorithms amplify emotional and
    divisive content. They explain how this kind of content often
    goes "viral" online and creates more division between
    religious groups in real life. One thing I found interesting was
    that the authors said young people are the most affected,
    since they use social media more than older generations.

    I believe this source is reliable because it was published in
    Informology, an academic journal, and is written by
    researchers who use case studies and content analysis to
    back up their claims. A researcher would use this article over
    other sources because it directly connects misinformation,
    religion, and Nigerian society. Out of the sources I came
    across, this one fits my topic best because it connects
    misinformation directly with Muslim-Christian relations in
    Nigeria. A limitation, however, is that it focuses mainly on
    social media and does not go as deeply into misinformation
    from traditional sources like radio or newspapers. Still, it
    provides a strong foundation for understanding how online
    misinformation worsens Muslim-Christian relations in Nigeria
    and will help me highlight the impact of digital platforms in
    my research.

       This peer reviewed article explores how misinformation
       about urinary tract infections (UTIs) spreads on Instagram.
       The authors analyzed 1,200 posts to see how accurate they
       were and who were sharing them. They found that many
       posts came from non medical influencers or personal
       accounts, and that posts with emotional and visually striking
       content got more views than factual posts. This study
       suggests that Instagram can influence how people
       understand and manage their own health, sometimes
       leading to incorrect treatment.

       This source is reliable because it is published in Urology
       Research & Practice, a respected medical journal, and uses a
       structured analysis method. Researchers would use it
       because it provides real and true examples of health
       misinformation on social media and shows how users
       respond to different types of content. One limitation is that it
               FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 233

only focuses on UTIs, so it may not help with other health
topics. An interesting point is that posts with emotional
appeals or "miracle cures" gained the most attention,
showing how social media engagement often favors
sensational content over accurate information.

The first source I chose was a section in a chapter from the
book Writing interactive music for video games: A
composer's guide, by author Michael Sweet. The chapter's
234 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       name is The language of music storytelling in games, and the
       section is called Exploring Music Function. In that section, it
       discusses how music is used to immerse the player into the
       game and communicate with them about events. An
       example, "Introduce Character," they discussed how when
       players meet a new character appearing on screen, that
       character's theme should be played to inform the player of
       whether they are a friend or foe. The reason I know this is a
       reliable source is that the author has experience in video
       game composing. On the Berklee College of Music website, it
       is stated that Michael Sweet is an audio composer who has
       worked on 100 award-winning video games, earning him
       awards such as the Best Audio Award at the Independent
       Games Festival.

       Researchers should consider this source as it provides a
       composer's view on how video game music is structured to
       inform the player of various events and how to make them
       feel engaged with the material. There are some limitations to
       this source, as the book was released in 2015, and the study
       of video game music has since improved, rendering it
       somewhat outdated. In addition, it was not peer-reviewed,
       so the book's information was from the author
       himself. However, despite being considered outdated, the
       information still holds up to modern times. An interesting
       detail I learned was that when reading through it, I was able
       to correlate the information to video games that I have
       played or seen. An example was "Introduce Character," and I
       remembered the theme of the villain of Odin from the game
       God of War: Ragnarök.

   Urgency, challenges, possibilities. Lexicography, 11(2), 145-180.
   https://doi.org/10.3138/lexi.27796

       This is a peer-reviewed scholarly academic journal article on
       the role of lexicography, the study and practice of dictionary
       compilation, in the documentation of endangered languages.
       The author, Van den Berg, calls for urgent documentation of
       endangered languages in an age of global language
       endangerment and extinction, particularly focusing on Asia.
       The author also discusses additional related issues in
       documentation, including community identity and resources,
       linguistic resources, linguist engagement, and balancing
236 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       description and accessibility of dictionaries. Van den Berg
       discusses practical tools such as dictionary development and
       collaboration as two necessary tools of effective language
       documentation.

       This source is credible because it was published in a peer-
       reviewed academic journal and authored by a linguist
       specializing in lexicography. As a researcher, one might select
       this article because it discusses both theoretical perspectives
       and real-life documentation practices, providing a critical
       summary and usable methods. One shortcoming is that the
       article focuses predominantly on lexicographic approaches,
       and it is difficult to discern how it relates to some of the
       broader technological innovations and sociocultural elements
       of preservation. Interestingly, I learned that dictionary
       projects, created with community input, can function as
       cultural commodities, rather than purely linguistic records,
       while also fostering and supporting identity.

       This is a peer-reviewed journal article. This article discusses
       how collaborating AI with Nursing, particularly in mental
                        FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES | 237

health, can be beneficial in some respects, as well as cause
ethical issues in others. When looking at AI and Nursing,
some of the ways it can be beneficial to the practice: early
diagnosis, intervention, and care through the analysis of
large datasets, automating routine tasks, and creating
personalized treatment plans, which all help with the
reduction of a nurse's workload. While there are still ethical
considerations to be considered when using AI. I recently
looked at another peer-reviewed journal article that explored
artificial intelligence and whether it is trustworthy or reliable
due to the human aspect and core values of nursing, such as
autonomy, dignity, integrity, and vulnerability, being replaced
by AI. Both articles believe that due to the evolution of
nursing and AI they can complement each other but not
completely replace the core values of nursing.

I believe that this is a reliable source due to it being published
in a peer-reviewed academic journal. I used the SIFT method.
A researcher would use this source to get a different
perspective of nursing (mental health) that one would not
normally think AI could benefit the practice with, due to the
relationship aspect of this part of nursing. AI is not going
anywhere, and it's only becoming more and more popular.
Therefore, as nursing practices change and the demands
placed on nursing, something has to change, and
incorporating AI into nursing without taking away the
humanness can be beneficial to not just the practice but the
patient as well. The more research/ evidence done on this
topic, the more acceptable AI will become in nursing. A
limitation of this article is that it discusses AI in the mental
health area of nursing instead of all aspects of nursing/
238 | FALL 2025 STUDENT BIBLIOGRAPHIES

       healthcare. I found this information useful in how using AI
       can result in a faster diagnosis for a patient, which will allow
       nurses more time to focus on what they are actually treating
       the patient for, and not waiting on a diagnosis for weeks or
       months without proper care.
