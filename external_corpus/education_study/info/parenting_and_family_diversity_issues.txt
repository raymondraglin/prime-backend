KEY CONCEPTS

Introduction

Parenting, child-rearing, care-giving, and parenting education are key concepts that can impact child
outcomes. Therefore, it is imperative to provide definitions of each concept before learning about
"parenting." I invite you to critically think about each concept and analyze how the information
within this book can be applied to each of these words.

Parenting is a process of raising, promoting, and
supporting the physical, emotional, social, and
cognitive development of a child to adulthood and
across the lifespan. 1

Child-rearing is oftentimes defined interchangeably
with parenting. However, there are many non-
parental figures (e.g., society, day care providers,
teachers, governments) who offer similar types of
care without being a child's legal "parent." 2

Care-giving is the act of assuming the main           Figure 1. A family celebrating graduation.
responsibilities for someone who cannot provide all
basic needs for oneself. Examples might include a
parent, day care provider, trained professional, or
family member. 3

Parenting education is a process that can help caregivers (and prospective caregivers) understand
how to provide developmentally-appropriate care in a safe, loving, nurturing, and stable
environment that contributes to a child's positive health and well-being. Successful parenting
education provides participants with individualized, culturally-relevant knowledge, resources,
strategies, tools, networking support, and guidance regarding best-practice approaches to child-
rearing. The goals of parenting education include caregivers learning and implementing this

  information to facilitate a child's long-term, positive, emotional, social, physical, and cognitive
  development. 4

  Research continually shows that parenting practices can influence a child's social, emotional, and
  intellectual development, especially during the early years.5 Studies also demonstrate that parenting
  practices can impact a child's behavioral health, ability to focus (attention), and enhanced sense of
  security. 6

  Further, parenting processes and outcomes can be influenced by factors such as personality, biology,
  temperament, and the unique experiences of a parent and a child. Therefore, these processes should
  be examined within the contexts of social, economic, historical, and psychological factors related to
  individuals, families, communities, and cultures. 7

  Across the world, a variety of definitions exist for many topics concerning "parenting" and "family."
  For instance, the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence recommends that "family" be
  defined on culturally-sensitive and case-by-case bases by giving consideration to the personal ties
  between the persons concerned.8

  Further, it is fairly-well agreed upon that those who work with children and families embrace,
  respect, and understand that subjective definitions of these concepts (a) exist within and between
  individuals, cultures, and organizations (e.g., UNICEF, U.S. Census Bureau, etc.), (b) can change over
  time, and (c) are based on personal experiences, views, values, beliefs, historical time and place,
  culture, etc.9

                               Throughout this entire book, it should be assumed that

                                        the following terms are defined as follows:

 INFLUENCES ON PARENTING

     Diana Lang and Marissa L. Diener

  Parenting is a complex process in which parents and children both impact one another. There are
  many reasons that parents behave the way they do. The multiple influences on parenting are still
  being explored. Proposed influences on parental behavior include:

   1. parent characteristics,
   2. child characteristics, and
   3. contextual and sociocultural characteristics.1 2

 Parent Characteristics

  Parents bring unique traits and qualities to the parenting relationship that affect their decisions as
  parents. These characteristics include a parent's age, gender identity, personality, developmental
  history, beliefs, knowledge about parenting and child development, and mental and physical health.
  Parents' personalities also affect parenting behaviors. Parents who are more agreeable,
  conscientious, and outgoing are warmer and provide more structure to their children. Parents who
  are more agreeable, less anxious, and less negative also support their children's autonomy more than
  parents who are anxious and less agreeable.3 Parents who have these personality traits appear to be
  better able to respond to their children positively and provide a more consistent, structured
  environment for their children.

  Parents' developmental histories, or their experiences as children, can also affect their parenting
  strategies. Parents may learn parenting practices from their own parents. Fathers whose own
  parents provided monitoring, consistent and age-appropriate discipline, and warmth are more likely
  to provide this constructive parenting to their own children.4 Patterns of negative parenting and
  ineffective discipline also appear from one generation to the next. However, parents who are

dissatisfied with their primary caregivers' approach may be more likely to change their parenting
methods when they have children.

Child Characteristics

Parenting is bidirectional. Not only do parents and

caregivers affect their children, but children

influence their parents/primary caregivers as well.5

Child characteristics, such as gender identity, birth

order, temperament, and health status, can affect

child-rearing behaviors and roles. For example, an

infant with an easy temperament may enable

caregivers to feel more effective, as they are easily

able to soothe the child and elicit smiling and

cooing. On the other hand, a cranky or fussy infant

can elicit fewer positive reactions from caregivers

and may result in parents feeling less effective in the

role.6 Over time, parents of more difficult children

may become more punitive and less patient with           Figure 1. A child with a difficult temperament can
their children.7 8 Many parents who have a fussy,
difficult child have been found to be less satisfied     have a significant impact on a parent. (Photo

with their relationships and have greater challenges

in balancing work and family roles.9 Thus, child temperament is one of the child characteristics that

influences how caregivers behave with their children.

Another child characteristic is the child's gender identity. Some parents assign different household
chores to their children based on their child's gender identity. For example, older research has
shown girls are more often responsible for caring for younger siblings and household chores,
whereas boys are more likely to be asked to perform chores outside the home, such as mowing the

   lawn.10 Research has also demonstrated that some parents talk differently with their children based
   on their child's gender identity, such as providing more scientific explanations to their sons and
   using more emotion words with their daughters.11

  Contextual Factors and Sociocultural Characteristics

   The parent-child relationship does not occur in isolation. Sociocultural characteristics, including
   economic hardship, religion, politics, neighborhoods, schools, and social support, can also influence
   parenting. Parents who experience economic hardship tend to be more easily frustrated, depressed,
   and sad, and these emotional characteristics can affect their parenting skills.12 Culture can also
   impact parenting behaviors in fundamental ways. Although promoting the development of skills
   necessary to function effectively in one's community, to the best of one's abilities, is a universal goal
   of parenting, the specific skills necessary vary widely from culture to culture. Thus, parents have
   different goals for their children that partially depend on their culture.13 For example, parents vary
   in how much they emphasize goals for independence and individual achievements and goals
   involving maintaining harmonious relationships and being embedded in a strong network of social
   relationships.

    Figure 2. Influences on parenting can stem from internal factors such as the parent or child's characteristics or
    external, sociocultural characteristics.

   These differences in parental goals can also be influenced by culture and immigration status. Other
   important contextual characteristics, such as the neighborhood, school, and social networks, can
   affect parenting, even though these settings do not always include both the child and the parent.14
   For example, Latina mothers who perceived their neighborhood as more dangerous showed less
   warmth with their children, perhaps because of the greater stress associated with living in a
   threatening environment.15

   spectrum of environments and diverse communities. Caregivers who consistently engage in high
   responsiveness and appropriate demandingness with children are linked to more "quality" outcomes
   for youth.
   The interaction among all these factors creates many different patterns of parenting behaviors. For
   instance, parenting influences a child's development as well as the development of the parent or
   primary caregiver. And, as parents face new challenges, they change their parenting strategies and
   construct new aspects of their identities. Furthermore, the goals and tasks of parents may change
   over time as their children develop.16 17 However, the next page outlines typical parenting tasks,

Despite contextual factors and varied goals associated with parenting, roles and responsibilities of
parenthood are derived from national and international laws, policies, research, and practice. Below
are well-agreed upon fundamental tasks of parenthood 1 that extend across many cultures:

· Safety and sustenance: ensuring adequate food,

housing, clothing, medical care, and protection

from harm in a multitude of contexts (e.g.,

neighborhood, household structure)

· Socioemotional support: providing warm and

positive responsivity, affection, communication,

expectations, affirmations, encouragement,

emotional regulation, guidance, discipline, and

modeling of appropriate behaviors

· Stimulation/instruction: encouraging

achievement and learning through exposure to

developmentally-appropriate and culturally-

THE PRIMARY ROLE OF FAMILIES IN
PROMOTING CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT

   Diana Lang

The family is central in children's lives because it is through experiences with their families that
children learn about themselves and the world around them. "Family member" is used here to define
the people who are primarily responsible for a child, including parents, extended family members,
guardians, and foster families. Family structures, processes, and functions must be assessed in order
to understand the role family members have in child outcomes.1

Family Structures                            "Family structures" delineate household members
                                             who are related by blood or legal ties; this concept

                                             foster care, and children living in institutionalized
                                             settings), blended families, single-parent plus partner
                                             families (cohabiting couples, for example),
                                             multigenerational families, binuclear families, and
                                             adoptive families.

                                             The U.S. Census Bureau utilizes these definitions of

· Nuclear family: a child lives with two married biologically-related parents and with only full
   siblings, if siblings are present.

· Cohabiting families: a child's parent lives with at least one opposite-sex, non-related adult.
   This additional adult may or may not be the biological parent of the child.

· Same-sex cohabiting/married families: a child's parent lives with at least one same-sex, non-

   related adult. The additional adult may or may not be the biological parent of the child.
· Stepfamilies and blended families (terms used interchangeably): children who live in a

   household formed through remarriage resulting in children living with one or no biologically-
   related parents. The presence of a stepparent, stepsibling, or half-sibling designates a family as
   blended.2

Family Processes

"Family processes" are the ways in which families internally function to navigate cognitive, social,
and emotional events. Examples include how families adapt, communicate, cope, problem solve,
parent, rear children, make decisions, plan, and lead. 3

Family Functions

Many "family functions" are similar to parenting tasks, goals, and
responsibilities. However, it is important to understand how
"family functions" and parenting tasks impact each other. The
following is a list of somewhat universal family functions (e.g.,
almost all families in all countries worldwide have some of these in
common):

· Economic support: providing basic needs, such as food,

shelter, clothing, etc.

· Emotional support: providing love, comfort, intimacy,

companionship, nurturing, belongingness, etc.

· Socialization of children: rearing children, parenting, helping     Figure 2. This infant getting

 THE PRIMARY ROLE OF COMMUNITIES IN
 PROMOTING CHILDREN'S AND FAMILIES'
 DEVELOPMENT: EVIDENCE-BASED,
 BEST-PRACTICE RECOMMENDATIONS

     Diana Lang

  Many caregivers seek or need information, education, and/or assistance in rearing children. "It takes
  a village" is a common mantra used in relation to parenting and child-rearing. This means that
  entire communities of people help shape children's development and can foster safe, healthy
  environments and positive child outcomes. Programs, educational institutions, community
  organizations, and those who work with children and families can also support children's healthy
  growth and development within the family by creating continuity between primary caregivers and
  the "village." For optimal outcomes, it is important for all members of the "village" to find, assess,
  analyze, and implement high-quality, up-to-date, evidence-based, best-practice recommendations to
  strengthen children and families.
  Evidence-based parenting programs and practices are those that are supported and well-
  documented by up-to-date scientific research. Key indicators must demonstrate that practices have
  strengthened families, prevented youth and/or family problems, and/or promoted family and child
  well-being via validated research studies.1 Read this PDF: Family Engagement Best-Practice Tips for

PARENTING THEORY
1600S: AUTOCRATIC PARENTING

   Diana Lang

Autocratic Parenting and Thomas Hobbes

Thomas Hobbes, 1588-1679, contributed to the era of
autocratic parenting due to his views regarding human
motivation, Psychological Egoism, and the social
contract.1 According to Hobbes, humans are extremely
self-interested and born with original sin.

Hence, adults had to use control and discipline because
children were born "evil" and had to be saved. Further, as a
result of adults' own self-interests, Hobbes believed that
absolute authority was a necessity in politics, in dealing
with others, and in the home.2

During this era, many believed that children learned
obedience to God via their parents' use of harsh discipline
and strict parenting. Children were typically viewed as
being "willful" and were used as household servants.

Key Takeaways

· Babies were born with original sin and were very egocentric.
· Parents were to direct children away from their evil tendencies.
· Similar to the current authoritarian approach.
· Recommended that rigid and strict rules be used to shape children into well-behaved, successful

   adults.
EARLY 1800S: ROUSSEAU

   Diana Lang

Jacques Rousseau and Childlike Innocence

During the eighteenth century, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's views started to
change parenting practices. Rousseau contended that children were
inherently innocent (not sinful, as Hobbes believed), weak, and easily
tempted. He believed that humans were born pure until one's interactions
with the environment caused negative effects on one's development.1
Rousseau also believed that children needed protection from child labor
and negative influences within civilization.

Rousseau's work is credited as being the first developmental account of
childhood via his emphasis on maturation and stages of development:2

· Childhood (0 to 12 years): children are guided by simple impulses and   Figure 1. Photo of a
   simply react to their surroundings.                                    painting by Bouguereau:
                                                                          "L'Innocence"
· Pre-Adolescence (12 to 16 years): children begin to develop reason
   and are able to comprehend more abstract ideas.

· Puberty and Adulthood (16 years and onward): children develop into
   adults that can navigate society and its moral issues.

These stages elicited guidelines outlining "developmentally-appropriate" practices in parenting and
education. Rousseau's work also emphasized the importance of play and teaching within the early
years of childhood education:3

"When the child flies a kite he is training eye and hand to accuracy; when he whips a top, he is
increasing his strength by using it, but without learning anything. I have sometimes asked why
children are not given the same games of skill as men; tennis, mall, billiards, archery, football, and
musical instruments. I was told that some of these are beyond their strength, that the child's senses are
not sufficiently developed for others. These do not strike me as valid reasons; a child is not as tall as a

  in his little hand; but let him play in a room whose windows have been protected; at first let him only
  use soft balls, let his first racquets be of wood, then of parchment, and lastly of gut, according to his
  progress."

Key Takeaways

     · Children were born innocent and exposure to certain circumstances resulted in them acting

teach children (otherwise known as "pedagogy").
This work made significant contributions to the
study of, and improvements within, parenting and
educational practices.

Hall believed that a child's nature should guide educational practices so children could become
healthy, productive members of society. Overall, Hall's in-person presentations started the
movement for the U.S. to integrate psychological and scientific studies within educational
endeavors.2

Key Takeaways

· One of the first psychologists to be known as an educational expert.
· Developed "pedagogy" (how to "best" teach for optimal learning).
· A child's nature should guide educational practices in order to become a healthy, productive

   member of society.

Maria Montessori: The Montessori Method

Maria Montessori scientifically observed and
measured the behaviors of young children which
resulted in her development of The Montessori
Method-an educational teaching method and
philosophy. According to Montessori, a child's mind
is quickly developing within the first six years of life
("the absorbent mind") whereby a child takes in as
much as possible from one's environment.1

Key hallmarks of The Montessori Method include

self-directed, hands-on experiential learning,

collaborative play, and freedom of movement and           Figure 1. This child in a Montessori classroom is

offering developmentally-appropriate activities that

promote individualized learning to optimize children's physical, cognitive, social, and emotional

development.

Children work at their own pace and engage in free choice activities within clear, firm, reasonable,
and developmentally-appropriate boundaries established by trained teachers. Montessori's research
deduced that these practices stimulate deeper learning experiences, independent thinking, problem-
solving, creativity, confidence, and lifelong enthusiasm for learning.

Watson: Behaviorism

John B. Watson was an influential American psychologist whose most famous work occurred during
the early 20th century at Johns Hopkins University. Watson conducted research on animal behavior,
child-rearing, and advertising. Along with this research, he conducted the controversial "Little
Albert" study.1

Watson believed that an objective analysis of the
mind was impossible; therefore, he preferred to
focus directly on observable behavior and attempted
to modify it. Watson was a major proponent in
shifting the focus of psychology from the mind to
behavior, and this approach of observing and
controlling behavior came to be known as
behaviorism. A major object of study by
behaviorists was learned behavior and its interaction
with the inborn qualities of the organism.

Behaviorism commonly used animals in experiments       Figure 1. A photograph of John Watson
under the assumption that what was learned using
animal models could, to some degree, be applied to
human behavior. This famous quote from Watson
explains his contentions:2

"Give me a dozen healthy infants, well-formed, and my own specified world to bring them up in and I'll
guarantee to take any one at random and train him to become any type of specialist I might select -
doctor, lawyer, artist, merchant-chief and, yes, even beggar-man and thief, regardless of his talents,
penchants, tendencies, abilities, vocations, and race of his ancestors. I am going beyond my facts and I
admit it, but so have the advocates of the contrary and they have been doing it for many thousands of
years."

Watson believed that children should be treated as young adults. In his book, he warned against the

  inevitable dangers of a mother providing too much love and affection. Watson's slogan was `not
  more babies but better brought up babies'. Watson argued for the nurture side of the nature-nurture
  debate and contended that everything is built into a child through their interactions with their
  environment.
  Thus, according to Watson, parents and caregivers hold complete responsibility for their children's
  actions since they choose the environment into which their child is reared.3 Based on the results
  from his "Little Albert" study, Watson concluded that caregivers can shape a child's behavior and
  development simply by taking control of all stimulus-response associations.

 The Little Albert Experiment (1920)

  The goal of the Little Albert Experiment was to show how the principles of classical conditioning
  could be applied to a 9-month-old boy. Watson and his assistant conditioned "Little Albert" to fear a
  white rat by clanging an iron rod when a white rat was shown to Albert.4
  First, they presented a white rat to the boy and observed that he was not afraid of it. Second, they
  showed him a white rat and then clanged an iron rod. "Little Albert" responded by crying. This
  second presentation was repeated several times. Finally, the researchers introduced the white rat by
  itself and the boy showed fear.
  Later, in an attempt to see if the fear transferred to other objects, Watson presented Albert with a
  rabbit, a dog, and a fur coat. "Little Albert" cried at the sight of all of them.5

  developmental delays.6 An ethical problem with the study was that Watson never reversed this
  conditioned response in Little Albert.7

 Watson Today

  Watson's advice to treat children with respect, but with relative emotional detachment, has been
  strongly criticized. However, behaviorism is still evident today and is largely responsible for
  establishing psychology as a scientific discipline through its objective methods and experimentation.
  It is currently used in behavioral and cognitive-behavioral therapies, in classroom settings, and in
  child-rearing.

     Key Takeaways

            · Objective analysis of the mind was impossible, therefore Watson coined "behaviorism" where the
                focus of psychology is to observe and control behavior.

            · Individuals can be trained to behave in certain ways as a result of their environment and the types
                of stimuli applied.

            · The Little Albert experiment--emotional responses can be conditioned in humans.

Vygotsky: Sociocultural Theory

Lev Vygotsky believed that a person has both a set of abilities and a set of potential abilities that can
be reached if given the proper guidance from others.1

His Sociocultural Theory emphasizes the
importance of culture and interaction in the
development of cognitive abilities. Vygotsky
concentrated more on children's immediate social
and cultural environment and their interactions with
adults and peers. He saw a child as more of an
apprentice, learning through a social environment
with others who had more experience and were
sensitive to the child's needs and abilities.

Vygotsky theorized that through guided                Figure 1. An adolescent working with a tutor

cognitive skills within a certain range known as the zone of proximal development. According to

Vygotsky, development occurs first through children's immediate social interactions and then moves

to the individual level as they began to internalize their learning.

Lev Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development

                                         Have you ever taught children how to perform a task? Maybe
                                         it was brushing their teeth or tying their shoestrings.
                                         Chances are you spoke to them and described what you were
                                         doing while you demonstrated the skill and let them work
                                         along with you throughout the process. You provided them
                                         assistance when they seemed to need it, but once they knew
                                         what to do, you stood back and let them perform the task
                                         alone. This is an example of scaffolding.2

                                         Examples of scaffolding, the temporary support that parents,

                                         people are doing, people should be understood in terms of

what they are capable of doing with the proper guidance. This approach to teaching has also been

adopted by educators.

The zone of proximal development (ZPD) is the distance
between a child's potential to learn and the actual learning that
takes place. Vygotsky hypothesized that a "quality teacher"
first identifies a child's ZPD and then helps the child learn
beyond their ZPD.3

After this, the teacher (or any person with more advanced          Figure 3. A park ranger teaching

a new developmental level and can begin progressing further
in their studies.

Of course, this learning and teaching can occur with people of
all ages and skill levels.

Freud and Psychodynamic Theories of Personality: The
Role of the Unconscious

One of the most important psychological approaches to
understanding personality is based on the theorizing of the
Austrian physician and psychologist Sigmund Freud
(1856-1939), who founded what is known today as the
psychodynamic approach to understanding personality.1 Many
people know about Freud because his work has had a long-
standing impact on our everyday thinking about psychology, and
the psychodynamic approach is one of the most important
approaches to psychological therapy.2 3 Freud is probably the
best known psychologist, in part because of his impressive
observation and analyses of personality (there are 24 volumes of
his writings). As is true of all theories, many of Freud's ingenious
ideas have turned out to be at least partially incorrect, but yet
other aspects of his theories are still influencing psychology.

Freud used the observations that he and French neurologist            Figure 1. A photograph of Sigmund
Jean-Martin Charcot (1825-1893) made to develop his theory            Freud.

regarding the sources of personality and behavior, and his

insights are central to the fundamental themes of psychology. In terms of free will, Freud did not

believe that we are able to control our own behaviors. Rather, he believed that all behaviors are

predetermined by motivations that lie outside our awareness, in the unconscious. These forces show

themselves in our dreams, in neurotic symptoms such as obsessions, while we are under hypnosis,

and in Freudian "slips of the tongue" in which people reveal their unconscious desires in language.

Freud argued that we rarely understand why we do what we do, although we can make up

explanations for our behaviors after the fact. For Freud the mind was like an iceberg - many

  motivations of the unconscious being much larger, but out of sight, in comparison to the
  consciousness of which we are aware.

                                 submerged at varying depths.

 Id, Ego, and Superego

  Freud proposed that the mind is divided into three components: the id, ego, and superego, and that
  the interactions and conflicts among the components create a personality.4 According to Freudian
  theory, the id is the component of personality that forms the basis of our most primitive impulses.
  The id is entirely unconscious, and it drives our most important motivations, including the sexual
  drive (libido) and the aggressive or destructive drive (Thanatos). According to Freud, the id is driven
  by the pleasure principle--the desire for immediate gratification of our sexual and aggressive
  urges. The id is why we smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, view pornography, tell mean jokes about

people, and engage in other fun or harmful behaviors, often at the cost of doing more productive
activities.
The function of the ego is based on the reality principle--the idea that we must delay gratification of
our basic motivations until the appropriate time with the appropriate outlet. The ego is the largely
conscious controller or decision-maker of personality. The ego serves as the intermediary between
the desires of the id and the constraints of society contained in the superego (Figure 2. "Ego, Id, and
Superego in Interaction"). We may wish to scream, yell, or hit, and yet our ego normally tells us to
wait, reflect, and choose a more appropriate response.
In stark contrast to the id, the superego represents our sense of morality and doing what is "right".
The superego tells us all the things that we shouldn't do, or the duties and obligations of society.
The superego strives for perfection, and when we fail to live up to its demands we feel guilty.

                   Figure 3. The ego, id, and superego interact to help an individual solve and work
                   through problems.

Freud believed that psychological disorders, particularly the experience of anxiety, occur when there
is conflict or imbalance among the motivations of the id, ego, and superego. When the ego finds that
the id is pressing too hard for immediate pleasure, it attempts to correct or compensate for this
problem, often through the use of defense mechanisms--unconscious psychological strategies used
to cope with anxiety and to maintain a positive self-image. Freud believed that defense mechanisms
were essential for effective coping with everyday life, but that any of them could be overused (See
Table 1. "The Major Freudian Defense Mechanisms").

The most controversial, and least scientifically valid, part of Freudian theory is its explanations of
personality development. Freud argued that personality is developed through a series of psychosexual
stages, each focusing on pleasure from a different part of the body (See Table 2. "Freud's Stages of
Psychosexual Development"). Freud believed that sexuality begins in infancy and that the
appropriate resolution of each stage has implications for later personality development.

In the first of Freud's proposed stages of psychosexual development,
which begins at birth and lasts until about 18 months of age, the
focus is on the mouth. During this oral stage, the infant obtains
sexual pleasure by sucking and drinking. Infants who receive either
too little or too much gratification become fixated or "locked" in
the oral stage, and are likely to regress to these points of fixation
under stress, even as adults.

According to Freud, a child who receives too little oral gratification

(e.g., who was underfed or neglected) will become orally dependent as

an adult and be likely to manipulate others to fulfill his or her needs

rather than becoming independent. On the other hand, the child

who was overfed or overly gratified will resist growing up and try to

return to the prior state of dependency by acting helpless,

demanding satisfaction from others, and acting in a needy way.

The anal stage, lasting from about 18 months to 3 years of age is        Figure 4. An infant chewing on
when children first experience psychological conflict. During this       their toy, exhibiting the "oral
stage, children desire to experience pleasure through bowel              stage." (Photo Credit: Polina

movements, but they are also being toilet trained to delay this gratification. Freud believed that if

this toilet training was either too harsh or too lenient, children would become fixated in the anal

stage and become likely to regress to this stage under stress as adults. If the child received too little

anal gratification (i.e., if the parents had been very harsh about toilet training), the adult personality

would be anal retentive--stingy, and compulsively seeking order and tidiness. On the other hand, if

the parents had been too lenient, the anal expulsive personality would be the result, characterized by

a lack of self-control and a tendency toward messiness and carelessness.

The phallic stage, which lasts from age 3 to age 6, is when the penis (for boys) and clitoris (for girls)
become the primary erogenous zone for sexual pleasure. During this stage, Freud believed that
children develop a powerful but unconscious attraction for the opposite-sex parent, as well as a
desire to eliminate the same-sex parent as a rival. Freud based his theory of sexual development in
boys (the "Oedipus complex") on the Greek mythological character Oedipus, who unknowingly
killed his father and married his mother, and then gouged his own eyes out when he learned what he
had done. Freud argued that boys will normally eventually abandon their love of the mother, and
instead identify with the father, also taking on the father's personality characteristics, but that boys
who do not successfully resolve the Oedipus complex will experience psychological problems later in
life. Although it was not as important in Freud's theorizing, in girls the phallic stage is often termed
the "Electra complex," after the Greek character who avenged her father's murder by killing her
mother. Freud believed that girls frequently experienced penis envy, the sense of deprivation
supposedly experienced by girls because they do not have a penis. Scholars have heavily criticized
   36 | 1930S: FREUD

  this concept in the decades since Freud's work and it is no longer taken seriously in the psychological
  community.5
  The latency stage is a period of relative calm that lasts from about 6 years to 12 years of age. During
  this time, Freud believed that sexual impulses were repressed, leading boys and girls to have little or
  no interest in members of the opposite sex.
  The fifth and last stage, the genital stage, begins about 12 years of age and lasts into adulthood.
  According to Freud, sexual impulses return during this time frame, and if development has
  proceeded normally to this point, the child is able to move into the development of mature romantic
  relationships. But if earlier problems have not been appropriately resolved, difficulties with
  establishing intimate love attachments are likely.

Benjamin Spock: A Child-Centered Approach

                                Benjamin Spock was the first American pediatrician to study
                                psychoanalysis in an attempt to understand children's needs and
                                family dynamics.1 His ideas about childcare significantly changed
                                overall attitudes toward the rearing of infants and children via his
                                book, The Common Sense Book of Baby and Child Care (1946), one of the
                                best selling volumes in history. The book's premises to parents are
                                that "you know more than you think you do," and if you "feel like
                                comforting the child, do it."2 He encouraged parents to be more
                                flexible and affectionate with their children and to treat them as
                                individuals.

                                Spock's first edition advised mothers to indulge their own impulses

                                and as well as their children's, assuring them on the basis of the latest

                                scientific studies that it was safe to do so. In the process, the book

                                changed child-rearing advice from the previous generation and

In subsequent editions of his book, Spock also included
fathers in the contexts of childcare and child-rearing,
acknowledged gender roles, and addressed divorce and
single parenting.4

Overall, Spock's advice encouraged caregivers to help        Figure 2. A photograph of Dr. Spock

contributing members of that society. He highly advocated
for caregivers to instill values of cooperativeness and
congeniality and help their child be likable. Spock was one
of the most notable American authors of child-rearing
advice during the twentieth century due to publications in
contemporary, mainstream magazines.

Key Takeaways

     · Parents should be adaptable, loving and encourage individuality within each child.
     · Parents should have balanced relationships with their children composed of spontaneity, warmth,

         and fun.
     · Parents should help children become contributing members of society by teaching cooperativeness

         and congeniality.

 René Spitz: The Effects of Emotional Deprivation

  René Spitz, a psychoanalyst, performed research in the 1930s and '40s on the effects of maternal
  deprivation and hospitalism in infants who were institutionalized for long periods and deprived of
  substitute maternal care. His studies focused on infants who had experienced abrupt, long-term
  separation from their primary caregiver, such as when the primary caregiver was sent to prison.
   Spitz was one of the first to directly observe infants.1
  Spitz adopted the term anaclitic depression to describe the child's reaction of grief, anger, and
  apathy to partial emotional deprivation2 (the loss of a loved object) and proposed that when the loved
  object is returned to the child within three to five months, recovery is prompt, but after five months,
  a child will show symptoms of increasingly serious deterioration. He called this reaction to total
  deprivation hospitalism.3 4

reactions to separation, including the ability to cope
by forming relationships with other children.
Results demonstrated that these children
experienced stunted development related to height,
weight, motor functioning, emotions, relations, and
affective expressions. Many forms of these overall
developmental deteriorations were thought to be
irreversible and some led to child deaths.

Spitz defined these "total affective deficiencies" as hospitalism and concluded that children who have
at least six months of satisfactory relations with their mother could improve once the child was
reunited with the mother; Spitz defined the latter as anaclitic depression and partial deficiency.

Most of this research was not published until after the war and only gradually contributed to the
understanding of young children's reactions to loss.5 Ultimately, these studies of young infants being
separated from their maternal caregiver led to recommendations that children need responsive,
nurturing caregivers for their overall well-being.

Key Takeaways

· Infants without warm, nurturing, supportive care and affection will develop anaclitic depression.

         When this type of care and affection are returned to infants within three to five months, the
            infant will most likely recover.

         When this type of care is denied to infants for more than five months, the infant's anaclitic
            depression will continually worsen.

· Anaclitic depression can stunt development in height, weight, motor function, emotions, relations,
   and affective expressions.

· Hospitalism--a child's reaction to total deprivation.

   OpenStax and Diana Lang

B.F. Skinner: Operant Conditioning

Psychologist B.F. Skinner saw that classical conditioning is limited to existing behaviors that are
reflexively elicited, and doesn't account for new behaviors such as riding a bike.1 He proposed a
theory about how such behaviors come about. Skinner believed that behavior is motivated by the
consequences we receive for the behavior: reinforcements and punishments. His idea that learning
is the result of consequences is based on the law of effect, which was first proposed by psychologist
Edward Thorndike. According to the law of effect, behaviors that are followed by consequences that
are satisfying to the organism are more likely to be repeated, and behaviors that are followed by
unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.2 Essentially, if an organism does something
that brings about a desired result, the organism is more likely to do it again. If an organism does
something that does not bring about the desired result, the organism is less likely to do it again. An
example of the law of effect is employment. One of the reasons (and often the main reason) we show
up for work is because we get paid to do so. If we stop getting paid, we will likely stop showing
up--even if we love our job.

Working with Thorndike's law of effect as his foundation, Skinner began conducting scientific
experiments on animals (mainly rats and pigeons) to determine how organisms learn through
operant conditioning.3 He placed these animals inside an operant conditioning chamber, which has

come to be known as a "Skinner box" (See Figure 1.). A Skinner box contains a lever (for rats) or disk
(for pigeons) that the animal can press or peck for a food reward via the dispenser. Speakers and
lights can be associated with certain behaviors. A recorder counts the number of responses made by
the animal.

 operant conditioning chamber to receive a food reward.

   Video Example

     Watch this brief video clip to learn more about operant conditioning: Skinner is interviewed, and operant
     conditioning of pigeons is demonstrated.

In discussing operant conditioning, we use several everyday words--positive, negative,
reinforcement, and punishment--in a specialized manner. In operant conditioning, positive and
negative do not mean good and bad. Instead, positive means you are adding something, and negative
means you are taking something away. Reinforcement means you are increasing a behavior, and
punishment means you are decreasing a behavior. Reinforcement can be positive or negative, and
punishment can also be positive or negative. All reinforcers (positive or negative) increase the
likelihood of a behavioral response. All punishers (positive or negative) decrease the likelihood of a
behavioral response. Now let us combine these four terms: positive reinforcement, negative
reinforcement, positive punishment, and negative punishment (Table 2.).

Reinforcement

The most effective way to teach a person or animal a new behavior is with positive reinforcement.
In positive reinforcement, a desirable stimulus is added to increase a behavior.

For example, let's say you tell your five-year-old son, Jerome, that if he cleans his room, he will get a
toy. Jerome quickly cleans his room because he wants a new art set. Some people might say, "Why
should I reward my child for doing what is expected?" However, we are constantly and consistently
rewarded in our lives. Our paychecks are rewards, as are high grades or acceptance into our
preferred schools. Being praised for doing a good job or for passing a driver's test are also rewards.
Positive reinforcement as a learning tool is extremely effective. It has been found that one of the
most effective ways to increase achievement in school districts with below-average reading scores
was to pay the children to read.

An example of this can be seen in Dallas, where second-grade students in Dallas were paid $2 each
time they read a book and passed a short quiz about the book. The result was a significant increase
in reading comprehension.4 What do you think about this program? If Skinner were alive today, he
would probably think this was a great idea. He was a strong proponent of using operant
conditioning principles to influence students' behavior at school. In fact, in addition to the Skinner
box, he also invented what he called a teaching machine that was designed to reward small steps in
learning--an early forerunner of computer-assisted learning.5 His teaching machine tested students'
knowledge as they worked through various school subjects. If students answered questions
correctly, they received immediate positive reinforcement and could continue; if they answered
incorrectly, they did not receive any reinforcement. The idea was that students would spend
additional time studying the material to increase their chance of being reinforced the next time.

In negative reinforcement, an undesirable stimulus is removed to increase a behavior. For example,
car manufacturers use the principles of negative reinforcement in their seatbelt systems, which go
"beep, beep, beep" until you fasten your seatbelt. The annoying sound stops when you exhibit the

  desired behavior, increasing the likelihood that you will buckle up in the future. Negative
  reinforcement is also used frequently in horse training. Riders apply pressure--by pulling the reins
  or squeezing their legs--and then remove the pressure when the horse performs the desired
  behavior, such as turning or speeding up. The pressure is the negative stimulus that the horse wants
  to remove.

 Punishment

  Many people confuse negative reinforcement with punishment in operant conditioning, but they
  are two very different concepts. Remember that reinforcement, even when it is negative, always
  increases a behavior. In contrast, punishment always decreases a behavior. In positive
  punishment, you add an undesirable stimulus to decrease a behavior. An example of positive
  punishment is reprimanding a student to get the student to stop texting in class. In this case, a
  stimulus (the reprimand) is added in order to decrease the behavior (texting in class). In negative
  punishment, you remove a pleasant stimulus to decrease a behavior, such as something the child
  enjoys (e.g., a toy or a scheduled outing). Time-outs are a very common form of negative punishment
  -- they momentarily take away children's access to something they enjoy.

  Punishment, especially when it is immediate, is one way to decrease undesirable behavior. For
  example, imagine your four-year-old son, Brandon, runs into a busy street to get his ball. You give
  him a time-out (positive punishment) and tell him never to go into the street again. Chances are he
  will not repeat this behavior. While strategies like time-outs are common today, in the past children
  were often subject to physical punishment, such as spanking. It's important to be aware of some of
  the drawbacks of using physical punishment on children. Within the context of parenting, it is
  important to note that the term "punishment" doesn't mean that the consequence should be harmful.

  In fact, experts caution that punishments like spanking can cause more harm than good. 6 First,
  punishment may teach fear. Brandon may become fearful of the street, but he also may become
  fearful of the person who delivered the punishment--you, his parent. Similarly, children who are
  punished by teachers may start to fear the teacher and try to avoid school.7 Consequently, most
  schools in the United States have banned corporal punishment. Second, punishment may cause
  children to become more aggressive and prone to antisocial behavior and delinquency.8 They see
  their parents resort to spanking when they become angry and frustrated, so, in turn, they may act

out this same behavior when they become angry and frustrated. For example, because you spank
Brenda when you are angry with her for her misbehavior, she might start hitting her friends when
they will not share their toys.

While positive punishment can be effective in some cases, Skinner suggested that the use of
punishment should be weighed against the possible negative effects. Today's psychologists and
parenting experts favor reinforcement over punishment--they recommend that you catch your child
doing something good and reward her for it.

Shaping

In his operant conditioning experiments, Skinner often used an approach called shaping. Instead of
rewarding only the target behavior, in shaping, we reward successive approximations of a target
behavior. For instance, parents can break a task into smaller more "attainable" steps. These smaller
steps should be in sequence of completing the entire desired task. As children start a step, or show
improvements on a step, they should be praised and rewarded. As children master each step, they
should again be praised and rewarded and then encouraged to the next step. This process of
successive approximations is followed until a child masters the entire task. This takes time, but it is a
proven method of shaping a child's behavior via rewarding and praising ongoing improvements.

Why is shaping needed? Remember that in order for reinforcement to work, the organism must first
display the behavior. Shaping is needed because it is extremely unlikely that an organism will display
anything but the simplest of behaviors spontaneously. In shaping, behaviors are broken down into
many small, achievable steps. The specific steps used in the process are the following:

 1. Reinforce any response that resembles the desired behavior.
 2. Then reinforce the response that more closely resembles the desired behavior. You will no

      longer reinforce the previously reinforced response.
 3. Next, begin to reinforce the response that even more closely resembles the desired behavior.
 4. Continue to reinforce closer and closer approximations of the desired behavior.
 5. Finally, only reinforce the desired behavior.

Shaping is often used to teach a complex behavior or chain of behaviors. Skinner used shaping to
teach pigeons not only relatively simple behaviors such as pecking a disk in a Skinner box, but also
many unusual and entertaining behaviors, such as turning in circles, walking in figure eights, and
even playing ping pong; this technique is commonly used by animal trainers today. An important
part of shaping is stimulus discrimination. Recall Pavlov's dogs--he trained them to respond to the
tone of a bell, and not to similar tones or sounds. This discrimination is also important in operant
conditioning and in shaping behavior.
48 | 1940S: SKINNER

   Video Example

     Here is a brief video of Skinner's pigeons playing ping pong.

It is easy to see how shaping is effective in teaching behaviors to animals, but how does shaping work
with humans? Let us consider parents whose goal is to have their child learn to clean his room. They
use shaping to help him master steps toward the goal. Instead of performing the entire task, they set
up these steps and reinforce each one. First, he cleans up one toy. Second, he cleans up five toys.
Third, he chooses whether to pick up ten toys or put his books and clothes away. Fourth, he cleans
up everything except two toys. Finally, he cleans his entire room.

Primary and Secondary Reinforcers

Rewards such as stickers, praise, money, toys, and more can be used to reinforce learning. Let us go
back to Skinner's rats again. How did the rats learn to press the lever in the Skinner box? They were
rewarded with food each time they pressed the lever. For animals, food would be an obvious
reinforcer.

What would be a good reinforcer for humans? For your daughter Sydney, it was the promise of a toy
if she cleaned her room. How about Joaquin, the soccer player? If you gave Joaquin a piece of candy
every time he made a goal, you would be using a primary reinforcer. Primary reinforcers are
reinforcers that have innate reinforcing qualities. These kinds of reinforcers are not learned. Water,
food, sleep, shelter, sex, and touch, among others, are primary reinforcers. Pleasure is also a primary
reinforcer. Organisms do not lose their drive for these things. For most people, jumping in a cool
lake on a very hot day would be reinforcing and the cool lake would be innately reinforcing--the
water would cool the person off (a physical need), as well as provide pleasure.

A secondary reinforcer has no inherent value and only has reinforcing qualities when linked with a
primary reinforcer. Praise, linked to affection, is one example of a secondary reinforcer, such as
when you called out "Great shot!" every time Joaquin made a goal. Another example, money, is only
worth something when you can use it to buy other things--either things that satisfy basic needs
(food, water, shelter--all primary reinforcers) or other secondary reinforcers. If you were on a
remote island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and you had stacks of money, the money would not
be useful if you could not spend it. What about the stickers on the behavior chart? They also are
secondary reinforcers.

Sometimes, instead of stickers on a sticker chart, a token is used. Tokens, which are also secondary
                                                                                                                                          1940S: SKINNER | 49

reinforcers, can then be traded in for rewards and prizes. Entire behavior management systems,
known as token economies, are built around the use of these kinds of token reinforcers. Token
economies have been found to be very effective at modifying behavior in a variety of settings such as
schools, prisons, and mental hospitals.
50 | 1940S: SKINNER

     Everyday Connection: Behavior Modification in Children

       Parents and teachers often use behavior modification to change a child's behavior. Behavior
       modification uses the principles of operant conditioning to accomplish behavior change so that
       undesirable behaviors are switched out for more socially acceptable ones. Some teachers and parents
       create a sticker chart, in which several behaviors are listed. Sticker charts are a form of token
       economies, as described in the text. Each time children perform the desired behavior, they get a
       sticker, and after a certain number of stickers, they get a prize, or reinforcer. The goal is to increase
       acceptable behaviors and decrease misbehavior. Remember, it is better to reinforce desired behaviors
       than to use punishment. In the classroom, the teacher can reinforce a wide range of behaviors, from
       students raising their hands, to walking quietly in the hall, to turning in their homework. At home,
       parents might create a behavior chart that rewards children for things such as putting away toys,
       brushing their teeth, and helping with dinner. In order for behavior modification to be effective, the
       reinforcement must be connected with the behavior, the reinforcement must matter to the child, and
       the process must be performed consistently over time.

                      Sticker charts are a form of positive reinforcement and a tool for behavior modification.

                      she will be rewarded with a trip to the ice cream parlor. (credit: Abigail Batchelder)

       Time-out is another popular technique used in behavior modification with children. When a child
       demonstrates an undesirable behavior, she is removed from the desirable activity at hand. For
       example, say that Sophia and her brother Mario are playing with building blocks. Sophia throws some
                                                                                                                                          1940S: SKINNER | 51

       blocks at her brother, so you give her a warning that she will go to time-out if she does it again. A few
       minutes later, she throws more blocks at Mario. You remove Sophia from the room for a few minutes.
       When she comes back, she doesn't throw blocks.
       There are several important points to consider if you plan to implement time-out as a behavior
       modification technique. First, make sure the child is being removed from a desirable activity and
       placed in a less desirable location. If the activity is something undesirable for the child, this technique
       will backfire because it is more enjoyable for the child to be removed from the activity. Second, the
       length of the time-out is important. The general rule of thumb is one minute for each year of the
       child's age. Sophia is five; therefore, she sits in time-out for five minutes. Setting a timer helps
       children know how long they have to sit in time-out. Third, using this method should be dependent
       upon the child's cognitive and social development, not merely the child's chronological age. Finally, as
       a caregiver, keep several guidelines in mind over the course of a time-out: remain calm when directing
       your child to time-out; ignore your child during time-out (because caregiver attention may reinforce
       misbehavior), and give the child a hug or a kind word when the time-out is over.

        Time-out is a popular form of negative punishment used by caregivers. When a child misbehaves, the child is
        removed from a desirable activity in an effort to decrease the unwanted behavior. For example, (a) a child might be
        playing on the playground with friends and push another child; (b) the child who misbehaved would then be
        removed from the activity for a short period of time. (credit a: modification of work by Simone Ramella; credit b:

Reinforcement Schedules

Remember, the best way to teach a person or animal a behavior is to use positive reinforcement. For
example, Skinner used positive reinforcement to teach rats to press a lever in a Skinner box. At first,
the rat might randomly hit the lever while exploring the box, and out would come a pellet of food.
After eating the pellet, what do you think the hungry rat did next? It hit the lever again and received
another pellet of food. Each time the rat hit the lever, a pellet of food came out. When an organism
52 | 1940S: SKINNER

receives a reinforcer each time it displays a behavior, it is called continuous reinforcement. This
reinforcement schedule is the quickest way to teach someone a behavior, and it is especially effective
in training a new behavior. Let's look at a dog learning to sit. Each time the dog sits, you give the
dog a treat. Timing is important here: you will be most successful if you present the reinforcer
immediately after the dog sits so that the dog can make an association between the target behavior
(sitting) and the reinforcement (getting a treat).

   Key Takeaways

         · Behavior is motivated by the consequences of that behavior.
         · Behaviors with satisfying consequences are often repeated, while behaviors with unpleasant

             consequences are often avoided.
         · Conditioning can be done through positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, positive

             punishment, and negative punishment.
         · Reinforcement increases a behavior; punishment decreases a behavior.
         · Shaping is slowly reinforcing behaviors that are more and more similar to the ideal goal behavior.

                                                       social milestone of infancy.1 Attachment is a
                                                       long-standing connection or bond with others.
                                                       Developmental psychologists are interested in
                                                       how infants reach this milestone. They ask
                                                       questions such questions as: How do parent and
                                                       infant attachment bonds form? How does
                                                       neglect affect these bonds? What accounts for
                                                       children's attachment differences?

Researchers Harry Harlow, John Bowlby, and Mary Ainsworth conducted studies designed to answer
these questions. In the 1950s, Harlow conducted a series of experiments on monkeys. He separated
newborn monkeys from their mothers. Each monkey was presented with two surrogate mothers.
One surrogate monkey was made out of wire mesh, and she could dispense milk. The other monkey
was softer and made from cloth, but did not dispense milk. The findings showed that the monkeys
preferred the soft, cuddly cloth monkey, even though she did not provide any nourishment. The
baby monkeys spent their time clinging to the cloth monkey and only went to the wire monkey when
they needed to be fed. Prior to this study, the medical and scientific communities generally thought
that babies become attached to the people who provide their nourishment. However, Harlow
concluded that there was more to the mother-child bond than nourishment.2 Feelings of comfort
and security are the critical components of maternal-infant bonding, which leads to healthy
psychosocial development.

        experiments are widely considered to be unethical and even cruel. Watch this video to see footage of

  Building on the work of Harlow and others, John Bowlby developed the concept of attachment
  theory. He defined attachment as the affectional bond or tie that infants form with their mother.3
  An infant must form this bond with a primary caregiver in order to have normal social and
  emotional development. In addition, Bowlby proposed that this attachment bond is very powerful
  and continues throughout life. He used the concept of a secure base to define a healthy attachment
  between parent and child.4 A secure base is a parental presence that gives the child a sense of safety
  as he explores his surroundings. Bowlby said that two things are needed for a healthy attachment:
  the caregiver must be responsive to the child's physical, social, and emotional needs, and the
  caregiver and child must engage in mutually enjoyable interactions (See Figure 1.).5

Mary Ainsworth

While Bowlby believed that attachment was an all-
or-nothing process, Mary Ainsworth's research
showed otherwise.6 Mary identified the existence of
what she calls "attachment behaviors," which are
examples of behaviors demonstrated by insecure
children in hopes of establishing or re-establishing
an attachment to a presently absent caregiver. `Since
this behavior occurs uniformly in children, it is a
compelling argument for the existence of "innate" or
instinctual behaviors in human beings'.7

Ainsworth wanted to know if children differ in the        Figure 2. Mutually enjoyable interactions promote
ways they bond, and if so, why. To find the answers       the mother-infant bond. (Image Credit: Peter

procedure to study attachment between mothers and

their infants in 1970. In the Strange Situation, the mother (or primary caregiver) and the infant (age

12-18 months) are placed in a room together. There are toys in the room, and the caregiver and

child spend some time alone in the room. After the child has had time to explore one's surroundings,

a stranger enters the room. The primary caregiver then leaves the baby with the stranger. After a

few minutes, the caregiver returns to comfort the child.

                                                      Based on how the infants/toddlers responded to the

                                                      separation and reunion, Ainsworth identified three

                                                      types of parent-child attachments: secure, avoidant,

                                                      and resistant.8 A fourth style, known as disorganized

                                                      attachment, was later described.9 The most common

                                                      type of attachment--also considered the

                                                      healthiest--is called secure attachment (See Figure

                                                      2.). In this type of attachment, the toddler prefers

                                                      their parent over a stranger. The attachment figure

                                                      is used by the child as a secure base to explore their

                                                      environment and is sought out in times of stress.

to securely explore his environment. (Image Credit:   Situation experiment, but when their caregivers
Kerry Ceszyk)                                         returned, the securely attached children were happy

to see them. Securely attached children have caregivers who are sensitive and responsive to their

needs.

With avoidant attachment (sometimes called insecure or anxious-avoidant), the child is
unresponsive to the parent, does not use the parent as a secure base, and does not care if the parent
leaves. The toddler reacts to the parent the same way she reacts to a stranger. When the parent does
return, the child is slow to show a positive reaction. Ainsworth theorized that these children were
most likely to have a caregiver who was insensitive and inattentive to their needs.10

In cases of resistant attachment (also called ambivalent or anxious-ambivalent/resistant), children
tend to show clingy behavior, but then reject the attachment figure's attempts to interact with
them.11 These children do not explore the toys in the room, as they are too fearful. During
separation in the Strange Situation, they became extremely disturbed and angry with the parent.
When the parent returns, the children are upset and difficult to comfort. Resistant attachment is the
result of the caregivers' inconsistent level of response to their child.

Finally, children with disorganized attachment behave oddly in the Strange Situation. They freeze,

   abuse disrupts a child's ability to regulate their emotions.

 Piaget: Cognitive Development Theory

  Jean Piaget studied how children and youth gradually become able to think logically and
  scientifically, resulting in his Cognitive Development Theory. Cognition refers to thinking and
  memory processes, and cognitive development refers to long-term changes in these processes. He
  was one of the first to recognize and map out the ways in which children's thought differs from that
  of adults. His interest in this area began when he was asked to test the IQ of children and began to
  notice that there was a pattern in their wrong answers.1
  Piaget believed that children's intellectual skills change over time based on biological predispositions
  and their own individual interactions with the world. He was very critical of teacher-directed
  instruction, believing that teachers or caregivers who take control of the child's learning place the
  child into a passive role.2 According to Piaget, children of differing ages interpret the world
  differently; therefore, he divided this learning into four stages. His stages assumed a sequence of
  thinking patterns with these key features:

   1. They always happen in the same order.
   2. No stage is ever skipped.
   3. Each stage is a significant transformation from the stage before it.
   4. Each later stage builds upon and incorporates the earlier stages.

 Sensorimotor Stage

  Piaget described intelligence in infancy as sensorimotor, or based on direct, physical contact via the
  use of their senses. Infants taste, feel, pound, push, hear, and move in order to experience the world.

     Watch this video for an example of a child who has not mastered object permanence.

Preoperational Stage

Piaget's stage that coincides with early childhood is the preoperational stage. The word operational
means logical, so these children were thought to be illogical. However, they learn to use language
and to think of the world symbolically.

                                    Figure 1. A child pretending to buy items at a toy grocery
                                    store. (Photo Credit: Ermalfaro, CC BY SA 4.0.)

   Pretend Play

     Pretending is a favorite activity during the preoperational stage. A toy has qualities beyond the way it
     was designed to function and can now be used to stand for a character or object unlike anything for which
     it was originally intended. A teddy bear, for example, can be a baby or the queen of a faraway land!

Video Example

Watch this Preoperational Stage example video. Note that children in the Preoperational Stage exhibit
symbolic play, egocentrism, lack of understanding conservation tasks, and inability to understand
reversibility.

Egocentrism

Egocentrism in early childhood refers to the tendency of young children to think that everyone sees
things in the same way as them. This trait is particularly common in the preoperational stage.

Concrete Operational Stage

This stage takes place from around 7 years old to 11
years of age and is characterized by the development
of organized and rational thinking. The child is
now mature enough to use logical thought or
operations (e.g., rules) but can only apply logic to
physical or "concrete" objects and events (hence the
name "concrete operational"). Children gain the
abilities of conservation (number, area, volume,
orientation) and understand that when concrete
objects change in appearance, they still contain the
same volume, area, number, and orientation and can
return to their original state (reversibility).3

Their rules of thinking still seem very basic by adult

standards and usually operate unconsciously, but        Figure 2. A child with scissors (Photo Source:
they allow children to solve problems more              Flickr, CC BY 2.0.)
systematically than before, and therefore to be

successful with many academic tasks. For example, a child may unconsciously follow the rule: "If

nothing is added or taken away, then the amount of something stays the same." This simple principle

helps children to understand certain arithmetic tasks, such as adding or subtracting zero from a
number.

     does not understand conservation or reversibility.
     For more information, watch this video about Concrete Operations.

Formal Operational Stage

During this stage, adolescents are able to understand abstract principles. They are no longer limited
by what can be directly seen or heard and are able to contemplate constructs such as beauty, love,
freedom, and morality. Adolescents demonstrate hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which is
developing hypotheses based on what might logically occur. They are able to think about all the
possibilities in a situation beforehand, and then test them systematically because they are able to
engage in scientific thinking.

Sensorimotor Stage    During the sensorimotor stage, children rely on the use of the senses and motor
                      skills. From birth until about 2 years, the infant learns by tasting, smelling,

Concrete Operational
Stage                 In the preoperational stage, children from ages 2 to 7 years become able to think
                      about the world using symbols. A symbol is something that stands for something
Formal Operational    else. The use of language, whether it is in the form of words or gestures, facilitates
Stage                 knowing and communicating about the world. This is the hallmark of
                      preoperational learning and it typically occurs in early childhood. However, these
                      children are preoperational or pre-logical. They still do not understand how the
                      physical world operates. They may, for instance, fear that they will go down the
                      drain if they sit at the front of the bathtub, even though they are too big.

                      Children in the concrete operational stage, ages 7 to 11 years, develop the ability
                      to think logically about the physical world. Middle childhood is a time of
                      understanding concepts such as size, distance, and constancy of matter, and cause
                      and effect relationships. A child knows that a scrambled egg is still an egg and that
                      8 ounces of water are still 8 ounces no matter what shape of glass contains it.

                      During the formal operational stage children, at about 12 years of age, acquire the
                      ability to think logically about concrete and abstract events. The teenager who has
                      reached this stage is able to consider possibilities and to contemplate ideas about
                      situations that have never been directly encountered. More abstract
                      understanding of religious ideas, morals, or ethics, and abstract principles such as
                      freedom and dignity can be considered.

Criticisms of Piaget's Theory

Critics have discovered a considerable variation in what children are able to do at various ages in
different parts of the world and in different cultures. Further, many contend that Piaget may have
underestimated what children are capable of given the right circumstances.4 For instance, he
believed that learning peaked around the age of 12 years, designated by his last stage--formal
operational stage.

         · Children develop cognitively through stages--sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational,
             and formal operational.

         · Each stage must be mastered before moving on to the next stage.
         · Children's intellectual skills change based on their direct experiences with the environment.

 Erik Erikson's Psychosocial Theory

  Erik Erikson suggested that our relationships and society's expectations motivate much of our
  behavior in his theory of psychosocial development. Unlike Freud, Erikson believed that we are not
  driven by unconscious urges. He is considered the father of developmental psychology because his
  model gives us a guideline for the entire life span and suggests certain primary psychological and
  social concerns throughout life.1
  Erikson expanded on Freud's theory by emphasizing the importance of culture in parenting
  practices and motivations. He also added three stages of social and emotional domains regarding
  adult development. He believed that we are aware of what motivates us throughout life and that the
  ego has greater importance in guiding our actions than the id does.2 We make conscious choices in
  life and these choices focus on meeting certain social and cultural needs rather than purely biological
  ones. Humans are motivated, for instance, by the need to feel that the world is a trustworthy place,
  that we are capable individuals, that we can make a contribution to society, and that we have lived a
  meaningful life. These are all psychosocial issues.

66 | 1960S: ERIKSON

Erikson divided the lifespan into eight stages. In each
stage, we have a major psychosocial task to accomplish
or crisis to overcome. Successful completion of each
developmental task results in a sense of competence
and a healthy personality. Failure to master these
tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy. Erikson believed
that our personality continues to take shape
throughout our lifespan as we face these challenges in
living.3

These eight stages form a foundation for discussions

on emotional and social development during the life

span. However, these stages or crises can occur more

than once and can occur at different ages.4 For

instance, a person may struggle with a lack of trust     Figure 1. Erikson's Lifespan Stages (Image
beyond infancy under certain circumstances.              Source: Brianne Thompson)
Erikson's theory has been criticized for focusing so

heavily on stages and assuming that the completion of one stage is a prerequisite for the next

development crisis.5 His theory also focuses on the social expectations that are found in some

cultures, but not in others. For instance, the idea that adolescence is a time of searching for identity

might translate well in the middle-class culture of the United States, but not as well in cultures where

the transition into adulthood coincides with puberty through rites of passage and where adult roles

offer fewer choices. Here is a brief overview of the eight stages6:

Name of Stage and Age             Description of Stage

Trust vs. mistrust (0-1 year)     The infant must have basic needs met in a consistent way in order to feel
                                  that the world is a trustworthy place.

Autonomy vs. shame and doubt Mobile toddlers have newfound freedom that they like to exercise and by

(1-2 years)                       being allowed to do so, they learn some basic independence.

Initiative vs. guilt (3-5 years)  Preschoolers like to initiate activities and emphasize doing things "all by
                                  myself."

Industry vs. inferiority (6-11    School-aged children focus on accomplishments and begin making
years)                            comparisons between themselves and their classmates.

Identity vs. role confusion       Teenagers try to gain a sense of identity as they experiment with various
(adolescence)                     roles, beliefs, and ideas.

Intimacy vs. isolation (young     In our 20s and 30s, we make some of our first long-term commitments in
adulthood)                        intimate relationships.

Generativity vs. stagnation       In the 40s through the early 60s we focus on being productive at work
(middle adulthood)                and home and are motivated by wanting to feel that we've made a
                                  contribution to society.

Integrity vs. Despair (late       We look back on our lives and hope to like what we see -- that we have
adulthood)                        lived well and have a sense of integrity because we lived according to our
                                  beliefs.

Trust vs. Mistrust

                                  From birth to 12 months of age, infants must learn that adults can
                                  be trusted. This occurs when adults meet a child's basic needs for
                                  survival. Infants are dependent upon their caregivers, so caregivers
                                  who are consistently and appropriately responsive and sensitive to
                                  their infant's needs help their baby to develop a sense of trust; their
                                  baby will see the world as a safe, predictable place. Unresponsive or
                                  inconsistent caregivers who do not meet their baby's needs can
                                  elicit feelings of anxiety, fear, and mistrust; their baby may see the
                                  world as unpredictable and unsafe. If infants are treated cruelly or
                                  their needs are not met appropriately, they will likely grow up with
                                  a sense of mistrust for people in the world.

                                  Autonomy vs. Shame/Doubt

Akyurt on Pixabay)                get results. They begin to show clear preferences for certain

elements of the environment, such as food, toys, and clothing. A toddler's main task is to resolve the
68 | 1960S: ERIKSON

issue of autonomy vs. shame and doubt by working to establish independence. This is the "me do it"
stage. For example, we might observe a budding sense of autonomy in a 2-year-old child who wants
to choose her clothes and dress herself. Although her outfits might not be appropriate for the
situation, her input in such basic decisions has an effect on her sense of independence. If denied the
opportunity to act on her environment (within developmentally-appropriate measures), she may
begin to doubt her abilities, which could lead to low self-esteem and feelings of shame.

                  Figure 3. A mother helps her son cut his food.

Initiative vs. Guilt

Once children reach the preschool stage (ages 3-6 years), they are typically capable of initiating
activities and asserting control over their world through social interactions and play. According to
Erikson, preschool children must resolve the task of initiative vs. guilt. By learning to plan and
achieve goals while interacting with others, preschool children can master this task. Initiative, a
sense of ambition and responsibility, occurs when parents allow a child to explore within limits and
then support the child's choice. These children tend to develop self-confidence and feel a sense of
purpose. Those who are unsuccessful at this stage--with their initiative stifled by over-controlling
caregivers--may develop feelings of guilt.

Industry vs. Inferiority

During the elementary school stage (ages 6-12 years), children face the task of industry vs.
inferiority. Many children begin to compare themselves to their peers to see how they measure up.
They either develop a sense of pride and accomplishment in their schoolwork, sports, social
                                                                                                                                          1960S: ERIKSON | 69

activities, and family life, or they feel inferior and inadequate because they feel that they don't
measure up. If children do not learn to get along with others or have negative experiences at home
or with peers, an inferiority complex might develop into adolescence and adulthood.

Identity vs. Role Confusion

                                                    In adolescence (ages 12-18 years), children face the
                                                    task of identity vs. role confusion. According to
                                                    Erikson, an adolescent's main task is developing a
                                                    sense of self. Adolescents struggle with questions
                                                    such as "Who am I?" and "What do I want to do with
                                                    my life?" Along the way, most adolescents try on
                                                    many different "selves" or identities to see which
                                                    ones fit; they explore various roles and ideas, set
                                                    goals, and attempt to discover their "adult" selves.

                                                    Adolescents who are successful at this stage have a

identity. (Photo Source: Eliott Reyna on Unsplash)  and other people's perspectives. When adolescents
                                                    are apathetic, do not make a conscious search for

identity, or are pressured to conform to their caregivers' ideas for the future, they may develop a

weak sense of self and experience role confusion. They may be unsure of their identity and confused

about the future. Teenagers who have difficulty adopting a positive role may struggle to "find"

themselves as adults.

Intimacy vs. Isolation

People in early adulthood (20s through early 40s) are concerned with intimacy vs. isolation. After we
have developed a sense of self in adolescence, many of us are ready to share our life with others.
However, if the previous developmental stages have not been successfully resolved, young adults may
have trouble creating and maintaining healthy relationships with others. Erikson said that we must
have a strong sense of self before we can form strong, successful intimate relationships. Adults who
do not develop a positive self-concept in adolescence may experience feelings of loneliness and
emotional isolation.

Generativity vs. Stagnation

When people reach their 40s, they enter the time known as middle adulthood, which extends to the
mid-60s. The social task of middle adulthood is generativity vs. stagnation. Generativity involves
70 | 1960S: ERIKSON

finding your "life's work" and fostering the development of others through activities such as
volunteering, mentoring, and rearing children. During this stage, middle-aged adults begin
contributing to the next generation, often through childbirth and caring for others; they also engage
in meaningful and productive work which positively benefits society. Those who do not master this
task may experience stagnation and feel as though they are not leaving a mark on the world in a
meaningful way; they may have little connection with others and little interest in productivity and
self-improvement.

Integrity vs. Despair

From the mid-60s to the end of life, we are in a

period of development known as late adulthood.

Erikson's task at this stage is called integrity vs.

despair. He said that people in late adulthood reflect

on their lives and feel either a sense of satisfaction or

a sense of failure. People who feel proud of their

accomplishments feel a sense of integrity, and they

look back on their lives with few regrets. However,        Figure 5. An elderly person holding a baby doll

as if their life has been wasted. They focus on what

"would have," "should have," and "could have" been. They may face the end of their lives with feelings

of bitterness, depression, and despair.

Key Takeaways

Erikson was a student of Freud but focused on conscious thought.

    · His stages of psychosocial development address the entire lifespan and suggest a primary
        psychosocial crisis in some cultures that adults can use to understand how to support children's
        social and emotional development.

    · Certain cultures may need to resolve the stages in different ways based upon their cultural and
        survival needs.

    · During each of Erikson's eight development stages, two conflicting ideas must be resolved
        successfully in order for a person to become a confident, contributing member of society. Failure to
        master these tasks leads to feelings of inadequacy.

    · The stages include: trust vs. mistrust, autonomy vs. shame and doubt, initiative vs. guilt, industry vs.
        inferiority, identity vs. role confusion, intimacy vs. isolation, generativity vs. stagnation, and
        integrity vs. despair.

 Bandura's Social Learning Theory and Observational
 Learning

  Observational learning is a component of Albert Bandura's Social Learning Theory, which asserts
  that individuals can learn new responses via observation of key others' behaviors.1 Observational
  learning does not necessarily require reinforcement, but instead hinges on the presence of others,
  referred to as social models. Social models typically possess a higher status or authority compared to
  the observer, examples of which include parents, teachers, or police officers.2
  Bandura theorized that the observational learning process consists of four parts. The first is
  attention-one must pay attention to what one is observing in order to learn. The second part is
  retention. To learn, one must be able to retain the observed behavior into one's memory. The third
  part of observational learning, initiation, acknowledges that the learner must be able to execute, or
  initiate the learned behavior. Lastly, the observer must possess the motivation to engage in
  observational learning.

                                            Imagine a child walking up to a group of children playing
                                            a game on the playground. The game looks fun, but it is
                                            new and unfamiliar. Rather than joining the game
                                            immediately, the child opts to sit back and watch the other
                                            children play a round or two. While observing the others,
                                            the child takes note of the ways in which they behave
                                            while playing the game. By watching the behavior of the
                                            other kids, the child can figure out the rules of the game
                                            and even some strategies for performing well at the game.
                                            This is called observational learning.

Figure 1. Children observe a social model   In the example here, the child must want to learn how to

                                            age as the observer.

By observing how the social models behave, an individual is able to learn how to act in a certain
situation. Other examples of observational learning might include a child learning to place her
napkin in her lap by watching her parents at the dinner table, or a child learning how to use a pair of
scissors after watching another child successfully use a pair of scissors.

The Bobo Doll Experiment

Researchers have conducted countless experiments designed to explore
observational learning, the most famous of which is Albert Bandura's "Bobo

                                                                            Figure 2. Bobo doll

  doll experiment." In this experiment, Bandura had children individually observe an adult social
  model interact with a clown doll ("Bobo").3
  For one group of children, the adult interacted aggressively with Bobo: punching it, kicking it,
  throwing it, and even hitting it in the face with a toy mallet. Another group of children watched the
  adult interact with other toys, displaying no aggression toward Bobo. In both instances, the adult
  left and the children were allowed to interact with Bobo on their own.
  Bandura found that children exposed to the aggressive social model were significantly more likely to
  behave aggressively toward Bobo, hitting and kicking him, compared to those exposed to the non-
  aggressive model. The researchers concluded that the children in the aggressive group used their
  observations of the adult social model's behavior to determine that aggressive behavior toward Bobo
  was acceptable.

  While reinforcement was not required to elicit the children's behavior in Bandura's first experiment,
  it is important to acknowledge that consequences do play a role within observational learning. A
  future adaptation of this study demonstrated that children in the aggression group showed less
  aggressive behavior if they witnessed the adult model receive punishment for aggressing against
  Bobo.4 Bandura referred to this process as vicarious reinforcement, as the children did not
  experience the reinforcement or punishment directly, yet were still influenced by observing it.

 1960S: DREIKURS

     New World Encyclopedia; Wikimedia contributors; and Diana Lang

 Rudolf Dreikurs

  Rudolf Dreikurs was an American psychiatrist and educator who developed Alfred Adler's system of
  individual psychology into a pragmatic method for understanding the purposes of misbehavior in
  children and stimulating cooperative behavior without punishment or reward. His primary focus was
  on pre-adolescents, and he reasoned that their problematic behavior resulted from feelings of lack of
  significance in their social group. He described four "mistaken goals" that such children would
  resort to, and outlined the most effective ways that teachers and parents could respond.1
  He saw the family as the first social setting in which education takes place, with the school
  environment as an extension of the family. Thus, his techniques for preventing misbehavior and
  encouraging appropriate behavior could be applied equally in both settings. Dreikurs' work
  continues through the training centers he and his colleagues established to train counselors in
  addressing the social problems of youth.

 Individual Psychology

  Dreikurs was often credited with "elaborating, building, and working out in a clear, systematic and
  logical form, the basic ideas of Individual Psychology."2 While most agree that his greatest
  contribution was in the application and practice of individual psychology, some felt he also
  contributed to the creation of the original theory. He is most well-known for his simplification and
  application of Adler's principles for use by parents and educators. In 1964, he and Vicki Soltz wrote
  Children: The Challenge, and in 1968, he and Loren Grey wrote A Parent's Guide to Child Discipline.

Adler and Dreikurs firmly believed that encouragement was
essential to the improvement of behavior and human relationships.
Their basic assumption was that human behavior is not
predetermined by genetics, or merely the result of outside forces
beyond one's control. They argued that behavior is a result of a
search for significance within a social setting. Dreikurs said
"anticipation influences outcome--the fear of making a mistake
leads to mistakes. Anyone who can alter the expectations of people
can change their behavior."3 Accordingly, encouragement and
positive support have a direct correlation with improved behavior
in others.

Adlerian Parent Education aims to give children the skills to meet

life challenges in a constructive, positive way and the courage to

circumvent the many pitfalls and dangers that confront children in

society. It supports parents by providing them with tools to ease                          Figure 1. Sports is often seen as a

The Roots of Misbehavior

                                                    Dreikurs suggested that human misbehavior is the
                                                    result of not having one's basic needs of belonging
                                                    to, and contributing to, a social group met. The child
                                                    then resorts to one of four mistaken goals: attention,
                                                    power, revenge, or avoidance of failure.

Figure 2. Children squabbling in a public           Dreikurs' main theory dealt with the misbehavior of

CC by 2.0)                                          "mistaken goals."4 The first reason for their
                                                    misbehavior is that they desire attention. If they do
they begin to feel inadequate.                      not receive the attention they crave through their
                                                    actions (good or bad, e.g., doing well on a paper or
                                                    throwing a tantrum), they move onto seeking power
                                                    (e.g., they may refuse to complete a paper). If their
                                                    power struggle is thwarted, they seek revenge. If
                                                    even revenge does not achieve the desired response,

His books list many ways to combat these behaviors. The first step is for teachers to identify the
mistaken goal while also noting their own response to the misbehavior, and observe the students'
reactions. Second, a teacher should confront the mistaken goal by providing an explanation of it
along with a discussion of the faulty logic involved. By doing so, students are given an opportunity
to examine and change their behavior. Third, Dreikurs emphasized the importance of avoiding
power struggles with students. One way is simply by withdrawing as an authority figure; teachers
can also redirect students' ambitions for power by having them participate in making decisions or
giving directions. This is called "democratic teaching."5

Dreikurs also recommended taking positive steps against revenge-seeking behavior. The teacher is
instructed to set up situations where the students can exhibit talents and strengths and ultimately
experience acceptance. Lastly, teachers should encourage students who display inadequacy by
offering these students encouragement and support for even minimal efforts.6 His overall goal was

that students would learn to cooperate reasonably, without being penalized or rewarded, because
they would feel that they are valuable contributors to the classroom.

Logical and Natural Consequences

                                                  Dreikurs described two types of consequences:

                                                  logical and natural. Logical consequences refer to

                                                  "reasonable results that follow behavior either

                                                  desirable or non-desirable." They typically require

                                                  students to make right of what they have done

                                                  wrong. For example, if students do not complete

                                                  their work during class, they are required to do it for

                                                  homework. In a democratic classroom, the students

                                                  would know in advance the consequences of their

                                                  misbehavior because as part of the classroom they

                                                  Natural consequences differ from logical

consequences in that the results following the behavior occur naturally. For example, if a student

tips his chair backward and falls, leaving him hurt or embarrassed, this would be a natural

consequence, because the hurt and embarrassment alone is a sufficient consequence for his

misbehavior.

Dreikurs did not consider punishment an effective method of discipline. He viewed punishment as
an action taken by the teacher as an act of revenge to show the students who is in charge. He
believed that punishment was humiliating and offensive to students.

Dreikurs believed in prevention, and his main focus was on constructive behavior rather than
coercive discipline. He recommended that teachers have a democratic classroom and teaching style
to help students gain a sense of belonging which is the genuine goal. In this manner, students would
have a social interest: a condition in which students would realize themselves that it is to their
advantage to contribute to the welfare of a group. Therefore, to understand children, they must be
observed in a social setting and in relationship to others, to discover the reasons for their behavior.

   Key Takeaways

         · Children who do not feel the basic need of belonging to a social group turn to attention, power,
             revenge, and avoidance of failure.

         · Misbehavior can be modified without punishment through implementing natural and logical
             consequences.

         · Dreikurs focused on pre-adolescents' reasons for their problematic behaviors and how teachers and
             parents can respond to it.

         · Humans have a basic need for unconditional positive regard and acceptance.

 Bioecological Systems Theory

  Urie Bronfenbrenner was one of the first psychologists to adopt a holistic perspective on human
  development via his Bioecological Systems Theory, which had a widespread influence on the way
  psychologists and other social scientists approach the study of human beings and their
  environments.1

                                                                   Bronfenbrenner emphasized the importance of the

                                                                   and saw the breakdown of the family as the leading

                                                                   rebellion, delinquency, and violence among

                                                                   research and the design of programs and policies
                                                                   affecting the well-being of children and families.

Bronfenbrenner's primary theoretical contribution
was his Bioecological Systems Theory, in which he
identified four types of nested systems.2
Bronfenbrenner recognized that is it necessary to
understand how not only the family or school
influences human development, but how broader
influences do as well.

The four systems are:

· Microsystem: Immediate environments such as

family, school, peer group, neighborhood, and

childcare environments.

· Mesosystem: A system comprised of

connections between immediate environments

   (i.e., a child's home and school).              Figure 2. Bronfenbrenner's Ecological theory
· Exosystem: External environmental settings       diagram (Image Source: Alyla.K, CC BY SA)

which only indirectly affect development, such

as parent's workplace.

· Macrosystem: The larger cultural context (Eastern vs. Western culture, national economy,

political culture, subculture).

Later a fifth system was added:

· Chronosystem: The patterning of environmental events and transitions over the course of life.

Each system contains roles, norms, and rules that can powerfully shape development (See Table 1.).
For example, in order to understand the issues a learner is having with math, we can't simply look at
that individual and what challenges they face directly with the subject. We have to look at the
interactions that occur between the teacher and the child. Perhaps the teacher needs to make
modifications as well. The teacher may be responding to regulations made by the school, such as
new expectations for students in math or constraints on time that interferes with the teacher's ability
to instruct. These new demands may be a response to national efforts to promote math and science
deemed important by political leaders in response to relations with other countries at a particular
time in history.

Microsystems  Microsystems impact a child directly. These are the people with whom the child interacts
              such as parents, peers, and teachers. The relationship between individuals and those around
              them need to be considered. For example, to appreciate what is going on with a student in
              math, the relationship between the student and teacher should be known.

Mesosystems   Mesosystems are interactions between environments closely surrounding the individual.
              The relationship between parents and schools, for example, will indirectly affect the child.

Exosystem     Larger institutions such as the mass media or the healthcare system are referred to as the
              ecosystem. These have an impact on families, peers, and schools that operate under policies
              and regulations found in these institutions.

Macrosystems We find cultural values and beliefs at the level of macrosystems. These larger ideals and expectations inform institutions that will ultimately impact the individual.

                       All of this happens in a historical context referred to as the chronosystem. Cultural values
Chronosystem change over time, as do the policies of educational institutions or governments in certain

                       political climates. Development occurs at a point in time.

According to the Bioecological theory, if the relationships in the immediate microsystem break
down, the child will not have the tools to explore other parts of his environment. Children looking
for the affirmations that should be present in the child/parent (or child/other important adult)
relationship look for attention in inappropriate places. These deficiencies tend to show themselves
in adolescence as anti-social behavior, lack of self-discipline, and inability to provide self-direction.3

The major assumptions of The (Bio)Ecology of Human Development, have had widespread influence on
the way psychologists and other social scientists approach the study of human beings and their
environments.4 It has been said that before Bronfenbrenner, child psychologists studied the child,
sociologists examined the family, anthropologists the society, economists the economic framework
of the times, and political scientists the political structure.

As a result of Bronfenbrenner's groundbreaking work in human ecology, these environments, from
the family to economic and political structures, have come to be viewed as part of the life course
from childhood through adulthood. The "bioecological" approach to human development broke
down barriers among the social sciences and built bridges between the disciplines that have allowed
findings to emerge about which key elements in the larger social structure, and across societies, are
vital for optimal human development.

Application of the Theory: Head Start

Bronfenbrenner played an active role in the design of developmental programs, including being one
of the founders of Head Start, the federal child development program. In 1965, his ideas and ability
to translate them into operational research models and effective social policies spurred the creation
of Head Start. One of the most successful and longest-running programs for stopping the cycle of
poverty in the United States, Head Start has provided comprehensive education, health, nutrition,
and parent involvement services to low-income children and their families.

Later Years

The following quote from Bronfenbrenner's obituary highlights the ways his work impacted the
world:

      "[Bronfenbrenner] spent many of his later years warning that the process that makes human beings
      human is breaking down as disruptive trends in American society produce ever more chaos in the lives
      of America's children. `The hectic pace of modern life poses a threat to our children second only to
      poverty and unemployment,' he said. `We are depriving millions of children--and thereby our
      country--of their birthright... virtues, such as honesty, responsibility, integrity, and compassion.'"5

macrosystem (the cultural values and the larger social system, such as immigration policy that
influences admission and social system access).6

In the context of a refugee family, the family might be influenced by their biophysical (e.g., whether
or not members were injured as they fled the persecution), their microsystem (e.g., parental conflict
while fleeing), their mesosystem (e.g., teachers and school personnel who are struggling with their
own trauma from fleeing conflict and thus their ability to provide robust services is impaired), their
exosystem (e.g., local leaders who do not consult with women living in shelters regarding their
resources needs and don't provide feminine hygiene products or children's toys), and countless other
environments.7 The family may have access to and be able to directly influence their mesosystem
and at the same time feel powerless to make changes in the exosystem. Each of these environments
will contribute to their coping.

contexts such as when considering immigrant
families. For example, a researcher could ask, "How
do Hmong immigrant families manage financial
resources in their new environment in the United
States?" and "How did Hmong families manage their
financial resources while still living in Laos?" The
assumptions and central concepts of human ecology
theory would apply equally in either culture. The
needs, values, and environment would be sensitively
identified within each culture.8

Additionally, human ecology theory assumes that families are intentional in their decision-making
and that they work toward biological sustenance, economic maintenance, and psychosocial
function. As patterns in the social environment are more and more threatening to the family's
quality of life in these three areas, the system will be more and more likely to seek change, possibly
by a move to a new country.

The family system has certain needs, including physical needs for resources and interpersonal needs

in management to meet these needs within their value system.

Galinsky's Six Stages of Parenthood

Ellen Galinsky, a researcher who studies changing family dynamics, was one of the first scholars to
emphasize the development of parents themselves, how they respond to their children's
development, and how they grow as parents.1 Parenthood is an experience that transforms one's
identity as one takes on new roles. Children's growth and development force parents to change their
roles. They must develop new skills and abilities in response to children's development. Galinsky
identified six stages of parenthood that focus on different tasks and goals (See Table 1.).2

communicating, making connections (creatively), critical thinking, taking on challenges, and self-
directed, engaged learning.

     The video below showcases how we learn these seven essential life skills and why they are important in
     the 21st century.
     The Seven Essential Life Skills.

1. The Image-Making Stage

Prospective parents enter the image-making stage when they (a) think about and form images about
their roles as parents, (b) contemplate what will emerge as a result of parenthood, and (c) prepare for
changes associated adding an infant to their family. Future parents develop ideas about what it will be
like to be a parent and what type of parent they want to be. Individuals may evaluate their
relationships with their own parents as a model for their upcoming roles as parents.

2. The Nurturing Stage

The second stage, the nurturing stage, occurs at the birth of
the baby. A parent's main goal during this stage is to develop an
attachment relationship with their baby. Parents must adapt their
romantic relationships, their relationships with their other
children, and their relationships with their own parents to
include the new infant. Some parents feel attached to their
baby immediately, but for other parents, this occurs more
gradually. Parents may have imagined their infant in specific
ways, but they now have to reconcile those images with their
actual baby. In incorporating their relationship with their child
into their other relationships, parents often have to reshape
their conceptions of themselves and their identity. Parenting
responsibilities are the most demanding during infancy
because infants are completely dependent on caregiving.

3. The Authority Stage                                             Figure 1. A parent holding her infant
                                                                   child. (Photo Credit: Jonathan Borba,
                                                                   Pexels License)

The authority stage occurs when children are 2 years old until about 4 or 5 years old. In this stage,
parents make decisions about how much authority to exert over their children's behavior. Parents must
establish rules to guide their child's behavior and development. They have to decide how strictly they
should enforce rules and what to do when rules are broken.
90 | 1980S: GALINSKY

4. The Interpretive Stage

The interpretive stage occurs when children enter school
(preschool or kindergarten) and lasts until the beginning of
adolescence. Parents interpret their children's experiences as
they are increasingly exposed to the world outside of the family.
Parents answer their children's questions, provide explanations,
and determine what behaviors and values to teach. They decide
what experiences to provide their children in terms of schooling,
neighborhood, and extracurricular activities. By this time,
parents have experience in the parenting role and often reflect
on their strengths and weaknesses as parents, review their
images of parenthood, and determine how realistic they have
been. Parents have to negotiate how involved to be with their
children, when to step in, and when to encourage children to make
choices independently.

5. The Interdependent Stage                                        Figure 2. A family with children of
                                                                   various ages.

Parents of teenagers are in the interdependent stage. They must redefine their authority and renegotiate
their relationship with their adolescent as the children increasingly make decisions independent of
parental control and authority. On the other hand, parents do not permit their adolescent children to
have complete autonomy over their decision-making and behavior, and thus adolescents and parents
must adapt their relationship to allow for greater negotiation and discussion about rules and limits.

6. The Departure Stage

During the departure stage of parenting, parents evaluate their entire parenting experience. They
prepare for their child's departure, redefine their identity as the parent of an adult child, and assess
their parenting accomplishments and failures. This stage forms a transition to a new era in parents'
lives. This stage usually spans a long time period from when the oldest child moves away (and often
returns) until the youngest child leaves. The parenting role must be redefined as a less central role in a
parent's identity.

Despite the interest in the development of parents, little research has examined developmental
changes in parents' experiences and behaviors over time. Thus, it is not clear whether these
theoretical stages are generalizable to parents of different races, ages, cultures, and religions, nor do
we have empirical data on the factors that influence individual differences in these stages. On a
practical note, how-to books and websites geared toward parental development should be evaluated
with caution, as not all advice provided is supported by research.

  The Double ABC-X model describes the impact of crises on a family. It states that the combination
  of stressors (A), the family's resources (B), and the family's definition of the event (C) will produce the
  family's experience of a crisis (X).1 2

interpreted as crises will depend on the family's other stressors, such as employment, housing,
healthcare, and family conflict; family meaning-making,(cultural and family values), and resources
(socioeconomic, family support, community).

 FAMILY SYSTEMS THEORY

     Diana Lang

  The Family Systems Theory assumes that a family is understood best by examining the family as
  one whole system. This one system is a complex, deeply-connected changing collection of parts,
  subsystems and family members, where each member has a known purpose or function.1
  Other key concepts within the Family Systems Theory include:

     · boundaries (e.g., who is a member of the system),
     · equilibrium (e.g., during stressors or crises, the system attempts to return to its original state

        wherein members are functional and comfortable), and
     · bidirectional (e.g., a change with one member will impact at least one other member, and hence

        impact the whole system).
  Based on this theory, individuals experiencing a crisis or problem are best-served by assessments
  that include other members of the system as opposed to examining only one family member.2
  This theory also assumes that families can examine their own processes and set deliberate goals.
  Change can occur when a family system acknowledges that a particular family pattern is
  dysfunctional and identifies new processes that support the family's goals. Resettlement is one
  example of a large change that a family system may choose or be forced to make.

· A family is a whole, complex, single system; each member's behaviors can impact another member.
· Key concepts--boundaries, equilibrium, bidirectional, patterns, roles, and functions.

SYSTEMIC FAMILY DEVELOPMENT THEORY

   Diana Lang

The Systemic Family Development Theory asserts that families are (a) complex, (b) extremely
diverse related to the types, numbers, and timing of transitions and stressors, and (c)
multigenerational systems. It also assumes that

families share common processes through their
development, but the processes must take into
account intergenerational influences and
variations within and between all families. No
two families are alike.1

Many studies have shown that patterns of family

interactions are similar within families across

generations.2 3 Intergenerational transmissions

of conflict, trauma, communication styles,

parenting practices, etc., continue to be        Figure 1. Extended family members of multiple

Key Takeaways

· Families are complex, diverse, and multigenerational.
· Families share common processes through their development, but there are intergenerational

   influences and variations between the number and types of crises, transitions, and stressors.
· Family interactions are typically similar across generations (intergenerational).
 FAMILY DEVELOPMENT THEORY

     Diana Lang

 Duvall's Family Development Theory

  According to Duvall's Family Development Theory (1988), families move through stages in a
  particular order across time after members successfully master tasks for each stage.1

                  Figure 1. A set of parents smile at their toddler and new baby. (Photo Source: Pixabay)

  This theory was different from other theories during this time because:

        "(a) its family life cycle dimension that provides a basis for study of families over time; (b) its emphasis
        on the developmental tasks of individual family members and of families at every stage of their
        development; (c) its built-in recognition of family stress at critical periods in development; and (d) its
        recognition ever since 1947 of the need for services, supports, and programs for families throughout
        their family life cycles."2

PARENTING STYLES
 BAUMRIND'S PARENTING STYLES

     Joel A Muraco; Wendy Ruiz; Rebecca Laff; Ross Thompson; and Diana Lang

 Diana Baumrind's Parenting Styles

  The parenting style used to rear a child will likely impact that child's future success in romantic, peer
  and parenting relationships. Diana Baumrind, a clinical and developmental psychologist, coined the
  following parenting styles: authoritative, authoritarian, and permissive/indulgent, Later, Maccoby
  and Martin added the uninvolved/neglectful style.1

                               Figure 1. Like effective teaching, effective parenting requires a mix of
                               authoritative and considerate responses to a child's needs. This
                               balance can lead to more appreciative child behavior.

  It is beneficial to evaluate the support and demandingness of a caregiver in order to determine which
  style is being used and how to effectively use it. Support refers to the amount of affection,
  acceptance, and warmth a parent provides to a child. Demandingness refers to the degree a parent
  controls a child's behavior.

Authoritative Parenting

In general, children tend to develop greater competence and self-confidence when parents have
high-but reasonable and consistent- expectations for children's behavior, communicate well with
them, are warm and responsive, and use reasoning rather than coercion to guide children's
behaviors. This kind of parenting style has been described as authoritative.2 Parents who use this
style are supportive and show interest in their kids' activities but are not overbearing and allow
children to make constructive mistakes. This "tender teacher" approach deemed the most optimal
parenting style to use in western cultures. Children whose parents use the authoritative style are
generally happy, capable, and successful.3

Authoritarian Parenting

Parents using the authoritarian ("rigid ruler")
approach are low in support and high in
demandingness. These parents expect and demand
obedience because they are "in charge" and they do
not provide any explanations for their orders.4
Parents also provide well-ordered and structured
environments with clearly stated rules.

Many would conclude that this is the parenting style  Figure 2. Authoritarian parenting called "rigid

in environments using the authoritarian approach
are more likely to be obedient and proficient, but
score lower in happiness, social competence, and
self-esteem.

Permissive Parenting

  called the indulgent-style. Their children tend to rank low in happiness and self-regulation, and are
  more likely to have problems with authority. Parents using this approach are lenient, do not expect
  their children to adhere to boundaries or rules, and avoid confrontation.5

 Uninvolved Parenting

  Children reared by parents who are low in both support and demandingness tend to rank lowest
  across all life domains, lack self-control, have low self-esteem, and are less competent than their
  peers. Parents using the uninvolved (or sometimes referred to as indifferent or neglectful) approach
  are neglectful or rejecting of their children and do not provide most, if any, necessary parenting
  responsibilities.

 Parenting Styles and Outcomes for Children

  Parenting style has been found to predict child well-being in the domains of social competence,
  academic performance, psychosocial development, and problem behavior. Research in the United
  States, based on parent interviews, child reports, and parent observations consistently finds:

     · Children and adolescents whose parents use the authoritative style typically rate themselves and
        are rated by objective measures as more socially and instrumentally competent than those
        whose parents do not use the authoritative style.6 7 8

     · Children and adolescents whose parents are uninvolved typically perform most poorly in all
        domains.

In general, parental responsiveness tends to predict social competence and psychosocial functioning,
while parental demandingness is typically associated with instrumental competence and behavioral
control (e.g., academic performance and deviance). These findings indicate:

· Children and adolescents reared in households using the authoritarian style (high in
   demandingness, but low in responsiveness) tend to perform moderately well in school and be
   uninvolved in problem behavior, but tend to have poorer social skills, lower self-esteem, and
   higher levels of depression when compared to their peers who are reared in households using
   the authoritative approach.

· Children and adolescents reared in homes using the indulgent style (high in responsiveness, low
   in demandingness) tend to be more involved in problem behavior and perform less well in
   school, but they have been shown to have higher self-esteem, better social skills, and lower levels
   of depression when compared to their peers who are not reared using the indulgent style.9

Table 1. Four parenting styles. Other, less advantageous parenting styles include authoritarian (in contrast
                                           to authoritative), permissive, and uninvolved.

In reviewing the literature on parenting styles, it is apparent that using the authoritative parenting
style is associated with both instrumental and social competence and lower levels of problem
behavior at all developmental stages for youth in the United States. The benefits of using the
authoritative parenting style and the detrimental effects of the uninvolved parenting style are
evident as early as the preschool years and continue throughout adolescence and into early
adulthood.

   Czech Republic,10 India,11 China,12 Israel,13 and Palestine.14 In fact, authoritative parenting appears to
   be superior in Western, individualistic societies--so much so that some people have argued that
   there is no longer a need to study it.15
   Other researchers are less certain about authoritative parenting and point to differences in cultural
   values and beliefs. For example, while many children reared in European-American cultures fare
   poorly with too much strictness (authoritarian parenting), children reared in Chinese cultures often
   perform well, especially academically. The reason for this likely stems from Chinese culture viewing
   strictness in parenting as related to training, which is not central to American parenting beliefs.16
   As children mature, parent-child relationships should naturally adapt to accommodate
   developmental changes. Parent-child relationships that do not adapt to a child's abilities can lead to
   high parent-child conflict and ultimately a reduced parent-child relationship quality.17

      Key Takeaways

              · The authoritative (the "tender teacher") approach is the most optimal style for use in the U.S.
              · The ways in which parents rear children can have lifelong impacts on children's development.

  Researchers have identified additional parenting approaches that are not applicable to Baumrind's
  styles, definitions, or outcomes. Below is an overview of three of these approaches-overindulgent
  parenting, helicopter parenting, and traditional parenting.

 Overindulgent Parenting

  Overindulgent parenting is providing children with too much of what "looks good, too soon, too
  long."1 Oftentimes, it appears that parents implement these strategies to fulfill their own unmet
  needs or feelings of neglect from their own childhood.
  Examples include giving children an overabundance of:

     · things or experiences that are not developmentally appropriate for the child,
     · family resources that appear to meet the child's needs but do not,
     · anything that actively harms or prevents a child from developing and achieving one's full

        potential, and
     · freedom with minimal boundaries and limits that are developmentally-inappropriate for the

        child.2

 Helicopter Parenting

  Helicopter parenting is characterized by caregivers who are extremely overinvolved in their child's life
  due to the belief that they can protect their child's physical and/or emotional well-being. Caregivers
  using this approach appear overbearing and overprotective due to the close attention they pay to all
  of their child's problems and successes. Parents "hover overhead" by constantly overseeing or being
  excessively interested in every aspect of their child's life. Some contend that cell phones are "the
  world's longest umbilical cord" which is contributing to this phenomenon.3

             2. long-term mental health problems,

For example, many families who self-identify as Asian Americans and Latino Americans engage in
high demandingness and expect respect and obedience of their children. However, these caregivers
also value closeness and love which is different from the authoritarian parenting style. Adolescents
who grow up in families using traditional parenting style characteristics tend to show higher
academic achievements and lower behavioral and psychological problems when compared to their
peers who are reared by caregivers using the authoritarian approach. These positive outcomes may
be related to the closeness and love shown to children, which is different from the "cold" or "distant"
characteristics consistent with the authoritarian style. 7 Additional, less-researched parenting styles

CHILD-REARING STRATEGIES
CHILD-REARING AND GUIDANCE

   Diana Lang

Parents and caregivers have a responsibility to guide and promote positive socialization strategies
for children in their care. These activities are known as discipline or guidance-two words that are
often used interchangeably in parenting education. Discipline is defined as "ongoing teaching and
nurturing that facilitates self-control, self-direction, competence, and care for others". 1 It is
recommended that caregivers utilize a comprehensive disciplinary approach for guiding children's
behaviors.

Caregivers should proactively teach children how to
regulate their own behaviors by using age- and
developmentally--appropriate strategies that
enhance:

· positive, supportive, and nurturing caregiver-    Figure 1. A family teaching a child to ride a bicycle
   child relationships,                             with support. (Photo Source: Agung Pandit
                                                    Wiguna, Pexel License)
· safety, permanency, and consistency,
· acceptable behavioral patterns by removing

   reinforcements to eliminate undesired behaviors
   and providing positive reinforcements to
   strengthen desired behaviors, and
· cognitive, socioemotional, and executive
   functioning skills.

For optimal outcomes, all of the above components must consistently function well in an
individualized manner for each child, and within the context of youth, feeling loved, safe, and
secure. Recommended child-rearing strategies are outlined in upcoming pages.

Examples

Examples of caregivers' guidance by stage:

    · Newborns: recognize and respond flexibly to infant's needs while providing generally structured
        daily routines.

    · Infants and toddlers: use limitations, protection, and structure to create safe spaces for play and
        exploration.

    · Early childhood: utilize creative and individualized strategies to guide children's desirable behavior
        patterns to become their "typical interactions".

    · School-age: increase children's own responsibility for self-control via the integration of previously-
        developed internalized rules of conduct.

    · Adolescence: change strategies to foster more autonomy, self-regulation, and responsibility while
        guiding teens' safety and positive decision-making skills.

ACTIVE LISTENING

   Diana Lang

Active listening is a type of communication strategy between two or more people that consists of
paying attention to what someone is saying and attempting to understand what is being said.
Clinical research studies demonstrate that active listening can be a catalyst in one's personal growth.
For example, children are more likely to listen to themselves if someone else allows them to speak
and successfully convey their message. 1

Learning how to actively listen takes time, practice, and full
commitment. Once achieved, it can build a strong
foundation for positive communication resulting in a strong
caregiver-child relationship by building trust throughout the
lifespan. This strategy also tends to improve the quality of
conversations by connecting with others on a deeper level, 2
which can lead to more positive and healthy relationships.3

How to use this method:

· Caregivers should be on the child's level and listen in an

attentive, nonjudgmental, non-interrupting manner.

· Listeners should pay close attention to possible hidden

messages and meanings contained in the verbal                 Figure 1. A doctor stops and listens to a
communication and should note all non-verbal                  child explain how they feel. (Image
communication from the child.4                                Source: Latrobebohs, CC by-SA 3.0)

· It is important to remember that you are not giving your

opinion and thoughts regarding what the child relays to you; you are paraphrasing what the

child said and expressing back to the child the emotions the child conveyed.

Example

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's website provides useful information about active
listening.5

Key Takeaways

     · Active listening is paying attention and attempting to understand what someone else is saying.
     · It is important to note hidden messages in verbal and non-verbal communications.
     · It is important to refrain from giving opinions while paraphrasing what the other person is saying.

ANTICIPATORY STRUCTURE

   Diana Lang

                                                    Anticipatory structure is a strategy where
                                                    caregivers share plans and provide forewarnings to
                                                    children regarding upcoming transitions between
                                                    activities. This can help establish routines and
                                                    facilitate more smooth changes in routines. It also
                                                    allows time for children to prepare for changes,
                                                    which can heighten their cooperation when the
                                                    change happens.

                                                    Anticipatory structure is most effective when

(Photo Source: Josh Willink, Pexels License)        asked to do, and use age-appropriate language that

                                                    the child can understand. 1 It is helpful for parents

to provide praise or compliments for their children as they follow each step and meet the end goal.

Example

· A parent tells their children that it is almost time to go to bed and they have ten minutes to finish
   playing and then they need to put their toys away. Later the parent reminds the children again and
   tells them that they have five minutes left to play and then they need to have all of their toys put
   away. After five minutes, the parent makes sure the children's toys are put away and asks them to
   get ready for bed by reminding them of their regular bedtime routine.

Key Takeaway

· Anticipatory structure provides forewarnings to changes in activities and can help establish
   routines and cooperation.
CALM

   Diana Lang

The CALM method is a technique for parents to use to communicate with their children, whether
that be talking through a conflict or just sharing about what happened that day. The goal of this
method is to give children a voice and help them feel heard. The "best-practice" way to utilize this
method would be to implement it every time your child wants to have a conversation one-on-one
with you.

  · Connect
  · Affect
  · Listen
  · Mirroring

How to use this method:

CONNECT. The first step in the CALM method is
connecting with the child. This means putting aside
any and all distractions in order to give your full and
undivided attention to what the child says to you.

AFFECT. The second step is affect, which is

emotion. This means you want to share and show

your emotions and feelings with your children and

let them know that you have the same emotions as

they do. Through this, they can see that you

understand and empathize with what they are going        Figure 1. Parents often have to juggle giving
through or telling you.                                  attention to multiple children, which may lead to
                                                         outbursts if one child feels neglected. In these
LISTEN. The third step is listening to the child by      cases, the CALM method may be of help. (Photo
repeating what is said back to you or asking for         Source: Anna Shvets, Pexels License)

clarifications to help the child feel listened to and heard.

MIRRORING. The fourth and final step is mirroring. This is when you (a) make sure you fully
understand what the child is telling you, (b) clear up any questions or misunderstandings by
                                                                                                                                                      CALM | 125

paraphrasing (back to the child) what the child said, and (c) share in your child's thoughts and
feelings.1

   Example and Video

Your daughter, Deidre, came to you upset because
she didn't win a contest at school.

First, you would connect by removing all of your
distractions (putting away phone, stopping what
you are doing), turning your attention to her, and
making eye contact with her.

Next, you would show how her actions affected           Figure 2. A parent comforts their crying child. (Photo
you by having an upset look on your face and tone in    Source: codewan, CC0)
your voice to show you understand her emotions.

After this, you would listen to what she tells you and
then clarify details to show Deidre you are invested
in the conversation.

Lastly, you would mirror the interaction back to Deidre by paraphrasing what she told you to show you
care about her thoughts and feelings.

By using this technique, children will be able to see and feel that you are listening, caring, and involved in
what they are telling you. You want them to feel that they can come to you and trust you about anything
going on in their life, big or small.

CONSTRUCTIVE CHOICES

   Diana Lang

Constructive choices are a child-rearing strategy
where parents provide the child with options for the
child when making decisions. This allows children
to be involved in making choices in their everyday
activities, while still maintaining choices that are
positive and safe.

This strategy can help children learn how to make     Figure 1. A child playing with toy vehicles. (Photo
decisions, and it teaches and guides children about   Source: Pxfuel, DMCA)
how to analyze their decision-making abilities so
they can eventually make decisions on their own. 1

How to use this method:

· Limit the number of times you give a child a choice,
· Limit the number of choices you give a child (two to four choices work well),
· Provide developmentally-appropriate choices that keep the child safe and healthy,
· Support the child's decision, and
· Help children think about their choices and the reasoning behind making each decision.

Example

· A caregiver may give a child a choice to keep playing with their toys inside or to clean up the toys
   and go play outside.

 FOUR PLUSES AND A WISH

     Diana Lang

  Four Pluses and a Wish is a parenting strategy aimed at creating cooperation and motivation for
  children to comply with parental requests. Along with leading to better behavior outcomes, it also
  works to foster healthy communication and is a good example of parental supportive speech. Four
  Pluses and a Wish involves the parent providing three pluses, which are positive actions toward their
  child, before making a request. This helps the child feel more respected by their parents and
  therefore more likely to comply with parental wishes and requests. There are four steps to follow for
  this strategy. 1

                         FOUR PLUSES AND A WISH | 129

How to use this method:

Plus 1

Smile: The parent approaches the child with a smile and a happy facial expression to show the child
that nothing is wrong.

Plus 2

Relaxed body language: The parent displays a relaxed body and uses a friendly voice to communicate
friendliness and acceptance toward the child.

Plus 3

Say the child's name: For children, hearing a parent say their name feels more personal, is affirming,
and helps make them feel included and respected in the communication.

Plus 4

Compliment the child: Make a positive comment on something the child is doing, wearing, etc., to
make the child feel appreciated.

The Wish

Make the request: After providing four pluses for the child, the parent can then make a request (the
wish). 2

   Example

     Luke is playing with blocks and his mother comes into the room.
     Luke's mother: "Luke, it's almost time for dinner, please clean up your toys and wash your hands."
     Luke: "I don't want to clean up yet. I want to keep playing."
     Luke's mother smiles at Luke and with relaxed body language, kneels to his level. "Luke, that is a great car
     you built with your blocks, you did a good job building it. Could you put it away for a while and come
     wash your hands for dinner, please?"
     Luke smiled and complied with his mother's request.

   Key Takeaways

         · Three positive actions are made towards the child before making a request.
         · This method promotes cooperation and compliance with requests.
GROUNDING

   Diana Lang

Grounding is a technique in which caregivers teach children that there are consequences to their
actions by taking away certain privileges or freedoms. This is especially beneficial to start using at
around 12 years of age, when many children are starting to gain new freedoms and may push the
limits.

The goals of grounding are to provide the child with appropriate limits and boundaries and teach the
child that there are consequences to behaving in certain ways, such as pushing these limits or
crossing these boundaries. If a child chooses to behave in contrast to the limits or boundaries set by
a caregiver, grounding can be the logical consequence for the child's behavior. 1

How to use this method:

· Start early: From as early on as preschool, a

caregiver can begin to set boundaries and family

rules for the child and should explain to the

child that not following these will lead to

consequences.

· Choose specific activities to take away that are

desirable to the child: When grounding, choose

a tangible activity, privilege, or freedom to take

away from the child such as toys, television time,

or playing with friends. The activity, privilege,

   or freedom must be something the child enjoys    Figure 1. Cell phones are a common item removed
   or this method will be ineffective.              when grounding a child. (Image Source: pxfuel,
· Do not give in to guilt: Even though a caregiver  CC0 1.0)

may feel bad and want to give the privileges back to the child early, the child must learn that

poor decisions lead to negative consequences; a child will not learn the lessons that grounding

aims to teach if a caregiver does not follow through with the entire process.

· Consistency is key: Caregivers must consistently follow through with all consequences in order

for grounding, or any other guidance technique, strategy, or method, to be beneficial and

   132 | GROUNDING

        successful in their child's life. 2

     Example

            · Lucy's parents have established the rule that Lucy can only be out with friends until 11 p.m. on
                weeknights.

            · One night, Lucy did not follow this rule and came back home at 1 a.m.
            · As a consequence, Lucy's primary caregiver decides to not allow Lucy to go out with her friends in

                the evening for the next week and take her cell phone away from her for three days.

     Key Takeaways

            · Grounding is when caregivers take away certain privileges or freedoms from a child as a
                consequence for undesirable behaviors.

            · The goal is to provide limits and boundaries to teach children that there are consequences when
                boundaries are crossed.

            · The removed privilege or freedom MUST be desirable to the child or it will not be effective in
                changing the behavior.

            · Once caregivers state the consequences, they must follow through with the consequence or the
                child's behavior will likely remain the same.

I-MESSAGES

   Diana Lang

I-messages are effective communication techniques to use when talking with another person. The
goals of I-messages are to keep interactions positive, and avoid blame, guilt, judgment, and shame. I-
messages express your own feelings, while "you" messages place assumptions or judgments onto the
person with whom you are speaking. A "you" message would sound like, "You need to pay more
attention!" or "You shouldn't be acting like that."1

Figure 1. A child playing with blocks (Photo Source:  Here is an example of turning a "you" message into
Tatiana Syrikova, Pexels License)                     an I-message. The "you" message might be
                                                      something like, "You always disobey our rules and
                                                      do whatever you want!" However, turning it into an
                                                      I-message might sound more like this, "I feel angry
                                                      when you disobey the rules we've laid out for you
                                                      because I feel disrespected. I like it when you obey
                                                      the rules, guidelines, and boundaries we have in this
                                                      family because it makes me feel like you care about
                                                      me, yourself, and the whole family."2

                                                      How to use this method:

· "I feel ___
· When ___
· Because ___
· I like ___"3

This outline expresses how you feel about a given situation, action, or behavior by explaining what
you feel, why you feel that way, and what you would like the desired behavior to be.

   Example

         · "I feel worried and anxious when it is one hour past the time you were to be home and I have not
             heard from you because I fear something bad has happened. I like it when you keep in touch with
             me if you might be late. I need you to contact me if you will be late."

   Key Takeaway

         · I-messages start with the word "I," express your own feelings to keep communication positive, and
             help avoid blame and judgment onto the other person.
INDUCTION

   Diana Lang

Induction can be used to help youth develop empathy,1 guide their behaviors, take ownership of
their actions, learn acceptable behaviors, and understand how their actions may impact themselves
(self-centered induction) and others (other-oriented induction).2

How to use this method:

When you have a child's full attention:

· Explain how one's actions can affect themselves

and others (positively and negatively).

· Use a child's actions as an example to discuss

and recommend expectations for acceptable

behavior.

· Model desired behaviors for a child to imitate.

· Use others' actions as examples to discuss and

assess how behaviors can impact others'

   feelings.                                       Figure 1. Riding a bicycle in the road can be
· Encourage, discuss, and reward desired           dangerous, but explaining that to a child requires
                                                   patience and understanding. (Photo Source:
   behaviors.                                      Pixabay, Pixabay License)
· Explain and discourage undesirable actions.

· Be consistent and proactive by communicating expectations, discussing outcomes, and

identifying feelings related to behaviors on an ongoing basis.

Children reared in an environment that uses this approach tend to have higher moral reasoning,
internalized standards for behaviors, prosocial skills, and resistance to external influences when
compared to their peers who have not been exposed to this technique3.

136 | INDUCTION

   Example

         · If a child is taking a sibling's toys, a caregiver can explain, "When you take your brother's toys, it
             causes him to feel sad and that you do not like him. How might you feel if your friend took your
             bike out of our yard without asking you?"

   Key Takeaway

         · Induction is used to help children understand how their behaviors affect themselves and others,
             take ownership of their actions, and guide them to engage in acceptable behaviors.
NATURAL AND LOGICAL CONSEQUENCES

   Diana Lang

For definitions and examples of natural and logical consequences see the Dreikurs chapter.

Caregivers can use both natural and logical
consequences for children to learn better behaviors.
Both natural and logical consequences encourage
children to take responsibility for their actions and
behaviors, but in different ways. 1

Natural consequences allow children to learn from

the natural outcomes of a situation 2 and logical

consequences allow the parent to set the

consequences of a child's undesired actions or         Figure 1. A young girl plays with a toy doll. (Photo

                                                       3.0)
Logical consequences work best when consequences

are immediate and consistent. It is also important to talk with the child about the behavior and to

discuss what alternative behaviors would be better to use. 4

   Examples

         · Natural consequence: Sophie leaves her favorite hair styling doll outside overnight. It rains on
             Sophie's doll and ruins its hair. Now Sophie's doll is ruined and she is no longer able to style the
             doll's hair.

         · Logical consequence: Juan hits a baseball into his neighbor's yard and breaks the neighbor's
             window. Juan's parents require Juan to apologize to the neighbor and to complete chores around
             their own home in order to pay for the neighbor's broken window.

   Key Takeaways

         · Natural consequences are when a child learns from and experiences the natural outcomes of
             situations.

         · Logical consequences are when parents set the consequences of a child's behaviors.
                   This works best when the consequences are immediate and consistent.
 NO-LOSE METHOD

     Diana Lang

  This is a democratic approach that results in caregivers and children resolving conflict in a manner
  in which all parties are satisfied with the solution.

 How to use this method:

     · Define: All parties communicate their perspectives of the "problem".
     · Brainstorm Solutions: All parties list all possible solutions to resolve the issue.
     · Assess Solutions: All parties decide and discuss how they feel about all of the solutions.
     · Best Solution: All parties decide upon and agree to implement the best solution.
     · Plan in Action: All parties put the best solution into practice.
     · Follow-Up: Adult(s) proactively discuss the problem and solution with the child(ren) to revisit

        the situation1.

1. Heath, P. (2013). Parent-child relations: Context, research, and application (3rd Ed.). Pearson.
140 | NO-LOSE METHOD

   Example

· Define: The "problem" is that siblings are fighting

over a book.

· Brainstorm Solutions: The children can take turns

reading the book; each child can read a different

book; both children can read with each other at

the same time with that book; a parent can

remove the book so both children need to find

different books.

· Assess Solutions: Both children want to read the     Figure 1. Siblings. (Photo Source: AnukEvo,
   book together.                                      CCby-SA 4.0)

· Best Solution: The children and parent agree that

the children will read the book together as long as the children do not fight. If they fight while

reading the book, the parent will remove the book and both children will need to take a break.

· Plan in Action: The children read the book together and do not fight.

· Follow-Up: Later that same day, the parent asks if they both enjoyed reading that book together.

Both children agreed it was an enjoyable time. The parent praised them for not fighting and for

solving the issue.

Key Takeaways

     · This method is used to resolve conflict where every party involved discusses their perspective on
         the problem and possible solutions.

     · A solution that satisfies all parties is decided and agreed upon.
 PROBLEM OWNERSHIP

     Diana Lang

  Problem ownership is an important tool to utilize when caregivers are communicating with children
  because it can help avoid blaming and arguing. This is when caregivers take time to reflect on an
  issue and think, "Whose problem is this? Who is actually upset about this?" Sometimes we may think
  the child is the one with the problem when actually we are the ones getting upset. In reality, the child
  is just fine - we are the ones that have a problem. This is when a caregiver should own the problem.
  If a caregiver owns the problem, it is a perfect opportunity to utilize effective communication
  strategies such as I-Messages to express one's thoughts and feelings regarding the problem.
  If, however, the child owns the problem, caregivers can use this as a chance to practice adult-child
  interaction techniques such as active listening and the CALM method to connect with the child
  concerning the problem.
  Problem ownership helps caregivers determine which problems they need to figure out themselves,
  and which problems they should allow their children to figure out. This provides a learning
  experience to gain responsibility for one's actions that can be utilized in other relationships as well. 1

   Example

Third-grader tells his dad, "Caleb is not my friend anymore!"

Dad: (active listening) "So, I hear that you are upset.
What happened?"

Third-grader: "Caleb knocked down our entire
snow fort during recess today! It took us three
entire recesses to build it!"

(Dad feels sad for his son and wants to advocate for     Figure 1. An elaborate snow fort. (Photo Source:
his son. Dad contemplates calling the teacher or         brothersforever)
Caleb's parents. After reflecting, Dad asks himself,
"Whose problem is this? It's my son who is upset. I
need to help him navigate this and let him know he
can talk to me about these types of issues." Dad
decides to ask open-ended questions and use active
listening to learn more about the entire situation.)

Dad: Why don't you tell me what happened.

Third-grader: Well... (child has the opportunity to retell the incident and decide for himself, with his dad's
nurturing and understanding support, what to do about the problem).

This type of interaction allows a parent to provide support while assisting the child with ways to resolve
or work through a problem.

Key Takeaways

     · Problem ownership is when an issue is reflected upon and analyzed to determine who is upset and
         who owns the problem in a situation.

     · A solution can be determined based on who owns the problem.
POSITIVE LANGUAGE

   Diana Lang

The manner in which parents communicate with their
child can largely determine the child's own
communication methods and language development and
can affect the child's vocabulary and speaking skills over
time. Using positive language can greatly support and
encourage the child as they get older. 1

How to use this method:

· Respond quickly and kindly to a child's needs.

· Provide a listening ear or advice even at

inconvenient times.

· Be responsive and consistent.

· Use positive and encouraging words when speaking

   with a child.                                            Figure 1. Communicating on a child's level
· Set a good example of how to talk to other people in      can remove stress from an otherwise

   public as well as at home by using manners and           Elliott, Pexels License)
   respect, such as saying "please," "thank you," and "I'm

sorry."

· Avoid sarcasm or ill-willed teasing.

· Use positive, communicative forms of guidance and avoid any form of violent discipline such as

spanking.

· Spend time alone with each child, even at a young age. Quality time coupled with open

communication encourages the child to feel safe and comfortable with their parents and creates

a reliable relationship. 2

   Examples

         · Peter and Dan's mother always says, "Thank you for picking up your toys" after they put away the
             toys in their playroom.

         · Kaila returns home from school and says that she has had a bad day at school. Kaila's dad asks her
             what had made it a bad day and listens to Kaila explain what had happened.

   Key Takeaway

         · Using phrases such as, "I'm sorry," "please," "thank you", and "I love you" often for children of all
             ages are recommended!
REDIRECTING

   Diana Lang and Jack Maass

Redirection: Verbal and Physical

Verbal and physical redirection help promote desirable behaviors by directing children's attention to
a different activity, toy, or behavior. These strategies help teach appropriate behavior, prevent
injuries, reduce punishments, remove children from situations, and promote learning and
exploration. The goal is to provide children with easy-to-understand alternative actions (verbally
and/or physically) instead of using threats, punishments, or telling children what not to do.

How to Use Verbal and Physical Redirection

 1. Maintain eye contact and come down to the child's level. Let children know that the act they are
      performing is unacceptable by using a firm, nurturing voice.

 2. Explain why the behavior is unacceptable in a clear, consistent, developmentally appropriate
      manner. This will help children associate these words with the undesirable action.

 3. Encourage children to practice the desired outcome immediately. For example, instead of telling
      children not to stand on chairs, verbally explain that they need to sit down while gently touching
      them to help them sit down carefully.

 4. Use physical and verbal redirection to foster children's curiosity. For instance, encourage them
      to participate in desired acts that they will undoubtedly want to join.

 5. Provide positive reinforcement and praise for completing the act in a desirable manner.

Verbal redirection is effective without physical redirection, but physical redirection is not effective
without verbal redirection. As in most forms of child rearing, communication is a pivotal component
of effective parenting strategies. Physical redirection tends to be more effective with younger
children because they are still developing their language comprehension. As children develop
additional cognitive and language skills, physical redirection should be used less frequently and
verbal redirection should be used more often. An extremely important part of effective physical
redirection is adding a gentle, nurturing touch simultaneously with the verbal redirection.

               REDIRECTING | 147

Key Takeaways

· Verbal redirection should always include explanations of the correct action that a child can
   understand while using a gentle, nurturing voice.

· Avoid using threats and telling children what not to do.
· Physical redirection should always be used in combination with verbal redirection.
· Consistent language is key for effective redirection so children associate the same words with

   undesirable actions.
· It is important to use the same steps and words if children repeat the same behavior. Consistency is

   key when reinforcing positive behaviors and deterring negative behaviors.
 REWARD-ORIENTED PARENTING AND
 POSITIVE REINFORCEMENT

     Diana Lang

  There are many ways to increase the likelihood of children exhibiting desirable behaviors by using
  positive reinforcements and rewards.1 To learn how to effectively reinforce behaviors, please re-visit
  the Skinner chapter.

  Parents or teachers may wish to reinforce children for:

     · Listening attentively;
     · Using appropriate manners (e.g., saying "please," "you are welcome," and "thank you");
     · Moving and talking in a manner appropriate for the environment (e.g., using "library voices;"

        "walking feet");
     · Playing nicely;
     · Completing tasks without reminders; and
     · Calling or texting if they will be late.

  Examples of rewards and positive reinforcements include:2

     · Complimenting a child's behavior (e.g., "I really like the way you put all of your clothes away in
        your room");

     · Praising a child's actions (e.g., "I am proud of how hard you studied for your spelling quiz.");
     · Giving additional privileges;
     · Clapping or cheering;
     · Thanking them for behaving a certain way (e.g., "Thank you very much for asking such a

        detailed question;" "I really appreciate you using your inside voice while we were at the
        museum.");
     · Making sure they overhear you telling someone else about their positive behavior;
     · Smiling at them; and
     · Giving tangible rewards (e.g., stickers, incentives).

In order for these methods to be effective, rewards or incentives must:

  · be important or valuable to the child,
  · occur immediately after the desired behavior, and
  · consistently be implemented.

To learn how to create a reward program, visit the CDC's website for information.

   Examples

Here is a common example of (unintentionally and positively) rewarding inappropriate behavior: An aunt
provides candy to her nephew every time he throws a tantrum in the store because he wants candy at the
checkout lane.

The aunt reinforces the poor behavior (e.g., a tantrum) by
providing reinforcers (e.g., candy and attention) every
time he throws a tantrum at the grocery store.

Here is an example of positively rewarding the same

child to stop the tantrums: Now that this child

throws a tantrum with his parents when they go to

the grocery store, his parents provide their son with

candy only when he does not throw a tantrum in the

store.                                                      Figure 1. A child panicking in public. (Photo

throwing a tantrum) by providing reinforcers (e.g., candy

and attention) every time they go to the grocery store and he refrains from throwing a tantrum.
STRUCTURE (WITH FLEXIBILITY):
ROUTINES, RULES, DIRECTIONS

   Diana Lang

Children (and most people of all ages) thrive in flexibly-structured environments. For children, the
sense of knowing what to expect typically elicits feelings of safety and security. Caregivers can help
children reduce feelings of chaos by providing flexible, but consistent:

  · Routines,
  · Rules, and
  · Concrete, explicit directions with easy-to-understand expectations.

Rules and Routines

In order to maintain consistent routines (e.g.,
bedtimes, traditions) and rules (e.g., not eating food
in certain areas of the house, curfews, wearing a
helmet while riding a bicycle) it is important to
facilitate and adhere to them as much as possible.
Expectations should be developmentally-appropriate
and communicated in a manner that can be easily
understood. 1

For instance, perhaps family meals are at 6:30 p.m.

because this is the time that everyone gets home

from work and school activities. This expectation

and all moderations should be communicated with         Figure 1. Setting routines is particularly important

Exceptions that may change a family mealtime might

include attending a school-related activity or having a large family gathering every Sunday at 1:30

p.m.

Directions

Specific, warm, concrete, understandable directions and expectations can improve behaviors,
prevent dangerous circumstances, reduce caregivers' frustrations, and foster children's learning of
appropriate behaviors. It is most effective to tell children exactly what behaviors you desire.

   Examples

· "Please use your walking feet while we are in the library," is more detailed than saying, "Stop that!"
· Another example is, "We must hold hands in the parking lot to avoid getting hit by a car," instead of

   "Hey, come back here!" as the child runs through the parking lot.
· Visit this website from the CDC to learn how to give good directions.
· Watch this YouTube video to learn how to provide quality directions.

Consistency, Consistency, Consistency with Warmth

                                                                 Research shows that children's abilities to anticipate

                                                                 independence are fostered by warm, safe, stable,
                                                                 nurturing, caring, compassionate caregiving on a
                                                                 consistent basis! This means that routines, rules,

   152 | STRUCTURE (WITH FLEXIBILITY): ROUTINES, RULES, DIRECTIONS

  directions, expectations, and consequences should be responded to or applied every time in a
  nurturing, warm, consistent manner.2 3

     Key Takeaways

            · Providing a warm, close, nurturing, and openly-communicative environment with consistent
                routines, directions, and rules with reasonable flexibility are key for eliciting feelings of
                predictability and security. 4

            · It is not too late to learn, teach, and reinforce these skills for caregivers and youth. However, it may
                take time and practice to elicit changes.

TAKING AWAY PRIVILEGES

   Diana Lang

Taking away privileges can be used both at
home and in the classroom as a way to
discipline children. Within the classroom,
teachers may take away privileges, such as the
ability to participate in extracurricular activities
(e.g., sports, music) if students are not
performing well academically. At-home
caregivers may take away privileges such as
allowances, technology, toys, or time with
friends when the child does not follow the
rules.1

Both within the classroom and at home, setting        Figure 1. Children learning in a classroom. (Photo

important parts of this child-rearing strategy.

When standards are set and communicated with the children, it allows children to know what is

expected of them and when they do not meet these expectations then consequences, such as taking

away privileges will happen.2

· A child does not do their homework, so their caregiver takes away the child's cell phone until they
   have done their homework.

TIME-INS AND TIME-OUTS

                                                   are both calm and can communicate about the issue
                                                   at hand. When using a time-in the caregiver should
                                                   stay with the child, and listen to the child and what
                                                   they are feeling. Once the child has calmed down
                                                   then the caregiver and child can discuss the child's
                                                   behavior and what needs to be changed. Time-ins
                                                   allow for children to not feel threatened and learn in
                                                   a positive way. The caregiver and child are able to
                                                   connect reducing power struggles since everyone's
                                                   feelings and needs are considered. 1

A more common and somewhat opposite approach is the use of time-outs. Time-outs are a less
positive approach and can be less effective compared to time-ins. Time-outs are where a child is left
to sit alone somewhere away from the caregiver for a set amount of time. To learn about time-outs,
such as how and when to use them, visit the cdc's parent essentials site.

Example

     Watch this video from the CDC to learn about using time-outs.

Both time-ins and time-outs are used to:
  · stop undesirable behavior,
  · help children learn better coping skills, and
  · give parents and children a chance to calm down.

   Key Takeaways

         · Threats and punishments (e.g., time-outs) are often less effective than positive parenting strategies
             (e.g., time-ins) for changing behaviors.

         · Not all children respond well to time-outs.

CHILD-REARING IN A VARIETY OF
CONTEXTS
 CHILD ABUSE, NEGLECT, AND FOSTER CARE

     Diana Lang and Wikimedia contributors

  Child abuse takes many forms. Children can be physically or sexually assaulted, and they may also
  suffer from emotional abuse and neglect of many different forms. Whatever form it takes, child
  abuse is a serious problem.

  It is especially difficult to know how much child abuse occurs. Infants obviously cannot talk, and
  toddlers and older children who are abused usually do not tell anyone about the abuse. They might
  not define it as abuse, they might be scared to tell a trusted adult, they might blame themselves for
  being abused, or they might not know with whom they could talk about their abuse. Whatever the
  reason, children usually remain silent, thus making it very difficult to know how much abuse takes
  place. Up-to-date statistics on the different types of child abuse in the United States can be found at
  the U.S. Children's Bureau website.

 Abuse

  Abuse can occur in multiple forms and across all family relationships. Breiding, Basile, Smith, Black,
  and Mahendra (2015) define the forms of abuse as:

     · Physical abuse, the use of intentional physical force to cause harm. Scratching, pushing,
        shoving, throwing, grabbing, biting, choking, shaking, slapping, punching, and hitting are
        common forms of physical abuse;

     · Sexual abuse, the act of forcing someone to participate in a sex act against the person's will.
        Such abuse is often referred to as sexual assault or rape.

     · Psychological abuse, aggressive behavior that is intended to control someone else. Such abuse
        can include threats of physical or sexual abuse, manipulation, bullying, and stalking.1

  Abuse between partners is referred to as intimate partner violence; however, such abuse can also
  occur between a parent and child (child abuse), adult children and their aging parents (elder abuse),
  and between siblings.2

  The most common form of child abuse is neglect. Child neglect is a deficit in meeting a child's basic
  needs, such as failure to provide adequate nutrition, supervision, health care, clothing, or housing, as
  well as other physical, emotional, social, educational, and safety needs. All societies have established
  necessary behaviors a caregiver must provide in order for a child to develop well within the domains
  of physical, social, and emotional development. Causes of neglect may result from caregivers
  experiencing problems associated with mental disorders, unplanned pregnancy, substance abuse,
  unemployment, over-employment, domestic violence, and, in special cases, poverty.
  Child neglect depends on how a child and society perceives the caregivers' behaviors; it is not how
  parents or caregivers believe they are behaving toward their child.3 Caregiver's failure to provide for
  a child, when options are available, is different from failure to provide when options are not
  available. Poverty and lack of resources are often contributing factors that may prevent caregivers
  from meeting children's needs, when they otherwise would be able to meet those needs.4
  There are various types of child neglect which include:

     · Physical neglect is the failure to provide a child with basic necessities of life such as adequate
        food, shelter, and clothing.

     · Medical neglect is the failure of caregivers to meet a child's basic health care needs. Examples
        include not brushing teeth on a daily basis, not bathing a child, and/or taking children to doctor
        visits when needed.

     · Emotional neglect is the failure to provide emotional support such as emotional security and
        encouragement (love, nurturance, etc.).

     · Educational and developmental neglect include the failure to provide children with experiences
        necessary for normative growth and development. These may include failing to ensure children
        receive adequate education or experiences that help foster normative, developmental standards.

     · Depending on the laws and child protective policies in one's area, leaving a young child
        unsupervised may be considered neglect, especially if doing so places the child in danger.

families. There are many reasons people may become
abusers, such as poverty, stress, and substance abuse are
common characteristics shared by abusers, although
abuse can happen in any family.

Children who experience any type of abuse may "act out"

or respond in a variety of unhealthful ways. These may

include acts of self-destruction, withdrawal, and

aggression, and struggles with depression, anxiety, and

academic performance. Researchers have found that

abused children's brains may produce higher levels of      Figure 1. While physical abuse might be the
stress hormones. These hormones can lead to decreased      easiest to see, neglect is much more common.

immune responses, and lifelong difficulties with learning and memory. 5 Abused children are much

more likely than children who are not abused to end up with various developmental, psychological,

and behavioral problems throughout their life course. In particular, they are more likely to be

aggressive, to use alcohol and other drugs, to be anxious and depressed, and to get divorced if they

marry.6

Children who experience abuse or neglect are at risk of developing lifelong social, emotional, and
health problems, particularly if neglected before the age of two years. This is consistent with what we
learned about ACEs. However, it is important to note that not all children who experience abuse and
neglect will have the same outcomes. As we learned, there are many ways in which we can foster
stable, permanent, safe, secure, nurturing, loving care for children who have been associated with
reduced effects of ACEs.

It is extremely important to understand the ways in which child abuse and neglect can be prevented,
such as those listed in this infographic from the CDC. For more information, visit cdc.gov/

Corporal Punishment

Worldwide initiatives have recommended banning the use of corporal punishment with or in
children of all ages. According to the Global Initiative to End all Corporal Punishment of Children,
corporal punishment is defined as "any punishment in which physical force issued and intended to
cause some degree of pain or discomfort, however light". 7 Examples include shaking, kicking,
forcing ingestion (e.g., soap, hot sauce), and "smacking," "slapping," or "spanking" with any object or a
hand. Nonphysical forms of punishment (e.g., verbal and emotional abuse) include activities that are
intended to cause shame to a person such as humiliation, threats, ridicules, etc.

Vast amounts of research have consistently demonstrated strong correlations between youth who
experienced harsh punishment (e.g., spanking) by their parents and increased risks of:

· changes in brain physiology that show on MRI studies,
· mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety,
· elevated cortisol levels,
· cognitive problems,
· aggressive behaviors,
· unhealthy caregiver-child relationships,
· suicide attempts,
· moderate-to-heavy drinking,
· substance use disorders,
· misconduct, and
· adverse outcomes that extend into adulthood.

Key Takeaways

· Corporal punishment is not an effective method for teaching or changing performance.
· Corporal punishment has been linked to many negative outcomes.
· Caregivers should utilize methods other than corporal punishment to effectively and optimally

   guide children's behaviors and learning.

 Foster Care

  In the United States and in some other countries, another way to immediately protect children from
  further abuse is to remove them from their primary caregivers and place them into foster care or
  with family members. Foster care is a system in which a minor is placed into a group home
  (residential child care community, treatment center, etc.), or private home of a state-
  certified caregiver, referred to as a "foster parent," or with a family member approved by the state.
  The placement of the child is normally arranged through the government or a social service agency.
  The institution, group home, or foster parent is typically compensated for expenses unless the child
  is placed with a family member.8
  In the United States, on any given day, there are more than 400,000 youth living in foster care (out-
  of-home care) primarily due to abuse and/or neglect. And, more than 100,000 of these youth are
  waiting to be adopted from foster care. This means that these parents have lost permanent legal
  rights and custody of their children, leaving their children without any permanently legal caregivers
  (the government assumes this responsibility until someone adopts the children). The average age of
  youth waiting to be adopted from foster care is eight years old. Contrary to popular belief, it
  typically does not cost any money to adopt a child from foster care. For more information about
  becoming a foster parent or adopting from foster care, visit: www.adoptuskids.org. For additional
  statistics about adoption and foster care visit the Adoption and Foster Care Statistics website.

  Adoption of children is one of many ways in which families are formed. Adoption, the legal transfer
  of parental rights of a child to another person, can occur in many ways and elicit a wide variety of
  family types. In the United States, statistics for the total number of all types of adoptions are not
  compiled on a regular basis and statistics are not at all compiled for some adoption types. Adoption
  statistics and estimates are based on U.S. Census data and other sources. It is estimated that
  approximately 2-4% of all Americans are adopted.1

  As we learned previously, more than 100,000 youth (with an average age of 8 years) are waiting to be
  adopted from foster care. But, a majority of individuals wish to adopt an infant. According to
  research, millions of American women have expressed a desire to adopt an infant2 and tens of
  thousands of families are waiting to adopt an infant.

  However, it is also estimated that fewer than 20,000 babies are voluntarily placed for adoption each
  year in the United States. Certainly, there are thousands fewer infants placed for adoption than
  families waiting to adopt an infant. Research has shown that placing a baby for adoption can serve as
  a preventive option of child abuse and neglect for individuals who are not ready to parent, able to
  parent, or willing to parent.3 4 5

  Thus, it is a best-practice approach that individuals experiencing unplanned or unwanted
  pregnancies be provided the most accurate information concerning their options for parenting,
  adoption, the processes associated with all options, etc. 6

In the U.S., it is common for birth parents to choose their baby's adoptive parents, and in some cases,
adoptive and birth family members are able to maintain some contact with each other. It is
important to note that infants who are voluntarily placed are typically taken home immediately from
the birthing location by their adopting family. In conclusion, fewer children may end up in foster
care if their parents were advised of their options for adoption and parenting. To learn how to
educate parents about the option of placing their baby for adoption view this pdf, Adoption:
Considering Your Options and Making a Plan [pdf]

Family Types

There are numerous adoptive family types. Below is a brief definition of each family type.

  · Infant/newborn/domestic: A child who is born in a country and who is adopted shortly after
      birth (within the same country).

  · Transnational/Intercountry/International: A child who is born in one country and is adopted
      by a family who lives in another country. Often, the child is orphaned. For statistics and
      information about intercountry adoptions visit this website.

  · Kin: Children adopted by a relative such as an aunt, uncle, sister, brother, grandparent, or other
      relative.

  · Foster care: Children who are no longer able to be cared for by their primary caregiver(s) who
      are adopted by another family member.

  · Stepparent: Children adopted by one parent's spouse; the spouse agrees to take full
      responsibility for the child.

The following forms of adoption are a result of assisted reproductive technology (methods that
utilize medical technology to achieve conception and birth). In most U.S. states, these forms require
the legal transfer of parental rights to another parent(s).

  · Embryo: Families can adopt an embryo produced from the sperm and egg of one couple. Clinics
      and agencies help match donating families and recipient/adopting families.

  · Surrogacy: A surrogate mother carries a fertilized egg in utero. After the birth of the child, the
      intended parent(s) adopt(s) the child.

Below are some of the more commonly-used terms associated with adoption and the legal process.

  · Adoption Triad: Birth parents, adoptive parents, and the adopted child(ren).
  · Disrupted Adoption: An adoption agreement that ends before finalization.
  · Dissolution of Adoption: An adoption that ends after finalization.
  · Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children: A law that requires written notice and

      prior approval of the placement of a child for adoption or foster care from one state with a
                                                                                                                                              ADOPTION | 165

      family in another state.
  · Kinship care: The full-time nurturing of a child by someone related to the child by family ties

      or by prior relationship connection (fictive kin).
  · Reunification: The returning of foster children to the custody of their parent(s) after placement

      outside the home.
  · Relinquishment/Termination of Parental Rights: The legal step necessary for parents to

      voluntarily or involuntarily have their parental rights terminated to allow their child to be
      adopted by adoptive parents; sometimes referred to as a surrender or as making an adoption
      plan for one's child.
  · Special Needs: Children with physical, behavioral, or mental impairments, children with
      siblings in need of adoption, and at-risk children.

Before and after the legal transfer of parental rights, families can decide how they may stay in
contact after the child is no longer a legal member of the birth family. This decision is referred to as
"levels of openness" or "degrees of contact."

Levels of Openness/Degrees of Contact

Non-identifying information: Information that allows the members of the adoption triad to know
about each other, but without identifying information. First names, physical descriptions,
occupation, education, personality characteristics, hobbies, interests, religious affiliation, and
medical information are examples of non-identifying information.

Semi-open adoption: An adoption in which a child's birth parents and adoptive parents may
exchange primarily non-identifying information. After the child is placed in the adoptive home,
contact with the birth family may involve letters or pictures or other communications sent through
the intermediary of the adoption agency or the attorney who assisted in the placement.

Closed adoption: An adoption that involves total confidentiality and sealed records; contact does
not exist between any members of either family.

Identifying information: Information concerning birth parents which discloses their identities.

Open adoption: An adoption that involves some amount of initial and/or ongoing contact between
birth and adoptive families, ranging from sending letters through the agency, to exchanging names,
and/or scheduling visits.

Terminology

Using accurate adoption language can stop the spread of adoption-related misconceptions and
educate others about adoption. For instance, the phrase "choosing to place your child for adoption"
166 | ADOPTION

has a much more positive connotation than "giving up your baby." "Choosing to place your child for
adoption" focuses on the fact that parents most likely considered options and chose the option they
felt was best for the child. It is important to use appropriate terms so that accurate language may
someday be the norm. Below is a list of "accurate adoption terminology."

Table: Adoption terminology, accurate and inaccurate language

Accurate Language                       Inaccurate Language

 Intellectual Disability and Giftedness

  The results of studies assessing the measurement of intelligence show that IQ is distributed in the
  population in the form of a Normal Distribution (or bell curve), which is the pattern of scores
  usually observed in a variable that clusters around its average. In a normal distribution, the bulk of
  the scores fall toward the middle, with many fewer scores falling at the extremes. The normal
  distribution of intelligence shows that on IQ tests, as well as on most other measures, the majority of
  people cluster around the average (in this case, where IQ = 100), and fewer are either very smart or
  very dull (see Figure 5.13). Because the standard deviation of an IQ test is about 15, this means that
  about 2% of people score above an IQ of 130, often considered the threshold for giftedness, and
  about the same percentage score below an IQ of 70, often being considered the threshold for an
  intellectual disability.
  Although Figure 5.13 presents a single distribution, the actual IQ distribution varies by sex such that
  the distribution for men is more spread out than is the distribution for women. These sex differences
  mean that about 20% more men than women fall in the extreme (very smart or very dull) ends of the
  distribution.1 Boys are about five times more likely to be diagnosed with the reading disability
  dyslexia than are girls, and are also more likely to be classified as having an intellectual disability.2
  However, boys are also about 20% more highly represented in the upper end of the IQ distribution.

  Figure 3. Distribution of IQ Scores in the General PopulationThe normal distribution of IQ scores in the general
  population shows that most people have about average intelligence, while very few have extremely high or
  extremely low intelligence.

  One end of the distribution of intelligence scores is defined by people with very low IQ. Intellectual
  disability (or intellectual developmental disorder) is assessed based on cognitive capacity (IQ) and
  adaptive functioning. The severity of the disability is based on adaptive functioning, or how well the
  person handles everyday life tasks. About 1% of the United States population, most of them males,
  fulfill the criteria for intellectual developmental disorder, but some children who are given this
  diagnosis lose the classification as they get older and better learn to function in society. A particular
  vulnerability of people who have a low IQ is that they may be taken advantage of by others, and this
  is an important aspect of the definition of intellectual developmental disorder.3
  One cause of intellectual developmental disorder is Down syndrome, a chromosomal disorder
  caused by the presence of all or part of an extra 21st chromosome. The incidence of Down syndrome
  is estimated at approximately 1 per 700 births, and the prevalence increases as the mother's age
  increases.4 People with Down syndrome typically exhibit a distinctive pattern of physical features,
  including a flat nose, upwardly slanted eyes, a protruding tongue, and a short neck.
  Fortunately, societal attitudes toward individuals with intellectual disabilities have changed over the
  past decades. We no longer use terms such as "retarded," "moron," "idiot," or "imbecile" to describe
  people with intellectual deficits, although these were the official psychological terms used to describe
  degrees of what was referred to as mental retardation in the past. Laws such as the Americans with

   Disabilities Act (ADA) have made it illegal to discriminate on the basis of mental and physical
   disability, and there has been a trend to bring people with mental disabilities out of institutions and
   into our workplaces and schools.

   Giftedness refers to children who have an IQ of 130 or higher.5 Having extremely high IQ is clearly
   less of a problem than having extremely low IQ, but there may also be challenges to being
   particularly smart. It is often assumed that schoolchildren who are labeled as "gifted" may have
   adjustment problems that make it more difficult for them to create social relationships. To study
   gifted children, Lewis Terman and his colleagues selected about 1,500 high school students who
   scored in the top 1% on the Stanford-Binet and similar IQ tests (i.e., who had IQs of about 135 or
   higher), and tracked them for more than seven decades (the children became known as the "termites"
   and are still being studied today).6 This study found that these students were not unhealthy or poorly
   adjusted, but rather were above average in physical health and were taller and heavier than
   individuals in the general population. The students also had above-average social relationships and
   were less likely to divorce than the average person.7

   Terman's study also found that many of these students went on to achieve high levels of education
   and entered prestigious professions, including medicine, law, and science.8 Of the sample, 7% earned
   doctoral degrees, 4% earned medical degrees, and 6% earned law degrees. These numbers are all
   considerably higher than what would have been expected from a more general population. Another
   study of young adolescents who had even higher IQs found that these students ended up attending
   graduate school at a rate more than 50 times higher than that in the general population.9

   As you might expect based on our discussion of intelligence, kids who are gifted have higher scores
   on general intelligence "g", but there are also different types of giftedness. Some children are
   particularly good at math or science, some at automobile repair or carpentry, some at music or art,
   some at sports or leadership, and so on. There is a lively debate among scholars about whether it is
   appropriate or beneficial to label some children as "gifted and talented" in school and to provide
   them with accelerated special classes and other programs that are not available to everyone.
   Although doing so may help the gifted kids, it also may isolate them from their peers and make such
   provisions unavailable to those who are not classified as "gifted."10

  Children with Disabilities

   A Learning Disability (or LD) is a specific impairment of academic learning that interferes with a
   specific aspect of schoolwork and that reduces a student's academic performance significantly. An
   LD shows itself as a major discrepancy between a student's ability and some feature of achievement:
   The student may be delayed in reading, writing, listening, speaking, or doing mathematics, but not in
   all of these at once. A learning problem is not considered a learning disability if it stems from
   physical, sensory, or motor handicaps, or from generalized intellectual impairment. It is also not an
   LD if the learning problem really reflects the challenges of learning English as a second language.
   Genuine LDs are the learning problems left over after these other possibilities are accounted for or
   excluded. Typically, a student with an LD has not been helped by teachers' ordinary efforts to assist
   the student when he or she falls behind academically, though what counts as an "ordinary effort", of
   course, differs among teachers, schools, and students. Most importantly, though, an LD relates to a
   fairly specific area of academic learning. A student may be able to read and compute well enough, for
   example, but not be able to write. LDs are by far the most common form of special educational need,
   accounting for half of all students with special needs in the United States and anywhere from 5 to 20
   percent of all students, depending on how the numbers are estimated.11 12 Students with LDs are so
   common, in fact, that most teachers regularly encounter at least one per class in any given school
   year, regardless of the grade level they teach.

   These difficulties are identified in school because this is when children's academic abilities are being
   tested, compared, and measured. Consequently, once academic testing is no longer essential in that
   person's life (as when they are working rather than going to school) these disabilities may no longer
   be noticed or relevant, depending on the person's job and the extent of the disability.

   Dyslexia is one of the most commonly diagnosed disabilities and involves having difficulty in the
   area of reading. This diagnosis is used for a number of reading difficulties. Common characteristics
   are difficulty with phonological processing, which includes the manipulation of sounds, spelling, and
   rapid visual/verbal processing. Additionally, the child may reverse letters, have difficulty reading
   from left to right, or may have problems associating letters with sounds. It appears to be rooted in
   neurological problems involving the parts of the brain active in recognizing letters, verbally
   responding, or being able to manipulate sounds. Recent studies have identified a number of genes

the hyperactive child comes across as noisy and boisterous. The child's behavior is hasty, impulsive,

and seems to occur without much forethought; these characteristics may explain why adolescents

and young adults diagnosed with ADHD receive more traffic tickets and have more automobile

accidents than do others their age.15

                                                        with ADHD face severe academic and social
                                                        challenges. Compared to their non-ADHD
                                                        counterparts, children with ADHD have lower
                                                        grades and standardized test scores and higher

                                                        dropping out.18 They also are less well-liked and
                                                        more often rejected by their peers.19

ADHD can persist into adolescence and adulthood.20 A recent study found that 29.3% of adults who
had been diagnosed with ADHD decades earlier still showed symptoms.21 Somewhat troubling, this
study also reported that nearly 81% of those whose ADHD persisted into adulthood had experienced
at least one other comorbid disorder, compared to 47% of those whose ADHD did not persist.
Additional concerns when an adult has ADHD include Worse educational attainment, lower
socioeconomic status, less likely to be employed, more likely to be divorced, and more likely to have
non-alcohol-related substance abuse problems.22

Causes of ADHD

Family and twin studies indicate that genetics play a significant role in the development of ADHD.

   Burt (2009), in a review of 26 studies, reported that the median rate of concordance for identical
   twins was .66, whereas the median concordance rate for fraternal twins was .20.23 The specific genes
   involved in ADHD are thought to include at least two that are important in the regulation of the
   neurotransmitter dopamine,24 suggesting that dopamine may be important in ADHD. Indeed,
   medications used in the treatment of ADHD, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) and amphetamine
   with dextroamphetamine (Adderall), have stimulant qualities and elevate dopamine activity. People
   with ADHD show less dopamine activity in key regions of the brain, especially those associated with
   motivation and reward,25 which provides support to the theory that dopamine deficits may be a vital
   factor in the development of this disorder.26

   Brain imaging studies have shown that children with ADHD exhibit abnormalities in their frontal
   lobes, an area in which dopamine is in abundance. Compared to children without ADHD, those with
   ADHD appear to have smaller frontal lobe volume, and they show less frontal lobe activation when
   performing mental tasks. Recall that one of the functions of the frontal lobes is to inhibit our
   behavior. Thus, abnormalities in this region may go a long way toward explaining the hyperactive,
   uncontrolled behavior of ADHD.

   Although some food additives have been shown to increase hyperactivity in non-ADHD children, the
   effect is rather small.27 Numerous studies, however, have shown a significant relationship between
   exposure to nicotine in cigarette smoke during the prenatal period and ADHD.28 Maternal smoking
   during pregnancy is associated with the development of more severe symptoms of the disorder.29

   Treatment for ADHD

   Recommended treatment for ADHD includes behavioral interventions, cognitive behavioral therapy,
   parent and teacher education, recreational programs, and lifestyle changes, such as getting more
   sleep.30 For some children medication is prescribed. For an overview of treatments options for a
   variety of ages, please visit this link to the the CDC website. Also visit this site to learn about
   evidence-based treatment options.

   Is the prevalence rate of ADHD increasing?

   Many people believe that the rates of ADHD have increased in recent years, and there is evidence to
   support this contention. ADHD may be over-diagnosed by doctors who are too quick to medicate
   children as a behavior treatment. There is also greater awareness of ADHD now than in the past.
   Nearly everyone has heard of ADHD, and most parents and teachers are aware of its key symptoms.
   Thus, parents may be quick to take their children to a doctor if they believe their child possesses
   these symptoms, or teachers may be more likely now than in the past to notice the symptoms and
   refer the child for evaluation. Further, the use of computers, video games, iPhones, and other
   electronic devices has become pervasive among children in the early 21st century, and these devices
   could potentially shorten children's attention spans. Thus, what might seem like inattention to some
   parents and teachers could simply reflect exposure to too much technology.

  Legislation for Learning Disabilities

   Since the 1970s political and social attitudes have moved increasingly toward including people with
   disabilities into a wide variety of "regular" activities. In the United States, the shift is illustrated
   clearly in the Federal legislation that was enacted during this time. Three major laws were passed
   that guaranteed the rights of persons with disabilities, and of children and students with disabilities
   in particular. The third law has had the biggest impact on education.

  Rehabilitation Act of 1973, Section 504

   This law, the first of its kind, required that individuals with disabilities be accommodated in any
   program or activity that receives Federal funding.31 Although this law was not intended specifically
   for education, in practice it has protected students' rights in some extra-curricular activities (for
   older students) and in some child care or after-school care programs (for younger students). If those

   programs receive Federal funding of any kind, the programs are not allowed to exclude children or
   youths with disabilities, and they have to find reasonable ways to accommodate the individuals'
   disabilities.

  Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (or ADA)

   This legislation also prohibited discrimination on the basis of disability, just as Section 504 of the
   Rehabilitation Act had done.32 Although the ADA also applies to all people (not just to students), its
   provisions are more specific and "stronger" than those of Section 504. In particular, ADA extends to
   all employment and jobs, not just those receiving Federal funding. It also specifically requires
   accommodations to be made in public facilities such as with buses, restrooms, and telephones. ADA
   legislation is therefore responsible for some of the "minor" renovations in schools that you may have
   noticed in recent years, like wheelchair-accessible doors, ramps, and restrooms, and public
   telephones with volume controls.

  Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (or IDEA)

   As its name implied this legislation was more focused on education than either Section 504 or ADA.
   It was first passed in 1975 and has been amended several times since, including most recently in
   2004.33 In its current form, the law guarantees the following rights related to education for anyone
   with a disability from birth to age 21. The first two influence schooling in general, but the last three
   affect the work of classroom teachers rather directly:

      · Free, appropriate education: An individual or an individual's family should not have to pay for
         education simply because the individual has a disability, and the educational program should be
         truly educational; i.e., not merely care-taking or babysitting the person.

      · Due process: In case of disagreements between an individual with a disability and the schools or
         other professionals, there must be procedures for resolving the disagreements that are fair and
         accessible to all parties, including the person himself or herself or the person's representative.

      · Fair evaluation of performance in spite of disability: Tests or other evaluations should not
         assume test-taking skills that a person with a disability cannot reasonably be expected to have,
         such as holding a pencil, hearing or seeing questions, working quickly, or understanding and
         speaking orally. Evaluation procedures should be modified to allow for these differences. This
         provision of the law applies both to evaluations made by teachers and to school-wide or "high-
         stakes" testing programs.

  · Education in the "least restrictive environment": Education for someone with a disability
      should provide as many educational opportunities and options for the person as possible, both
      in the short term and in the long term. In practice, this requirement has meant including
      students in regular classrooms and school activities as much as possible, though often not
      totally.

  · An individualized educational program: Given that every disability is unique, instructional
      planning for a person with a disability should be unique or individualized as well. In practice,
      this provision has led to classroom teachers planning individualized programs jointly with other
      professionals (like reading specialists, psychologists, or medical personnel) as part of a team.

Evaluation and diagnosis can be the first step in helping provide children with disabilities the type of
instruction and resources that will benefit them educationally, but diagnosis and labeling also have
social implications. It is important to consider that children can be misdiagnosed and that once a
child has received a diagnostic label, the child, teachers, and family members may tend to interpret
actions of the child through that label. The label can also influence the child's self-concept. Consider,
for example, a child who is misdiagnosed as learning disabled. That child may expect to have
difficulties in school, lack confidence, and because of these expectations experience trouble. This
self-fulfilling prophecy calls our attention to the power that labels can have whether or not they are
accurately applied. It is also important to consider that children's difficulties can change over time; a
child who has problems in school may improve later or may live under circumstances as an adult
where the problem (such as a delay in math skills or reading skills) is no longer relevant. That person,
however, will still have a label as learning disabled. It should be recognized that the distinction
between abnormal and normal behavior is not always clear; some abnormal behavior in children is
fairly common.

                                       Figure 1. The stages of pregnancy

How did you come to be who you are? From beginning as a one-cell structure to your birth, your
prenatal development occurred in an orderly and delicate sequence. There are three stages of
prenatal development: germinal, embryonic, and fetal. Keep in mind that this is different than the
three trimesters of pregnancy.

Prenatal Development

Let's take a look at some of the changes that take place during each of the three periods of prenatal
development: the germinal period, the embryonic period, and the fetal period.

The Germinal Period (Weeks 1-2)

                                        Conception occurs when a sperm fertilizes an egg
                                        and forms a zygote, which begins as a one-cell
                                        structure. The mother and father's DNA is passed on
                                        to the child at the moment of conception. The
                                        genetic makeup and sex of the baby are set at this
                                        point. The germinal period (about 14 days in length)
                                        lasts from conception to implantation of the zygote
                                        (fertilized egg) in the lining of the uterus.

                                        During the first week after conception, the zygote

                                        structure to two cells, then four cells, then eight cells,

and so on. The process of cell division is called mitosis. After the fourth division, differentiation of

the cells begins to occur as well. Differentiated cells become more specialized, forming different

organs and body parts. After 5 days of mitosis, there are 100 cells, and after 9 months there are

billions of cells. Mitosis is a fragile process, and fewer than one-half of all zygotes survive beyond the

first two weeks.1

After the zygote divides for about 7-10 days and has 150 cells, it travels down the fallopian tubes and
implants itself in the lining of the uterus. It's estimated that about 60 percent of natural conceptions
fail to implant in the uterus. The rate is higher for in vitro conceptions. Once the zygote attaches to
the uterus, the next stage begins.

The Embryonic Period (Weeks 3-8)

The embryonic period begins once the zygote is implanted in the
uterine wall. It lasts from the third through the eighth week after
conception. Upon implantation, this multi-cellular organism is
called an embryo. Now blood vessels grow, forming the placenta.
The placenta is a structure connected to the uterus that provides
nourishment and oxygen from the mother to the developing
embryo via the umbilical cord.

During this period, cells continue to differentiate. Basic structures
of the embryo start to develop into areas that will become the head,
chest, and abdomen. During the embryonic stage, the heart begins
to beat and organs form and begin to function. At 22 days after
conception, the neural tube forms along the back of the embryo,
developing into the spinal cord and brain.

Growth during prenatal development occurs in two major                 Figure 3. Human Embryo
directions: from head to tail (cephalocaudal development) and from

the midline outward (proximodistal development). This means that those structures nearest the head

develop before those nearest the feet and those structures nearest the torso develop before those

away from the center of the body (such as hands and fingers).

The head develops in the fourth week and the precursor to the heart begins to pulse. In the early
stages of the embryonic period, gills and a tail are apparent. But by the end of this stage, they
disappear and the organism takes on a more human appearance. The embryo is approximately 1 inch
in length and weighs about 4 grams at the end of this period. The embryo can move and respond to
touch at this time.

About 20 percent of organisms fail during the embryonic period, usually due to gross chromosomal
abnormalities. As in the case of the germinal period, often the mother does not yet know that she is
pregnant. It is during this stage that the major structures of the body are taking form making the
embryonic period the time when the organism is most vulnerable to the greatest amount of damage
if exposed to harmful substances. Potential mothers are not often aware of the risks they introduce
to the developing child during this time.
188 | PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT

The Fetal Period (Weeks 9-40)

                                               When the organism is about nine weeks old, the
                                               embryo is called a fetus. At this stage, the fetus is
                                               about the size of a kidney bean and begins to take on
                                               the recognizable form of a human being as the "tail"
                                               begins to disappear.

                                               differentiate. By the 12th week, the fetus has all its
grams.                                         body parts including external genitalia. In the
                                               following weeks, the fetus will develop hair, nails,
                                               teeth and the excretory and digestive systems will
                                               continue to develop. At the end of the 12th week, the
                                               fetus is about 3 inches long and weighs about 28

At about 16 weeks, the fetus is approximately 4.5 inches long. Fingers and toes are fully developed,
and fingerprints are visible. During the 4-6th months, the eyes become more sensitive to light and
hearing develops. The respiratory system continues to develop. Reflexes such as sucking, swallowing,
and hiccupping develop during the 5th month. Cycles of sleep and wakefulness are present at that
time as well. Throughout the fetal stage, the brain continues to grow and develop, nearly doubling in
size from weeks 16 to 28. The majority of the neurons in the brain have developed by 24 weeks
although they are still rudimentary and the glial or nurse cells that support neurons continue to
grow. At 24 weeks the fetus can feel pain. 2

The first chance of survival outside the womb, known as the age of viability is reached at about 22
to 26 weeks. 3 By the time the fetus reaches the sixth month of development (24 weeks), it weighs up
to 1.4 pounds. The hearing has developed, so the fetus can respond to sounds. The internal organs,
such as the lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, have formed enough that a fetus born prematurely
at this point has a chance to survive outside of the mother's womb.

Between the 7th and 9th months, the fetus is primarily preparing for birth. It is exercising its
muscles, its lungs begin to expand and contract. It is developing fat layers under the skin. The fetus
gains about 5 pounds and 7 inches during this last trimester of pregnancy which includes a layer of
fat gained during the 8th month. This layer of fat serves as insulation and helps the baby regulate
body temperature after birth.

Around 36 weeks, the fetus is almost ready for birth. It weighs about 6 pounds and is about 18.5
inches long, and by week 37 all of the fetus's organ systems are developed enough that it could
survive outside the uterus without many of the risks associated with premature birth. The fetus
continues to gain weight and grow in length until approximately 40 weeks. By then, the fetus has
very little room to move around and birth becomes imminent.

Environmental Risks

Teratology

Good prenatal care is essential. The developing embryo is most at risk for some of the most severe
problems during the first three months of development. Unfortunately, this is a time at which most
women are unaware that they are pregnant. It is estimated that 10% of all birth defects are caused by
a prenatal exposure or teratogen. Teratogens are factors that can contribute to birth defects which
include some maternal diseases, drugs, alcohol, and stress. These exposures can also include
environmental and occupational exposures. Today, we know many of the factors that can jeopardize
the health of the developing embryo and fetus. Some teratogen-caused birth defects are potentially
preventable.
The study of factors that contribute to birth defects is called teratology. Teratogens are usually
discovered after an increased prevalence of a particular birth defect. For example, in the early 1960's,
a drug known as thalidomide was used to treat morning sickness. Exposure of the fetus during this
early stage of development resulted in cases of phocomelia, a congenital malformation in which the
hands and feet are attached to abbreviated arms and legs.

A Look at Some Teratogens

Alcohol

One of the most commonly used teratogens is alcohol.
Because half of all pregnancies in the United States are
unplanned, it is recommended that women of child-
bearing age take great caution against drinking alcohol
when not using birth control and when pregnant.4
Alcohol consumption, particularly during the second
month of prenatal development, but at any point during
pregnancy, may lead to neurocognitive and behavioral
difficulties that can last a lifetime.

There is no acceptable safe limit for alcohol use during

pregnancy, but binge drinking (5 or more drinks on a

single occasion) or having 7 or more drinks during a

single week places an embryo and fetus at particularly

high risk. In extreme cases, alcohol consumption can lead

to fetal death, but more frequently it can result in fetal  Figure 6. Some distinguishing

and that all individuals do not have the same characteristics. Children with FASD share certain

physical features such as flattened noses, small eye openings, small heads, intellectual developmental

delays, and behavioral problems. Those with FASD are more at risk for lifelong problems such as

criminal behavior, psychiatric problems, and unemployment. 5

The terms alcohol-related neurological disorder (ARND) and alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD)
have replaced the term Fetal Alcohol Effects to refer to those with less extreme symptoms of FASD.
ARBD include kidney, bone and heart problems.

        plugin-z36ohj3l-pvFqjU43Odo

  Tobacco

  Smoking is also considered a teratogen because nicotine travels through the placenta to the fetus.
  When the pregnant woman smokes, the developing fetus experiences a reduction in blood oxygen
  levels. Tobacco use during pregnancy has been associated with low birth weight, placenta previa,
  birth defects, preterm delivery, fetal growth restriction, and sudden infant death syndrome. Smoking
  in the month before getting pregnant and throughout pregnancy increases the chances of these risks.
  Quitting smoking before getting pregnant is best. However, for women who are already pregnant,
  quitting as early as possible can still help protect against some health problems for the mother and
  baby.6

  Drugs

  Prescription, over-the-counter, or recreational drugs can have serious teratogenic effects. In general,
  if medication is required, the lowest dose possible should be used. Combination drug therapies and
  first trimester exposures should be avoided. Almost three percent of pregnant women use illicit
  drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, Ecstasy and other amphetamines, and heroin. These drugs can
  cause low birth-weight, withdrawal symptoms, birth defects, or learning or behavioral problems.
  Babies born with a heroin addiction need heroin just like an adult addict. The child will need to be
  gradually weaned from the heroin under medical supervision; otherwise, the child could have
  seizures and die. Visit this link for further information about opioid use during pregnancy.

  Environmental Chemicals

  Environmental chemicals can include exposure to a wide array of agents including pollution, organic
  mercury compounds, herbicides, and industrial solvents. Some environmental pollutants of major

  concern include lead poisoning, which is connected with low birth weight and slowed neurological
  development. Children who live in older housing in which lead-based paints have been used have
  been known to eat peeling paint chips thus being exposed to lead. The chemicals in certain
  herbicides are also potentially damaging. Radiation is another environmental hazard that a pregnant
  woman must be aware of. If a woman is exposed to radiation, particularly during the first three
  months of pregnancy, the child may suffer some congenital deformities. There is also an increased
  risk of miscarriage and stillbirth. A pregnant woman's exposure to mercury can also lead to physical
  deformities and intellectual disabilities.7

  Sexually Transmitted Infections

  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) can complicate pregnancy and may have serious effects on
  both the pregnant woman and the developing fetus. Most prenatal care today includes testing for
  STIs, and early detection is important. STIs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, trichomoniasis,
  and bacterial vaginosis can all be treated and cured with antibiotics that are safe to take during
  pregnancy. STIs that are caused by viruses, like genital herpes, hepatitis B, or HIV cannot be cured.
  However, in some cases these infections can be treated with antiviral medications or other
  preventive measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of passing the infection to the baby.8

  Maternal Diseases

  Maternal illnesses increase the chance that a baby will be born with a birth defect or have a chronic
  health problem. Some of the diseases that are known to potentially have an adverse effect on the
  fetus include diabetes, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, rubella, varicella, hypothyroidism, and Strep
  B. If the pregnant woman contracts Rubella during the first three months of pregnancy, damage can
  occur in the eyes, ears, heart, or brain of the developing fetus. On a positive note, Rubella has been
  nearly eliminated in the industrial world due to the vaccine created in 1969. Diagnosing these
  diseases early and receiving appropriate medical care can help improve the outcomes. Routine
  prenatal care now includes screening for gestational diabetes and Strep B.9

  Maternal Stress

  Stress represents the effects of any factor able to threaten the homeostasis of an organism; these
  either real or perceived threats are referred to as the "stressors" and comprise a long list of

   potentially adverse factors, which can be emotional or physical. Because of a link in blood supply
   between a pregnant woman and her fetus, it has been found that stress can leave lasting effects on a
   developing fetus, even before birth. The best-studied outcomes of fetal exposure to maternal
   prenatal stress are preterm birth and low birth weight. Maternal prenatal stress is also considered
   responsible for a variety of changes in the child's brain, and a risk factor for conditions such as
   behavioral problems, learning disorders, high levels of anxiety, attention deficit hyperactivity
   disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. Furthermore, maternal prenatal stress has been associated with
   a higher risk for a variety of immune and metabolic changes in the child such as asthma, allergic
   disorders, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes, and obesity.10

  Factors influencing prenatal risks

   There are several considerations in determining the type and amount of damage that might result
   from exposure to a particular teratogen.11 These include:

      · The timing of the exposure: Structures in the body are vulnerable to the most severe damage
         when they are forming. If a substance is introduced during a particular structure's critical period
         (time of development), the damage to that structure may be greater. For example, the ears and
         arms reach their critical periods at about 6 weeks after conception. If a pregnant woman exposes
         the embryo to certain substances during this period, the arms and ears may be malformed.

      · The amount of exposure: Some substances are not harmful unless the amounts reach a certain
         level. The critical level depends in part on the size and metabolism of the mother.

      · Genetics: Genetic make-up also plays a role in the impact a particular teratogen might have
         after the child is born. This is suggested by fraternal twin studies who are exposed to the same
         prenatal environment, yet do not experience the same teratogenic effects. The genetic make-up
         of the mother can also have an effect; some mothers may be more resistant to teratogenic effects
         than others.

      · Biological sex: Males are more likely to experience damage due to teratogens than are females.
         It is believed that the Y chromosome, which contains fewer genes than the X, may have an
         impact.

Complications of Pregnancy and Delivery

There are a number of common side effects of pregnancy.
Not everyone experiences all of these nor do women
experience them to the same degree. And although they are
considered "minor" these problems are potentially very
uncomfortable. These side effects include nausea
(particularly during the first 3-4 months of pregnancy as a
result of higher levels of estrogen in the system), heartburn,
gas, hemorrhoids, backache, leg cramps,
insomnia, constipation, shortness of breath or varicose
veins (as a result of carrying a heavy load on the abdomen).
What is the cure? Delivery!

The following are some serious complications of
pregnancy which can pose health risks to mother and child
and that often require special care.

weight loss. It is more severe than the more

common morning sickness.

· Preeclampsia is gestational hypertension. Severe preeclampsia involves blood pressure over

160/110 with additional signs. Eclampsia is seizures in a patient who is pre-eclamptic.

· Deep vein thrombosis is the formation of a blood clot in a deep vein, most commonly in the

legs.

· A pregnant woman is more susceptible to infections. This increased risk is caused by an

increased immune tolerance in pregnancy to prevent an immune reaction against the fetus.

· Peripartum cardiomyopathy is a decrease in heart function which occurs in the last month of

pregnancy, or up to six months post-pregnancy.

Maternal Mortality

Maternal mortality is unacceptably high. About 830 women die from pregnancy or childbirth-
related complications around the world every day. It was estimated that in 2015, roughly 303,000
women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth. Almost all of these deaths occurred in
                                                                                                                          PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT | 197

   low-resource settings, and most could have been prevented. The high number of maternal deaths in
   some areas of the world reflects inequities in access to health services and highlights the gap between
   rich and poor. Almost all maternal deaths (99%) occur in developing countries. More than half of
   these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa and almost one third occur in South Asia.

   Almost all maternal deaths can be prevented, as evidenced by the huge disparities found between the
   richest and poorest countries. The lifetime risk of maternal death in high-income countries is 1 in
   3,300, compared to 1 in 41 in low-income. 12

   Even though maternal mortality in the United States is relatively rare today because of advanced in
   medical care, it is still an issue that needs to be addressed. The Centers for Disease Control and
   Prevention define a pregnancy-related death as the death of a woman while pregnant or within 1
   year of the end of a pregnancy-regardless of the outcome, duration, or site of the pregnancy-from
   any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or
   incidental causes. The reasons for the overall increase in pregnancy-related mortality are unclear.
   What do you think are some reasons for this surprising increase in the United States? What can be
   done to change this statistic?

      Video Example

         In the United States, black women are disproportionately more likely to die from complications related to
         pregnancy or childbirth than any other race; they are three or four times more likely than white women to
         die due to pregnancy-related death and are more likely to receive worse maternal care.13 Black women
         from higher income groups and with advanced education levels also have heightened risks--even tennis
         superstar Serena Williams had near-deadly complications during the birth of her daughter, Olympia. Why
         is this the case in our modern world? Watch this video to learn more:

   Miscarriage

   Spontaneous abortion, or miscarriage, is experienced in an estimated 20-40 percent of undiagnosed
   pregnancies and in another 10 percent of diagnosed pregnancies. Usually, the body aborts due to
   chromosomal abnormalities and this typically happens before the 12th week of pregnancy.
   Cramping and bleeding result and normal periods return after several months. Some women are
   more likely to have repeated miscarriages due to chromosomal, amniotic, or hormonal problems; but

  We will now turn our attention to the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development during
  the first two years.1 Researchers have given this part of the lifespan more attention than any other
  period, perhaps because changes during this time are so dramatic and so noticeable. We have also
  assumed that what happens during these years provides a foundation for one's life to come.
  However, it has been argued that the significance of development during these years has been
  overstated.2

                  Figure 1. Changes in Proportions

 Physical Growth and Development

  The average newborn in the United States weighs about 7.5 pounds (between 5 and 10 pounds) and
  is about 20 inches in length. For the first few days of life, infants typically lose about 5 percent of
  their body weight as they eliminate waste and get used to feeding. This often goes unnoticed by most

  parents but can be cause for concern for those who have a smaller infant. This weight loss is
  temporary, however, and is followed by a rapid period of growth. By the time an infant is 4 months
  old, it usually doubles in weight and by one year has tripled the birth weight. By age 2, the weight has
  quadrupled, so we can expect that a 2-year-old should weigh between 20 and 40 pounds. The
  average length at one year is about 29.5 inches and at two years it is around 34.4 inches.

  Body Proportions: Another dramatic physical change that takes place in the first several years of life
  is the change in body proportions. The head initially makes up about 50 percent of our entire length
  when we are developing in the womb. At birth, the head makes up about 25 percent of our length,
  and by age 25 it comprises about 20 percent our length.

 Infant Sleep

  A newborn typically sleeps approximately 16.5 hours per 24-hour period. This is usually polyphasic
  sleep in that the infant is accumulating the 16.5 hours over several sleep periods throughout the day.3
  The infant is averaging 15 hours per 24-hour period by one month, and 14 hours by 6 months. By
  the time children turn two, they are averaging closer to 10 hours per 24 hours.

  Additionally, the average newborn will spend close to 50% of the sleep time in the Rapid Eye
  Movement (REM) phase, which decreases to 25% to 30% in childhood.

 Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID)

  Each year in the United States, there are about 3,500 Sudden Unexpected Infant Deaths (SUID).
  These deaths occur among infants less than one year-old and have no immediately obvious cause.4
  The three commonly reported types of SUID are:

     · Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS): SIDS is identified when the death of a healthy infant
        occurs suddenly and unexpectedly, and medical and forensic investigation findings (including an
        autopsy) are inconclusive. SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants 1 to 12 months old, and
        approximately 1,500 infants died of SIDS in 2013.5 Because SIDS is diagnosed when no other
        cause of death can be determined, possible causes of SIDS are regularly researched. One leading
        hypothesis suggests that infants who die from SIDS have abnormalities in the area of the
        brainstem responsible for regulating breathing.

  · Unknown Cause: The sudden death of an infant less than one year of age that cannot be
      explained because a thorough investigation was not conducted and cause of death could not be
      determined.

  · Accidental Suffocation and Strangulation in Bed: Reasons for accidental suffocation include:
      Suffocation by soft bedding, another person rolling on top of or against the infant while
      sleeping, an infant being wedged between two objects such as a mattress and wall, and
      strangulation such as when an infant's head and neck become caught between crib railings.

As can be seen in the previous graph (Figure 3.6), the combined SUID death rate declined
considerably following the release of the American Academy of Pediatrics safe sleep
recommendations in 1992, which advocated that infants be placed for sleep on their backs
(nonprone position). These recommendations were followed by a major Back to Sleep Campaign in
1994. However, accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed mortality rates remained unchanged
until the late 1990s.

Should infants be sharing the bed with parents?

Colvin, Collie-Akers, Schunn, and Moon (2014)

analyzed a total of 8207 deaths from 24 states during

2004-2012 that were contained in the National

Center for the Review and Prevention of Child

Deaths Case Reporting System, a database of death

reports from state child death review teams.6 The

results indicated that younger victims (0-3 months)

were more likely to die by bed-sharing and sleeping

in an adult bed/on a person. A higher percentage of

older victims (4 months to 364 days) rolled into

objects in the sleep environment and changed           Figure 2. An infant holding onto their parent.

(2013) compared infants who died of SIDS with a

matched control and found that infants younger than three months old who slept in bed with a

parent were five times more likely to die of SIDS compared to babies who slept separately from the

parents, but were still in the same room.7

They concluded that bed-sharing, even when the parents do not smoke or take alcohol or drugs, is

  related to an increased risk of SIDS. However, when combined with parental smoking and maternal
  alcohol consumption and/or drug use, risks associated with bed-sharing greatly increased.

  The two studies discussed above were based on American statistics. What about the rest of the
  world? Co-sleeping occurs in many cultures, primarily because of a more collectivist perspective that
  encourages a close parent-child bond and interdependent relationship.8 In countries where co-
  sleeping is common, however, parents and infants typically sleep on floor mats and other hard
  surfaces which minimize the suffocation that can occur with bedding and mattresses.9

 Motor Development

  Motor development occurs in an orderly sequence as infants move from reflexive reactions (e.g.,
  sucking and rooting) to more advanced motor functioning. As mentioned during the prenatal
  section, development occurs according to the Cephalocaudal (from head to tail) and Proximodistal
  (from the midline outward) principles. For instance, babies first learn to hold their heads up, then to
  sit with assistance, then to sit unassisted, followed later by crawling, pulling up, cruising, and then
  walking. As motor skills develop, there are certain developmental milestones that young children
  should achieve. For each milestone there is an average age, as well as a range of ages in which the
  milestone should be reached. An example of a developmental milestone is a baby holding up its head.
  Babies on average are able to hold up their head at 6 weeks old, and 90% of babies achieve this
  between 3 weeks and 4 months old. If a baby is not holding up his head by 4 months old, he is
  showing a delay. On average, most babies sit alone at 7 months old. Sitting involves both
  coordination and muscle strength, and 90% of babies achieve this milestone between 5 and 9 months
  old. If the child is displaying delays on several milestones, that is reason for concern, and the parent
  or caregiver should discuss this with the child's pediatrician. Some developmental delays can be
  identified and addressed through early intervention.

  Motor Skills refer to our ability to move our bodies and manipulate objects. Fine motor skills focus
  on the muscles in our fingers, toes, and eyes, and enable coordination of small actions (e.g., grasping
  a toy, writing with a pencil, and using a spoon). Newborns cannot grasp objects voluntarily but do
  wave their arms toward objects of interest. At about 4 months of age, the infant is able to reach for
  an object, first with both arms and within a few weeks, with only one arm. At this age grasping an
  object involves the use of the fingers and palm, but no thumbs. This is known as the Palmer Grasp.
  The use of the thumb comes at about 9 months of age when the infant is able to grasp an object using
  the forefinger and thumb. Now the infant uses a Pincer Grasp, and this ability greatly enhances the
  ability to control and manipulate an object and infants take great delight in this newfound ability.

They may spend hours picking up small objects from the floor and placing them in containers. By 9
months, an infant can also watch a moving object, reach for it as it approaches, and grab it.

Gross motor skills focus on large muscle groups that control our head, torso, arms and legs and
involve larger movements (e.g., balancing, running, and jumping). These skills begin to develop first.
Examples include moving to bring the chin up when lying on the stomach, moving the chest up, and
rocking back and forth on hands and knees. But it also includes exploring an object with one's feet as
many babies do as early as 8 weeks of age if seated in a carrier or other device that frees the hips.
This may be easier than reaching for an object with the hands, which requires much more practice.10
Sometimes an infant will try to move toward an object while crawling and surprisingly move
backward because of the greater amount of strength in the arms than in the legs.

Sensory Capacities

Current research techniques have demonstrated just how developed the newborn is with especially
organized sensory and perceptual abilities.

Vision: The womb is a dark environment void of visual stimulation.                             Figure 3. Carefully holding an

and time is needed to build those neural pathways between the eye                              DMCA)
and the brain. Newborns typically cannot see further than 8 to 16
inches away from their faces, and their visual acuity is about 20/400,
which means that an infant can see something at 20 feet that an
adult with normal vision could see at 400 feet. Thus, the world
probably looks blurry to young infants. Because of their poor visual
acuity, they look longer at checkerboards with fewer large squares
than with many small squares. Infants' thresholds for seeing a visual
pattern are higher than adults'. Thus, toys for infants are sometimes
manufactured with black and white patterns rather than pastel
colors because the higher contrast between black and white makes
the pattern more visible to the immature visual system. By about 6
months, infants' visual acuity improves and approximates adult 20/
25 acuity.

When viewing a person's face, newborns do not look at the eyes the
way adults do; rather, they tend to look at the chin a less detailed part of the face. However, by 2 or 3
months, they will seek more detail when exploring an object visually and begin showing preferences
for unusual images over familiar ones, for patterns over solids, for faces over patterns, and for three-

    204 | INFANCY AND TODDLERHOOD

   dimensional objects over flat images. Newborns have difficulty distinguishing between colors, but
   within a few months they are able to discriminate between colors as well as adults. Sensitivity to
   binocular depth cues, which require inputs from both eyes, is evident by about 3 months and
   continues to develop during the first 6 months. By 6 months, the infant can perceive depth
   perception in pictures as well.11 Infants who have experience crawling and exploring will pay greater
   attention to visual cues of depth and modify their actions accordingly.12

  Hearing

   The infant's sense of hearing is very keen at birth, and the ability to hear is evidenced as soon as the
   7th month of prenatal development. In fact, an infant can distinguish between very similar sounds as
   early as one month after birth and can distinguish between a familiar and non-familiar voice even
   earlier. Infants are especially sensitive to the frequencies of sounds in human speech and prefer the
   exaggeration of infant-directed speech, which will be discussed later. Additionally, infants are
   innately ready to respond to the sounds of any language, but some of this ability will be lost by 7 or 8
   months as the infant becomes familiar with the sounds of a particular language and less sensitive to
   sounds that are part of an unfamiliar language.

   Newborns also prefer their mother's voices over another female when speaking the same material.13
   Additionally, they will register in utero specific information heard from their mother's voice.
   DeCasper and Spence (1986) tested 16 infants (average age of hours) whose mothers had previously
   read to them prenatally.14 The mothers read several passages to their fetuses, including the first 28
   paragraphs of the Cat in the Hat, beginning when they were 7 months pregnant. The fetuses had
   been exposed to the stories an average of 67 times or 3.5 hours. When the experimental infants were
   tested, the target stories (previously heard) were more reinforcing than the novel story as measured
   by their rate of sucking. However, for control infants, the target stories were not more reinforcing
   than the novel story indicating that the experimental infants had heard them before.

Touch and Pain

pain, responding with crying and cardiovascular
responses.15 Newborns who are circumcised, which
is the surgical removal of the foreskin of the penis,
without anesthesia experience pain as demonstrated
by increased blood pressure, increased heart rate,
decreased oxygen in the blood, and a surge of stress
hormones.16 Research has demonstrated that infants
who were circumcised without anesthesia
experienced more pain and fear during routine
childhood vaccines. Fortunately, many local pain
killers are currently used during circumcision.

Taste and Smell

Studies of taste and smell demonstrate that babies respond with different facial expressions,
suggesting that certain preferences are innate. Newborns can distinguish between sour, bitter, sweet,
and salty flavors and show a preference for sweet flavors. Newborns also prefer the smell of their
mothers. An infant only 6 days old is significantly more likely to turn toward its own mother's breast
pad than to the breast pad of another baby's mother,17 and within hours of birth an infant also shows
a preference for the face of its own mother.18 19

Infants seem to be born with the ability to perceive the world in an intermodal way; that is, through
stimulation from more than one sensory modality. For example, infants who sucked on a pacifier
with either a smooth or textured surface preferred to look at a corresponding (smooth or textured)
visual model of the pacifier. By 4 months, infants can match lip movements with speech sounds and
can match other audiovisual events. Although sensory development emphasizes the afferent
processes used to take in information from the environment, these sensory processes can be affected

   by the infant's developing motor abilities. Reaching, crawling, and other actions allow the infant to
   see, touch, and organize his or her experiences in new ways.

  Nutrition

   Typically, breast milk is considered the ideal diet for newborns (exceptions would include if the milk
   contains teratogens such as HIV or due to a mother's consumption of alcohol or other drugs, etc.).
   Colostrum, the first breast milk produced during pregnancy and just after birth has been described
   as "liquid gold" (United States Department of Health and Human Services.)20 It is very rich in
   nutrients and antibodies. Breast milk changes by the third to fifth day after birth, becoming much
   thinner, but containing just the right amount of fat, sugar, water and proteins to support overall
   physical and neurological development. For most babies, breast milk is also easier to digest than
   formula. Formula-fed infants tend to experience more diarrhea and upset stomachs. The absence of
   antibodies in formula often results in a higher rate of ear infections and respiratory infections.
   Children who are breastfed tend to have lower rates of childhood leukemia, asthma, obesity, Type 1
   and 2 diabetes, and a lower risk of SIDS. The USDHHS recommends that mothers breastfeed their
   infants until at least 6 months of age and that breast milk be used in the diet throughout the first year
   or two.21

   Several recent studies have reported that it is not just babies that benefit from breastfeeding.
   Breastfeeding stimulates contractions in the uterus to help it regain its normal size, and women who
   breastfeed are more likely to space their pregnancies further apart. Mothers who breastfeed are at
   lower risk of developing breast cancer, 22 especially among higher-risk racial and ethnic groups.23
   Women who breastfeed have lower rates of ovarian cancer,24 reduced risk for developing Type 2
   diabetes,25 and rheumatoid arthritis.26 In most studies these benefits have been seen in women who
   breastfeed longer than 6 months.

   Mothers can certainly continue to provide breast milk to their babies by expressing and freezing the
   milk to be bottle fed at a later time or by being available to their infants at feeding time. Some
   workplaces support breastfeeding mothers by providing flexible schedules and welcoming infants,
   but many do not. In addition, not all women may be able to breastfeed. Women with HIV are
   routinely discouraged from breastfeeding as the infection may pass to the infant. Similarly, women
   who are taking certain medications or undergoing radiation treatment may be told not to
   breastfeed.27

  When to Introduce More Solid Foods

   Solid foods should not be introduced until the infant is ready. According to The Clemson University
   Cooperative Extension (2014), some things to look for include that the infant:

      · can sit up without needing support
      · can hold its head up without wobbling
      · shows interest in foods others are eating
      · is still hungry after being breastfed or formula-fed
      · is able to move foods from the front to the back of the mouth
      · is able to turn away when they have had enough28

   For many infants who are 4 to 6 months of age, breast milk or formula can be supplemented with
   more solid foods. The first semi-solid foods that are introduced are iron-fortified infant cereals
   mixed with breast milk or formula. Typically rice, oatmeal, and barley cereals are offered as a
   number of infants are sensitive to more wheat-based cereals. Finger foods such as toast squares,
   cooked vegetable strips, or peeled soft fruit can be introduced by 10-12 months. New foods should
   be introduced one at a time, and the new food should be fed for a few days in a row to allow the baby
   time to adjust to the new food. This also allows parents time to assess if the child has a food allergy.
   Foods that have multiple ingredients should be avoided until parents have assessed how the child
   responds to each ingredient separately. Foods that are sticky (such as peanut butter or taffy), cut into
   large chunks (such as cheese and harder meats), and firm and round (such as hard candies, grapes, or
   cherry tomatoes) should be avoided as they are a choking hazard. Honey and Corn syrup should be
   avoided as these often contain botulism spores. In children under 12 months, this can lead to death.29

  Cognitive Development: Piaget and the Sensorimotor Stage

   Piaget believed that we are continuously trying to maintain cognitive equilibrium, or a balance, in
   what we see and what we know.30 Children have much more of a challenge in maintaining this
   balance because they are constantly being confronted with new situations, new words, new objects,
   etc. All this new information needs to be organized, and a framework for organizing information is
   referred to as a schema. Children develop schemata through the processes of assimilation and
   accommodation.

   When faced with something new, a child may demonstrate assimilation, which is fitting the new
   information into an existing schema, such as calling all animals with four legs "doggies" because he
   or she knows the word doggie. Instead of assimilating the information, the child may demonstrate.

   Accommodation, which is expanding the framework of knowledge to accommodate the new
   situation and thus learning a new word to more accurately name the animal. For example,
   recognizing that a horse is different from a zebra means the child has accommodated, and now the
   child has both a zebra schema and a horse schema. Even as adults we continue to try and "make
   sense" of new situations by determining whether they fit into our old way of thinking (assimilation)
   or whether we need to modify our thoughts (accommodation).

   According to the Piagetian perspective, infants learn about the world primarily through their senses
   and motor abilities.31 These basic motor and sensory abilities provide the foundation for the
   cognitive skills that will emerge during the subsequent stages of cognitive development. The first
   stage of cognitive development is referred to as the Sensorimotor Period.

  Development of Object Permanence

   A critical milestone during the sensorimotor period is the development of object permanence.
   Object permanence is the understanding that even if something is out of sight, it still exists.32
   According to Piaget, young infants do not remember an object after it has been removed from sight.
   Piaget studied infants' reactions when a toy was first shown to an infant and then hidden under a
   blanket. Infants who had already developed object permanence would reach for the hidden toy,
   indicating that they knew it still existed, whereas infants who had not developed object permanence
   would appear confused. Piaget emphasizes this construct because it was an objective way for
   children to demonstrate that they can mentally represent their world. Children have typically

   acquired this milestone by 8 months. Once toddlers have mastered object permanence, they enjoy
   games like hide and seek, and they realize that when someone leaves the room they will come back.
   Toddlers also point to pictures in books and look in appropriate places when you ask them to find
   objects.

   In Piaget's view, around the same time children develop object permanence, they also begin to
   exhibit Stranger Anxiety, which is a fear of unfamiliar people.33 Babies may demonstrate this by
   crying and turning away from a stranger, by clinging to a caregiver, or by attempting to reach their
   arms toward familiar faces such as parents. Stranger anxiety results when a child is unable to
   assimilate the stranger into an existing schema; therefore, she can't predict what her experience with
   that stranger will be like, which results in a fear response.

  Critique of Piaget

   Piaget thought that children's ability to understand objects, such as learning that a rattle makes a
   noise when shaken, was a cognitive skill that develops slowly as a child matures and interacts with
   the environment. Today, developmental psychologists think Piaget was incorrect. Researchers have
   found that even very young children understand objects and how they work long before they have
   experience with those objects.34 35 For example, Piaget believed that infants did not fully master
   object permanence until substage 5 of the sensorimotor period.36

   However, infants seem to be able to recognize that objects have permanence at much younger ages.
   Diamond (1985) found that infants show earlier knowledge if the waiting period is shorter.37 At age
   6 months, they retrieved the hidden object if their wait for retrieving the object is no longer than 2
   seconds, and at 7 months if the wait is no longer than 4 seconds. Even earlier, children as young as 3
   months old demonstrated knowledge of the properties of objects that they had only viewed and did
   not have prior experience with them. In one study, 3-month-old infants were shown a truck rolling
   down a track and behind a screen. The box, which appeared solid but was actually hollow, was
   placed next to the track. The truck rolled past the box as would be expected. Then the box was
   placed on the track to block the path of the truck. When the truck was rolled down the track this
   time, it continued unimpeded. The infants spent significantly more time looking at this impossible
   event (Figure 3.16).

   Baillargeon (1987) concluded that they knew solid objects cannot pass through each other.38
   Baillargeon's findings suggest that very young children have an understanding of objects and how
   they work, which Piaget (1954) would have said is beyond their cognitive abilities due to their
   limited experiences in the world.39

  Language Development

   An important aspect of cognitive development is language acquisition. The order in which children
   learn language structures is consistent across children and cultures.40 Starting before birth, babies
   begin to develop language and communication skills. At birth, babies recognize their mother's voice
   and can discriminate between the language(s) spoken by their mothers and foreign languages, and
   they show preferences for faces that are moving in synchrony with audible language.41 42
   Do newborns communicate? Of course they do. They do not, however, communicate with the use of
   oral language. Instead, they communicate their thoughts and needs with body posture (being relaxed
   or still), gestures, cries, and facial expressions. A person who spends adequate time with an infant can
   learn which cries indicate pain and which ones indicate hunger, discomfort, or frustration.

  Intentional Vocalizations

   In terms of producing spoken language, babies begin to coo almost immediately. Cooing is a one-
   syllable combination of a consonant and a vowel sound (e.g., coo or ba). Interestingly, babies replicate
   sounds from their own languages. A baby whose parents speak French will coo in a different tone

   than a baby whose parents speak Spanish or Urdu. These gurgling, musical vocalizations can serve as
   a source of entertainment to an infant who has been laid down for a nap or seated in a carrier on a
   car ride. Cooing serves as practice for vocalization, as well as the infant hears the sound of his or her
   own voice and tries to repeat sounds that are entertaining. Infants also begin to learn the pace and
   pause of conversation as they alternate their vocalization with that of someone else and then take
   their turn again when the other person's vocalization has stopped.

   At about four to six months of age, infants begin making even more elaborate vocalizations that
   include the sounds required for any language. Guttural sounds, clicks, consonants, and vowel sounds
   stand ready to equip the child with the ability to repeat whatever sounds are characteristic of the
   language heard. Eventually, these sounds will no longer be used as the infant grows more
   accustomed to a particular language.

   At about 7 months, infants begin babbling, engaging in intentional vocalizations that lack specific
   meaning and comprise a consonant-vowel repeated sequence, such as ma-ma-ma or da-da-da.
   Children babble as practice in creating specific sounds, and by the time they are 1 year old, the
   babbling uses primarily the sounds of the language that they are learning.43 These vocalizations have
   a conversational tone that sounds meaningful even though it isn't. Babbling also helps children
   understand the social, communicative function of language. Children who are exposed to sign
   language babble in sign by making hand movements that represent real language.44

   Children communicate information through gesturing long before they speak, and there is some
   evidence that gesture usage predicts subsequent language development.45 Babies who are deaf also
   use gestures to communicate wants, reactions, and feelings. Because gesturing seems to be easier
   than vocalization for some toddlers, sign language is sometimes taught to enhance one's ability to
   communicate by making use of the ease of gesturing. The rhythm and pattern of language is used
   when deaf babies sign just as it is when hearing babies babble.

   Most infants shake their head "no" around 6-9 months, and they respond to verbal requests to do
   things like "wave bye-bye" or "blow a kiss" around 9-12 months. Children also use contextual
   information, particularly the cues that parents provide, to help them learn language. Children learn
   that people are usually referring to things that they are looking at when they are speaking, and that
   that the speaker's emotional expressions are related to the content of their speech.46

    212 | INFANCY AND TODDLERHOOD

   Children begin using their first words at about 12 or 13 months of age and may use partial words to
   convey thoughts at even younger ages. These one word expressions are referred to as Holophrasic
   Speech. For example, the child may say "ju" for the word "juice" and use this sound when referring to
   a bottle. The listener must interpret the meaning of the holophrase, and when this is someone who
   has spent time with the child, interpretation is not too difficult. But, someone who has not been
   around the child will have trouble knowing what is meant. Imagine the parent who to a friend
   exclaims, "Ezra's talking all the time now!" The friend hears only "ju da ga" to which the parent
   explains means, "I want some milk when I go with Daddy."

   The early utterances of children contain many errors, for instance, confusing /b/ and /d/, or /c/ and
   /z/. The words children create are often simplified, in part because they are not yet able to make the
   more complex sounds of the real language.47 Children may say "keekee" for kitty, "nana" for banana,
   and "vesketti" for spaghetti because it is easier. Often these early words are accompanied by gestures
   that may also be easier to produce than the words themselves. Children's pronunciations become
   increasingly accurate between 1 and 3 years, but some problems may persist until school age.

   A child who learns that a word stands for an object may initially think that the word can be used for
   only that particular object, which is referred to as underextension. Only the family's Irish Setter is a
   "doggie", for example. More often, however, a child may think that a label applies to all objects that
   are similar to the original object, which is called overextension. For example, all animals become
   "doggies".

  First words and cultural influences

   First words if the child is using English tend to be nouns. The child labels objects such as cup, ball, or
   other items that they regularly interact with. In a verb-friendly language such as Chinese, however,
   children may learn more verbs. This may also be due to the different emphasis given to objects based
   on culture. Chinese children may be taught to notice action and relationships between objects, while
   children from the United States may be taught to name an object and its qualities (color, texture, size,
   etc.). These differences can be seen when comparing interpretations of art by older students from
   China and the United States.

   By the time they become toddlers, children have a vocabulary of about 50-200 words and begin
   putting those words together in telegraphic speech, such as "baby bye-bye" or "doggie pretty". Words
   needed to convey messages are used, but the articles and other parts of speech necessary for
   grammatical correctness are not yet used. These expressions sound like a telegraph, or perhaps a
   better analogy today would be that they read like a text message. Telegraphic speech/text message

   speech occurs when unnecessary words are not used. "Give baby ball" is used rather than "Give the
   baby the ball."

  Infant-directed Speech

   Have you ever wondered why adults tend to use that sing-song type of intonation and exaggeration
   used when talking to children? This represents a universal tendency and is known as Infant-directed
   Speech. It involves exaggerating the vowel and consonant sounds, using a high-pitched voice, and
   delivering the phrase with great facial expression.48 Why is this done? Infants are frequently more
   attuned to the tone of voice of the person speaking than to the content of the words themselves and
   are aware of the target of speech. Werker, Pegg, and McLeod (1994) found that infants listened
   longer to a woman who was speaking to a baby than to a woman who was speaking to another
   adult.49 It may be in order to clearly articulate the sounds of a word so that the child can hear the
   sounds involved. It may also be because when this type of speech is used, the infant pays more
   attention to the speaker and this sets up a pattern of interaction in which the speaker and listener are
   in tune with one another.

Socioemotional Development: Infant Temperament

Perhaps you have spent time with a number of
infants. How were they alike? How did they differ?
How do you compare with your siblings or other
children you have known well. You may have noticed
that some seemed to be in a better mood than others
and that some were more sensitive to noise or more
easily distracted than others. These differences may
be attributed to temperament. Temperament is the
innate characteristics of the infant, including mood,
activity level, and emotional reactivity, noticeable
soon after birth.

In a 1956 landmark study, Chess and Thomas (1996)

evaluated 141 children's temperament based on

parental interviews.50 Referred to as the New York

Longitudinal Study, infants were assessed on 9         Figure 6. A happy infant. (Image Source: Noba

rhythmicity (regularity of biological functions),

approach/withdrawal (how children deal with new things), adaptability to situations, intensity of

reactions, threshold of responsiveness (how intense a stimulus has to be for the child to react),

quality of mood, distractibility, attention span, and persistence. Based on the infants' behavioral

profiles, they were categorized into three general types of temperament:

· Easy Child (40%) who is able to quickly adapt to routine and new situations, remains calm, is
   easy to soothe, and usually is in a positive mood.

· Difficult Child (10%) who reacts negatively to new situations, has trouble adapting to routine, is
   usually negative in mood, and cries frequently.

· Slow-to-Warm-Up Child (15%) has a low activity level, adjusts slowly to new situations and is
   often negative in mood.

The percentages listed above do not equal 100% as some children were not able to be placed neatly
into one of the categories. Think about how you might approach each type of child in order to
improve your interactions with them. An easy child will not need much extra attention, while a slow
to warm up child may need to be given advance warning if new people or situations are going to be
introduced. A difficult child may need to be given extra time to burn off their energy. A caregiver's
ability to work well and accurately read the child will enjoy a goodness-of-fit, meaning their styles

match and communication and interaction can flow. Parents who recognize each child's
temperament and accept it, will nurture more effective interactions with the child and encourage
more adaptive functioning. For example, an adventurous child whose parents regularly take her
outside on hikes would provide a good "fit" to her temperament. Remember that parenting and
child-rearing is bidirectional; both caregivers and children influence each others behaviors. Revisit
the Influences on Parenting section in Part I. Key Concepts to review this information.

                                                   Temperament does not change dramatically as we
                                                   grow up, but we may learn how to work around and
                                                   manage our temperamental qualities. Temperament
                                                   may be one of the things about us that stays the same
                                                   throughout development. In contrast, personality,
                                                   defined as an individual's consistent pattern of
                                                   feeling, thinking, and behaving, is the result of the
                                                   continuous interplay between biological disposition
                                                   and experience.

Figure 7. A parent smiling at their child. (Photo  Personality also develops from temperament in

temperamental characteristics emerge and change over time. A newborn is not capable of much self-

control, but as brain-based capacities for self- control advance, temperamental changes in self-

regulation become more apparent. For example, a newborn who cries frequently doesn't necessarily

have a grumpy personality; over time, with sufficient parental support and an increased sense of

security, the child might be less likely to cry.

In addition, personality is made up of many other features besides temperament. Children's
developing self-concept, their motivations to achieve or to socialize, their values and goals, their
coping styles, their sense of responsibility and conscientiousness, and many other qualities are
encompassed into personality. These qualities are influenced by biological dispositions, but even
more by the child's experiences with others, particularly in close relationships, that guide the growth
of individual characteristics. Indeed, personality development begins with the biological foundations
of temperament but becomes increasingly elaborated, extended, and refined over time. The newborn
that parents gazed upon thus becomes an adult with a personality of depth and nuance.

Erikson: Trust vs Mistrust

                                                 As we previously discussed in the Theories section,

                                                 Erikson formulated an eight-stage theory of

                                                 psychosocial development. Erikson was in

                                                 agreement on the importance of a secure base,

                                                 arguing that the most important goal of infancy was

                                                 the development of a basic sense of trust in one's

                                                 caregivers. Consequently, the first stage, trust vs.

                                                 mistrust, highlights the importance of attachment.

                                                 Erikson maintained that the first year to year and a

                                                 half of life involves the establishment of a sense of

Figure 8. A happy child. (Photo Source: John H.  trust.52 Infants are dependent and must rely on
White, public domain)                            others to meet their basic physical needs as well as

                                                 their needs for stimulation and comfort. A caregiver

who consistently meets these needs instills a sense of trust or the belief that the world is a

trustworthy place. The caregiver should not worry about overindulging a child's need for comfort,

contact, or stimulation.

Erikson (1982) believed that mistrust could contaminate all aspects of one's life and deprive the
individual of love and fellowship with others.53 Consider the implications for establishing trust if a
caregiver is unavailable or is upset and ill-prepared to care for a child. Or if a child is born
prematurely, is unwanted, or has physical problems that make him or her less desirable to a parent.
Under these circumstances, we cannot assume that the parent is going to provide the child with a
feeling of trust.

Mary Ainsworth and the Strange Situation

Developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth, a student of John Bowlby, continued studying the
development of attachment in infants. Ainsworth and her colleagues created a laboratory test that
measured an infant's attachment to his or her parent. The test is called The Strange Situation
Technique because it is conducted in a context that is unfamiliar to the child and therefore likely to
heighten the child's need for his or her parent.54

During the procedure, that lasts about 20 minutes, the parent and the infant are first left alone, while
the infant explores the room full of toys. Then a strange adult enters the room and talks for a minute

   to the parent, after which the parent leaves the room. The stranger stays with the infant for a few
   minutes, and then the parent again enters and the stranger leaves the room. During the entire
   session, a video camera records the child's behaviors, which are later coded by trained coders. The
   investigators were especially interested in how the child responded to the caregiver leaving and
   returning to the room, referred to as the "reunion." On the basis of their behaviors, the children are
   categorized into one of four groups where each group reflects a different kind of attachment
   relationship with the caregiver. One style is secure and the other three styles are referred to as
   insecure.

      · A child with a secure attachment style usually explores freely while the caregiver is present and
         may engage with the stranger. The child will typically play with the toys and bring one to the
         caregiver to show and describe from time to time. The child may be upset when the caregiver
         departs but is also happy to see the caregiver return.

      · A child with an ambivalent (sometimes called resistant) attachment style is wary about the
         situation in general, particularly the stranger, and stays close or even clings to the caregiver
         rather than exploring the toys. When the caregiver leaves, the child is extremely distressed and is
         ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The child may rush to the caregiver but then fails to be
         comforted when picked up. The child may still be angry and even resist attempts to be soothed.

      · A child with an avoidant attachment style will avoid or ignore the mother, showing little
         emotion when the mother departs or returns. The child may run away from the mother when
         she approaches. The child will not explore very much, regardless of who is there, and the
         stranger will not be treated much differently from the mother.

      · A child with a disorganized/disoriented attachment style seems to have an inconsistent way of
         coping with the stress of the strange situation. The child may cry during the separation, but
         avoid the mother when she returns, or the child may approach the mother but then freeze or fall
         to the floor.

   How common are the attachment styles among children in the United States? It is estimated that
   about 65 percent of children in the United States are securely attached. Twenty percent exhibit
   avoidant styles and 10 to 15 percent are ambivalent. Another 5 to 10 percent may be characterized as
   disorganized.

   Some cultural differences in attachment styles have been found.55 For example, German parents
   value independence and Japanese mothers are typically by their children's sides. As a result, the rate

55. Rothbaum, F., Weisz, J., Pott, M., Miyake, K., & Morelli, G. (2010). Attachment and culture: Security in the United States and
    Japan. American Psychologist, 55, 1093-1104.
    218 | INFANCY AND TODDLERHOOD

   of insecure-avoidant attachments is higher in Germany and insecure-resistant attachments are
   higher in Japan. These differences reflect cultural variation rather than true insecurity, however.56

   Keep in mind that methods for measuring attachment styles have been based on a model that reflects
   middle-class, U. S. values and interpretation. Newer methods for assessment attachment styles
   involve using a Q-sort technique in which a large number of behaviors are recorded on cards and
   the observer sorts the cards in a way that reflects the type of behavior that occurs within the
   situation.57 There are 90 items in the third version of the Q-sort technique, and examples of the
   behaviors assessed include:

      · When child returns to mother after playing, the child is sometimes fussy for no clear reason.
      · When the child is upset or injured, the child will accept comforting from adults other than

         mother.
      · Child often hugs or cuddles against mother, without her asking or inviting the child to do so
      · When the child is upset by mother's leaving, the child continues to cry or even gets angry after

         she is gone.

   At least two researchers observe the child and parent in the home for 1.5-2 hours per visit. Usually
   two visits are sufficient to gather adequate information. The parent is asked if the behaviors
   observed are typical for the child. This information is used to test the validity of the Strange
   Situation classifications across age, cultures, and with clinical populations.

  Caregiver Interactions and the Formation of Attachment

   Most developmental psychologists argue that a child becomes securely attached when there is
   consistent contact from one or more caregivers who meet the physical and emotional needs of the
   child in a responsive and appropriate manner. However, even in cultures where mothers do not talk,
   cuddle, and play with their infants, secure attachments can develop.58

      · The insecure ambivalent style occurs when the parent is insensitive and responds
         inconsistently to the child's needs. Consequently, the infant is never sure that the world is a
         trustworthy place or that he or she can rely on others without some anxiety. A caregiver who is
         unavailable, perhaps because of marital tension, substance abuse, or preoccupation with work,
         may send a message to the infant he or she cannot rely on having needs met. An infant who
         receives only sporadic attention when experiencing discomfort may not learn how to calm

         down. The child may cry if separated from the caregiver and also cry upon their return. They
         seek constant reassurance that never seems to satisfy their doubt. Keep in mind that clingy
         behavior can also just be part of a child's natural disposition or temperament and does not
         necessarily reflect some kind of parental neglect. Additionally, a caregiver that attends to a
         child's frustration can help teach them to be calm and to relax.
      · The insecure avoidant style is marked by insecurity, but this style is also characterized by a
         tendency to avoid contact with the caregiver and with others. This child may have learned that
         needs typically go unmet and learns that the caregiver does not provide care and cannot be
         relied upon for comfort, even sporadically. An insecure avoidant child learns to be more
         independent and disengaged.
      · The insecure disorganized/disoriented style represents the most insecure style of attachment
         and occurs when the child is given mixed, confused, and inappropriate responses from the
         caregiver. For example, a mother who suffers from schizophrenia may laugh when a child is
         hurting or cry when a child exhibits joy. The child does not learn how to interpret emotions or
         to connect with the unpredictable caregiver. This type of attachment is also often seen in
         children who have been abused. Research has shown that abuse disrupts a child's ability to
         regulate their emotions.59

   Having a consistent caregiver may be jeopardized if the infant is cared for in a daycare setting with a
   high turn-over of staff or if institutionalized and given little more than basic physical care. Infants
   who, perhaps because of being in orphanages with inadequate care, have not had the opportunity to
   attach in infancy may still form initial secure attachments several years later. However, they may
   have more emotional problems of depression, anger, or be overly friendly as they interact with
   others.60

  Social Deprivation

   Severe deprivation of parental attachment can lead to serious problems. According to studies of
   children who have not been given warm, nurturing care, they may show developmental delays,
   failure to thrive, and attachment disorders.61 Non-organic failure to thrive is the diagnosis for an
   infant who does not grow, develop, or gain weight on schedule. In addition, postpartum depression
   can cause even a well-intentioned mother to neglect her infant.

   Children who experience social neglect or deprivation, repeatedly change primary caregivers that

   limit opportunities to form stable attachments, or are reared in unusual settings (such as institutions)
   that limit opportunities to form stable attachments can certainly have difficulty forming
   attachments. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition,
   those children experiencing neglectful situations and also displaying markedly disturbed and
   developmentally inappropriate attachment behavior, such as being inhibited and withdrawn,
   minimal social and emotional responsiveness to others, and limited positive affect, may be diagnosed
   with Reactive Attachment Disorder.62 This disorder often occurs with developmental delays,
   especially in cognitive and language areas. Fortunately, the majority of severely neglected children
   do not develop Reactive Attachment Disorder, which occurs in less than 10% of such children. The
   quality of the caregiving environment after serious neglect affects the development of this disorder.

   Being able to overcome challenges and successfully adapt is Resiliency. Even young children can
   exhibit strong resiliency to harsh circumstances. Resiliency can be attributed to certain personality
   factors, such as an easy-going temperament. Some children are warm, friendly, and responsive,
   whereas others tend to be more irritable, less manageable, and difficult to console, and these
   differences play a role in attachment.63 64 It seems safe to say that attachment, like most other
   developmental processes, is affected by an interplay of genetic and socialization influences.

   Receiving support from others also leads to resiliency. A positive and strong support group can help
   a parent and child build a strong foundation by offering assistance and positive attitudes toward the
   newborn and parent. In a direct test of this idea, Dutch researcher van den Boom (1994) randomly
   assigned some babies' mothers to a training session in which they learned to better respond to their
   children's needs.65 The research found that these mothers' babies were more likely to show a secure
   attachment style in comparison to the mothers in a control group that did not receive training.

  Erikson: Autonomy vs Shame and Doubt

   As the child begins to walk and talk, an interest in independence or autonomy replaces a concern for
   trust. The toddler tests the limits of what can be touched, said, and explored. Erikson (1982) believed
   that toddlers should be allowed to explore their environment as freely as safety allows and in so
   doing will develop a sense of independence that will later grow to self-esteem, initiative, and overall

   confidence.66 If a caregiver is overly anxious about the toddler's actions for fear that the child will get
   hurt or violate other's expectations, the caregiver can give the child the message that he or she should
   be ashamed of their behavior and instill a sense of doubt in their own abilities. Parenting advice
   based on these ideas would be to keep your toddler safe, but let them learn by doing.

  Conclusion

   We have explored the dramatic story of the first two years of life. Rapid physical growth,
   neurological development, language acquisition, the movement from hands on to mental learning, an
   expanding emotional repertoire, and the initial conceptions of self and others make this period of
   life very exciting. These abilities are shaped into more sophisticated mental processes, self-concepts,
   and social relationships during the years of early childhood.

EARLY CHILDHOOD

   Martha Lally; Suzanne Valentine-French; and Diana Lang

Our discussion will now focus on the physical, cognitive, and socioemotional development during
the ages from two to six, referred to as early childhood. Early childhood represents a time period of
continued rapid growth, especially in the areas of language and cognitive development. Those in
early childhood have more control over their emotions and begin to pursue a variety of activities
that reflect their personal interests. Parents continue to be very important in the child's
development, but now teachers and peers exert an influence not seen with infants and toddlers.1

Children between the ages of two and six years

tend to grow about 3 inches in height and gain

about 4 to 5 pounds in weight each year. Just as

in infancy, growth occurs in spurts rather than

continually. According to the Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention (2000) the

average 2-year-old weighs between 23 and 28

pounds and stands between 33 and 35 inches

tall.2 The average 6-year-old weighs between 40

and 50 pounds and is about 44 to 47 inches in      Figure 1. Children sitting on a staircase. (Image Source:

toddler with a large head, large stomach, and

short arms and legs. By the time the child reaches age 6, however, the torso has lengthened and body

proportions have become more like those of adults.

This growth rate is slower than that of infancy and is accompanied by a reduced appetite between
the ages of 2 and 6. This change can sometimes be surprising to parents and lead to the development
of poor eating habits. However, children between the ages of 2 and 3 need 1,000 to 1,400 calories,
while children between the ages of 4 and 8 need 1,200 to 2,000 calories.3

Toilet Training

Toilet training typically occurs during the first two years of early childhood (24-36 months). Some
children show interest by age 2, but others may not be ready until months later. The average age for
girls to be toilet trained is 29 months and for boys it is 31 months, and 98% of children are trained by
36 months.4 The child's age is not as important as his/her physical and emotional readiness. If
started too early, it might take longer to train a child. According to The Mayo Clinic (2016b) the
following questions can help parents determine if a child is ready for toilet training:

· Does your child seem interested in the potty chair or toilet, or in wearing underwear?
· Can your child understand and follow basic directions?
· Does your child tell you through words, facial expressions or posture when he or she needs to

   go?
· Does your child stay dry for periods of two hours or longer during the day?
· Does your child complain about wet or dirty diapers?
· Can your child pull down his or her pants and pull them up again?
· Can your child sit on and rise from a potty chair? (p. 1)5

If a child resists being trained or is not successful after a few weeks, it is best to take a break and try
again later. Most children master daytime bladder control first, typically within two to three months
of consistent toilet training. However, nap and nighttime training might take months or even years.

Some children experience elimination disorders that may require intervention by the child's
pediatrician or a trained mental health practitioner. Elimination disorders include enuresis, or the
repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes (involuntary or intentional) and encopresis, the
repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (involuntary or intentional).6 The prevalence of
enuresis is 5%-10% for 5 year-olds, 3%-5% for 10 year-olds, and approximately 1% for those 15 years
of age or older. Around 1% of 5 year- olds have encopresis, and it is more common in males than
females.

Sleep

During early childhood, there is wide variation in the number of hours of sleep recommended per

  day. For example, two-year-olds may still need 15-16 hours per day, while a six-year-old may only
  need 7-8 hours. The National Sleep Foundation's 2015 recommendations based on age are listed in
  the figure below.

                 Figure 2. As we age, the amount of sleep recommended for our health decreases steadily.

 Piaget

  According to Piaget, the preoperational stage is associated with early childhood and occurs from 2
  to 7 years of age. In this stage, children use symbols to represent words, images, and ideas, which is
  why children in this stage tend to engage in pretend play. A child's arms might become airplane
  wings as she zooms around the room, or a child with a stick might become a brave knight with a
  sword. Children also begin to use language in the preoperational stage, but they cannot typically
  understand adult logic. The term operational refers to logical manipulation of information, so
  children at this stage are considered pre-operational. Children's logic is based on their own personal
  knowledge of the world so far, rather than on conventional knowledge.7

Video Example

Watch this video illustrating children's accurate portrayal of Piaget's preoperational thinking

The preoperational period is divided into two stages: The Symbolic Function Substage occurs
between 2 and 4 years of age and is characterized by the child being able to mentally represent an
object that is not present and a dependence on perception in problem solving. The Intuitive
Thought Substage, lasting from 4 to 7 years, is marked by greater dependence on intuitive thinking
rather than just perception.8 At this stage, children ask many questions as they attempt to understand
the world around them using immature reasoning. Let's examine some of Piaget's assertions about
children's cognitive abilities at this age.

Pretend Play

Pretending is a favorite activity at this time. A   Figure 3. Children learn to use pretend play to mode

character or object unlike anything originally
intended. A teddy bear, for example, can be a
baby or the queen of a faraway land. Piaget
believed that children's pretend play helped
children solidify new schemata they were
developing cognitively. This play, then, reflected
changes in their conceptions or thoughts.
However, children also learn as they pretend
and experiment. Their play does not simply
represent what they have learned.9

Egocentrism

Egocentrism in early childhood refers to the tendency of young children not to be able to take the
perspective of others. Instead, the child thinks that everyone sees, thinks, and feels just as they do. An

    226 | EARLY CHILDHOOD

   egocentric child is not able to infer the perspective of other people and instead attributes his own
   perspective to situations. For example, ten-year-old Keiko's birthday is coming up, so her mom takes
   3-year-old Kenny to the toy store to choose a present for his sister. He selects an Iron Man action
   figure for her, thinking that if he likes the toy, his sister will too.

   Piaget's classic experiment on egocentrism involved showing children a three dimensional model of
   a mountain and asking them to describe what a doll that is looking at the mountain from a different
   angle might see (see Figure 4.9). Children tend to choose a picture that represents their own, rather
   than the doll's view. By age 7 children are less self-centered.

   However, even younger children when speaking to others tend to use different sentence structures
   and vocabulary when addressing a younger child or an older adult. This indicates some awareness of
   the views of others.

  Conservation Errors

   Conservation refers to the ability to recognize that moving or rearranging matter does not change
   the quantity. Let's look at Kenny and Keiko again. Dad gave a slice of pizza to 10-year-old Keiko and
   another slice to 3-year-old Kenny. Kenny's pizza slice was cut into five pieces, so Kenny told his
   sister that he got more pizza than she did. Kenny did not understand that cutting the pizza into
   smaller pieces did not increase the overall amount. This was because Kenny exhibited Centration, or
   focused on only one characteristic of an object to the exclusion of others. Kenny focused on the five
   pieces of pizza to his sister's one piece even though the total amount was the same. Keiko was able to
   consider several characteristics of an object than just one. Because children have not developed this
   understanding of conservation, they cannot perform mental operations.
   The classic Piagetian experiment associated with conservation involves liquid.10 As seen in Figure
   4.10, the child is shown two glasses (as shown in a) which are filled to the same level and asked if they
   have the same amount. Usually the child agrees they have the same amount.

   The experimenter then pours the liquid in one glass to a taller and thinner glass (as shown in b). The
   child is again asked if the two glasses have the same amount of liquid. The preoperational child will
   typically say the taller glass now has more liquid because it is taller (as shown in c). The child has
   centrated on the height of the glass and fails to conserve.

Video Example

     Watch this video illustrating children's classification errors (they have not yet mastered all parts of
     Piaget's conservation tasks)

Classification Errors: Preoperational children have difficulty understanding that an object can be
classified in more than one way. For example, if shown three white buttons and four black buttons
and asked whether there are more black buttons or buttons, the child is likely to respond that there
are more black buttons. They do not consider the general class of buttons. As the child's vocabulary
improves and more schemata are developed, the ability to classify objects improves.

Animism refers to attributing life-like qualities to objects. The cup is alive, the chair that falls down
and hits the child's ankle is mean, and the toys need to stay home because they are tired. Cartoons
frequently show objects that appear alive and take on lifelike qualities. Young children do seem to
think that objects that move may be alive, but after age three, they seldom refer to objects as being
alive.11

Critiques of Piaget

Similar to the critique of the sensorimotor period, several psychologists have attempted to show that
Piaget also underestimated the intellectual capabilities of the preoperational child. For example,
children's specific experiences can influence when they are able to conserve. Children of pottery
makers in Mexican villages know that reshaping clay does not change the amount of clay at much
younger ages than children who do not have similar experiences. 12Crain (2005) indicated that
preoperational children can think rationally on mathematical and scientific tasks, and they are not as
egocentric as Piaget implied.13 Research on Theory of Mind (discussed later in the chapter) has
demonstrated that children overcome egocentrism by 4 or 5 years of age, which is sooner than
Piaget indicated.

  Children's Understanding of the World

   Both Piaget and Vygotsky believed that children actively try to understand the world around them.
   More recently, developmentalists have added to this understanding by examining how children
   organize information and develop their own theories about the world.
   Theory of mind refers to the ability to think about other people's thoughts. This mental mind
   reading helps humans to understand and predict the reactions of others, thus playing a crucial role in
   social development. One common method for determining if a child has reached this mental
   milestone is the false belief task, described below.
   The research began with a clever experiment by
   Wimmer and Perner (1983), who tested whether
   children can pass a false-belief test.14 The child is
   shown a picture story of Sally, who puts her ball in a
   basket and leaves the room. While Sally is out of the
   room, Anne comes along and takes the ball from the
   basket and puts it inside a box. The child is then asked
   where Sally thinks the ball is located when she comes
   back to the room. Is she going to look first in the box
   or in the basket? The right answer is that she will look
   in the basket, because that's where she put it and
   thinks it is; but we have to infer this false belief against
   our own better knowledge that the ball is in the box.
   This is very difficult for children before the age of
   four because of the cognitive effort it takes. Three-
   year-olds have difficulty distinguishing between what

                                                                                         Figure 4. Object permanence comic.

   they once thought was true and what they now know to be true. They feel confident that what they
   know now is what they have always known.15

   Even adults need to think through this task.16 To be successful at solving this type of task the child
   must separate what he or she "knows" to be true from what someone else might "think" is true. In
   Piagetian terms, they must give up a tendency toward egocentrism. The child must also understand
   that what guides people's actions and responses are what they "believe" rather than what is reality. In
   other words, people can mistakenly believe things that are false and will act based on this false
   knowledge. Consequently, prior to age four children are rarely successful at solving such a task.17

  Language Development

   A child's vocabulary expands between the ages of two to six from about 200 words to over 10,000
   words. This "vocabulary spurt" typically involves 10-20 new words per week and is accomplished
   through a process called fast-mapping. Words are easily learned by making connections between
   new words and concepts already known. The parts of speech that are learned depend on the
   language and what is emphasized. Children speaking verb-friendly languages, such as Chinese and
   Japanese, learn verbs more readily, while those speaking English tend to learn nouns more readily.
   However, those learning less verb-friendly languages, such as English, seem to need assistance in
   grammar to master the use of verbs.18

  Literal meanings

   Children can repeat words and phrases after having heard them only once or twice, but they do not
   always understand the meaning of the words or phrases. This is especially true of expressions or
   figures of speech which are taken literally. For example, a classroom full of preschoolers hears the
   teacher say, "Wow! That was a piece of cake!" The children began asking "Cake? Where is my cake? I
   want cake!"

  Overregularization

   Children learn rules of grammar as they learn language but may apply these rules inappropriately at
   first. For instance, a child learns to add "ed" to the end of a word to indicate past tense. Then form a
   sentence such as "I goed there. I doed that." This is typical at ages two and three. They will soon learn
   new words such as "went" and "did" to be used in those situations.

  The Impact of Training

   Remember Vygotsky and the Zone of Proximal Development? Children can be assisted in learning
   language by others who listen attentively, model more accurate pronunciations, and encourage
   elaboration. The child exclaims, "I'm goed there!" and the adult responds, "You went there? Say, `I
   went there.' Where did you go?" Children may be ripe for language as Chomsky suggests, but active
   participation in helping them learn is important for language development as well. The process of
   scaffolding is one in which the guide provides needed assistance to the child as a new skill is learned.

  Preschool

   Providing universal preschool has become an important lobbying point for federal, state, and local
   leaders throughout our country. In his 2013 State of the Union address, President Obama called
   upon Congress to provide high-quality preschool for all children. He continued to support universal
   preschool in his legislative agenda, and in December 2014 the President convened state and local
   policymakers for the White House Summit on Early Education.19 However, universal preschool
   covering all four-year-olds in the country would require significant funding. Further, how effective
   preschools are in preparing children for elementary school, and what constitutes high-quality
   preschool have been debated. To set criteria for designation as a high quality preschool, the National
   Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) identifies 10 standards.20 These include:

      · Positive relationships among all children and adults are promoted.
      · A curriculum that supports learning and development in social, emotional, physical, language,

         and cognitive areas.
      · Teaching approaches that are developmentally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate.
      · Assessment of children's progress to provide information on learning and development.
      · The health and nutrition of children are promoted, while they are protected from illness and

· Teachers possess the educational qualifications, knowledge, and commitment to promote

   children's learning.
· Collaborative relationships with families are established and maintained.
· Relationships with agencies and institutions in the children's communities are established to

   support the program's goals.

programs using the NAEYC criteria as a guide
and template for asking questions that will
assist them in choosing the best program for
their child. Selecting the right preschool is also
difficult because there are so many types of
preschools available. Zachry (2013) identified
Montessori, Waldorf, Reggio Emilia, High
Scope, Parent Co-Ops, and Bank Street as types
of preschool programs that focus on children
learning through discovery. Teachers act as
guides and create activities based on the child's
developmental level.21

Head Start

For children who live in poverty, Head Start has been providing preschool education since 1965
when it was begun by President Lyndon Johnson as part of his war on poverty. In 2013, research
revealed that Head Start served nearly one million children and annually costs approximately 7.5
billion dollars.22

However, concerns about the effectiveness of Head Start have been ongoing since the program
began. Armor (2015) reviewed existing research on Head Start and found there were no lasting gains,

   and the average child in Head Start had not learned more than children who did not receive
   preschool education.23

   A recent report dated July 2015 evaluating the effectiveness of Head Start comes from the What
   Works Clearinghouse. The What Works Clearinghouse identifies research that provides reliable
   evidence of the effectiveness of programs and practices in education and is managed by the Institute
   of Education Services for the United States Department of Education. After reviewing 90 studies on
   the effectiveness of Head Start, only one study was deemed scientifically acceptable and this study
   showed disappointing results.24 This study showed that 3 and 4-year-old children in Head Start
   received "potentially positive effects" on general reading achievement, but no noticeable effects on
   math achievement and social-emotional development.

   Nonexperimental designs are a significant problem in determining the effectiveness of Head Start
   programs because a control group is needed to show group differences that would demonstrate
   educational benefits. Because of ethical reasons, low-income children are usually provided with
   some type of preschool programming in an alternative setting. Additionally, head Start programs are
   different depending on the location, and these differences include the length of the day or
   qualification of the teachers. Lastly, testing young children is difficult and strongly dependent on
   their language skills and comfort level with an evaluator.25

  Autism Spectrum Disorder in Early Childhood

   A greater discussion on disorders affecting children and special educational services to assist them
   will occur in chapter 5. However, because characteristics of Autism Spectrum Disorder must be
   present in the early developmental period, as established by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
   Mental Disorders (DSM-5), this disorder will be presented here.26

   Autism spectrum disorder is probably the most misunderstood and puzzling of
   neurodevelopmental disorders. Children with this disorder show signs of significant disturbances in
   three main areas: (a) deficits in social interaction, (b) deficits in communication, and (c) repetitive

patterns of behavior or interests. These disturbances appear early in life and cause serious
impairments in functioning.27 The child with autism spectrum disorder might exhibit deficits in
social interaction by not initiating conversations with other children or turning their head away
when spoken to. These children do not make eye contact with others and seem to prefer playing
alone rather than with others. In a certain sense, it is almost as though these individuals live in a
personal and isolated social world others are simply not privy to or able to penetrate.
Communication deficits can range from a complete lack of speech, to one word responses (e.g.,
saying "Yes" or "No" when replying to questions or statements that require additional elaboration), to
echoed speech (e.g., parroting what another person says, either immediately or several hours or even
days later), to difficulty maintaining a conversation because of an inability to reciprocate others'
comments. These deficits can also include problems in using and understanding nonverbal cues (e.g.,
facial expressions, gestures, and postures) that facilitate normal communication.

                                               Repetitive patterns of behavior or interests can

                                               be exhibited a number of ways. The child might

                                               engage in stereotyped, repetitive movements

                                               (rocking, head-banging, or repeatedly dropping

                                               an object and then picking it up), or she might

                                               show great distress at small changes in routine

                                               or the environment. For example, the child

                                               might throw a temper tantrum if an object is

                                               not in its proper place or if a regularly-

                                               scheduled activity is rescheduled. In some cases,

                                               the person with autism spectrum disorder

                                               might show highly restricted and fixated

                                               interests that appear to be abnormal in their

                                               intensity. For instance, the child might learn

                                               purpose. Importantly, autism spectrum disorder

is not the same thing as intellectual disability, although these two conditions can occur together. The

DSM-5 specifies that the symptoms of autism spectrum disorder are not caused or explained by

intellectual disability.

The qualifier "spectrum" in autism spectrum disorder is used to indicate that individuals with the
disorder can show a range, or spectrum, of symptoms that vary in their magnitude and severity:
Some severe, others less severe. The previous edition of the DSM included a diagnosis of Asperger's

   disorder, generally recognized as a less severe form of autistic disorder; individuals diagnosed with
   Asperger's disorder were described as having average or high intelligence and a strong vocabulary,
   but exhibiting impairments in social interaction and social communication, such as talking only
   about their special interests.28 However, because research has failed to demonstrate that Asperger's
   disorder differs qualitatively from autistic disorder, the DSM-5 does not include it. Some individuals
   with autism spectrum disorder, particularly those with better language and intellectual skills, can live
   and work independently as adults. However, most do not because the symptoms remain sufficient to
   cause serious impairment in many realms of life.29

   Currently, estimates indicate that nearly 1 in 88 children in the United States has autism spectrum
   disorder; the disorder is 5 times more common in boys (1 out of 54) than girls (1 out of 252).30 Rates
   of autistic spectrum disorder have increased dramatically since the 1980s. Although it is difficult to
   interpret this increase, it is possible that the rise in prevalence is the result of the broadening of the
   diagnosis, increased efforts to identify cases in the community, and greater awareness and
   acceptance of the diagnosis. In addition, mental health professionals are now more knowledgeable
   about autism spectrum disorder and are better equipped to make the diagnosis, even in subtle
   cases.31

   The exact causes of autism spectrum disorder remain unknown despite massive research efforts over
   the last two decades.32 Autism appears to be strongly influenced by genetics, as identical twins show
   concordance rates of 60%- 90%, whereas concordance rates for fraternal twins and siblings are
   5%-10%.33 Many different genes and gene mutations have been implicated in autism.34 Among the
   genes involved are those important in the formation of synaptic circuits that facilitate
   communication between different areas of the brain.35 A number of environmental factors are also
   thought to possibly be associated with increased risk for autism spectrum disorder, at least in part,

   because they contribute to new mutations. These factors include exposure to pollutants, such as
   plant emissions and mercury, urban versus rural residence, and vitamin D deficiency.36
   There is no scientific evidence that a link exists between autism and vaccinations.37 Indeed, a recent
   study compared the vaccination histories of 256 children with autism spectrum disorder with that of
   752 control children across three time periods during their first two years of life (birth to 3 months,
   birth to 7 months, and birth to 2 years).38 At the time of the study, the children were between 6 and
   13 years old, and their prior vaccination records were obtained. Because vaccines contain
   immunogens (substances that fight infections), the investigators examined medical records to see
   how many immunogens children received to determine if those children who received more
   immunogens were at greater risk for developing autism spectrum disorder. The results of this study
   clearly demonstrated that the quantity of immunogens from vaccines received during the first two
   years of life were not at all related to the development of autism spectrum disorder.

  Erikson: Initiative versus Guilt

   The trust and autonomy of previous stages develop into a desire to take initiative or to think of ideas
   and initiative action.39 Children may want to build a fort with the cushions from the living room
   couch or open a lemonade stand in the driveway or make a zoo with their stuffed animals and issue
   tickets to those who want to come. Or they may just want to get themselves ready for bed without
   any assistance. To reinforce taking initiative, caregivers should offer praise for the child's efforts and
   avoid being critical of messes or mistakes. Placing pictures of drawings on the refrigerator,
   purchasing mud pies for dinner, and admiring towers of legos will facilitate the child's sense of
   initiative.

                                                    Siblings spend a considerable amount of time with

                                                    each other and offer a unique relationship that is not

                                                    play an important role in the development of social

                                                    skills. Cooperative and pretend play interactions

                                                    between younger and older siblings can teach

                                                    empathy, sharing, and cooperation,40 as well as,

                                                    negotiation and conflict resolution.41 However, the

                                                    quality of sibling relationships is often mediated by

                                                    the quality of the parent-child relationship and the

Pikrepo , DMCA)                                     2005). For instance, more negative interactions

                                                    between siblings have been reported in families

where parents had poor patterns of communication with their children.42 Children who have

emotional and behavioral problems are also more likely to have negative interactions with their

siblings. However, the psychological adjustment of the child can sometimes be a reflection of the

parent-child relationship. Thus, when examining the quality of sibling interactions, it is often

difficult to tease out the separate effect of adjustment from the effect of the parent-child relationship.

While parents want positive interactions between their children, conflicts are going to arise, and
some confrontations can be the impetus for growth in children's social and cognitive skills. The
sources of conflict between siblings often depend on their respective ages. Dunn and Munn (1987)
revealed that over half of all sibling conflicts in early childhood were disputes about property
rights.43 By middle childhood this starts shifting toward control over social situations, such as what
games to play, disagreements about facts or opinions, or rude behavior.44 Researchers have also
found that the strategies children use to deal with conflict change with age, but that this is also
tempered by the nature of the conflict. Abuhatoum and Howe (2013) found that coercive strategies
(e.g., threats) were preferred when the dispute centered on property rights, while reasoning was

   more likely to be used by older siblings and in disputes regarding control over the social situation.45
   However, younger siblings also use reasoning, frequently bringing up the concern of legitimacy (e.g.,
   "You're not the boss") when in conflict with an older sibling. This is a very common strategy used by
   younger siblings and is possibly an adaptive strategy in order for younger siblings to assert their
   autonomy. A number of researchers have found that children who can use non-coercive strategies
   are more likely to have a successful resolution, whereby a compromise is reached and neither child
   feels slighted.46 47

   peers. The reverse is also true. A child can also learn to get along with a sibling, with, as the song says

 MIDDLE AND LATE CHILDHOOD

     Martha Lally; Suzanne Valentine-French; and Diana Lang

  Middle and late childhood spans the ages between early childhood and adolescence, approximately
  ages 6 to 11 years. Children gain greater control over the movement of their bodies, mastering many
  gross and fine motor skills that eluded the younger child. Changes in the brain during this age enable
  not only physical development, but contributes to greater reasoning and flexibility of thought.
  School becomes a big part of middle and late childhood, and it expands their world beyond the
  boundaries of their own family. Peers start to take center-stage, often prompting changes in the
  parent-child relationship. Peer acceptance also influences children's perception of self and may have
  consequences for emotional development beyond these years.1

  Rates of growth generally slow during these years. Typically, a child will gain about 5-7 pounds a
  year and grow about 2-3 inches per year.2 They also tend to slim down and gain muscle strength and
  lung capacity making it possible to engage in strenuous physical activity for long periods of time.
  The beginning of the growth spurt, which occurs prior to puberty, begins two years earlier for
  females than males. The mean age for the beginning of the growth spurt for girls is nine, while for
  boys it is eleven. Children of this age tend to sharpen their abilities to perform both gross motor
  skills, such as riding a bike, and fine motor skills, such as cutting their fingernails. In gross motor
  skills (involving large muscles) boys typically outperform girls, while with fine motor skills (small
  muscles) girls outperform the boys. These improvements in motor skills are related to brain growth
  and experience during this developmental period.

  Two major brain growth spurts occur during middle/late childhood.3 Between ages 6 and 8,
  significant improvements in fine motor skills and eye-hand coordination are noted. Then between
  10 and 12 years of age, the frontal lobes become more developed and improvements in logic,
  planning, and memory are evident.4 Children in middle to late childhood are also better able to plan,

 Childhood Obesity

  The decreased participation in school physical education and youth sports is just one of many factors
  that has led to an increase in children being overweight or obese. The current measurement for
  determining excess weight is the Body Mass Index (BMI) which expresses the relationship of height
  to weight. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), children's whose
  BMI is at or above the 85th percentile for their age are considered overweight, while children who
  are at or above the 95th percentile are considered obese. Excess weight and obesity in children are
  associated with a variety of medical and cognitive conditions including high blood pressure, insulin
  resistance, inflammation, depression, and lower academic achievement.6
  Being overweight has also been linked to impaired brain functioning, which includes deficits in
  executive functioning, working memory, mental flexibility, and decision making.7 Children who ate
  more saturated fats performed worse on relational memory tasks while eating a diet high in omega-3
  fatty acids promoted relational memory skills.8 Using animal studies Davidson et al. (2013) found
  that large amounts of processed sugars and saturated fat weakened the blood-brain barrier,
  especially in the hippocampus.9 This can make the brain more vulnerable to harmful substances that

   can impair its functioning. Another important executive functioning skill is controlling impulses and
   delaying gratification. Children who are overweight show less inhibitory control than normal-
   weight children, which may make it more difficult for them to avoid unhealthy foods.10 Overall,
   being overweight as a child increases the risk for cognitive decline as one ages. Visit this link from
   the CDC to learn more about childhood overweight and obesity.

   An added concern is that the children themselves are not accurately identifying if they are
   overweight. In a United States sample of 8-15 year-olds, more than 80% of overweight boys and 70%
   of overweight girls misperceived their weight as normal.11 Also noted was that as the socioeconomic
   status of the children rose, the frequency of these misconceptions decreased. It appeared that
   families with more resources were more conscious of what defines a healthy weight.

   Children who are overweight tend to be rejected, ridiculed, teased and bullied by others more than
   their peer counterparts.12 This can certainly be damaging to their self-image and popularity. In
   addition, children who are obese run the risk of suffering orthopedic problems such as knee injuries,
   and they have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke in adulthood. It is hard for a child who is
   obese to become a non-obese adult. In addition, the number of cases of pediatric diabetes has risen
   dramatically in recent years.

   Behavioral interventions, including training children to overcome impulsive behavior, are being
   researched to help children achieve and maintain a healthy weight.13 Practicing inhibition has been
   shown to strengthen the ability to resist unhealthy foods. Parents can help their children the best
   when they are warm and supportive without using shame or guilt. Parents can also act like the child's
   frontal lobe until it is developed by helping them make correct food choices and praising their
   efforts.14 Research also shows that exercise, especially aerobic exercise, can help improve cognitive
   functioning in children.15 Parents should take caution against emphasizing diet alone to avoid the
   development of any obsession about dieting that can lead to eating disorders. Instead, increasing a
   child's activity level is most helpful.

   Recall from earlier chapters that children in early childhood are in Piaget's preoperational stage, and
   during this stage, children are learning to think symbolically about the world. Cognitive skills
   continue to expand in middle and late childhood as thought processes become more logical and
   organized when dealing with concrete information. Children at this age understand concepts such as

   past, present, and future, giving them the ability to plan and work toward goals. Additionally, they
   can process complex ideas such as addition and subtraction and cause-and-effect relationships.

  Concrete Operational Thought

   From ages 7 to 11, children are in what Piaget referred to as the Concrete Operational Stage of
   cognitive development.16 This involves mastering the use of logic in concrete ways. The word concrete
   refers to that which is tangible; that which can be seen, touched, or experienced directly. The
   concrete operational child is able to make use of logical principles in solving problems involving the
   physical world. For example, the child can understand the principles of cause and effect, size, and
   distance.
   The child can use logic to solve problems tied to their own direct experience, but has trouble solving
   hypothetical problems or considering more abstract problems. The child uses Inductive Reasoning,
   which is a logical process in which multiple premises believed to be true are combined to obtain a
   specific conclusion. For example, a child has one friend who is rude, another friend who is also rude,
   and the same is true for a third friend. The child may conclude that friends are rude. We will see that
   this way of thinking tends to change during adolescence being replaced with deductive reasoning.
   We will now explore some of the major abilities that the concrete child exhibits.

                      Figure 2. Children in the concrete operational stage understand how to classify
                      organisms

16. Crain, W. (2005). Theories of development (5th ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson.
    242 | MIDDLE AND LATE CHILDHOOD

      · Classification: As children's experiences and vocabularies grow, they build schemata and are
         able to organize objects in many different ways. They also understand classification hierarchies
         and can arrange objects into a variety of classes and subclasses.

      · Identity: One feature of concrete operational thought is the understanding that objects have
         qualities that do not change even if the object is altered in some way. For instance, mass of an
         object does not change by rearranging it. A piece of chalk is still chalk even when the piece is
         broken in two.

      · Reversibility: The child learns that some things that have been changed can be returned to their
         original state. Water can be frozen and then thawed to become liquid again. But eggs cannot be
         unscrambled. Arithmetic operations are reversible as well: 2 + 3 = 5 and 5 - 3 = 2.

   Many of these cognitive skills are incorporated into the school's curriculum through mathematical
   problems and in worksheets about which situations are reversible or irreversible.

      · Conservation: Remember the example in our last chapter of preoperational children thinking
         that a tall beaker filled with 8 ounces of water was "more" than a short, wide bowl filled with 8
         ounces of water? Concrete operational children can understand the concept of conservation
         which means that changing one quality (in this example, height or water level) can be compensated for by
         changes in another quality (width). Consequently, there is the same amount of water in each
         container, although one is taller and narrower and the other is shorter and wider.

      · Decentration: Concrete operational children no longer focus on only one dimension of any object
         (such as the height of the glass) and instead consider the changes in other dimensions too (such as the width
         of the glass). This allows for conservation to occur.

      · Seriation: Arranging items along a quantitative dimension, such as length or weight, in a methodical
         way is now demonstrated by the concrete operational child. For example, they can methodically
         arrange a series of different-sized sticks in order by length, while younger children approach a
         similar task in a haphazard way.
         These new cognitive skills increase the child's understanding of the physical world, however
         according to Piaget, they still cannot think in abstract ways. Additionally, they do not think in
         systematic scientific ways. For example, when asked which variables influence the period that a
         pendulum takes to complete its arc, and given weights they can attach to strings in order to do
         experiments, most children younger than 12 perform biased experiments from which no
         conclusions can be drawn.17

Education

Remember the ecological systems model that we explored? This model helps us understand an
individual by examining the contexts in which the person lives and the direct and indirect influences
on that person's life. School becomes a very important component of children's lives during middle
and late childhood, and parents and the culture contribute to children's experiences in school as
indicated by the ecological systems model through their interaction with the school.

Parental Involvement in School

Parents and caregivers vary in their level of involvement with their children's schools. Teachers often
complain that they have difficulty getting parents/caregivers to participate in their child's education
and devise a variety of techniques to keep parents in touch with daily and overall progress. For
example, parents may be required to sign a behavior chart each evening to be returned to school or
may be given information about the school's events through websites and newsletters. There are
other factors that need to be considered when looking at parental involvement. To explore these,
first ask yourself if all parents who enter the school with concerns about their child be received in
the same way?

Horvat (2004) found that teachers seek a particular type of involvement from particular types of
parents.18 While teachers thought they were open and neutral in their responses to parental
involvement, in reality teachers were most receptive to support, praise and agreement coming from
parents who were most similar in race and social class with the teachers. Parents who criticized the
school or its policies were less likely to be given voice. Parents who have higher levels of income,
occupational status, and other qualities favored in society have family capital. This is a form of
power that can be used to improve a child's education. Caregivers who do not have these qualities
may find it more difficult to be effectively involved. The authors suggest that teachers closely
examine their biases. Schools may also need to examine their ability to dialogue with parents about
school policies in more open ways. Any efforts to improve effective parental involvement should
address these concerns.

Erikson: Industry vs. Inferiority

According to Erikson, children in middle and late childhood are very busy or industrious.19 They are
constantly doing, planning, playing, getting together with friends, and achieving. This is a very active

18. Horvat, E. M. (2004). Moments of social inclusion and exclusion: Race, class, and cultural capital in family-school
    relationships. In A. Lareau (Author) & J. H. Ballantine & J. Z. Spade (Eds.), Schools and society: A sociological approach to education
    (2nd ed., pp. 276-286). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth.

    244 | MIDDLE AND LATE CHILDHOOD

   time, and a time when they are gaining a sense of how they measure up when compared with peers.
   Erikson believed that if these industrious children can be successful in their endeavors, they will get
   a sense of confidence for future challenges. If not, a sense of inferiority can be particularly haunting
   during middle and late childhood.

  Bullying

   According to Stopbullying.gov, a federal government website managed by the U.S. Department of
   Health & Human Services, Bullying is defined as unwanted, aggressive behavior among school-aged
   children that involves a real or perceived power imbalance. Further, aggressive behavior happens
   more than once or has the potential to be repeated. There are different types of bullying, including
   verbal bullying, which is saying or writing mean things, teasing, name calling, taunting, threatening,
   or making inappropriate sexual comments. Social bullying, also referred to as relational bullying,
   involves spreading rumors, purposefully excluding someone from a group, or embarrassing someone
   on purpose. Physical Bullying involves hurting a person's body or possessions.

   A more recent form of bullying is Cyberbullying, which involves electronic technology. Examples of
   cyberbullying include sending mean text messages or emails, creating fake profiles, and posting
   embarrassing pictures, videos, or rumors on social networking sites. Children who experience
   cyberbullying have a harder time getting away from the behavior because it can occur at any time of
   day and without being in the presence of others. Additional concerns of cyberbullying include that
   messages and images can be posted anonymously, distributed quickly, and be difficult to trace or
   delete. Children who are cyberbullied are more likely to experience in-person bullying, be unwilling
   to attend school, receive poor grades, use alcohol and drugs, skip school, have lower self-esteem, and
   have more health problems.20

   Bullying can happen to anyone, but some students are at an increased risk for being bullied including
   lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered (LGBT) youth, those with disabilities, and those who are socially
   isolated. Additionally, those who are perceived as different, weak, less popular, overweight, or having
   low self-esteem, have a higher likelihood of being bullied.

   Bullies are often thought of as having low self-esteem, and then bully others to feel better about
   themselves. Although this can occur, many bullies in fact have high levels of self-esteem. They
   possess considerable popularity and social power and have well-connected peer relationships. They
   do not lack self-esteem, and instead lack empathy for others. They like to dominate or be in charge
   of others.

   Unfortunately, most children do not let adults know that they are being bullied. Some fear retaliation

from the bully, while others are too embarrassed to ask for help. Those who are socially isolated may
not know who to ask for help or believe that no one would care or assist them if they did ask for
assistance. Consequently, it is important for parents and teachers to know the warning signs that
may indicate a child is being bullied. These include unexplainable injuries, lost or destroyed
possessions, changes in eating or sleeping patterns, declining school grades, not wanting to go to
school, loss of friends, decreased self-esteem and/or self-destructive behaviors.

 ADOLESCENCE

     Martha Lally; Suzanne Valentine-French; and Diana Lang

  Adolescence is a period that begins with puberty and ends with the transition to adulthood
  (approximately ages 10-18). Physical changes associated with puberty are triggered by hormones.
  Changes happen at different rates in distinct parts of the brain and increase adolescents' propensity
  for risky behavior. Cognitive changes include improvements in complex and abstract thought.
  Adolescents' relationships with parents go through a period of redefinition in which many
  adolescents become more autonomous. Peer relationships are important sources of support, but
  companionship during adolescence can also promote problem behaviors. Identity formation occurs
  as adolescents explore and commit to different roles and ideological positions. Because so much is
  happening in these years, psychologists have focused a great deal of attention on the period of
  adolescence.1

 The Adolescent Brain

  The brain undergoes dramatic changes during adolescence. Although it does not get larger, it
  matures by becoming more interconnected and specialized.2 The myelination and development of
  connections between neurons continues. This results in an increase in the white matter of the brain,
  and allows the adolescent to make significant improvements in their thinking and processing skills.
  Different brain areas become myelinated at different times. For example, the brain's language areas
  undergo myelination during the first 13 years. Completed insulation of the axons consolidates these
  language skills, but makes it more difficult to learn a second language. With greater myelination,
  however, comes diminished plasticity as a myelin coating inhibits the growth of new connections.3

  Even as the connections between neurons are strengthened, synaptic pruning occurs more than
  during childhood as the brain adapts to changes in the environment. This synaptic pruning causes
  the gray matter of the brain, or the cortex, to become thinner but more efficient.4 The corpus
  callosum, which connects the two hemispheres, continues to thicken allowing for stronger
  connections between brain areas. Additionally, the hippocampus becomes more strongly connected

to the frontal lobes, allowing for greater integration of memory and experiences into our decision
making.

                              The limbic system, which regulates emotion

                              and reward, is linked to the hormonal changes

                              that occur at puberty. The limbic system is also

                              related to novelty seeking and a shift toward

                              interacting with peers. In contrast, the

                              prefrontal cortex which is involved in the

                              control of impulses, organization, planning, and

                              making good decisions, does not fully develop

                              until the mid-20s. According to Giedd (2015)

                              prefrontal cortex and early development of the

Figure 1. The Limbic System.  limbic system is the "mismatch" in timing
                              between the two.5 The approximately ten years

that separates the development of these two brain areas can result in risky behavior, poor decision

making, and weak emotional control for the adolescent. When puberty begins earlier, this mismatch

extends even further.

Teens often take more risks than adults and according to research, it is because they weigh risks and
rewards differently than adults do.6 For adolescents, the brain's sensitivity to the neurotransmitter
dopamine peaks, and dopamine is involved in reward circuits so the possible rewards outweigh the
risks. Adolescents respond especially strongly to social rewards during activities, and they prefer the
company of others their same age. In addition to dopamine, the adolescent brain is affected by
oxytocin which facilitates bonding and makes social connections more rewarding. With both
dopamine and oxytocin engaged, it is no wonder that adolescents seek peers and excitement in their
lives that could end up actually harming them.

Because of all the changes that occur in the adolescent brain, the chances for abnormal development
can occur, including mental illness. In fact, 50% of the mental illness occurs by the age 14 and 75%
occurs by age 24.7 Additionally, during this period of development the adolescent brain is especially
vulnerable to damage from drug exposure. For example, repeated exposure to marijuana can affect
cellular activity in the endocannabinoid system. Consequently, adolescents are more sensitive to the
effects of repeated marijuana exposure.8

   However, researchers have also focused on the highly adaptive qualities of the adolescent brain
   which allow the adolescent to move away from the family towards the outside world.9 10 Novelty
   seeking and risk-taking can generate positive outcomes including meeting new people and seeking
   out new situations. Separating from the family and moving into new relationships and different
   experiences are actually quite adaptive for society.

  Adolescent Sleep

   According to the National Sleep Foundation (NSF) (2016), adolescents need about 8 to 10 hours of
   sleep each night to function best.11 The most recent Sleep in America poll in 2006 indicated that
   adolescents between sixth and twelfth grade were not getting the recommended amount of sleep. On
   average adolescents only received 7 ½ hours of sleep per night on school nights with younger
   adolescents getting more than older ones (8.4 hours for sixth graders and only 6.9 hours for those in
   twelfth grade). For older adolescents, only about one in ten (9%) get an optimal amount of sleep, and
   they are more likely to experience negative consequences the following day. These include feeling
   too tired or sleepy, being cranky or irritable, falling asleep in school, having a depressed mood, and
   drinking caffeinated beverages (NSF, 2016). Additionally, they are at risk for substance abuse, car
   crashes, poor academic performance, obesity, and a weakened immune system.12

   Why don't adolescents get adequate sleep? In addition to known environmental and social factors,
   including work, homework, media, technology, and socializing, the adolescent brain is also a factor.
   As adolescents go through puberty, their circadian rhythms change and push back their sleep time
   until later in the evening.13 This biological change not only keeps adolescents awake at night, but it
   also makes it difficult for them to get up in the morning. When they are awake too early, their brains
   do not function optimally. Impairments are noted in attention, behavior, and academic achievement,
   while increases in tardiness and absenteeism are also demonstrated.

  Adolescent Sexual Activity

   By about age ten or eleven, most children experience increased sexual attraction to others that
   affects their social life, both in school and out.14

Adolescent Pregnancy

Although adolescent pregnancy rates have declined since 1991, teenage birth rates in the United
States are higher than most developed countries. In 2014 females aged 15-19 years experienced a
birth rate of 24.2 per 1,000 women. This is a drop of 9% from 2013. Birth rates fell 11% for those
aged 15-17 years and 7% for 18-19 year-olds. It appears that adolescents seem to be less sexually
active than in previous years, and those who are sexually active seem to be using birth control.15

Risk Factors for Adolescent Pregnancy

Miller, Benson, and Galbraith (2001) found that parent/child closeness, parental supervision, and
parents' values against teen intercourse (or unprotected intercourse) decreased the risk of adolescent
pregnancy.16 In contrast, residing in disorganized/dangerous neighborhoods, living in a lower SES
family, living with a single parent, having older sexually active siblings or pregnant/parenting
teenage sisters, early puberty, and being a victim of sexual abuse place adolescents at an increased
risk of adolescent pregnancy.

Consequences of Adolescent Pregnancy

After the child is born life can be difficult for a teenage mother. Teenagers who have a child before
age 18 years of age are less likely to graduate from high school. Without a high school degree, job
prospects are limited and economic independence is difficult. Teen mothers are more likely to live in
poverty, and more than 75% of all unmarried teen mothers receive public assistance within 5 years of
the birth of their first child. Approximately, 64% of children born to an unmarried teenage high-
school dropout live in poverty. Further, a child born to a teenage mother is 50% more likely to repeat
a grade in school and is more likely to perform poorly on standardized tests and drop out before
finishing high school.17 Research analyzing the age that men father their first child and how far they
complete their education have been summarized by the Pew Research Center (2015) and reflect the
research for females.18 Among dads ages 22 to 44, 70% of those with less than a high school diploma
say they fathered their first child before the age of 25. In comparison, less than half (45%) of fathers

   Like men, women with more education are likely to be older when they become mothers.

  Piaget's Formal Operational Stage

   During the formal operational stage, adolescents are able to understand abstract principles which
   have no physical reference. They can now contemplate such abstract constructs as beauty, love,
   freedom, and morality. The adolescent is no longer limited by what can be directly seen or heard.
   Additionally, while younger children solve problems through trial and error, adolescents
   demonstrate hypothetical-deductive reasoning, which is developing hypotheses based on what
   might logically occur. They are able to think about all the possibilities in a situation beforehand, and
   then test them systematically.19 Now they are able to engage in true scientific thinking. Formal
   operational thinking also involves accepting hypothetical situations. Adolescents understand the
   concept of transitivity, which means that a relationship between two elements is carried over to
   other elements logically related to the first two, such as if A<B and B<C, then A<C.20 For example,
   when asked: If Maria is shorter than Alicia and Alicia is shorter than Caitlyn, who is the shortest?
   Adolescents are able to answer the question correctly as they understand the transitivity involved.

   According to Piaget, most people attain some degree of formal operational thinking, but use formal
   operations primarily in the areas of their strongest interest.21 In fact, most adults do not regularly
   demonstrate formal operational thought, and in small villages and tribal communities, it is barely
   used at all. A possible explanation is that an individual's thinking has not been sufficiently challenged
   to demonstrate formal operational thought in all areas.

  Adolescent Egocentrism

   Once adolescents can understand abstract thoughts, they enter a world of hypothetical possibilities
   and demonstrate egocentrism or a heightened self-focus. The egocentricity comes from attributing
   unlimited power to their own thoughts.22 Piaget believed it was not until adolescents took on adult
   roles that they would be able to learn the limits to their own thoughts.

   David Elkind (1967) expanded on the concept of Piaget's adolescent egocentricity.23 Elkind theorized

   that the physiological changes that occur during adolescence result in adolescents being primarily
   concerned with themselves. Additionally, since adolescents fail to differentiate between what others
   are thinking and their own thoughts, they believe that others are just as fascinated with their
   behavior and appearance. This belief results in the adolescent anticipating the reactions of others,
   and consequently constructing an imaginary audience. "The imaginary audience is the adolescent's
   belief that those around them are as concerned and focused on their appearance as they themselves
   are" (p. 441).24 Elkind thought that the imaginary audience contributed to the self-consciousness that
   occurs during early adolescence. The desire for privacy and reluctance to share personal information
   may be a further reaction to feeling under constant observation by others.

   Another important consequence of adolescent egocentrism is the personal fable or a belief that one
   is unique, special, and invulnerable to harm. Elkind (1967) explains that because adolescents feel so
   important to others (imaginary audience) they regard themselves and their feelings as being special
   and unique.25 Adolescents believe that only they have experienced strong and diverse emotions, and
   therefore others could never understand how they feel. This uniqueness in one's emotional
   experiences reinforces the adolescent's belief of invulnerability, especially to death. Adolescents will
   engage in risky behaviors, such as drinking and driving or unprotected sex, and feel they will not
   suffer any negative consequences. Elkind believed that adolescent egocentricity emerged in early
   adolescence and declined in middle adolescence, however, recent research has also identified
   egocentricity in late adolescence.26

  Consequences of Formal Operational Thought

   As adolescents are now able to think abstractly and hypothetically, they exhibit many new ways of
   reflecting on information.27 For example, they demonstrate greater introspection or thinking about
   one's thoughts and feelings. They begin to imagine how the world could be which leads them to
   become idealistic or insisting upon high standards of behavior. Because of their idealism, they may
   become critical of others, especially adults in their life. Additionally, adolescents can demonstrate
   hypocrisy, or pretend to be what they are not. Since they are able to recognize what others expect of
   them, they will conform to those expectations for their emotions and behavior seemingly
   hypocritical to themselves.

Information Processing

Executive functions, such as attention, increases in working memory, and cognitive flexibility have
been steadily improving since early childhood. Studies have found that executive function is very
competent in adolescence. However, self-regulation, or the ability to control impulses, may still fail. A
failure in self- regulation is especially true when there is high stress or high demand on mental
functions.28 While high stress or demand may tax even an adult's self-regulatory abilities,
neurological changes in the adolescent brain may make teens particularly prone to more risky
decision making under these conditions.

Inductive and Deductive Reasoning

Inductive reasoning emerges in childhood, and    Figure 3. Inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning

characterized as "bottom-up- processing" in
which specific observations, or specific
comments from those in authority, may be used
to draw general conclusions. However, in
inductive reasoning the veracity of the
information that created the general conclusion
does not guarantee the accuracy of that
conclusion. For instance, a child who has only
observed thunder on summer days may
conclude that it only thunders in the summer.

In contrast, deductive reasoning, sometimes called "top-down-processing", emerges in adolescence.
This type of reasoning starts with some overarching principle, and based on this propose specific
conclusions. Deductive reasoning guarantees a truthful conclusion if the premises on which it is
based are accurate.

Intuitive versus Analytic Thinking: Cognitive psychologists often refer to intuitive and analytic
thought as the Dual-Process Model; the notion that humans have two distinct networks for
processing information.29 Intuitive thought is automatic, unconscious, and fast,30 and it is more
experiential and emotional. In contrast, Analytic thought is deliberate, conscious, and rational.

   While these systems interact, they are distinct.31 Intuitive thought is easier and more commonly used
   in everyday life. It is also more commonly used by children and teens than by adults.32 The quickness
   of adolescent thought, along with the maturation of the limbic system, may make teens more prone
   to emotional intuitive thinking than adults.

  Erikson: Identity vs. Role Confusion

   Erikson believed that the primary psychosocial task of adolescence was establishing an identity.
   Teens struggle with the question "Who am I?" This includes questions regarding their appearance,
   vocational choices and career aspirations, education, relationships, sexuality, political and social
   views, personality, and interests. Erikson saw this as a period of confusion and experimentation
   regarding identity and one's life path. During adolescence we experience psychological
   moratorium, where teens put on hold commitment to an identity while exploring the options. The
   culmination of this exploration is a more coherent view of oneself. Those who are unsuccessful at
   resolving this stage may either withdraw further into social isolation or become lost in the crowd.
   However, more recent research, suggests that few leave this age period with identity achievement
   and that most identity formation occurs during young adulthood.33

   Developmental psychologists have researched several different areas of identity development and
   some of the main areas include:

      · Religious identity: The religious views of teens are often similar to that of their families.34 Most
         teens may question specific customs, practices, or ideas in the faith of their parents, but few
         completely reject the religion of their families.

      · Political identity: The political ideology of teens is also influenced by their parents' political
         beliefs. A new trend in the 21st century is a decrease in party affiliation among adults. Many
         adults do not align themselves with either the democratic or republican party, but view
         themselves as more of an "independent". Their teenage children are often following suit or
         become more apolitical.35

      · Vocational identity: While adolescents in earlier generations envisioned themselves as working
         in a particular job, and often worked as an apprentice or part-time in such occupations as
         teenagers, this is rarely the case today. Vocational identity takes longer to develop, as most of
         today's occupations require specific skills and knowledge that will require additional education
         or are acquired on the job itself. In addition, many of the jobs held by teens are not in
         occupations that most teens will seek as adults.

      · Gender identity: This is also becoming an increasingly prolonged task as attitudes and norms
         regarding gender keep changing. The roles appropriate for males and females are evolving.
         Some teens may foreclose on a gender identity as a way of dealing with this uncertainty, and
         they may adopt more stereotypic male or female roles.36

      · Ethnic identity refers to how people come to terms with who they are based on their ethnic or
         racial ancestry. "The task of ethnic identity formation involves sorting out and resolving positive
         and negative feelings and attitudes about one's own ethnic group and about other groups and
         identifying one's place in relation to both" (p. 119).37 When groups differ in status in a culture,
         those from the non- dominant group have to be cognizant of the customs and values of those
         from the dominant culture. The reverse is rarely the case. This makes ethnic identity far less
         salient for members of the dominant culture. In the United States, those of European ancestry
         engage in less exploration of ethnic identity, than do those of non-European ancestry.38
         However, according to the U.S. Census (2012) more than 40% of Americans under the age of 18
         are from ethnic minorities.39 For many ethnic minority teens, discovering one's ethnic identity
         is an important part of identity formation.

   Phinney's model of ethnic identity formation is based on Erikson's and Marcia's model of identity
   formation.40 41 Through the process of exploration and commitment, individuals come to
   understand and create an ethnic identity. Phinney suggests three stages or statuses with regard to
   ethnic identity:

         identity issues may be in the first stage, unexamined ethnic identity. This is often characterized
         by a preference for the dominant culture, or where the individual has given little thought to the
         question of their ethnic heritage. This is similar to diffusion in Marcia's model of identity.42
         Included in this group are also those who have adopted the ethnicity of their parents and other
         family members with little thought about the issues themselves, similar to Marcia's foreclosure
         status.43
     2. Ethnic Identity Search: Adolescents and adults who are exploring the customs, culture, and
         history of their ethnic group are in the ethnic identity search stage, similar to Marcia's
         moratorium status.44 Often some event "awakens" a teen or adult to their ethnic group; either
         personal experience with prejudice, a highly profiled case in the media, or even a more positive
         event that recognizes the contribution of someone from the individual's ethnic group. Teens and
         adults in this stage will immerse themselves in their ethnic culture. For some, "it may lead to a
         rejection of the values of the dominant culture" (p. 503).45
     3. Achieved Ethnic Identity: Those who have actively explored their culture are likely to have a
         deeper appreciation and understanding of their ethnic heritage, leading to progress toward an
         achieved ethnic identity.46 An achieved ethnic identity does not necessarily imply that the
         individual is highly involved in the customs and values of their ethnic culture. One can be
         confident in their ethnic identity without wanting to maintain the language or other customs.

   The development of ethnic identity takes time, with about 25% of tenth graders from ethnic
   minority backgrounds having explored and resolved the issues.47 The more ethnically homogeneous
   the high school, the less identity exploration and achievement.48 Moreover, even in more ethnically
   diverse high schools, teens tend to spend more time with their own group, reducing exposure to
   other ethnicities. This may explain why, for many, college becomes the time of ethnic identity

   exploration. "[The] transition to college may serve as a consciousness-raising experience that triggers
   exploration."49

   It is also important to note that those who do achieve ethnic identity may periodically reexamine the
   issues of ethnicity. This cycling between exploration and achievement is common not only for ethnic
   identity formation but in other aspects of identity development.50

  Bicultural/Multiracial Identity

   Some who identify as ethnic minorities may wrestle with the question of how, and to what extent,
   they will identify with the culture of the surrounding society and with the culture of their family.
   Phinney (2006) suggests that people may handle it in different ways.51 Some may keep the identities
   separate, others may combine them in some way, while others may reject some of them. Bicultural
   identity means the individual sees oneself as part of both the ethnic minority group and the larger
   society. Those who are multiracial, that is whose parents come from two or more ethnic or racial
   groups, may have a more challenging task. In some cases their appearance may be ambiguous. This
   can lead to others constantly asking them to categorize themselves. Phinney (2006) notes that the
   process of identity formation may start earlier and take longer to accomplish in those who are not
   mono-racial.52

  Individual Identity Development within the Family Context

   An individual's identity forms in part from being a member of a family. In other words, an
   individual's personal identity emerges within the context of the family. It is not a neutral
   environment and family can greatly affect an individual's identity development.53 Recall the
   definition of family from the key concepts at the beginning of this book, that family can include
   various people who have relationship with an individual beyond just legal or biological ties. Many
   families are also a well-organized group with a high degree of unity that interacts with its social and

   cultural context. It is different from other social groups because it typically does not have a limited
   lifetime similar to most social groups, but rather most families have a past, present, and future.54

   Based on the family systems theory (visit the family systems chapter for more information) the
   family is considered a system (or unit) which is also made up of subsystems that inform one's
   individual identity. These subsystems may include couple relationships, sibling relationships, parent-
   child relationships, and so on. 55 Individuals within these systems have separate individual identities
   as well as the shared identity of a subsystem or family system. This means that individuals' role
   identities, such as being a sibling, spouse, parent, and/or child are interdependent with one another.
   One's identity in multiple domains such as the identity of being both a parent and child are linked,
   meaning that parents are also children of the preceding generation.56 Thus, one's identity formed in
   part by one identity role, such as being a child of a parent can influence later identity roles such as
   becoming a parent. Parenting style can also influence identity development. For example, those who
   experience significant abuse within their family may not achieve as clear of an identity compared to
   those who do not experience any abuse within their family.57

  Parents/Caregivers and Teens: Autonomy and Attachment

   While most adolescents tend to get along with their parents or primary caregivers, many tend to
   spend less time with them.58 This decrease in the time spent with families may be a reflection of a
   teenager's greater desire for independence or autonomy. It can be difficult for many parents to deal
   with this desire for autonomy. However, it is likely adaptive for teenagers to increasingly distance
   themselves and establish relationships outside of their families in preparation for adulthood. This
   means that both parents and teenagers need to strike a balance between autonomy, while still
   maintaining close and supportive familial relationships.

   Children in middle and late childhood are increasingly granted greater freedom regarding moment-
   to-moment decision making. This continues in adolescence, as teens are demanding greater control
   in decisions that affect their daily lives. This can increase conflict between parents and their
   teenagers. For many adolescents, this conflict centers on chores, homework, curfew, dating, and
   personal appearance. These are all things many teens believe they should manage that parents

   mothers to be more encouraging and supportive.59 As teens grow older, more compromise is reached
   between parents and teenagers.60 In addition, culture and ethnicity also play a role in how restrictive
   parents/caregivers are with the daily lives of their children.61
   Having supportive, less conflict-ridden relationships with primary caregivers also benefits teenagers.
   Research on attachment in adolescence find that teens who are still securely attached to their parents
   have less emotional problems,62 are less likely to engage in drug abuse and other criminal
   behaviors,63 and have more positive peer relationships.64

EMERGING AND EARLY ADULTHOOD

   Martha Lally and Suzanne Valentine-French

Historically, early adulthood spanned from approximately 18 years (the end of adolescence) until 40
to 45 years (beginning of middle adulthood). More recently, developmentalists have divided this age
period into two separate stages: Emerging adulthood followed by early adulthood. Although these
age periods differ in their physical, cognitive, and social development, overall the age period from 18
years to 45 years is a time of peak physical capabilities and the emergence of more mature cognitive
development, financial independence, and intimate relationships.1

Emerging Adulthood

Emerging adulthood is the period between the late     Figure 1. A young adult enjoying a saxophonist
teens and early twenties; ages 18-25 years, although  performance. (Photo Source: pxfuel, DMCA)
some researchers have included up to age 29 years in
the definition.2 Jeffrey Arnett (2000) argues that
emerging adulthood is neither adolescence nor is it
young adulthood.3 Individuals in this age period
have left behind the relative dependency of
childhood and adolescence, but have not yet taken
on the responsibilities of adulthood. "Emerging
adulthood is a time of life when many different
directions remain possible, when little about the
future is decided for certain, when the scope of
independent exploration of life's possibilities is
greater for most people than it will be at any other
period of the life course" (p. 469).4

    260 | EMERGING AND EARLY ADULTHOOD

   Arnett has identified five characteristics of emerging adulthood that distinguishes it from
   adolescence and young adulthood.5

     1. It is the age of identity exploration. In 1950, Erik Erikson proposed that it was during
         adolescence that humans wrestled with the question of identity. Yet, even Erikson (1968)
         commented on a trend during the 20th century of a "prolonged adolescence" in industrialized
         societies. Today, most identity development occurs during the late teens and early twenties
         rather than adolescence. It is during emerging adulthood that people are exploring their career
         choices and ideas about intimate relationships, setting the foundation for adulthood.

     2. Arnett also described this time period as the age of instability.6 Exploration generates
         uncertainty and instability. Emerging adults change jobs, relationships, and residences more
         frequently than other age groups.

     3. This is also the age of self-focus. Being self-focused is not the same as being "self- centered."
         Adolescents are more self-centered than emerging adults. Arnett reports that in his research, he
         found emerging adults to be very considerate of the feelings of others, especially their parents.
         They now begin to see their parents as people not just parents, something most adolescents fail
         to do.7 Nonetheless, emerging adults focus more on themselves, as they realize that they have
         few obligations to others and that this is the time where they can do what they want with their
         life.

     4. This is also the age of feeling in-between. When asked if they feel like adults, more 18 to 25
         year-olds answer "yes and no" than do teens or adults over the age of 25.8 Most emerging adults
         have gone through the changes of puberty, are typically no longer in high school, and many have
         also moved out of their parents' home. Thus, they no longer feel as dependent as they did as
         teenagers. Yet, they may still be financially dependent on their parents to some degree, and they
         have not completely attained some of the indicators of adulthood, such as finishing their
         education, obtaining a good full-time job, being in a committed relationship, or being
         responsible for others. It is not surprising that Arnett found that 60% of 18 to 25 year-olds felt
         that in some ways they were adults, but in some ways they were not.9

     5. Finally, emerging adulthood is the age of possibilities. It is a time period of optimism as more
         18 to 25 year-olds feel that they will someday get to where they want to be in life. Arnett
         suggests that this optimism is because these dreams have yet to be tested.10,

   For example, it is easier to believe that you will eventually find your soul mate when you have yet to
   have had a serious relationship. It may also be a chance to change directions, for those whose lives up
   to this point have been difficult. The experiences of children and teens are influenced by the choices
   and decisions of their parents. If the parents are dysfunctional, there is little a child can do about it.
   In emerging adulthood, people can move out and move on. They have the chance to transform their
   lives and move away from unhealthy environments. Even those whose lives were happier and more
   fulfilling as children, now have the opportunity in emerging adulthood to become independent and
   make decisions about the direction they would like their life to take.

  Cultural Variations

   The five features proposed in the theory of emerging adulthood originally were based on research
   involving about 300 Americans between ages 18 and 29 from various ethnic groups, social classes,
   and geographical regions.11 To what extent does the theory of emerging adulthood apply
   internationally?

   The answer to this question depends greatly on what part of the world is considered. Demographers
   make a useful distinction between the developing countries that comprise the majority of the world's
   population and the economically developed countries that are part of the Organization for
   Economic Co- operation and Development (OECD), including the United States, Canada, Western
   Europe, Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand. The current population of OECD
   countries (also called developed countries) is 1.2 billion, about 18% of the total world population.12
   The rest of the human population resides in developing countries, which have much lower median
   incomes, much lower median educational attainment, and much higher incidence of illness, disease,
   and early death. Let us consider emerging adulthood in other OECD countries as little is known
   about the experiences of 18- 25 year-olds in developing countries.

   The same demographic changes as described above for the United States have taken place in other
   OECD countries as well. This is true of participation in postsecondary education, as well as median
   ages for entering marriage and parenthood.13 However, there is also substantial variability in how
   emerging adulthood is experienced across OECD countries. Europe is the region where emerging

adulthood is longest and most leisurely. The median ages for entering marriage and parenthood are
near 30 in most European countries.14

Europe today is the location of the most affluent, generous, and egalitarian societies in the world, in
fact, in human history.15 Governments pay for tertiary education, assist young people in finding jobs,
and provide generous unemployment benefits for those who cannot find work. In northern Europe,
many governments also provide housing support. Emerging adults in European societies make the
most of these advantages, gradually making their way to adulthood during their twenties while
enjoying travel and leisure with friends.

different. Like emerging European adults,
emerging adults in Asian tend to enter marriage
and parenthood around age 30 years.16 Like
emerging adults in Europe, emerging adults in
Japan and South Korea enjoy the benefits of
living in affluent societies with generous social
welfare systems that provide support for them
in making the transition to adulthood,
including free university education and
substantial unemployment benefits.

However, in other ways, the experience of emerging adulthood in Asian OECD countries is
markedly different than in Europe. Europe has a long history of individualism, and today's emerging
adults carry that legacy with them in their focus on self-development and leisure during emerging
adulthood. In contrast, most Asian cultures have a shared cultural history emphasizing collectivism
and family obligations.

Although Asian cultures have become more individualistic in recent decades, as a consequence of
globalization, the legacy of collectivism persists in the lives of emerging adults. They pursue identity
explorations and self-development during emerging adulthood, like their American and European
counterparts, but within narrower boundaries set by their sense of obligations to others, especially

   their parents.17 For example, in their views of the most important criteria for becoming an adult,
   emerging adults in the United States and Europe consistently rank financial independence among
   the most important markers of adulthood. In contrast, emerging adults with an Asian cultural
   background especially emphasize becoming capable of supporting parents financially as among the
   most important criteria.18 19 This sense of family obligation may curtail their identity explorations in
   emerging adulthood to some extent, as they pay more heed to their parents' wishes about what they
   should study, what job they should take, and where they should live than emerging adults do in the
   West.20

  When Does Adulthood Begin?

   According to Rankin and Kenyon (2008), historically the process of becoming an adult was more
   clearly marked by rites of passage.21 For many individuals, marriage and becoming a parent were
   considered entry into adulthood. However, these role transitions are no longer considered as the
   important markers of adulthood.22 Economic and social changes have resulted in increase in young
   adults attending college and a delay in marriage and having children.23 24 Consequently, current
   research has found financial independence and accepting responsibility for oneself to be the most
   important markers of adulthood in Western culture across age and ethnic groups.25

   In looking at college students' perceptions of adulthood, Rankin and Kenyon (2008) found that some

   students still view rites of passage as important markers.26 College students who had placed more
   importance on role transition markers, such as parenthood and marriage, belonged to a fraternity/
   sorority, were traditionally aged (18-25), belonged to an ethnic minority, were of a traditional
   marital status; i.e., not cohabitating, or belonged to a religious organization, particularly for men.
   These findings supported the view that people holding collectivist or more traditional values place
   more importance on role transitions as markers of adulthood. In contrast, older college students and
   those cohabitating did not value role transitions as markers of adulthood as strongly.

  Obesity

   Although at the peak of physical health, a concern for early adults is the current rate of obesity.
   Results from the 2015 National Center for Health Statistics indicate that an estimated 70.7% of U.S.
   adults aged 20 and over are overweight and 37.9% are obese.27 Body mass index (BMI), expressed as
   weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2), is commonly used to classify
   overweight (BMI 25.0-29.9), obesity (BMI greater than or equal to 30.0), and extreme obesity (BMI
   greater than or equal to 40.0). The 2015 statistics are an increase from the 2013-2014 statistics that
   indicated that an estimated 35.1% were obese, and 6.4% extremely obese.28 In 2003-2004, 32% of
   American adults were identified as obese. The CDC also indicated that one's 20s are the prime time
   to gain weight as the average person gains one to two pounds per year from early adulthood into
   middle adulthood. The average man in his 20s weighs around 185 pounds and by his 30s weighs
   approximately 200 pounds. The average American woman weighs 162 pounds in her 20s and 170
   pounds in her 30s.

The American obesity crisis is also reflected
worldwide.29 Although obesity is seen throughout
the world, more obese men and women live in China
and the USA than in any other country. Figure 2
illustrates how waist circumference is also used as a
measure of obesity. Figure 3 demonstrates the
percentage of growth for males and females
identified as obese between 1960 and 2012.

Causes of Obesity

According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) (2016), obesity originates from a
complex set of contributing factors, including one's Figure 3. Waist Circumference
environment, behavior, and genetics. Societal factors
include culture, education, food marketing and promotion, the quality of food, and the physical
activity environment available. Behaviors leading to obesity include diet, the amount of physical
activity, and medication use. Lastly, there does not appear to be a single gene responsible for obesity.
Rather, research has identified variants in several genes that may contribute to obesity by increasing
hunger and food intake. Another genetic explanation is the mismatch between today's environment
and "energy-thrifty genes" that multiplied in the distant past, when food sources were unpredictable.
The genes that helped our ancestors survive occasional famines are now being challenged by
environments in which food is plentiful all the time. Overall, obesity most likely results from
complex interactions among the environment and multiple genes.

Obesity Health Consequences

Obesity is considered to be one of the leading causes of death in the United States and worldwide.
According to the CDC (2016) compared to those with a normal or healthy weight, people who are
obese are at increased risk for many serious diseases and health conditions including:30

  · All-causes of death (mortality)
  · High blood pressure (Hypertension)
  · High LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, or high levels of triglycerides (Dyslipidemia)
  · Type 2 diabetes

      · Mental illness such as clinical depression, anxiety, and other mental disorders
      · Body pain and difficulty with physical functioning

  A Healthy, but Risky Time

   Doctor's visits are less frequent in early adulthood than for those in midlife and late adulthood and
   are necessitated primarily by injury and pregnancy.31 However, the top five causes of death in
   emerging and early adulthood are non-intentional injury (including motor vehicle accidents),
   homicide, and suicide with cancer and heart disease completing the list.32 Rates of violent death
   (homicide, suicide, and accidents) are highest among young adult males, and vary by race and
   ethnicity. Rates of violent death are higher in the United States than in Canada, Mexico, Japan, and
   other selected countries. Males are more likely to die in auto accidents than are females.33

  Alcohol Abuse

   A significant contributing factor to risky behavior is alcohol. According to the 2014 National Survey
   on Drug Use and Health (National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), 88% of
   people ages 18 or older reported that they drank alcohol at some point in their lifetime; 71%
   reported that they drank in the past year; and 57% reported drinking in the past month.34
   Additionally, 6.7% reported that they engaged in heavy drinking in the past month. Heavy drinking
   is defined as drinking five or more drinks on the same occasion on each of five or more days in the
   past 30 days. Nearly 88,000 people (approximately 62,000 men and 26,000 women) die from alcohol-
   related causes annually, making it the fourth leading preventable cause of death in the United States.
   In 2014, alcohol-impaired driving fatalities accounted for 9,967 deaths (31% of overall driving
   fatalities).

   The NIAAA defines binge drinking when blood alcohol concentration levels reach 0.08 g/dL. This
   typically occurs after four drinks for women and five drinks for men in approximately two hours. In
   2014, 25% of people ages 18 or older reported that they engaged in binge drinking in the past month.
   According to the NIAAA (2015) "Binge drinking poses serious health and safety risks, including car
   crashes, drunk-driving arrests, sexual assaults, and injuries. Over the long term, frequent binge
   drinking can damage the liver and other organs," (p. 1).35

  Alcohol and College Students

   Results from the 2014 survey demonstrated a difference between the amount of alcohol consumed
   by college students and those of the same age who are not in college.36 Specifically, 60% of full-time
   college students' ages 18-22 drank alcohol in the past month compared with 51.5% of other persons
   of the same age not in college. In addition, 38% of college students' ages 18-22 engaged in binge
   drinking; that is, five or more drinks on one occasion in the past month, compared with 33.5% of
   other persons of the same age. Lastly, 12% of college students' (ages 18-22) engaged in heavy
   drinking; that is, binge drinking on five or more occasions per month, in the past month. This
   compares with 9.5% of other emerging adults not in college.

   The consequences for college drinking are staggering, and the NIAAA (2016) estimates that each
   year the following occur:

      · 1,825 college students between the ages of 18 and 24 die from alcohol-related unintentional
         injuries, including motor-vehicle crashes.

      · 696,000 students between the ages of 18 and 24 are assaulted by another student who has been
         drinking.

      · Roughly 1 in 5 college students meet the criteria for an Alcohol Use Disorder.
      · About 1 in 4 college students report academic consequences from drinking, including missing

         class, falling behind in class, doing poorly on exams or papers, and receiving lower grades

   454).37 Krebs, Lindquist, Warner, Fisher and Martin (2009) found that over 80% of sexual assaults on
   college campuses involved alcohol.38 Being intoxicated increases a female's risk of being the victim of
   date or acquaintance rape.39 Females are more likely to blame themselves and to be blamed by others
   if they were intoxicated when raped. College students view perpetrators who were drinking as less
   responsible, and victims who were drinking as more responsible for the assaults.40

  Factors Affecting College Students' Drinking

   Several factors associated with college life affect a student's involvement with alcohol.41 These
   include the pervasive availability of alcohol, inconsistent enforcement of underage drinking laws,
   unstructured time, coping with stressors, and limited interactions with parents and other adults. Due
   to social pressures to conform and expectations when entering college, the first six weeks of
   freshman year are an especially susceptible time for students. Additionally, more drinking occurs in
   colleges with active Greek systems and athletic programs. Alcohol consumption is lowest among
   students living with their families and commuting, while it is highest among those living in
   fraternities and sororities.

  College Strategies to Curb Drinking

   Strategies to address college drinking involve the individual-level and campus community as a
   whole. Identifying at-risk groups, such as first year students, members of fraternities and sororities,
   and athletes has proven helpful in changing students' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior regarding
   alcohol.42 Interventions include education and awareness programs, as well as intervention by health
   professionals. At the college-level, reducing the availability of alcohol has proven effective by
   decreasing both consumption and negative consequences.

  Non-Alcohol Substance Use

   Illicit drug use peaks between the ages of 19 and 22 and then begins to decline. Additionally, 25% of

   those who smoke cigarettes, 33% of those who smoke marijuana, and 70% of those who abuse
   cocaine began using after age 17.43 Emerging adults (18 to 25) are the largest abusers of prescription
   opioid pain relievers, anti-anxiety medications, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
   medication.44 In 2014 more than 1700 emerging adults died from a prescription drug overdose. This
   is an increase of four times since 1999. Additionally, for every death there were 119 emergency room
   visits.

   Daily marijuana use is at the highest level in three decades.45 For those in college, 2019 data indicate
   that 5.9% of college students smoke marijuana daily, while only 2% smoked daily in 1994. For non-
   college students of the same age, the daily percentage is over twice as high (approximately 15%).
   Additionally, daily cigarette smoking is lower for those in college as only 7.9% smoked in the past
   month, while for those not in college was 16%.46

   Rates of violent death are influenced by substance use which peaks during emerging and early
   adulthood. Drugs impair judgment, reduce inhibitions, and alter mood, all of which can lead to
   dangerous behavior. Reckless driving, violent altercations, and forced sexual encounters are some
   examples. Drug and alcohol use increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections because people
   are more likely to engage in risky sexual behavior when under the influence. This includes having
   sex with someone who has had multiple partners, having anal sex without the use of a condom,
   having multiple partners, or having sex with someone whose history is unknown. Lastly, as
   previously discussed, drugs and alcohol ingested during pregnancy have a teratogenic effect on the
   developing embryo and fetus.

  Beyond Formal Operational Thought

   According to Piaget's theory, adolescents acquire formal operational thought as they. The hallmark
   of this type of thinking is the ability to think abstractly or to consider possibilities and ideas about
   circumstances never directly experienced. Thinking abstractly is only one characteristic of adult
   thought, however. If you compare a 15 year-old with someone in their late 30s, you would probably
   find that the latter considers not only what is possible, but also what is likely. Why the change? The
   adult has gained experience and understands why possibilities do not always become realities. They
   learn to base decisions on what is realistic and practical, not idealistic, and can make adaptive

   choices. Adults are also not as influenced by what others think. This advanced type of thinking is
   referred to as postformal Thought.47

   In addition to moving toward more practical considerations, thinking in early adulthood may also
   become more flexible and balanced. Abstract ideas that the adolescent believes in firmly may become
   standards by which the adult evaluates reality. Adolescents tend to think in dichotomies; ideas are
   true or false; good or bad; and there is no middle ground. However, with experience, the adult comes
   to recognize that there is some right and some wrong in each position, some good or some bad in a
   policy or approach, some truth and some falsity in a particular idea. This ability to bring together
   salient aspects of two opposing viewpoints or positions is referred to as dialectical thought and is
   considered one of the most advanced aspects of postformal thinking.48 Such thinking is more
   realistic because very few positions, ideas, situations, or people are completely right or wrong. So,
   for example, parents who were considered angels or devils by the adolescent eventually become just
   people with strengths and weaknesses, endearing qualities, and faults to the adult.

  Does everyone reach post-formal or even formal operational thought?

   Formal operational thought involves being able to think abstractly; however, this ability does not
   apply to all situations or all adults. Formal operational thought is influenced by experience and
   education. Some adults lead lives in which they are not challenged to think abstractly about their
   world. Many adults do not receive any formal education and are not taught to think abstractly about
   situations they have never experienced. Further, they are also not exposed to conceptual tools used
   to formally analyze hypothetical situations. Those who do think abstractly, in fact, may be able to do
   so more easily in some subjects than others. For example, psychology majors may be able to think
   abstractly about psychology, but be unable to use abstract reasoning in physics or chemistry.
   Abstract reasoning in a particular field requires a knowledge base that we might not have in all areas.
   Consequently, our ability to think abstractly depends to a large extent on our experiences.

  Attachment in Young Adulthood

   Hazan and Shaver (1987) described the attachment styles of adults, using the same three general
   categories proposed by Ainsworth's research on young children; secure, avoidant, and anxious/
   ambivalent.49 Hazan and Shaver developed three brief paragraphs describing the three adult
   attachment styles. Adults were then asked to think about romantic relationships they were in and

select the paragraph that best described the way they felt, thought, and behaved in these relationships
(See Table 1).

              I find that others are reluctant to get as close as I would like. I often worry that my partner
              doesn't really love me or won't stay with me. I want to merge completely with another
              person, and this sometimes scares people away.

Bartholomew (1990) challenged the categorical

view of attachment in adults and suggested that

adult attachment was best described as varying

along two dimensions; attachment related-

anxiety and attachment-related avoidance.51

Attachment-related anxiety refers to the extent

to which an adult worries about whether their

partner really loves them. Those who score high

on this dimension fear that their partner will

reject or abandon them.52 Attachment-related

avoidance refers to whether an adult can open    Figure 5. Four-Category Model with the Two-
up to others, and whether they trust and feel    Dimensions of Attachment
they can depend on others. Those who score

high on attachment-related avoidance are uncomfortable with opening up and may fear that such

dependency may limit their sense of autonomy. According to Bartholomew (1990) this would yield

four possible attachment styles in adults; secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful-avoidant (see

Figure 5).53

   Securely attached adults score lower on both dimensions. They are comfortable trusting their
   partners and do not worry excessively about their partner's love for them. Adults with a dismissing
   style score low on attachment-related anxiety, but higher on attachment-related avoidance. Such
   adults dismiss the importance of relationships. They trust themselves but do not trust others, thus do
   not share their dreams, goals, and fears with others. They do not depend on other people and feel
   uncomfortable when they have to do so.

   Those with a preoccupied attachment are low in attachment-related avoidance, but high in
   attachment-related anxiety. Such adults are often prone to jealousy and worry that their partner does
   not love them as much as they need to be loved. Adults whose attachment style is fearful-avoidant
   score high on both attachment-related avoidance and attachment-related anxiety. These adults want
   close relationships, but do not feel comfortable getting emotionally close to others. They have trust
   issues with others and often do not trust their own social skills in maintaining relationships.

   Research on attachment in adulthood has found that:

      · Adults with insecure attachments report lower satisfaction in their relationships.54
      · Those high in attachment-related anxiety report more daily conflict in their relationships.55
      · Those with avoidant attachment exhibit less support to their partners.56
      · Young adults show greater attachment-related anxiety than do middle-aged or older adults.57
      · Some studies report that young adults show more attachment-related avoidance,58 while other

         studies find that middle-aged adults show higher avoidance than younger or older adults.59
      · Young adults with more secure and positive relationships with their parents make the transition

         to adulthood more easily than do those with more insecure attachments.60

  Do people with certain attachment styles attract those with similar styles?

   When people are asked what kinds of psychological or behavioral qualities they are seeking in a
   romantic partner, a large majority of people indicate that they are seeking someone who is kind,
   caring, trustworthy, and understanding, that is the kinds of attributes that characterize a "secure"
   caregiver.61 However, we know that people do not always end up with others who meet their ideals.
   Are secure people more likely to end up with secure partners, and, vice versa, are insecure people
   more likely to end up with insecure partners? The majority of the research that has been conducted
   to date suggests that the answer is "yes." Frazier, Byer, Fischer, Wright, and DeBord (1996) studied
   the attachment patterns of more than 83 heterosexual couples and found that, if the man was
   relatively secure, the woman was also likely to be secure.62

   One important question is whether these findings exist because (a) secure people are more likely to
   be attracted to other secure people, (b) secure people are likely to create security in their partners
   over time, or (c) some combination of these possibilities. Existing empirical research strongly
   supports the first alternative. For example, when people have the opportunity to interact with
   individuals who vary in security in a speed-dating context, they express a greater interest in those
   who are more secure rather than those who are more insecure.63 However, there is also some
   evidence that people's attachment styles mutually shape one another in close relationships. For
   example, in a longitudinal study, Hudson, Fraley, Vicary, and Brumbaugh (2012) found that, if one
   person in a relationship experienced a change in security, the person's partner was likely to
   experience a change in the same direction.64

  Do early experiences as children shape adult attachment?

   The majority of research on this issue is retrospective; that is, it relies on adults' reports of what they
   recall about their childhood experiences. This kind of work suggests that secure adults are more
   likely to describe their early childhood experiences with their parents as being supportive, loving,
   and kind.65 A number of longitudinal studies are emerging that demonstrate prospective associations
   between early attachment experiences and adult attachment styles and/or interpersonal functioning

   in adulthood. For example, Fraley, Roisman, Booth-LaForce, Owen, and Holland (2013) found in a
   sample of more than 700 individuals studied from infancy to adulthood that maternal sensitivity
   across development prospectively predicted security at age 18.66 Simpson, Collins, Tran, and Haydon
   (2007) found that attachment security, assessed in infancy in the strange situation, predicted peer
   competence in grades one to three, which, in turn, predicted the quality of friendship relationships at
   age 16, which, in turn, predicted the expression of positive and negative emotions in their adult
   romantic relationships at ages 20 to 23.67

   It is easy to come away from such findings with the mistaken assumption that early experiences
   "determine" later outcomes. To be clear: Attachment theorists assume that the relationship between
   early experiences and subsequent outcomes is probabilistic, not deterministic. Having supportive
   and responsive experiences with caregivers early in life is assumed to set the stage for positive social
   development. But that does not mean that attachment patterns are set in stone. In short, even if an
   individual has far from optimal experiences in early life, attachment theory suggests that it is
   possible for that individual to develop well-functioning adult relationships through a number of
   corrective experiences, including relationships with siblings, other family members, teachers, and
   close friends. Security is best viewed as a culmination of a person's attachment history rather than a
   reflection of his or her early experiences alone. Those early experiences are considered important,
   not because they determine a person's fate, but because they provide the foundation for subsequent
   experiences.

  Relationships with Parents/Caregivers and Siblings

   In early adulthood the parent-child relationship has to transition toward a relationship between two
   adults. This involves a reappraisal of the relationship by both parents and young adults. One of the
   biggest challenges for parents/caregivers, especially during emerging adulthood, is coming to terms
   with the adult status of their children. Aquilino (2006) suggests that parents who are reluctant or
   unable to do so may hinder young adults' identity development.68 This problem becomes more
   pronounced when young adults still reside with their parents. Arnett (2004) reported that leaving
   home often helped promote psychological growth and independence in early adulthood.69

Sibling relationships are one of the longest-lasting bonds in people's lives. Yet, there is little research
on the nature of sibling relationships in adulthood.70 What is known is that the nature of these
relationships change, as adults have a choice as to whether they will maintain a close bond and
continue to be a part of the life of a sibling. Siblings must make the same reappraisal of each other as
adults, as parents have to with their adult children. Research has shown a decline in the frequency of
interactions between siblings during early adulthood, as presumably peers, romantic relationships,
and children become more central to the lives of young adults. Aquilino (2006) suggests that the task
in early adulthood may be to maintain enough of a bond so that there will be a foundation for this
relationship in later life.71 Those who are successful can often move away from the "older-younger"
sibling conflicts of childhood, toward a more equal relationship between two adults. Siblings that
were close to each other in childhood are typically close in adulthood,72 and in fact, it is unusual for
siblings to develop closeness for the first time in adulthood. Overall, the majority of adult sibling
relationships are close.73

Erikson's sixth stage focuses on establishing intimate    Figure 6. Young adults find companionship in both
relationships or risking social isolation.74 Intimate     friend groups and prospective partners. (Photo

struggling with identity. Achieving a sense of
identity is a life-long process, as there are periods of
identity crisis and stability. However, once identity is
established intimate relationships can be pursued.75

These intimate relationships include
acquaintanceships and friendships, but also the more
