be used in accessible ways. The second for their collaborative
support for Subject Coordinators implementing complex
access requirement for a student to ensure they have an
inclusive experience. The team has also partnered with ADCET
to adapt their own accessibility resources for the Australian
and New Zealand tertiary sector.

Katie brings the student voice into the work that she does, by
advocating for and implementing paid opportunities for co-
design. Examples of this include the Students Explain Digital
Accessibility video series, where five UTS students draw on
their lived experiences of disability to explain why academics

Foreword

ROYCE KIMMONS

Educational systems are social systems. That shouldn't be an
earth-shattering thing to say, but it's amazing how often those
doing education-adjacent work view education as something
that is inherently non-social (i.e. non-human). Near the end of
a recent class about universal design for learning, one of my
students who was preparing to become a secondary science
teacher raised his hand. "You mean," he said, with exasperation
in his voice, "that we're expected to teach every student in
our classes?" "Well, yes," I replied, unsuccessfully hiding some
shock, "of course!".

Yet, it's not always obvious that education should actually
involve teaching someone at all, let alone everyone. A
charitable interpretation of this student's reaction may be
found in teachers' motivations to enter the field. Secondary
and tertiary teachers especially are drawn to education
because they love their subjects, with their hearts focused on
Shakespeare, cellular mitosis, the Renaissance, or the quadratic
formula, and though there is nothing wrong with such a love
of knowledge, per se, this focus can quickly warp into a view of
education as being merely "teaching something" rather than
"teaching someone something." Perhaps that's why classroom
management is the biggest reason teachers in my own
country are quitting in droves. We attract and train teachers
by focusing on the something of teaching, but those pesky
someones keep getting in the way, and when our teachers
can't deliver on the something, they feel unappreciated and
unfulfilled, and they become the someones we blame.

As industrialized nations grapple with perceived failures in their

xxii | Foreword
education systems, they have historically taken this basic
misunderstanding to an extreme: focusing even more firmly
on the something rather than the someone. In the U.S., the
"Johnny can't read" crisis led us to focus on the abstract
something of "reading," rather than the someone of "Johnny,"
and altogether ignoring the someones of "Isabella," "Ahmed,"
and others. Worldwide, university faculty are hired and
evaluated on their publishing and grant-seeking prowess
rather than their teaching skill. Secondary teachers are hired
with decreasing pedagogical training in favor of more subject-
area coursework. Initiatives and policies are enacted to "raise
standards" rather than to "raise students." And designers are
trained to think first, foremost, and always about their
objectives (the somethings), as their work is packaged and
delivered to unseen and unknown someones at ever-
increasing scale.

I'm obviously painting in broad strokes here, but do you see
any of these patterns in your spheres of experience? Do you
sense education ever being approached in lieu of (or at times
in spite of) the someones being taught? Do you ever sense
the someone of the learner being sacrificed to the something
being taught? And if so, what in the world can we possibly do
about it as learning designers?

This book, Designing Learning Experiences for Inclusivity and
Diversity, provides a useful leap in the right direction by helping
us to first understand the depth and nuances of this problem
and then providing practical guidance for moving forward. The
authors provide a simple and approachable definition of
"inclusivity" in design as "the practice of creating an
environment where everyone feels welcome, respected and
valued" (Chapter 1), and "diversity" is framed as a simple reality
that the someones involved in learning are actually very
different from one another in ways that really matter. Rather
than overlooking, minimizing, or altogether ignoring the social

                                                                                  Foreword | xxiii
nature of education, such an emphasis can help us move away
from the reductionistic and doomed view of education as
merely "teaching something" to a more complete and inspiring
view that seeks to

                    Teach everyone
                    as they really are
                    things that matter
                    in ways that matter.

In my mind, that's the heart of the inclusive learning designer.
It aligns deeply with the tenets and practices of openness and
social justice (Chapters 2 & 3) and represents the only morally
sustainable and also the most effective way to design learning
environments in a diverse social world.

Beyond moral posturing or ideological hand wringing,
championing inclusivity and diversity in design is a very
practical way to become a great designer as it helps us to avoid
three of the most common and limiting pitfalls designers face.
Let's call these pitfalls (a) Me Design, (b) Median Design, and (c)
Meaningless Design.

Me Design. The first mistake of a designer in any field, ranging
from architecture to software design to learning, is to design
for the designer rather than the target audience of the design.
This is rarely intentional but reflects the reality that if we do
not clearly and consistently think about our audience in our
design work, then we will subconsciously fill in any gaps with
ourselves. If I'm a sports guy, then I may use baseball
metaphors to teach about the criminal justice system even if
my audience has no idea what a "run," "ball," or "three strikes" is
in this context, thereby introducing extraneous cognitive load
and confusion. If I'm a native English speaker, then I may use
colloquialisms like "bite the bullet," "break a leg," or "beat
around the bush" that English speakers in other countries have
never heard of, thereby yielding misunderstandings. And if I'm

xxiv | Foreword
food secure, I might create an entire unit about learning
fractions from cutting up pizzas without ever hearing the
grumbling stomachs of my food insecure students, who are
now even more distracted by their hunger. In learning design,
this pitfall historically has occurred as white, male, middle-class,
Western, English-speaking, etc. designers created learning
experiences that they assumed were for everyone simply
because they made them for no one in particular. However, it
turns out that all designs are for someone. Designs made for
"no one in particular" are designs made for the designer, and
the designer can never escape designing for themselves until
they first understand the true diversity of their audience and
inclusively seek to make their designs spaces "where everyone
feels welcome, respected and valued" (Chapter 1).

Median Design. The second mistake that plagues designers
is creating for an "average" or "typical" learner. As a young
designer, a faculty member boasted to me "I don't care about
my students individually; only in aggregate," suggesting that
designers should plot learners along a bell curve and aim to
meet the needs of a dot at the top middle peak, ignoring all
else. This median learner, however, is a faceless apparition that
doesn't exist, and by focusing on it, we ignore our actual
learners (particularly those on the perceived margins). It also
reductionistically classifies learners on performance and treats
this as an inherent trait rather than a byproduct of the design.
The result is design work that artificially views learners
unidimensionally and only seeks to meet their needs on a
single dimension. The alternative that an inclusive approach
to design proposes is to intentionally design for the greatest
diversity of learners as possible and recognize that any bell
curve of performance is a byproduct of design decisions, not
an inherent trait. Richly understanding and designing for a
few dots on the edges of the bell curve, such as by attending
to cultural responsiveness (Chapters 5 & 6) and the needs of

                                                                                   Foreword | xxv
students experiencing disability (Chapter 7), helps the designer
to meet the needs of everyone (including the imagined
median). It also helps the designer to break away from morally
and philosophically problematic roots of the bell curve
mentality, which is based on an attempt to sort people and an
assumption that not everyone will be able to learn equally.

Meaningless Design. And a third common pitfall that learning
designers face emerges from doing work that is so
disconnected from actual learners that it ends up feeling
empty and meaningless. I think most learning designers enter
the field out of a desire to teach and to help people, but as
learning design as a discipline becomes increasingly distanced
from learners and focuses on delivering learning experiences
at increasing scale, designers may find themselves in a crisis of
meaning as they ply their efforts to help people but can never
see the results. They create learning experiences but don't see
students engaging in them nor see the effects on students'
lives. This is especially true when working as third-space
academics (Chapter 4) and would be like a nurse attending to
patients through a veil, a chef delivering all their entrees to a
black box, or a musician who never left the recording studio. At
some point, we would rightly ask ourselves "what's the point?"
and "am I even doing any good in my work?" Focusing on
inclusivity and diversity has the potential to rehumanize these
efforts, because though we might still be working behind a
computer in an office away from our learners, our mental and
emotional energies become invested in understanding our
actual learners as people, building teams to meet their needs
(Chapters 5 & 8), and experiencing learning with them. Rather
than focusing entirely on tools, processes, or frameworks, we
become reinvested in and refocused on people, the someones
of learning. From my own experience, this breathes life into our
careers and improves our designs, making us happier, more
effective, and more fulfilled in our work.

xxvi | Foreword
The problem of practice that this book seeks to address, then,
is a critical (perhaps existential) problem for learning design:
"How do we design for inclusivity and diversity?" Like the
problems faced in education broadly, this problem can only be
effectively approached as a social problem as designers seek
to understand the someone component of their mandate to
"teach someone something." Proposed practices, solutions, or
guides to learning design that ignore or minimize inclusivity
and diversity fundamentally misunderstand the purpose of the
field and are akin to attempting to solve medical problems
by pretending that patients do not exist. Rather, the future of
learning design should be a future that is increasingly human-
centered, by inclusively focusing on people and their true
(diverse) selves. As such, I can't think of a topic that should
merit the attention of learning designers more than that of this
book. Its guidance can practically help novice and experienced
designers alike to avoid some of the most common pitfalls
in the field, and its vision of a world of learning that is more
inclusive for everyone is the only one worth having.

KEITH HEGGART

Why this textbook, and why now?

Academia in Australasia and globally is increasingly a
challenging environment as universities seek to come to terms
with limited funding opportunities, more constrained
regulatory requirements, reduced staffing budgets and new
relationships with external communities. As more students
attend universities, either commencing their studies or
renewing them under the guise of lifelong and life-wide
learning, institutions are required to find ways to adapt
traditional approaches to more modern methods that meet
the demands of diverse student bodies in cost-effective ways.

The role of the learning designer is central to this; they are often
described as either third space professionals or third space
academics, working as they do in the interstitial spaces
between the traditional designations of professional and
academic staff. The role of learning designer (however it is
defined) is vital to the development, implementation and
maintenance of online and blended learning approaches. This
has seen a rapid rise in the need for well-trained and
experienced learning designers, and a concomitant need for
courses that offer learning design qualifications. Numerous
Australian universities now offer these qualifications in both
microcredential and postgraduate format.

As a result, learning designers are often involved in efforts to
ensure that courses incorporate inclusivity and accessibility.
This involves technical knowledge on digital accessibility, so
that learning management systems (LMSs) are accessible and

                                                                                  Introduction | 1
comply with the latest version of the Web Content Accessibility
Guidelines (WCAG), to ensure they are perceivable, operable,
understandable and robust for all students including those
with disabilities, access requirements or who use assistive
technology like screen readers. This is related to the increasing
diversity of the student cohort. Subjects, courses and programs
at universities are beginning to recognise that diversity and
tailor their educational offerings in such a way as to ensure that
all students feel welcome. The notion of belonging, especially
among first-year students, is an important aspect of students'
ongoing success at university - and learning designers have a
role to play in engendering that.

It is for this reason that this textbook has been developed.
While there are similar textbooks available in other
geographical locations (although few are Open Educational
Resources), this book is unashamedly Australasian in its focus.
This is because the Australasian tertiary education system has
unique features. These includes the diversity of students, but
also there is a need to consider the funding arrangements,
the role of governments and the broader sociocultural context
within the Australasian context. A key aspect of addressing
this diversity is designing learning experiences that meet the
needs of all students, regardless of their language, culture,
accessibility needs, family or other commitments.

This textbook will equip learning designers and related
professionals with the knowledge and skills to deal efficiently
and effectively with that diversity. It provides detailed and
comprehensive accounts of the ways that learning designers
can work within their institutions to ensure that students'
learning experiences are accessible and inclusive. It provides
thoughtful and thorough case studies highlighting the need
for learning design practices that privilege accessibility and
inclusivity, in a variety of settings and from several different
institutions.

2 | Introduction
This book is unusual in that it seeks to combine the
perspectives of academics researching inclusivity and learning
design with those of practising learning designers and similar
roles. In some cases, this takes place in separate chapters, but
in others, learning designers and academics have worked
together to combine their expertise into a single chapter. This
means that some chapters have more of a research or
conceptual focus, while others are more practice-focused. We
encourage readers to engage with all of the chapters. By
combining the perspectives of academics with those of
learning designers, this textbook provides learning designers
with both a firm theoretical foundation for their practice and
a helpful guide to implementing those practices in current
university environments.

The greatest strength of this book lies in its diverse authorship,
as it was thoughtfully written and developed by a diverse
group. The authorial team represents a rich tapestry of culture,
language, ethnicity and abilities, bringing unique perspectives
to the chapters and the book as a whole. We also possess
a wide range of expertise in primary, secondary and tertiary
education, Australian Indigenous communities, immigrant
experiences with education, adult learning and, of course,
learning design.

Key terms

This section addresses the key ideas related to social justice,
accessibility and inclusivity in learning design throughout the
book, and authors will refer to these terms in order to explain
the design choices they made and the reasons why they
adopted those. With that in mind, a basic definition is
presented here for each of these terms, although readers
should keep in mind that these definitions are only a starting

                                                                                  Introduction | 3
point for understanding these terms and how they intersect
with learning design.

Social justice is the fair and just treatment of all people,
regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation,
disability or other personal characteristics. It is about ensuring
that everyone has the same opportunities to succeed in life.

Inclusivity is the practice of creating an environment where
everyone feels welcome, respected and valued. It is about
recognising and celebrating the diversity of people and
ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to participate fully
in all aspects of society.

Accessibility is the ability of people with disabilities to access
and use goods, services and facilities. It is about making sure
that everyone can participate in society on an equal basis,
regardless of their disability.

Topics covered in this book

The development and implementation of inclusive and diverse
learning experiences is a vital consideration for educators in
higher education. Increasingly, learning designers play a
significant role in this process. This textbook offers
postgraduate students a comprehensive guide to designing
learning experiences that are accessible, equitable and
inclusive. It provides advice, principles and practical strategies
to help learning designers create a learning environment that
recognises and celebrates diversity while promoting equitable
learning outcomes. Through detailed accounts of theory and
practice, it will canvas the following topics:

 1. Diversity and inclusion in learning: Concepts of diversity
      and inclusion and their impact on the design of learning

4 | Introduction
     experiences are discussed. Theories and concepts related
     to diversity and inclusion, such as cultural competence,
     intersectionality and social justice, are considered. The
     chapter also highlights the importance of recognising
     cultural differences and creating learning experiences that
     celebrate and embrace these.
2. The role of learning designers in promoting diversity and
     inclusion: Attention will be paid to the roles and
     responsibilities of learning designers in creating inclusive
     and equitable learning experiences. Both theorists and
     designers can use their skills and knowledge to create
     accessible and culturally responsive learning
     environments. This topic also covers the ethical and legal
     obligations of learning designers in creating inclusive
     learning experiences.
3. Designing for accessibility: This textbook will also focus
     on the importance of designing for accessibility to ensure
     that all learners can access and engage with the learning
     material. It will provide practical strategies for designing
     learning experiences that are accessible, such as using
     clear and concise language, providing alternative text for
     images and videos, and creating content that is
     compatible with assistive technologies.
4. Designing for equity: Learning designers are also required
     to design experiences that promote equitable learning
     outcomes. This book will consider how to design in this
     way, with a focus on assessments that are fair and
     inclusive, such as using multiple forms of assessment and
     providing opportunities for feedback and revision.
     Attention will also be paid to creating a learning
     environment that is supportive and fosters a sense of
     belonging for all learners.
5. Designing for cultural responsiveness: This topic provides
     practical strategies for learning designers to design
     learning experiences that are culturally responsive. It

                                                                                 Introduction | 5
      explores the importance of acknowledging cultural
      differences and creating learning experiences that are
      relevant to diverse learners. It covers strategies for
      incorporating cultural responsiveness into the learning
      design process, such as incorporating culturally relevant
      examples and incorporating the learners' cultural
      background into the learning experience.
6. Implementation and evaluation: This theme will address
      the implementation and evaluation of inclusive learning
      design. Strategies for implementing inclusive learning
      design, such as providing training to educators and using
      feedback from learners to improve the learning
      experience, will be examined. Strategies for evaluating the
      effectiveness of inclusive learning design, such as using
      formative and summative evaluation methods and
      collecting feedback from learners, will also be explored.

About the chapters

Chapter 1: Introduction (Keith Heggart)

This chapter begins by considering why there is a need for
a book such as this, especially in the Australasian context. It
recognises the increasing diversity and expectations within
and upon universities, including the need to cater for a more
diverse student cohort. The central role played by learning
designers and similar is then presented, and their importance
is discussed. The chapter concludes with an outline of the
structure of the book and a brief biography of each of the
contributors.

Chapter 2: Making socially just pedagogy a reality (Keith
Heggart and Camille Dickson-Deane)

This chapter examines the concept of socially just learning

6 | Introduction
design. It begins by describing both how and why socially just
learning design is important in the current higher education
context, before suggesting a framework that learning
designers can adopt in order to ensure that their work is
socially just. This framework combines elements of Universal
Design for Learning, Nancy Fraser's three dimensions of social
justice and David Wiley's ideas about open education into a
cohesive approach to designing learning experiences that are
socially just. In the final section of this chapter, a number of
examples that make use of the framework are presented.

Chapter 3: Designing inclusive learning experience through
Open Educational Practices (Mais Fatayer)

This chapter serves as a guide for learning designers seeking
to integrate Open Educational Practices (OEP) into their work.
Drawing on both theoretical frameworks and practical insights,
the chapter emphasises the role of OEP in advancing social
justice within higher education. Through extensive experience
in learning design and open education, the author outlines
how OEP can reduce barriers, democratise education, foster
community, and enhance the student learning experience.
Despite the potential benefits, the chapter acknowledges
prevalent challenges hindering the widespread adoption of
OEP in learning design practices, including lack of awareness,
concerns about quality and intellectual property, and
inadequate infrastructure. However, the chapter elaborates on
the argument that learning designers, equipped with their
unique skills and positions, play a pivotal role in driving the
integration of OEP into educational settings.

Chapter 4: Negotiating the assumptions and identity
tensions surrounding third space academics/professionals
(Puva P Arumugam)

This chapter outlines the perceptions of identity and
assumptions surrounding the role of third space academics/

                                                                                  Introduction | 7
professionals. It also considers the tensions and challenges
faced by third space academics/professionals. It concludes by
discussing the adaptations and adjustments made by third
space academics/professionals.

Chapter 5: Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the
teaching team (Katrina Thorpe, Shaun Bell and Susan Page)

This chapter outlines the authors' approach to developing a
highly successful Indigenous-led microcredential, Supervising
Indigenous Higher Degree Research. It highlights the role of
collaboration, which hinges on three key factors: (1) the
importance of trust; (2) the value of conversation and iteration;
and (3) the strength of a multidisciplinary team. Through
reflecting on the creative synergy which propelled the teaching
development, the authors have reimagined the composition
of a teaching team beyond the traditional academic model.
The authors offer recommendations for educators/learning
designers undertaking work in Indigenous-led learning design
collaborations.

Chapter 6: Designing for equity in learning (John Vulic)

This chapter highlights Indigenous disadvantage across the
subjects of Math and Science, a common disadvantage that
occurs in many countries. In response to this, it introduces ways
learning designers can create well-designed learning
environments to provide students opportunities to learn the
skills and abilities that will set them up for success in school,
career and life. The chapter documents a case study of teachers
redesigning their Math curriculum with a focus on promoting
executive function skills to allow students to take control of
their own learning. Finally, the chapter unpacks practical ways
learning designers can design and promote the development
of skill sets, including the ability to pay attention and ignore
distractions, keep track of ideas in one's head and think flexibly
to solve problems.

8 | Introduction
Chapter 7: Designing for cultural responsiveness (Nhung
Nguyen)

This chapter discusses cultural responsiveness in education.
It explores practical strategies to design for cultural
responsiveness (e.g., incorporating culturally relevant examples
and incorporating the learners' cultural background into the
learning experience) and provides specific examples of
incorporating cultural responsiveness into the learning design
process such as designing learning materials using artefacts
that reflect cultural diversity and/or inviting Mori and Pacific/
Indigenous experts to get involved in different stages of the
learning design process. The experts can work collaboratively
with the team to brainstorm a course plan (an outline of the
content, assessment and learning activities), writing some
sections of a course, design some learning activities and
assessment tasks and/or review content and assessments.

Chapter 8: Working with students with lived experience of
disability to enhance inclusive and accessible learning (Katie
Duncan and Rhiannon Hall)

This chapter documents the importance of working with
students to understand their requirements. The chapter uses
the Students Explain Digital Accessibility video project as an
example of how to use co-design to engage with students. The
chapter also looks at other inclusive design approaches that
aim to improve the experience for all students and ensure that
no one is disadvantaged.

Chapter 9: Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning
design (Bruna Contro Pretero)

This chapter examines how learning designers and associated
professionals can work more productively with other members
of the course teams. It uses the analogy of baking a cake to
show the importance of planning, preparing different

                                                                                  Introduction | 9
materials, consulting all stakeholders and then serving the
finished cake - and highlights examples of how each of these
contributes to the successful implementation of a course.
Chapter 10: Conclusion (Mais Fatayer)
The final chapter draws together the various case studies into
advice for developing learning designers to adopt in their
practice.

Introduction

Being socially just has different connotations and meanings for
every individual and institution. Higher education institutions,
which often have as part of their mission the promotion of
social good, are required to consider their own systems and
practices and how they intersect with social justice, while at
the same time they struggle with residual challenges from the
pandemic. These challenges include ongoing questions about
how universities are funded, precarious employment within
those universities, and a student demographic that is
increasingly demanding - and increasing diverse. Amidst these
challenges, universities are also required (by government and
industry) to demonstrate their connection to the workforce,
and by other parts of society to commit to widening pathways

                                          Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 11
to participation, especially from groups that have previously
been marginalised and prevented from attending higher
education.

Perhaps heightened by the growing awareness of educational
injustices in the past (especially in the form of exclusion,
marginalisation and systemic oppression), there have been
calls for educational practice to adapt so that it is more
inclusive (Bradley et al., 2008; Collins et al., 2019). This path has
by no means been straightforward: arguments in the United
States and even in Australia about the place of Critical Race
Theory and its relevance to higher education are one example
of the challenges faced by those who advocate for greater
inclusivity (Bargallie & Lentin, 2022; Morgan, 2022).
Nevertheless, many universities have made significant strides
and implemented programs that are intended to make
universities, and learning within them, more accessible and
inclusive. In some cases, this focuses on entry into university
(Devlin et al., 2023). Another element is to ensure that students
feel like they belong at university and are therefore less likely
to drop out (Mahoney et al., 2022). These initiatives are often
branded as a commitment to social justice, but that term
suffers from a frustrating vagueness.

This chapter works towards resolving that vagueness by
bringing some clarity to the discussion around social justice
within higher education. Specifically, it is an attempt to explore
what that term might look like within educational practice, and
specifically within the design of learning ecosystems at the
tertiary level. In doing so, it is important to distinguish between
teaching about social justice and socially just pedagogy. Both
are important within educational settings, but there is a
difference: teaching about social justice refers to content and
learning activities related to equality, equity and similar topics.
Socially just pedagogy, however, refers to the practice of
education; that is, the principles that inform pedagogy, which

12 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
ensure that the context, including tools, techniques, mindsets
and behaviour, include elements such as fairness, equity,
equality and inclusivity as major contributors to a holistic
ecosystem that embodies diverse beings - students of the
world.

This chapter examines just one aspect of that educational
ecosystem: the design of learning. Learning and instructional
design is still considered a developing field, even though it has
been in existence for more than a century (Reiser, 2001). As
recognition of the field continues to grow, learning designers
are increasingly required to ensure that their designs meet
both legal and institutional requirements. This is often
captured under the broad umbrella of the term accessibility,
whereby learning designers need to be mindful about features
like font types and size, contrast, the availability of transcripts
and interactive elements. However, this is a necessary but not
sufficient part of socially just pedagogy. In addition to a focus
on accessibility, there is a need to examine inclusivity - how
it is actioned and what it means to those who experience it.
This is in keeping with recent work that considers inclusivity
as a rightful presence within courses (Calabrese Barton & Tan,
2020). This chapter seeks to identify ways in which learning
designers can do just that. In doing so, it builds upon previous
work by the authors in this field (Heggart et al., 2020).

Socially just pedagogy

Learning design, and imply by association that learning
designers are becoming an integral part of the Australian
higher education landscape (Heggart & Dickson-Deane, 2022).
This is apparent in the increasing numbers of courses that seek
to train individuals to become learning designers, as well as the
numbers of advertisements for learning designers (Heggart

& Dickson-Deane, 2022). Learning designers and those in
similarly situated spaces are expected to liaise with academics
to ensure that course materials are accessible to all students.
This is becoming more important as many university courses
make use of educational technologies to offer learning
opportunities in different modalities. To be able to use and
learn in such environments (Dickson-Deane & Chen, 2018),
makes accessibility a key factor but it is not the only factor
that should be considered. While it is vital that, for example,
students with vision impairment can engage with course
material, it is also vital that these students be seamlessly
included in the learning ecosystem whilst at the same time
accommodating students from differing characteristics. This
is often overlooked despite calls for the decolonisation of
curriculum (Tuitt et al., 2023). As the cohort of higher education
students becomes increasingly diverse, there is a need to
ensure that the curriculum, its content and, indeed, the entire
learning ecosystem, reflects the target audience.

Achieving this can be difficult as the field commercialises core
learning design processes (Traxler, 2018) At first glance,
balancing time to delivery, costs and implementation with the
ongoing worldly challenges is difficult for all institutions. Thus,
we ask: how can learning designers cater for all the different
characteristics and needs within a student cohort? This may
lead to a focus on one group over another (for example a focus
on accessibility via captions but ignoring inclusivity of students
from diverse backgrounds) to meet institutional requirements,
and it also ignores the compounding challenges presented by
the intersectional nature of disadvantage (Heggart et al., 2020).

Nancy Fraser (2007) has suggested that there are ways in
which this might be done. In her view, the answer lies in
providing more opportunities for students to take an active
part in the development of the course, rather than the learning
designer and/or academic seeking to cover every eventuality.

14 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
To do this, Fraser (2007) proposed three principles that could
inform the design of learning experiences. The first is
redistribution. This principle is about economics and in
educational terms it seeks to ensure that more people have
access to education (and in this case, higher education)
through varying allocations - designs. Simply by increasing the
opportunities for access for diverse groups of society, including
those that have previously been marginalised, higher
education will become more socially just. This is something
that many universities are already taking seriously, via various
programs and policies. Such programs are often implemented
at a level beyond the remit of the individual learning designer
and hence this principle will not be discussed at length in this
chapter.

The second principle, however, is very much within the domain
of learning designers. This is the principle of recognition. This
principle encourages designers to reconsider the content of
higher education, with a view to making it more diverse and
representative. Pedagogical approaches that have adopted
this idea include culturally relevant (Ladson-Billings, 2021) and
culturally sustaining (Alim & Paris, 2017) pedagogies. There
have been significant strides made in this area over recent
years, with efforts to decolonise the curriculum (for an example,
see Zembylas, 2018) and to include scholars who are women or
gender diverse, from the Global South, or from non-dominant
cultures.

The final principle espoused by Fraser is representation. This
principle is perhaps the hardest to realise, even if it is the most
important. Representation is best described as politically
developing authentic partnerships between students and
teachers in the decision-making process (Casey et al., 2022).
Representation can invite learning designers to consider
students less as objects, and more as active participants in
the learning ecosystem, who might take a more active role

                                         Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 15
in determining the what and the how of that experience - a
shared design and ultimately a learning ecosystem. In doing
so, it requires academics and learning designers to relinquish,
in part, their control over the learning ecosystem, and instead
embrace the complex and `messy' nature of student-centred
learning.

Clare Hocking (2010, p. 2) argues that a truly socially just
education is one that `embraces a wide range of differences
and explores their effects on individual learning' - basically a
positive acknowledgement of individual differences (Cronbach
& Snow, 1969; Heggart et al., 2020; Jonassen & Grabowski, 1993).
Hocking proposes that the relationships between participants
be fair and just, measured by choice, distribution,
opportunities, privileges, and indeed, any form of activity
(Boyles et al., 2009) .

Adopting these principals signals a more in-depth approach to
pedagogical activities. In the past, many attempts at inclusivity
or accessibility have necessitated a focus on a particular group
or learning requirement. In some cases, especially around
accessibility, this will continue to be important. However, a truly
socially just pedagogy requires a shift in attention away from
the group or individual, to the learning ecosystem as a whole.
In other words, through a careful understanding of what
comprises learning ecosystems, it should be possible to
incorporate the principles of redistribution, recognition and
representation for all. The term learning ecosystem (Huijser et
al., 2022) is used deliberately here to mark a difference between
it and the more commonly used term `teaching and learning'.
This is important because a student's experience incorporates
much more than just the `in-class' time, and learning designers
should be mindful of that.

16 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
The question of educational technology

While these principles are important, even more important
is the practice of how these might be implemented within
learning ecosystems. This is where the challenge lies: after all,
what does redistribution or recognition actually look like, in
Chemistry, or Accounting, or Law? And how might these
principles be implemented effectively, considering the
challenges involved in changing academic practice, and the
limited time and budgets available to many universities?

Educational technology may answer some of these questions,
especially when it is considered in conjunction with the ideas of
universal design, and especially Universal Design for Learning
(UDL). The usual caveats apply when it comes to educational
technology: the field is littered with disappointing applications
and unfulfilled promises, and this must be kept in mind in the
context of developing a socially just pedagogical framework
(Watters, 2023). Attention must be paid to specific learning
goals, rather than the tools themselves (de Alvarez & Dickson-
Deane, 2018; Dickson-Deane & Asino, 2018; Watters, 2023) -
using needs to frame behaviour (Dickson-Deane & Edwards,
2021).

As described above, shifting the focus away from the student
towards the learning ecosystem is something that is central to
UDL (Meyer et al., 2014). Indeed, the broader universal design
movement calls for a change from an individual deficit model
(i.e., there is something wrong or missing with a person)
towards a recognition that the deficit or problem is a societal
one - which is where the problem should be addressed. It is
this line of thought that has led to accessible buildings, for
example. However, what does that look like in the learning
context? In short, it means that, once a student has enrolled
in a course or program, the learning ecosystem should be

                                         Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 17
relevant to them (Dickson-Deane, 2023). For example, a student
from a low socio-economic background should not face
barriers due to their status, such as required access to paid
content. Instead, the course should be adaptable so that these
`deficits' are not an imposition. Some examples might help to
illustrate this point. One of the key principles of UDL is that the
alterations to learning design are essential for some students,
but they are of benefit for many, if not all (Fornauf & Erickson,
2020). Students with hearing impairments might require
captions or transcripts on video content. Yet captions are also
useful for students with no hearing difficulties or students for
whom the language used to teach is not their first language.
Furthermore, this is an accommodation where those who
prefer to watch course materials while traveling, and do not
want to disturb those around them, can prosper. This principle
of multiple means of representation thus has value far beyond
the students who might expressly need it.

A second principle of UDL focuses on providing multiple
means of engagement for all learners. This is potentially a
powerful tool, and aligns well with Fraser's ideas of
representation, in that engagement between learners and
educators suggests the start of a partnership. Yet, such
opportunities for engagement are often limited. This is
understandable as many academics and learning designers
are dealing with tight timelines and institutional inertia, and
as such the learning environments may not be conducive to
experimentation. In this case, interaction might be limited to
some form of asynchronous activity. There is nothing wrong
with asynchronous forms of interaction in and of themselves,
and they definitely have a place in a course or program.
However, they fail to recognise that many students, especially
those entering higher education, have grown up in a world
where the formalised environment is being merged with the
societal environment (informal learning spaces) whereby

18 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
online and interaction means something very different to them
(Bennett, 2008). Students are expecting to be able to have
some ownership over the course material, and to be able to
adjust the content (Dickson-Deane et al., 2023). In order to
leverage this predilection, learning designers can make use of
David Wiley's (2014) 5 Rs of open educational infrastructure
(Table 1). These 5 Rs provide clear guidance for how learners
might interact with the course material in new and interesting
ways. Clearly, the ideas of remixing and redistributing, to name
a few examples, go far beyond online discussion boards and
opinion polls.

                 share copies of your original, revised or

Table 1: David Wiley's 5Rs (Wiley, 2014)
Text-based version of Table 1

                 Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 19
       This table lists the 5Rs that define the principles of
       open content according to David Wiley. Each R is
       paired with a brief description of the rights it
       encompasses, emphasising the freedoms provided
       to users regarding open educational resources.

The 5Rs are not without significant challenges to the current
higher education ecosystem. Principally, there are questions
about ownership and intellectual copyright that need to be
carefully negotiated, as well as issues of trust, control and
management. It might prove to be confronting for academics
to be expected to give permission for their course content to be
remixed and distributed by students, for example. Such cases
will need to be carefully considered. Nevertheless, we would
propose that this shift in the locus of control is part of a wider
movement in higher education, where courses are becoming
less the domain of an individual course or subject coordinator
and instead the product of a group of individuals, which
includes academics, learning designers, analysts, media
producers and so on. There are two further possible extensions
of this idea of openness. Firstly, the development of a course
could be made dynamic - that is, ongoing for the duration of
the course - as it responds to changing ideas and discussions
within the cohort. Secondly, the learners could be included as
partners within the design and development of the course.

20 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
Putting it all together: Developing
iterations

Taken together, the three concepts (Fraser's 3Rs, Wiley's 5Rs
and UDL) described above provide learning designers with a
framework to use in their work to ensure that they are
designing socially just learning ecosystems. There is significant
overlap between some of the ideas. For example, allowing
students to demonstrate their learning via multiple means of
expression has something in common with the notion of
remixing course material by students. Equally, there is a
connection between recognising diverse learners (from
Fraser's three dimensions of social justice) and multiple means
of representation. And, of course, by allowing students to reuse
and redistribute course materials, students are becoming
partners in the learning process and thus are more likely to
be represented (although this is not an automatic process and
needs to be carefully designed for and resourced if it is to
occur). These connections are depicted in Figure 1.

Figure 1: One-dimensional framework for socially just learning
design activities

                                         Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 21
Figure 1 shows the original conception of a framework for
socially just learning design (Heggart et al., 2020). It captures
the connections between the different elements discussed
above. However, it fails to fully articulate the nature of the
relationships between the different elements, and specifically
the ways in which they influence one another. The more
carefully theorised depiction (Figure 2) has been developed by
the authors to address this and explains the more complex
relationship between the different elements of the framework.

Figure 2: Layered framework for socially just learning design
activities

In the new framework, Fraser's three dimensions are placed at
the bottom. This is because they occupy a foundational part
of the described approach to designing learning ecosystems.
The three principles of recognition, redistribution and
representation are important, but they are aspirational and
wide-ranging. They are aspirational because they describe
what a socially just learning environment should look like: it
should be accessible to all, and all should feel like they belong
within the environment and they should be able to `see' that
belonging through representation. However, what Fraser's

22 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
dimensions do not do is provide advice or guidance (except
in the most general terms) on how learning designers might
create such an environment that does this: this is where the
next two levels come into play.

Wiley's 5Rs of Open Education provide actionable structures
to re-envision what a contemporary learning ecosystem might
look like. Recognising the fundamental shift in both resource
availability and possible interaction that technological change
has provided, Wiley describes ways in which the traditional
learning ecosystem can be altered in order to make the most
of it. The 5Rs of Open Education point out how the three
dimensions of social justice might be realised in the classroom.

The final level of this revised framework belongs to Universal
Design for Learning (UDL). A broad conception of UDL offers
the best description of how to employ the 5Rs in a classroom
setting - and, crucially, to what end they should be employed.
This is worth some further explanation: the 5Rs themselves do
not necessarily constitute an approach to socially just learning
design. While not necessarily Wiley's intention, it would be
theoretically possible, for example, to redistribute or remix
materials in a way that makes them less accessible than
previously. More likely, however, the 5Rs can be used in such
a way that they have little impact on the learning process.
Clearly, this is not desirable for educators. By placing UDL at the
highest layer, learning designers are prioritising the student
experience over the technological affordances. In the next
section, some examples of what this might look like in practice
are explored, as well as how they align to the framework
described above.

                                         Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 23
What it looks like in practice

   Example 1: Creating a culture that values
   inclusivity

     The use of the word culture can be unclear to many as
     it is typically used to reference the characteristics of an
     individual or group. The formalised processes used in
     designing for learning are not separate from who
     participates in the activity, and through self-reflection
     of those contributing to the outcome, there is
     positivity/success. Designers, instructors, administrators
     and (eventually) students need to cohesively contribute
     to the process of design and implementation knowing
     that without their individual interactions,
     understandings, discussions and perceived-
     positionalities, the process will have less successful
     outcomes. By always iteratively thinking of the next
     step of who will be contributing with what knowledge,
     and that the current knowledge is not all that can be
     shared in the space at that specific time, it basically
     shows that the design process is not only dynamic but
     a living process and is the key to developing an
     inclusive culture. This kind of activity is not easily
     portrayed. It requires boundaries to be relaxed, powers
     to be relinquished and reflections to act as a partial
     guide to how the learning design occurs. It allows for

24 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
less formalisation of what is assumed to be known,
leading to an iterative process whereby the cognitive
power used to guide intentional designs leaves doors
open for contextual interpretation and subjective
value-making.
An example of what this may look like is not making
conclusive design decisions but instead leaving
enough wriggle room for students to explore the what-
ifs in their learning process.
For example:

     asking students to contribute steps 3 and 4 of a
        guided activity which they believe will contribute
        to the learning goal

     allowing students to introduce ideas which they
        think are relevant to their understanding of the
        topic and then be assessed on that same topic

     going off script with one of the topics - loosely
        designing spaces to fill the gaps in student
        knowledge.

Each of these examples introduces unstructured
designs that may leave everyone uneasy. Yet, this also
creates a space for students to breathe and restate
what they do understand with a new path as to where
they would like to go with their knowledge. This can be
seen as retracting the lifelong learning back into the
formalised learning environment.

                                   Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 25
   Example 2: Creating relevance by adding
   context to an existing OER

     In order to increase representation, learning designers
     and other educators can encourage students to
     contribute to the development of course materials. One
     effective way of doing this could be in the form of an
     Open Educational Resource (OER). In this example,
     rather than the course materials or textbooks being
     sacrosanct and provided by the lecturer or subject
     coordinator (or worse, having to be purchased by the
     students), they could instead become open and `living'
     documents that are being updated and developed by
     both the students and the academic staff.
     For example, students in an Initial Teacher Education
     course (a program of study for students learning to be
     teachers) might find and share exemplars and
     resources on a particular topic, which are then curated
     into a resource that all students can use. The
     academic's role in this case is to be a curator of the
     examples provided by the student, rather than a
     content producer. The learning designer, then, must
     provide the structure or mechanism that is required in
     order to make the sharing of resources as seamless as
     possible.
     In more advanced iterations, students and the
     academic could use this platform as a mechanism to

26 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
comment on the shared resources and to engage in a
critical discussion of their usefulness and validity in
various settings. Simple tools can be used by teachers
and students to undertake this task. This approach is a
powerful one; it reframes students less as consumers of
pre-generated material and instead casts them as
equal partners in the learning process. This meets the
criterion of representation, as educators and students
are now working as partners. It also allows students to
retain, revise and remix the finished textbook or
resource - and the fact that it is likely to be of
immediate use in their practice will probably lead to
higher levels of engagement.

Example 3: Adjusting rubrics to
accommodate for different media

Rubrics are becoming an increasingly common aspect
of assessment in many higher education institutions.
While the development of rubrics is an area of
expertise in and of itself, the use of rubrics can
sometimes be restrictive. This is often the case in
higher education, where there is (still) a preponderance
of written assignments, reports and essays in
assessment. Of course, this is appropriate in some

                                   Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 27
     settings, but it should be recognised that firstly, these
     assignments are not constructively aligned (Biggs,
     1996) with the outcomes of the learning ecosystem,
     and secondly, such approaches privilege students who
     have more experience with those forms of assessment.
     Fortunately, the solution is relatively simple and
     involves redesigning the assessment in such a way as
     to allow students to submit their assessment task in
     multiple different forms.

     For example, students in a nursing course might
     previously have been expected to write an essay about
     culturally safe approaches to nursing. This is clearly an
     important topic, and one that nurses should be
     expected to know about. However, there is no
     requirement for such an assessment task to have to be
     submitted in written form. Why shouldn't students
     have the opportunity to record a video, or create an
     infographic, or even make a presentation? This allows
     students to choose a form that they think best suits
     their work. Incidentally, it might also address some
     concerns regarding academic integrity. Of course, such
     an approach might lead to some concerns about the
     rigour or validity of the assessment; an essay is not
     necessarily any more rigorous than a video
     presentation. For example, in some nursing courses,
     students recording assessment tasks is becoming
     more common as it is seen as more relevant than a
     written essay due to the advent of telemedicine. More
     recent advances in generative artificial intelligence
     have also troubled this area. The key to rigour doesn't

28 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
necessarily lie in the format but rather in the task itself,
and the rubric that guides the students.
This example demonstrates aspects of all parts of the
socially just learning design framework. Firstly, it
adopts the UDL principle of multiple means of
expression by allowing students to determine how best
to meet the assessment task requirements instead of
mandating them to demonstrate their learning in a
particular fashion. This, in and of itself, is also an
example of recognition: it recognises that students
have different backgrounds and expertise and they
should be able to make use of these to present their
learning in the best possible setting. Broadly speaking,
this is also an example of remixing: students are
remixing the traditional assessment task into
something that is more familiar to them.

Example 4: Providing more contextual
choice in assessments

The final example also pertains to assessment. It is not
particularly surprising that there is such a focus on
assessment in terms of socially just learning design. As
others have noted (Biggs, 1996), it is often the case that
assessment drives the learning, regardless of whether

                                   Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 29
     that should be the case or not. In this example,
     assessments can be restructured or even entirely
     redesigned in order to provide more opportunity for
     students to contextualise their learning to the
     assessment task. This works especially well when
     students are asked to respond to a brief, or to take part
     in a scenario-type assessment. Normally, students are
     presented with a brief upon which to base their
     assessment task. However, such an approach can be
     exclusive, rather than inclusive, because the content of
     the brief will include elements of assumed or `hidden'
     knowledge that not all students will be privy to, and
     thus students might be marginalised.

     A better approach allows students to develop their own
     brief, tailored to their unique contexts and experiences.
     For example, in a Learning Design Program, students
     are often asked to develop a high-level learning design
     plan in response to a brief. In the past, the course
     coordinator has provided them with a generic brief
     based on a small enterprise seeking to train its
     facilitators in online learning practices. All students had
     to make use of the same brief. As explained above, this
     kind of context might be very familiar to some students
     in the course, especially those who have undertaken
     work in the corporate world. Yet, it might also be very
     unfamiliar to those who have come into the course
     from an educational background.

     In order to improve this task, the students could be
     required to develop their own brief, based on their own
     experience. A generic brief could still be provided for
     those students who want it, but it would be far more

30 | Making socially just pedagogy a reality
     effective in terms of engagement and motivation for
     students to consider a learning design problem to
     resolve that is directly related to their own context and
     experience. This approach necessitates extra work from
     learning designers; who must create a framework for
     students to draft their own briefs and provide several
     exemplars, but the increased engagement and likely
     higher quality outcomes would be a payoff for the
     additional work.
     Again, this approach draws on the framework. Fraser's
     (2007) notions of recognition and representation are
     both present: by changing the curriculum to one that is
     more inclusive, recognition is addressed; and allowing
     students to choose their own brief is an example of the
     development of an authentic partnership between
     educators and students. Students will have the
     opportunity to remix the exemplar brief to suit their
     own circumstances, and they will also have the chance
     to engage in the topic in multiple ways, by virtue of the
     choice element of the assessment task.

Conclusion

Designing for inclusivity is challenging but vitally important for
learning designers. A learning designer's first instinct might
be to design learning materials that cater to everyone, but
this is quickly revealed to be impossible. Some features of
accessibility are not negotiable and need to be included in all
course materials. However, in order to truly develop a feeling
of inclusivity and belonging in a course, rather than focusing
on individuals or specific groups, learning designers would be

                                         Making socially just pedagogy a reality | 31
better placed to consider how they can incorporate students as
active and authentic partners in the learning ecosystem. One
way of doing this is by adopting the framework described in
this chapter, which combines Fraser's (2007) three dimensions
of social justice with the principles of UDL and also with David
Wiley's (2014) 5Rs of Open Educational Practices.

3. Designing inclusive
learning experience
through Open
Educational Practices

MAIS FATAYER

Introduction

I wrote this chapter to equip learning designers with both
theoretical insights and practical guidance on integrating
Open Educational Practices (OEP) into learning design
practice. Along the chapter, I provide advice that helps learning
designers understand how OEP contribute to the
advancement of social justice in higher education, drawing on
my experience in learning design and open education.

For higher educational institutions, OEP hold the potential to
reduce educational barriers for students, thereby expanding
learning opportunities and democratising education,
promoting a connected academic community and enhancing
student learning experience. In the field of educational
technology, OEP benefit from leveraging current technologies
to develop content that is both accessible and inclusive. In
the learning design sphere, OEP offer innovative methods and
techniques to enhance interaction and active participation in
the learning process, fostering a more dynamic and
collaborative approach to knowledge acquisition as an integral
part of pedagogy (Paskevicius & Irvine, 2019). However, drawing
from over a decade of experience in both formal and informal

                                                                                     Practices | 39
leadership roles as a learning designer, I have frequently
observed the hesitant and fragile incorporation of OEP into
daily learning design practices is. These instances occur due
to many barriers such as lack of awareness of the role of open
education in advancing learning, concerns about the quality of
Open Educational Resources (OER), time constraints for either
creating or reviewing OER, lack of clarity about intellectual
property issues, lack of recognition of OEP and lack of
adequate infrastructure for hosting OER. Existing literature is
also in alignment with of all these barriers (Atenas et al., 2022;
Morgan, 2019), which highlights evidence of similar barriers
from institutions around the world.

Even with the previous challenges, learning design is a
significant area to advance open education in higher
education. In this chapter, I reinforce the prevailing call for the
involvement of learning designers in open education, as
advocated by Roberts at al. (2022). Additionally, I extend this
appeal by calling for intentional steps toward adopting OEP
in learning design practice. The aim here is to help learning
designers to seamlessly integrate OEP into their learning
design practice in order to enhance student learning
experiences. Further, the advice provided in this chapter offers
a pathway to make OEP more visible through practical
approaches so learning designers will be able to take concrete
steps towards socially just education.

But why is open education important to learning designers?
Why does it matter, and why should learning designers care? In
response to these underlying questions, I pose three key broad
responses that I'll elaborate on throughout the chapter:

 1. Learning designers possess the skills to develop OER:
      These skills are integral in learning design practice and are
      deployed consistently in building educational materials.

2. The open education movement in higher education is

40 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
      advancing slowly: Learning designers are urged to utilise
      their relationships and leadership skills to raise awareness
      and encourage greater engagement among faculties and
      senior management.
 3. Learning design is rooted in human-centred
      approaches: As learning designers, our core commitment
      is to design for the betterment of people to enable socially
      just education. This ethical responsibility aligns strongly
      with the values of open education.

As a final note, over the past two decades the open education
movement has made substantial advances in various parts of
the world, notably in the United States and Canada. While
Australia has been perceived as a late adopter, it has
increasingly begun to make significant contributions to the
field, signaling a promising emergence in open education
initiatives. Throughout the chapter, I will be borrowing
examples from existing projects and initiatives in Australia and
globally to illustrate the growing impact of OEP on higher
education in different places.

Understanding Open Educational
Practices (OEP)

This section offers a concise chronological exploration of key
concepts in open education. It begins with a historical overview
of open education and open pedagogy, encompassing
contemporary perspectives, and concludes with an exploration
of Open Educational Practices (OEP). The section concludes
with highlighting the role of open education as a catalyst for
social justice.

Before delving into OEP, it is vital to highlight the more general
concept of open education. As a pedagogical approach, open

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                      Practices | 41
education advocates for increased participation, democracy,
and social inclusion within the educational sphere. Lambert
(2018, p. 239) introduced a conceptualisation of open education
wherein social justice stands as its overarching objective:

          "Open Education is the development of free digitally
          enabled learning materials and experiences primarily
          by and for the benefit and empowerment of non-
          privileged learners who may be under-represented in
          education systems or marginalised in their global
          context. Success of social justice aligned programs can
          be measured not by any particular technical feature or
          format, but instead by the extent to which they enact
          redistributive justice, recognitive justice and/or
          representational justice."

For learning designers who are usually immersed in the design
process (i.e., co-creation, constructive alignment between
content and outcomes, developing inclusive and accessible
material, etc), this definition holds significance for two key
reasons. Firstly, it transitions the perspective of open education
from being perceived merely as a collection of pedagogies
applicable to all learners, to encompassing both processes and
artefacts tailored for and co-created with marginalised
learners. Secondly, it establishes a quality assurance
mechanism, ensuring that both the process and artefacts are
responsive to the existing needs of the learners involved.

The evolution of open education has unfolded gradually,
shaped by various influences and developments over time. The
historical timeline of open education spans decades, from the
introduction of the Open University in the 1960s (Open
University, 2010), as an advocate for openness and socially just
education, to the early mention of open education in the 1970s
by Elliot (1973) and Mai (1978), describing tensions between
`closed' and `open' pedagogies. In 1998 David Wiley coined the

42 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
term `open content' working on the premise that educational
content should be developed and shared freely and openly
similar to the free software philosophy (DiBiase, 2011). Moving
into the 21st century, the emergence of Web 2.0 technologies
contributed significantly to the rise of OER. In 2001, the
OpenCourseWare of Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) marked a milestone, when MIT academics made course
materials freely available online. This was followed by the
introduction of Creative Commons licenses in 2001, enabling
legal sharing and remixing of content.

Following the efforts of MIT and Creative Commons, in 2002
the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, the Western
Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications, and global
education leaders met at UNESCO headquarters for the OER
Forum. The group explored the impact of open courseware in
higher education and concluded with a declaration

          `At the conclusion of the Forum on the Impact of Open
          Courseware for Higher Education in Developing
          Countries, organized by UNESCO, the participants
          express their satisfaction and their wish to develop
          together a universal educational resource available for
          the whole of humanity, to be referred to henceforth as
          Open Educational Resources.' (UNESCO, 2002, p. 28)

This forum represents a significant milestone in the open
education movement's journey. Additionally, international
organisations, including UNESCO, OECD, and ICDE, played a
significant role in initiatives such as `open educational quality
initiatives' (OPAL) to promote OER adoption globally (Falconer
et al., 2013). Since that time, there was a projection of a
substantial increase in demand for open learning innovations,
encompassing OER, open textbooks, and Massive Open Online
Courses (MOOCs) (Jacobi et al., 2013).

In February 2011, with UNESCO funding, an open meeting

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 43
aimed to establish the OERu, a project building a parallel
learning universe for more affordable education. Now a global
initiative, OERu includes institutions from five continents,
collaborating to broaden access and is a formal project of the
UNESCO-Commonwealth of Learning (COL) OER Chair
network (Open Educational Resources University, n.d.).

At this stage, the term OEP began to take clearer shape as
introduced by OPAL (Open Educational Quality Initiative, 2011)
as `a set of activities around instructional design and
implementation of events and processes intended to support
learning. They also include the creation, use and repurposing of
Open Educational Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the
contextual setting. They are documented in a portable format
and made openly available' (p. 13). As the concept of OEP
gained momentum, Cronin (2017) introduced OEP by
encompassing OER, pedagogies, and the sharing of teaching
practices. Cronin's work is noteworthy as it highlights that
academics integrating OEP into their teaching do so in four
dimensions:

   Balancing privacy and openness: This dimension involves
      managing digital identity boundaries and carefully
      considering teacher-student interactions in online spaces.

   Developing digital literacies: This involves academics
      developing proficiency in social media use and
      encouraging students to cultivate digital identities,
      fostering overall digital literacy.

   Recognising the importance of social learning: This
      requires understanding of theories of social learning such
      as social constructivism and sociocultural theory that
      emphasise the importance of learners being actively
      involved in the learning process.

   Challenging conventional expectations associated with
      the traditional teaching role: This involves academics
      embracing broader identities, viewing themselves as

44 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
      learners, dismantling lecturer-student barriers, and
      demonstrating care for students such as creating different
      communication channels (e.g., communicating with
      students via X previously known as Twitter) (Cronin, 2017).

Meanwhile, scholars like Weller (2014) and Wiley (2013)
emphasised the term `open pedagogy' that became closely
associated with OEP. Both Weller and Wiley contributed
significantly to expanding on integrating OEP into learning
activities and teaching practices. For instance, Wiley's
significant contribution lies in defining the practical set of five
activities in using OER or what is now known as the 5R
activities--retain, revise, remix, reuse and redistribute (Wiley,
n.d.). These activities provide a foundation for designing
learning approaches for integrating OEP in learning and
teaching. Wiley and Hilton (2018) further defined open
pedagogy as a shift towards student-centred, flexible learning
experiences, emphasising trust in students and adaptability
based on learner needs.

   UTS Learning Design Meetup community:
   Adopting OEP with David Wiley

     Back in March 2021, I invited David Wiley to share his
     thoughts with the "UTS Learning Design Meetup
     community" about adopting OEP. Demonstrating
     through a couple of examples, David showed how the
     5R's enable students to engage in content through

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational

     collaboratively creating an enhanced version of an
     existing open textbook and students reusing videos to
     create a debate of `wikis vs blogs' by imitating the
     voices of Kennedy and Nixon. The following video is a
     15-minute snippet from the meetup where David
     elaborates on those ideas.

Open Education in Australian higher
education

The initial phases of open education in Australia were
predominantly government-led initiatives that were
committed to demonstrating transparency, information
sharing, and access to publicly funded research projects. This
is demonstrated by government-focused initiatives such as
Australian Government Policy on Open-Source Software,
Government 2.0 and Australian Government Open Access and
Licensing Framework (AusGOAL), which paved the way for the
Australian higher education sector to follow (Bossu, 2016, pp.
15-16).

46 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
Australian higher education institutions are positioned towards
the late majority of what is known as Rogers' innovation-
adoption curve (Rogers, 2003, pp. 35-36), particularly in joining
the open education movement. However, over the last two
decades, there have been considerable efforts across
Australian universities towards OEP, where innovative projects
and initiatives take place. The following are some of the
examples of OEP in the Australian higher education sector:

 1. The Open textbooks at La Trobe project demonstrates the
      value of modern curriculum in providing flexibility in
      developing educational resources and enhancing
      affordability for students. Dr David Walker from La Trobe's
      School of Business highlighted that `this [adopting open
      textbook] has also enabled me to structure the content
      and frame the questions and topics more precisely to the
      things we want to cover'. Associate Professor Tanya Serry,
      School of Education, also emphasised the contribution to
      students' wellbeing as she mentions that `the open
      textbook for this core 1st year subject has generated up to
      $45,650 of student cost savings by replacing a traditional
      commercial text'.

2. University of South Australia (UniSA) Textbook
      Minimisation Project: Between 2020 and 2022, the Library
      and the Teaching Innovation Unit at UniSA implemented a
      pilot project with the aim of minimising course material
      costs for students. The university is actively working to
      reduce the number of textbooks students need to
      purchase during their program of study by transitioning
      certain courses from traditional textbooks to high-quality
      research-driven resources. This significant initiative has
      already saved UniSA students a total of $9 million in
      textbook costs. Two crucial outcomes have emerged from
      this effort: firstly, the integration of this initiative into
      Action Item 2.7 of the University's Academic Enterprise

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 47
      Plan 2021-2025 as a strategic priority, and secondly, under
      the direction of the Academic Strategy, Standards, and
      Quality Committee (ASSQC), the Library is now
      incorporating the minimisation of student textbook costs
      as a `business as usual' activity.
 3. University of Southern Queensland OEP Grants: Learning
      and Teaching Staff Scholarships provide grants to aid a
      USQ staff member or a team in enhancing their leadership
      in and approaches to advancing students' educational
      experiences and graduate outcomes. Several academics
      shared their experience about this initiative, stating that
      these scholarships empower them to enhance their
      pedagogical skills, leading to publications, presentations,
      and increased impact while concurrently engaging in
      projects including developing renewable assessments and
      open textbooks.
4. The Council of Australian University Librarians (CAUL) and
      the OER Collective: an organisation representing the
      university librarians or library directors of Australian
      universities. CAUL is committed to advancing open access
      within the sector, helping institutions implement,
      communicate, deliver, and evaluate their open access
      initiatives. CAUL is also committed to raise awareness of
      OER with government and higher education sector
      stakeholders through professional development
      programs. The CAUL OER Collective initiative has also
      been introduced to develop capacity for publishing open
      textbooks and other educational resources, working
      collaboratively to promote OER within the broader agenda
      of OEP across Australian higher educational institutions
      and offering a publishing platform for authors from the
      Australian universities.

It is important to note that the creation of the textbook you're
reading was made possible through a CAUL grant awarded

48 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
to the authors. This grant has allowed us to offer learning
designers in the Australasian context a comprehensive
resource that aligns with the distinctive aspects of the learning
design profession, both in theory and practice.

This brief exploration underscores the evolution of the OEP
concept and its proliferation in Australian higher education,
forming a starting point for considering their relevance in the
context of socially just learning design. As learning designers,
we stand at a strategic vantage point to actively contribute
to the realisation of the overarching objectives of OE. Our
engagement can take the form of implementing and
cultivating OEP to expand access, as well as advocating for
inclusivity through the incorporation of OEP principles in
higher education.

OEP and learning designers

Nowadays, open education definitions are often amalgamated
into OER; therefore, it is crucial for learning designers to use
these terms accurately when communicating with
stakeholders. Clear understanding of applications of OEP is
vital when incorporating them into the learning design
practice, whether through content creation, developing
activities and assessments, use of technology, communication
or faculties relationships.

As learning designers, we play a pivotal role in advancing OEP
in higher educational institutions. Delving into the
opportunities within learning design requires thoughtful
consideration, deep reflection on the potential impact, and
careful decision-making to effectively embrace and implement
OEP. The following activity provides a short list of just a few

                                                                                     Practices | 49
practices in which learning designers can actively engage to
promote OEP.

   Exercises

     As you read through these, consider which practices
     you can promptly incorporate into your work. Reflect
     on areas within your workplace that may have gaps,
     and identify how one of the OEP below can address
     them. Also, consider evaluating which of these
     practices are inherent to your learning design role.
     Finally, think about whether there are practices that
     you will be incorporating into your work over the long
     term.

           Creation and adaptation of OER: Learning
             designers are inherently capable of developing
             OER or adapting existing resources to suit
             specific educational needs. For example, through
             utilising Wiley's 5 Rs, you can consider developing
             interactive H5P content and sharing in H5P
             OERHub, sharing videos in Kaltura, learning
             elements in Canvas Commons or enhancing
             accessibility of existing OER. Nevertheless, this
             may entail the challenge of navigating tension
             when collaborating with academics and senior
             management who may not embrace OEP
             (Roberts et al., 2022).

50 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
      Integration of OEP into learning design:
         Embedding principles of OEP into the
         instructional design process ensures that courses
         and learning materials are designed with
         openness in mind. This includes using content
         that is published under open licenses, ensuring
         proper attribution of materials published under
         open licenses and public domain, adopting open
         learning design models such as ABC Learning
         Design, and developing reusable teaching
         resources such as the UTS Adaptable Resources
         for Teaching with Technology resource collection
         and Equity Unbound online community.

      Promotion of open pedagogy: Learning
         designers can advocate for and incorporate open
         pedagogical practices, which involve engaging
         students in the creation and sharing of
         knowledge. This might include collaborative
         projects for creating OER, student-generated
         content, and renewable assessments. As learning
         designers, our approach to engaging academics
         in open pedagogy involves presenting practical
         examples for adoption of approaches to open
         pedagogy, rather than offering a theoretical
         overview. For example, the Open Pedagogy
         Notebook curates valuable resources for
         educators and learning designers who are
         seeking to delve deeper into open pedagogy,
         offering a range of evidence based examples
         from classroom practices.

      Training and professional development:

             opportunities for academics on OEP ensures that
             the broader educational community is aware of
             and skilled in implementing open approaches.
             This can be through running workshops and
             generating instructional resources such as the
             UTS resource collection Integrating Open
             Education Resources into your teaching.
           Advocacy for OEP: This can involve encouraging
             academics to share learning materials, raising
             awareness of the benefits of OEP in teaching and
             learning, and engaging in conversations with
             senior management and key stakeholders in
             higher educational institutions. It is important to
             ensure that these efforts align with institutional
             strategic goals, emphasising the value that OEP
             brings to the overall educational mission. For
             example, the OER Advocacy Toolkit, developed
             under the CAUL Enabling a Modern Curriculum
             OER Advocacy Project, serves as a comprehensive
             reference for advocates of OEP in higher
             educational institutions. The Toolkit includes
             information, resources, checklists, and practical
             ideas for effectively communicating with various
             stakeholders, including academics, librarians,
             teaching and learning committees, and university
             executives.
           Accessibility and inclusivity: As learning
             designers, we weave inclusivity into our work.
             OER hold the potential for ensuring accessible
             and inclusive learning. The fact that OER allow for
             adaptation, reuse, remix, and repurpose means
             we can use any OER to translate, create subtitles,

52 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
             and enhance content by adding alt text to
             images, among other improvements. This
             signifies that OEP help us cater to different
             learning styles, provide alternative formats, and
             ensure content is usable by individuals with
             various abilities. As a good practice, checking
             accessibility of H5P elements can be vital given
             the popularity of the tool. A good example is the
             H5P Accessibility tool by Libre Studio, which helps
             assessing and evaluating accessibility of H5P
             activities.
           Community engagement: Actively participating
             in the open education community such as Open
             Education Global, and special interest groups
             such as Australasian Open Educational Practices
             Special Interest Group allows librarians and
             learning designers to share insights, collaborate
             on projects, and stay informed about best
             practices and emerging trends in the field.

OEP encompasses skills and approaches that are inherent in
learning design. As learning designers working directly with
faculties, we can deliberately integrate these strategies into our
practice. This will enable us to make meaningful contributions
to the learning and teaching ecosystem, fostering
collaboration, accessibility, and the widespread sharing of
knowledge.

Open pedagogy: From theory to practice

The term open pedagogy has been introduced in the literature
as a concept that revolves around making educational
resources freely available, encouraging collaboration, and
involving students in the creation and sharing of knowledge
(Tietjen & Asino, 2021). Open pedagogy goes beyond that, as
it entails not only making resources accessible but also
influencing and transforming the methods and approaches
used in teaching.

DeRosa and Jhangiani (2017) define open pedagogy as a
dynamic and `contested site of praxis', where theories of
learning, teaching, technology, and social justice intersect,
guiding the ongoing development of educational practices
and structures. It embodies an access-oriented commitment
to learner-driven education, involving the intentional design
of architectures and the use of tools that empower students
to actively contribute to and shape the public knowledge
commons in which they participate.

Wiley and Hilton (2018) underscore the idea that students learn
best through hands-on experiences. They argue that copyright
laws restrict various educational activities (like copying or
creating derivative works without permission), limiting
students' learning options. OER with their permissions for the
5R activities (retain, revise, remix, reuse and redistribute),
remove these limitations. The advantages of using open
licenses extend to facilitating pedagogical approaches that are
otherwise unattainable when working with copyrighted
materials (DeRosa & Robison, 2017). Therefore, when using OER
instead of traditional copyrighted resources, students have the
freedom to engage in a wider range of activities and,
consequently, to learn in more diverse ways. Further, Fatayer
and Tualaulelei (2023) have argued that learning activities

54 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
should take place in socially relevant settings that allow
knowledge to be cognitively mediated between two or more
people. In the context of renewable assessments, defined by
David Wiley as assessments that produce meaningful and
valuable artifacts that contribute positively to the world and
can be extended, revised, and improved upon by future
students and others, the process of learning becomes more
explicit as students engage in the negotiation of knowledge
with academics, fellow students, and professionals,
concurrently contributing to the development of student-
generated OER. Students may then share their growing
knowledge with people other than those who are assessing
their assignments and they become a member of a learning
community (Fatayer & Tualaulelei, 2023). It is important to point
out that such inclusive practice of engaging students with
different stakeholders in the knowledge development process
is core to OEP and a result of openness as a pedagogical
approach. Importantly, OEP are recognised for their economic
advantages in terms of cost savings for students. An additional
and often overlooked benefit is the engagement of students in
the learning process.

Paskevicius and Irvine (2019) suggest that OEP constitute a
developing approach to learning design, incorporating
elements from established models of constructivist and
networked pedagogy. This involves leveraging open software
tools and content to innovate the creation and dissemination
of learning materials and assessments.

The previous section introduced different tools for adopting
open pedagogy and suggested tools that can be utilised by
learning designers to develop activities that are informed by
open pedagogy. Among the impactful approaches is utilising
renewable assessments. Renewable assessment, as
exemplified by Wiley's concept of "renewable assignments,"
(Wiley & Hilton, 2018) is a pedagogical approach that integrates
constructionism and openness within OER-enabled teaching.
In contrast to "disposable assignments," where the work is
understood to be temporary and discarded after grading,
renewable assignments aim to serve dual purposes. They not
only facilitate individual student learning but also contribute
to the creation or enhancement of OER that can benefit the
wider learning community. This approach underscores the idea
that assessments can be valuable beyond their immediate use,
providing lasting educational value by producing resources
that are shared and reused by others.

As learning designers, embracing a model for renewable
assessment is in line with principles of co-creation, student

56 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
agency, and ownership of learning, contributing to the
development of valuable, reusable educational resources. The
following section provides an evidence-based approach for
constructing an OER development model. This model aims
to sustain OER in higher education by leveraging renewable
assessments.

OER development model

The concept of student-generated content, originating from
user-generated content, has gained prominence in formal
learning environments. The term `student-generated content'
was first used by Sener (2007) and encompasses various terms
such as `learner-generated content' (Prez-Mateo et al., 2011)
and `student as producer' (Neary, 2010) and is utilised in
teaching approaches like project-based learning and group
work. When students work together on assignments, they
generate extra brainpower called `cognitive surplus'. This term,
coined by Shirky (2010) in his book The Cognitive Surplus,
describes the abundance of content created through activities
that people generate when they collaborate online. This
surplus leads to creative outcomes through activities like
Wikipedia.

The proliferation of content generation tools, such as blogs,
wikis, and social networking sites, has made it easier to design
collaborative learning activities. Importantly, these
technologies enhance the learning experience, promote digital
literacy, and support active learning (Mason & Rennie, 2008;
Sener, 2007).

Crafting effective learning design models is crucial for
successful teaching with technology in today's educational
landscape. This section presents a learning design model that

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 57
offers clear instructions and adaptable resources, catering to
various disciplines.

Three-stage model for student-generated OER

At the outset, a model was proposed where students and
academics developed OER as learning artefacts through a
three-step process: creating, evaluating and publishing
(Fatayer, 2016). The following H5P interactive elaborates on the
OER development model and presents two case studies of
model integration into undergraduate and postgraduate
studies.

                    An interactive H5P element has been excluded
                    from this version of the text. You can view it online
        here:
        https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/designing-learning-
        experiences/?p=56#h5p-2

By guiding the implementation of this model and ensuring
compliance with open access and intellectual property policies,
learning designers contribute to the broader goal of making
educational resources freely accessible to a wider audience
and extending the benefits of student work to several
communal goals. Finally, it is important to note that this
knowledge generation not only benefits the students
themselves but also enhances the availability of quality
educational materials for learners everywhere.

OER and open textbooks

Open education, encompassing content, practices, policy, and

58 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
a global community, offers the unprecedented opportunity for
universal access to cost-free, high-quality, open learning
resources. This educational revolution is driven by OER,
materials freely shared with legal permissions, empowering
learners and educators worldwide.

According to Creative Commons (n.d.), OER have become
important in learning and teaching due to several key factors.

   Storage: The digital nature of educational resources allows
      for easy storage, duplication, and distribution at minimal
      cost.

   Access: The public access of content and the widespread
      availability of the internet simplifies the process of sharing
      digital content with the public.

   Licensing: Legal sharing of content using Creative
      Commons licenses as they play a pivotal role by providing
      a straightforward and legal framework for individuals to
      both retain copyright and share educational resources
      openly with a global audience.

   Adaptability and reusability: OER's adaptability nature
      enhances inclusivity in learning and teaching. The
      reusability of OER allows educators to tailor materials to
      accommodate the diverse needs of learners, including
      those with different learning styles, languages, or cultural
      backgrounds.

These combined elements have facilitated the emergence of
OER in different learning environments.

   Why OER?

     Watch the following video and think about how Open
     Educational Resources align with your role as a
     learning designer and your commitment to enhancing
     student learning experiences.

                          One or more interactive elements has
                          been excluded from this version of the
              text. You can view them online here:
              https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/designing-
              learning-experiences/?p=56#oembed-2

Certainly, open textbooks are among the most prevalent and
widely recognised forms of OER. Open textbooks are typically
available in digital formats, making them easy to store,
duplicate, and distribute at minimal cost. Importantly,
traditional textbooks restrict pedagogical choices (Jhangiani et
al., 2016), which results in constraining the learning experience
for individuals with diverse learning preferences. However,
through the creation and adoption of open textbooks,
educators and learners gain the flexibility to customise the
content to meet their specific needs and teaching priorities.
For example, OpenStax is a non-profit organisation that offers

60 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
a collection of free, peer-reviewed, openly licensed textbooks
via their website. Academics can customise these resources to
suit the diverse needs of their students, whether by translating
content into different languages, adding supplementary
materials, or structuring the material to accommodate various
learning styles. This adaptability ensures that open textbooks
can cater to a wide range of learners, promoting inclusivity and
accessibility in education.

The adoption of open textbooks in learning and teaching has
the potential to achieve two significant outcomes: it can
significantly reduce the financial burden on students,
particularly those from disadvantaged socio-economic
backgrounds, and enhance their prospects for academic
success. This transformative impact aligns with the concept of
redistributive justice, one of the core principles of social justice
within open education, as articulated by Lambert (2018).

In addition to redistributive justice, Lambert (2018) proposes
that open education encompasses two other vital dimensions
of social justice: recognitive justice and representational justice,
both of which are emerging areas in the open education
landscape. Recognitive justice focuses on the inclusion of
diverse perspectives, images, and case studies within
educational resources, fostering a broader and more inclusive
educational experience. Representational justice, on the other
hand, emphasises the amplification of voices from
marginalised groups in textbooks and the open curriculum,
ensuring that their narratives are both heard and respected
(Lambert, 2018).

In their open textbook, Tualaulelei (2020) and her postgraduate
students, present an example of utilising a renewable
assessment approach. Importantly, this collaborative approach
of generating open textbooks with students provides a

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                      Practices | 61
practical example that reflects Lambert's (2018) framework of
redistributive, recognitive and representational justice.

Renewable assignments show promise for perspective
transformation as students will repurpose their assignment
artefacts for a broader professional audience and step more
fully into their future professional identities.

According to Tualaulelei and Green (2022), this approach
helped `to flatten out hierarchies within social structures such
as the teaching profession' and engaged students in
developing resources that address concerns related to
reconciliation and intercultural education and continuing
professional development or professional learning.

OER, open textbooks and learning
designers

As learning designers, we recognise that OEP hold the promise
of broadening access and championing inclusivity. It is
imperative for us to comprehend the effective approaches for
developing OER and open textbooks. Given our close
partnerships with academics, it becomes essential to raise
awareness among them about the available opportunities in
the realm of OEP. As our understanding of the potential of
OEP in enriching the learning experience deepens, we are
committed to leveraging existing resources that align with our
mission of fostering equitable, inclusive, and diverse education.

   Approaches to open textbooks

62 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
   development

     I was interested in the different approaches for
     generating open textbooks and integration in learning
     and teaching. I reached out to a few people in my
     network and interviewed them about their techniques.
     I was keen to know about the motives behind the
     decision to create and publish an open textbook rather
     than using traditional publishing methods, finding
     content, support to get the book reviewed and
     published, timeframe from start to publish and the
     impact on student learning and engagement.
     Read the blog and watch the three interviews.

The three examples above can be used as insights for us as
learning designers on adopting OEP in our daily work.
Importantly, we can consider several concrete actions to
address the issues of inequitable access and exclusion of
marginalised voices as highlighted in the following work by
Andersen (2022).

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 63
   Example of adapting open textbooks

     Enhancing Inclusion, Diversity, Equity and Accessibility
     (IDEA) in Open Educational Resources (OER) was
     developed by Nikki Andersen, Open Education
     Librarian at the University of Southern Queensland, to
     provide the Australian OER content developers with
     practical strategies for producing diverse, inclusive and
     accessible OER and open textbooks. The work is an
     adaptation of Improving Representation and Diversity
     in OER Materials by OpenStax. The work has also
     received the 2022 Australian Award University Teaching
     Citation for Outstanding Contributions to Student
     Learning and OEGlobal award for Diversity, Equity &
     Inclusion 2023.
     According to Andersen (2022): Content advertised as
     `open access' and `freely accessible' may give the
     impression that OER are universally accessible, but
     many users still face inequitable barriers to access.
     Additionally, access doesn't equal inclusion. Textbooks
     often express sexist and racist content and exclude
     marginalised voices. We need to consider how to
     contribute to a transformation and expand open access
     to resources to truly address diversity, equity, and
     inclusion."

Learning design, copyright and Creative
Commons

As learning designers, we are required to pay attention to using
and reusing materials to create new content in the learning
management system or any instructional resources. However,
often we question whether the content we use is covered by
copyright. The copyright area is broad, and it is not the
intention of this section to delve into legalese, but rather to
highlight the aspects of copyright that are important to
learning designers working in the Australian higher education
sector.

Copyright is the automatic legal protection given to all original
work that we create in a materialistic format. Copyright applies
as soon as a work has been put into a material form such as
being written down or recorded in some way, which applies
to both print and digital material. However, copyright is for
protection given to the expression of an idea and not the ideas
themselves.

The concept of copyright originated in 1709, making it a long-
standing idea. The main reasons for the need of copyright law
were to protect the publishing and printing industries and to
promote the advancement of knowledge. Its main mission was
to protect authors' ideas and advance knowledge. Copyright
law has two main reasons behind it, though the reasons may
differ in different legal systems.

 1. Utilitarian: To encourage authors by offering benefits of
      their work, such as commercial rewards and societal
      advantages.

2. Author's rights: To recognise and safeguard the bond
      between authors and their creative work. It is based on
      moral rights, which ensures authors receive credit for their

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 65
      work and protect the integrity of their creations.

The utilitarian rationale is more commonly found in common
law systems, while the author's rights rationale has historical
connections to civil law systems.

Copyright covers various works, such as art, literature,
recordings, and broadcasts. However, ideas, concepts,
methods, styles, facts, names, and titles are not copyrighted;
they may be protected under different laws like patents or
trademarks. When using indigenous cultural and intellectual
property, it is essential to respect relevant protocols and ethical
guidelines.

It is important to note that copyright law might differ from
country to country. So here in Australia, we do not need to
register work in some way or have the copyright symbol on it
to be protected. Therefore, images, text, and videos that you
may find on the Internet are not free to use if they do not
have a copyright notice! Copyright also lasts for a very long
time, generally for 70 years after the creators' death. After the
copyright has expired, the work then enters into the public
domain, which means you can reuse it however you like.

The copyright owner holds exclusive economic rights,
including publishing, communicating to the public, copying,
reproducing, performing, and adapting the work. Additionally,
moral rights safeguard the creator's personal rights, such as
the right to attribution and protection of the work's integrity.

Copyright questions I heard from learning
designers

Copyright laws in Australia protect the intellectual property
of learning designers and creators. Copyright automatically

66 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
applies to original works once they are created, and it grants
the creator exclusive rights to use and distribute their work.
This means that learning designers have certain rights and
protections for their educational materials and content.
However, this may change if you belong to a higher
educational institution in Australia. When it comes to learning
designers working in Australian higher educational
institutions, copyright, is still, of utmost importance. We are
usually responsible for creating and designing educational
materials, online subjects, and other content used in teaching
and learning. In most Australian higher education institutions,
we often collaborate with educators and subject matter
experts to develop educational materials, instructional
resources, and interactive content. This content can include
lecture notes, presentations, multimedia, assessments, and
more.

As my experience primarily resides in the learning design
sphere, I often encounter intriguing questions from colleagues
regarding copyright and Creative Commons. While I am not
an expert in copyright, I respond to all questions from my
perspective and recommend that they reach out to the
university library's copyright officer for legal advice. In the

Creative Commons essentials for learning
designers

While there is a vast amount to discuss regarding Creative
Commons, immersing oneself in the content of the Creative
Commons Certificate open textbook can offer a thorough
guide to effectively utilising Creative Commons licenses within
educational environments.

   Creative Commons story

     The creators of Creative Commons acknowledged the
     disparity between the possibilities enabled by
     technology and the limitations imposed by copyright.
     They offered an alternative method for creators who
     wish to distribute their work. This approach is now
     embraced by countless creators worldwide. It all began
     with the case of Eldred v. Ashcroft (2003), which was
     argued in the Supreme Court of the United States by
     Lawrence Lessig, a Stanford law professor who would
     go on to found Creative Commons. For detailed

to be contextual to our discipline and subject areas. She
proposes four guiding points that can be used in decolonising
the curriculum approach. The following points integrate OER/
OEP as the fifth guiding point to demonstrate their
introduction in Arshad's guide and to reveal where to revise the
curriculum, spotting chances for decolonisation.

decolonising-curriculum-how-do-i-get-started

Awareness and critical reflection: Start by examining what
coloniality means and why decolonising the curriculum is
important as part of our commitment to justice. Read Walter D.
Mignolo's 2017 paper `Coloniality is far from over, and so must
be decoloniality'. This paper emphasises that the impact of
colonialism persists in various aspects of modern society.
Foundational understanding: Review your subject materials
to uncover bodies of knowledge, perspectives, theories, or
viewpoints that exist outside of the mainstream or dominant
narratives knowledge canons that may have been
marginalised or disregarded due to colonial influences.
72 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
Determine if there are perspectives, theories, or contributions
that have been overshadowed by colonialism and should now
be integrated into the subject's discourse for meaningful
discussion with students.

Incorporating marginalised perspectives: Identify side-lined
knowledge due to colonialism in your educational content and
integrate it into learning activities (e.g., ice-breaker, discussions
boards, assessments, etc). Include various voices, re-imagine
the learning content to encompass broader global and
historical viewpoints.

Empowerment through Open Educational Resources (OER):
Curate and identify OER to replace identified content. Ensure
the chosen resources have open licenses for adaptability. A
good start is in Indigenisation, Decolonisation and Cultural
Inclusion. A common CC license used by an OER such as the
Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY-NC)
license is a good option. This license allows others to reuse,
remix, and redistribute the resource as long as they provide
appropriate attribution to the original creators and do not use
it for commercial purposes. Another CC license, that can also
be used, is the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license
which allows even greater freedom for users, permitting both
commercial and non-commercial use if attribution is given to
the original authors.

Student diversity: Consider the diversity of your student
groups and ensure that the learning content transcends
Western perspectives, encompassing broader global
f rameworks.

Importantly, as learning designers it is crucial for us to
continuously assess, gather feedback, and enhance content
design to ensure its relevance to students' diverse
backgrounds.

Openness: From social justice to liberation

This hot topic holds great personal significance for me as it
resonates with my cultural identity, as a first generation
Palestinian in the diaspora, and underscores the
transformative potential of openness in advancing social
justice to achieve liberation. As I compose this chapter, the
atrocities of the Israeli army on civilians in the Gaza Strip
persist. Regrettably, by the time of completion, additional
tragic incidents are anticipated, including the loss of innocent
lives, particularly children, as a result of Israeli military actions
and rocket attacks on civilian spaces such as refugee camps,
educational institutions and hospitals. This has also resulted
in the loss of lives of academics, artists, journalists, scientists,
and historians. Furthermore, the atrocities of the occupation
have extended to archives, libraries, museums, and historical
buildings.

       The educational system lies at the heart of this
       devastation, with the persistent war preventing
       approximately 608,000 students from exercising
       their fundamental right to school education, and
       interrupting the studies of over 90,000 university
       students. Moreover, the loss of 17 professors, 59
       holders of Ph.D. degrees, and 18 individuals with
       master's degrees has dealt a severe blow to the
       intellectual foundation of Gaza's universities
       (Mediterranean Universities Union, n.d.).

Education serves as a moral compass for Palestinians as they
strive for learning at all stages, making them the country with

74 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
the lowest illiteracy rate in the world per capita. Palestinian
universities stand as symbols of pride and resilience for the
Palestinian people; however, due to the occupation, their
participation in generating knowledge remains limited,
encountering barriers imposed by the Israeli occupation
(Alfoqahaa, 2015). Preserving lives is crucial, as is safeguarding
human intellectual property. Through openness, Palestinians
can find ways to preserve their knowledge and pave the way
towards liberation.

Openness, as a transformative force for equity, goes beyond its
role in facilitating learning and teaching through OER. It acts
as a catalyst for liberation, providing a platform to disseminate
narratives and facts that illuminate the persistent challenges
endured by the indigenous people of Palestine. In doing so, it
actively contributes to the discourse surrounding the 76 years
of occupation, fostering awareness about injustice, correcting
media misconceptions about the history of the land and
emphasising the urgent need for global attention and support.

Yet, preserving knowledge amidst occupation poses
significant challenges, often entailing serious risks. Under
Israeli occupation, access to material goods and decent living
standards are often considered privileges to Palestinians rather
than basic human rights. Consequently, these factors deprive
Palestinians of having a robust health system, an income to
secure basic needs without having to resort to working in
subhuman conditions, and proper education.

According to Itmazi (2020), in the Arab States, including
Palestine, a notable concern arises from the insufficient
availability of open digital content in the Arabic language.
Currently, all Arabic content on the web constitutes less than
3% of global digital content. Furthermore, the absence of
political strategies or action plans from Arab Ministries has
been identified as a hindrance to the development and

implementation of OER. It is critical to carry out awareness
campaigns about the importance of creating, using, and
sharing OER. Importantly, the available OER could be
translated from other languages into Arabic and further
recontextualised to meet the needs of Palestinian education.

As learning designers, understanding the perspectives and
needs of learners can inform the design decisions, therefore
adopting human-centred approaches is usually seen as a core
commitment in designing for the better, both for people and
the planet. It is our ethical duty and commitment to design
for better futures, acknowledge ethical responsibilities and to
speak out against injustices. We cannot be learning designers
who stay disconnected from brutal war crimes while claiming
to operate from a space of empathy when we design for
spaces, technology, and interfaces. Empathy, as we
understand it, is the ability to feel deeply and resonate with
the human experience.

   Practical steps to support liberation
   through OEP

     There are many ways we can consider to pave the way
     to liberation through an open education lens:

           Cultivate empathy for the enduring struggle of
             Palestinians over the long term.

           Educate ourselves on the history of the
             occupation dating back to 1948.

           Curate OER tailored to address the specific needs
             and infrastructural challenges (See OERs for
             Gaza).

           Challenge and rectify misconceptions by
             decolonising available resources.

78 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
The principles of open education pave the way for individuals
across various learning design roles to contribute to a more
informed, empathetic, and socially responsible approach to
addressing the challenges posed by conflicts and
displacements. As learning designers, our contribution can be
through global awareness and solidarity, documenting and
preserving narratives, as well as cultural preservation and
restoration, to name a few possibilities.

Generative AI and Open Educational

The introduction of generative AI has brought a significant
disruption in higher education, although it is worth noting that
disruption is the norm in the higher education sector. Before
exploring generative AI and OEP more extensively, it is crucial
to recognise that, at the time of writing, higher education is
primarily reacting to the emergence of generative AI.
Numerous uncertainties surround the integration of these new
technologies into learning and teaching. Consequently, this
discussion will focus on examining potential applications of
generative AI in the development of OER.

       What is artificial intelligence (AI)?

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 79
       UNESCO World Commission on the Ethics of
       Scientific Knowledge and Technology, UNESCO
       (2019) defines Artificial Intelligence (AI) into two
       distinct aspects: theoretical or scientific AI and
       pragmatic or technological AI. The theoretical
       aspect explores AI concepts and models to answer
       questions about human beings and other living
       things, intersecting with disciplines like philosophy,
       logic, linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science.
       It addresses questions about intelligence,
       distinguishing natural from artificial intelligence,
       the role of symbolic language in thought processes,
       and the possibility of achieving "strong AI"
       comparable to human intelligence. On the other
       hand, pragmatic or technological AI is engineering-
       oriented, leveraging branches of AI such as natural
       language processing, knowledge representation,
       machine learning, deep learning, computer vision,
       and robotics. It aims to create machines or
       programs capable of independently performing
       tasks that typically require human intelligence. The
       success of pragmatic AI is evident in its integration
       with information and communications technology
       (ICT), leading to widespread applications in areas
       like transport, medicine, communication, education,
       finance, law, military, marketing, customer services,
       and entertainment (UNESCO, 2019).

As technology develops, so too do the ways we define it. There
is no single or fixed definition of AI, but there is common
agreement that machines based on AI "are potentially capable
of imitating or even exceeding human cognitive capacities,

80 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
including sensing, language interaction, reasoning and
analysis, problem solving, and even creativity" (UNESCO, 2019).

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a type of artificial
intelligence used to create images, text, audio, video, computer
code and other types of content via text prompts from a user.
Generative AI exists in the form of a standalone tool or can
be incorporated or integrated into other content creation tools
for example ChatGPT for text, Dall-e for images, or GitHub for
computer code to name a few. In his short blog, David Wiley
(2023) has attempted to respond to the question of what
impact generative AI is going to have on education by starting
with the assumption that `Generative AI greatly reduces the
degree to which access to expertise is an obstacle to
education'. David's initial thought sparked more questions
such as, how will generative AI tools impact the development
of OER by learning designers, especially considering they may
not always be subject matter experts?

   Using generative AI in developing OER

     Some ways in which generative AI could be used when
     creating or adapting OER are as follows:

           To create questions sets, case studies, and other
             types of instructional resources.

           To analyse a photo to create alt text for
             accessibility purposes.

           To create illustrations and photo-realistic images

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                      Practices | 81
             for both decorative and instructional purposes.
           To generate scripts that can be used for videos

             and podcasts.
           To create instructional videos.
           To generate sentences, paragraphs, and chapters

             for a textbook.
           To analyse and create summaries of longer

             sections of text.
           To automate the creation of an audio version of

             text, usually for accessibility purposes.
           To translate text to another language.

Nonetheless, ensuring the quality of OER will remain a
challenge that learning designers need to address. Generative
AI tools can handle routine and bulk tasks, accelerating the
content development process and reducing the necessity for
expertise in all aspects of content creation. These tools also
aid in generating accessible content, such as alt text. However,
human intuition and an expert's final touch are unlikely to
become obsolete and remain a necessity to ensure the overall
quality of content.

Intentional vs. unintentional use

With the proliferation of generative AI tools and the continual
integration of these tools into other software packages, you
may not know that a tool you are using to create learning
materials is using generative AI. Therefore, these guidelines are
intended to be interpreted with leniency and flexibility to allow
for the possibility that generative AI use may not always be
visible or apparent to the person who is using a tool. Here are
guidelines to consider if you plan to use generative AI tools
during the OER content creation process.

82 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
Considerations and risks

While these tools can be of great value, there are numerous
ethical concerns and potential risks you should be aware of
when you consider using generative AI tools to develop OER.

 1. Lack of transparency: The source of the training data and
      the programming logic used by many generative AI tools
      is not always made available to the public. Indeed, even
      the companies that develop the tools may not be able to
      explain exactly how they work, or how they arrived at the
      outputs they did.

2. Bias: Because there is a lack of transparency in how the
      tools are constructed and what data is used to train them,
      this can lead to biases being present in the output.

 3. Accuracy: Generative AI systems can sometimes produce
      inaccurate or made-up answers (also referred to as
      hallucinations).

4. Intellectual property (IP) and copyright: There are three
      areas where copyright and IP should be considered; the
      content that the AI tool has been trained with, the content
      that the AI tool generates, and using AI to generate
      summaries of copyrighted content.

       I. Use of content to train AI models: Many generative AI
            tools have been trained on copyrighted works often
            without the permission of copyright holders. While
            organizations such as Creative Commons argue that
            this use is considered fair use under current copyright
            legislation, there are a number of lawsuits where
            creators are arguing that AI tools are creating
            unauthorised derivatives. This also means that AI-
            generated content could be subject to copyright
            claims.

      II. Applying copyright to generated output: Legal
            decision and rulings around copyrighting AI

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 83
            generated content has been very clear in the United
            States. AI generated content is not human made and
            therefore cannot be protected by copyright. In Canada
            there has not been as definitive legal rulings around
            this, although the emerging consensus in Canada is
            that Canadian copyright law will follow closely with
            the US when it comes to copyright and AI due to the
            shared international copyright and trades agreements
            the two countries have with each other. To date, there
            isn't a specific legal reference available for Australia's
            stance on copyrighting AI-generated content.
      III. Using AI to generate summaries of copyrighted
            work: It is unlikely that using generative AI to
            summarise copyrighted content is a violation of
            copyright as the AI generated summary is machine
            and not human generated.
 5. Sustainability: Generative AI uses massive amounts of
      electricity to operate, which has led to examinations as to
      how environmentally sustainable generative AI is.

   Key Takeaways

     Guidelines and recommendations:

         1. Be cautious with your use of AI generated
             content. While we do provide some guidelines
             and suggestions, AI generated content is an area
             that is in considerable flux right now and these
             guidelines and recommendations may change as
             the field evolves.

        2. Manually review and assess all AI generated
             content for accuracy, appropriateness, and
             usefulness before including it in any OER. AI
             generated content should be reviewed by more
             than one subject matter expert to ensure the
             validity of the content. As an OER author, you are
             ultimately accountable for the content that you
             share in your OER, therefore you must manually
             verify the accuracy of the content.

        3. Closely review any AI generated content for bias,
             including language or images that reinforce
             cultural or societal stereotypes around race,
             ethnicity, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political
             beliefs, religion, marital status, family status,
             ability, sex, gender identity and expression, sexual
             orientation, age, and class and/or socioeconomic
             status. Consider reviewing and assessing the
             outputs of AI generated content using the lenses

86 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
         of equity, diversity and inclusion and ask whether
         the content aligns with these considerations.
   4. Do not use generative AI to generate content for
         an area or subject where you do not have the
         appropriate level of knowledge or understanding
         to verify the accuracy of the content.
    5. Be transparent about your use of generative AI.
         Just like attributing the reuse of open content,
         you should include statements within the OER
         that let others know that you have used
         generative AI in the creation of the OER. This
         should include:

              what content was generated
              what tools were used to generate the

                 content, including links to the tool,
              how you used that tool (i.e., what prompts

                 was the tool given that generated the
                 content?)
              the date the content was generated
              what steps were taken to review the content
                 to ensure it was valid and correct.

    6. As much of the legal consensus around AI
         generated content suggests AI created content is
         not copyrightable, you should not apply a
         Creative Commons license to AI generated
         content as Creative Commons licenses can only
         be applied to content that is copyrightable.

    7. You should avoid generating content that may
         include content that is protected by a trademark
         or patent. For example, you should avoid creating
         an image using an AI image generator that

Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                Practices | 87
             includes a trademarked corporate logo unless you
             are doing so under the purposes of Fair Use.
        8. If you use AI to create a summary of another work,
             you should ensure that you are familiar enough
             with the original work to determine whether or
             not the generated summary is an accurate
             representation of the original work before using
             the summary.

Evaluating OER

Publishing an OER is a valuable endeavour that requires careful
planning, creation, and dissemination. The following sequence
can be useful for learning designers to consider before
publishing OER:

   Quality of content and use of third-party content
      When evaluating the quality of content for OER, several
      crucial considerations come into play. Firstly, it is
      imperative to review the content for accuracy, ensuring it
      is free from errors. Additionally, a critical aspect of quality
      control involves addressing biases and conflicting
      information to present an unbiased and cohesive resource.
      The content should align with the values of the institution
      where its developed and should not convey messages
      contradictory to these principles. Furthermore, adherence
      to accessibility guidelines is essential to guarantee that
      the content can be accessed and utilised by all learners. In
      the case of third-party content incorporation, it is crucial to
      verify licenses for compatibility with the broader OER and

88 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
   ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards. This
   first step of the evaluation process is fundamental to
   maintaining high quality and the integrity of the OER.

 Practical tool for OER development and
 evaluation in the Australian context

  EmpoweredOER is a website and practical tool
  designed to guide the development and evaluation of
  inclusive OER. This platform provides simplified
  explanations and concrete examples of good practice.
  EmpoweredOER adapts the Equity Rubric for OER
  Evaluation developed by a non-profit organisation,
  Branch Alliance for Educator Diversity (BranchED)
  (Grunzke et al., 2021). Barber's work (2023) incorporated
  into EmpoweredOER provides valuable insights into
  good practices, featuring illustrations from an
  Australian context. These practices are intricately
  woven into three overarching themes: (1) accessibility,
  (2) the intersection of Universal Design for Learning
  (UDL) and inclusive open education, and (3)
  perspective and representation.

 Publishing guidelines
   The process of license selection and definition is a crucial
   step in the creation and publication of OER. As you decide

  Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                  Practices | 89
      on how the work will be disseminated, consider the
      following:

         Firstly, and foremost, it is essential to carefully choose
            an appropriate license that aligns with the intended
            use and sharing of the OER.

         Secondly, to ensure institutional alignment and
            compliance, obtaining approval from the relevant
            academic unit or faculty is imperative, as this step
            helps validate the chosen license and the decision to
            publish the OER.

         Finally, a copyright officer's advice should also be
            sought to address any potential copyright-related
            concerns and to maintain legal integrity. Copyright
            officers, who are most of the time embedded in
            university libraries, can identify and resolve any
            copyright issues that may arise during the
            development and sharing of the OER. This step in the
            evaluation process safeguards the proper
            dissemination of OER while upholding legal and
            institutional standards.

   OER licensing tools

     Open Attribution Builder
     To simplify the process of licensing, an attribution
     builder tool developed by Open Washington OER
     Network ( Washington State Board for Community and

90 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
  Technical Colleges, n.d) can be utilised to generate the
  license, ensuring that it accurately reflects the desired
  permissions and restrictions.
  This tool facilitates convenient citation of open
  materials by automatically generating attribution as
  you fill out a form. It is designed specifically for citing
  openly distributed work, including content licensed by
  Creative Commons or released into the public domain.
  Keep in mind that the tool offers a default attribution
  statement, which can be modified to better suit
  specific needs.
  Open Education Licensing Toolkit
  The OEL Toolkit is a web application designed to assist
  teaching staff in Australian higher education
  institutions. It is a decision tree system that provides
  easy access to relevant support resources regarding
  open educational resources. The tool was developed by
  a team from Swinburne University and the University of
  Tasmania and was supported by the Australian
  Government Office for Learning and Teaching.

 Technological considerations
   When it comes to hosting OER, several essential
   considerations need to be addressed. Firstly, it is crucial to
   determine the most suitable platform or location for
   hosting the OER content, ensuring it aligns with your
   goals and target audience. Once hosted, there should be a
   well-defined plan in place for the ongoing maintenance
   and preservation of the OER to ensure its long-term
   accessibility and relevance. Additionally, it is important to

  Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                   Practices | 91
      review the terms and conditions of global OER
      repositories, such as OER Commons, to confirm that they
      align with your objectives and any licensing agreements
      you've chosen for your OER. These repositories can provide
      valuable platforms for sharing your educational
      resources.Recommendations for suitable OER repositories
      should be made considering the nature of your resource
      and its intended audience. For example, OER Commons is
      recommended as a publishing platform. It is essential to
      ensure that publishers, if involved, adhere to the original
      purpose of making the resource open and
      accessible.Lastly, the inclusion of sufficient meta-data
      attributes is crucial for effective discovery and
      categorisation of the OER. These attributes enhance the
      resource's visibility and usability, facilitating its access by
      educators and learners seeking relevant educational
      materials.

   OER infrastructure

     Open Educational Resources Search Index
     OERSI, or the Open Educational Resources Search
     Index, is a search engine designed for open educational
     materials in higher education. Launched in 2021, it
     connects various OER repositories, including initiatives,
     university libraries, and subject-specific repositories.
     OERSI, developed as an open-source service, does not

92 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
     store content but centralises metadata for uniform
     searching. Users can integrate OERSI into other
     platforms and customise searches based on specific
     criteria. The project encourages open participation,
     allowing feedback, bug reporting, and feature requests
     through transparent processes on the GitLab platform.
     OER Commons
     Developed in 2007 by Institute for the Study of
     Knowledge Management in Education (ISKME), OER
     Commons provides a robust infrastructure for
     curriculum experts and instructors at all levels to
     discover high-quality OER that can be downloaded
     directly through the curated resources. Individual
     learning content developers can also share their own
     materials directly through this platform.
     ISKME's technology platform, tools, and metadata
     enhancements in OER Commons emphasise fostering
     accessibility and inclusive design principles. By
     aggregating resources and standardising metadata
     from OER content providers, the site supports
     knowledge sharing and access to teaching and
     learning materials, strategies, and curricula online.

Conclusion

This chapter has presented practical approaches for the
adoption of OEP in higher education, offering insights from
Australia and other places around the world. The concept of
openness holds immense potential to enrich higher education,
particularly as it aligns with strategies commonly embraced

    Designing inclusive learning experience through Open Educational
                                                                                     Practices | 93
by universities, emphasising principles of social justice. Key
takeaways from this chapter can be summarised as follows:

   In our roles as learning designers, it is imperative that we
      intentionally approach open education with confidence
      and courage, recognising that our unique qualifications
      empower us to leverage the 5Rs (retain, revise, remix,
      reuse and redistribute) effectively in our learning design
      processes.

   As learning designers, a thorough understanding of the
      fundamentals of open education is indispensable for our
      daily interactions with academics. Utilising the insights of
      open pedagogy provides a common language that
      bridges the understanding gap between us and
      academics, making it essential to be cognisant of diverse
      teaching approaches grounded in open pedagogy.

   In our routine tasks, we often encounter inquiries about
      open textbooks or copyrights, typically better addressed
      by library copyright officers. However, it is crucial to share
      our insights with academics, guiding them in unpacking
      the benefits of open textbooks. This involves empowering
      them to infuse their perspectives into a curriculum that
      might be outdated and inherently biased.

   Lastly, delving deeper into the role of OEP beyond social
      justice becomes increasingly vital in the face of the
      disruptions we experience, whether due to political
      challenges or technological advancements. Open
      education holds the potential to decolonise and elevate
      the quality of education, enabling us to foster inclusivity
      for everyone in the learning journey.

I unequivocally concur with Ash Barber's (2023) assertion in her
paper that `... the reality is OER alone cannot achieve this goal
[inclusive, equitable and diverse education] because OER itself

94 | Designing inclusive learning experience through Open
Educational Practices
is not the goal. OER is the vehicle to the goal of dismantling the
education exclusion zone'.

Similarly, the exclusion zone within the learning content we
construct, the interactivity infused into resources, and the
innovations embedded in our designs must be dismantled .
This dismantling need is essential to amplify the voices of those
at the margins and foster inclusivity for everyone within the
learning environment.

  Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding third

       Hi, I am Puva P Arumugam, and I am a third space
       academic - I am a Lecturer, Learning Futures in an
       Australian university and I belong to a very
       prominent workforce in the higher education sector
       known as third space practitioners. As an academic,
       I am very interested in the research involving third
       space practitioners. Recently, colleagues asked me
       what the fuss was about third space practitioners in
       the higher education landscape and why third
       space practitioners warrant any research interest.
       My answer is that third space practitioners will
       always be an ever-developing important aspect of
       the higher education workforce, and there is no
       better time than now to be involved in this research.

       Among the many hats that I wear in my role, I am
       an academic lead of teaching and learning course
       and unit development projects and I enjoy my work
       because I get to work with a variety of discipline-
       based academics and projects, and I can indulge in
       lifelong learning in my role. As a third space
       academic, I am also constantly working to make an
       impact with the work that I do and to bring about
       awareness of my hybrid identity in the higher
       education teaching and learning space.

       As this textbook is aimed at providing an inclusive
       and diverse learning experience for learning
       designers who also come under the umbrella of
       third space practitioners (either as third space
       professionals or third space academics), it is right to
       point out that their roles have at times been

104 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
       perceived as an appendix to the discipline-based
       academics and/or higher education professional
       workforce. This perception causes assumptions, and
       these assumptions cause blurred boundaries in
       terms of professional identity and having a sense of
       belonging in the higher education landscape. As
       such, third space practitioners do often find that
       they have to navigate a fair bit of tension and
       challenges before completely understanding this
       space in which they operate.
       I hope to unpack a few of the tensions and
       challenges and show what the fuss is about third
       space practitioners as I narrate through my own
       reflections of being a third space academic and by
       drawing references from literature and research
       that has been done in this space.

Who are these third space practitioners?

Third space practitioners, who are often referred to as third
space professionals and third space academics, have been in
the higher education landscape for quite some time now. A
fair amount of research has been done across the globe
regarding the work of third space practitioners, the liminal
space they occupy and their identity in the higher education
landscape. The work and presence of third space professionals
has become more prominent through the work of Celia
Whitchurch. Whitchurch (2008) highlights the mixed
background and portfolios that third space professionals
come from and how their appointments span across the

  Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding third

domains of both academics and professionals. She highlights
that because third space professionals are likely to have work
experiences in settings external to higher education, third
space professionals may feel a sense of outsider status. During
the recent global COVID-19 pandemic, third space practitioner
roles such as learning designers, educational technologists,
educational developers, academic developers and
instructional designers, to name a few, become increasingly
necessary as higher education institutions moved to a more
integrated learning environment and the roles gained
popularity as a career choice (Heggart & Dickson-Deane, 2022).
This chapter discusses details surrounding the professional
identity of and the assumptions about the role of third space
practitioners. It highlights the tensions and challenges faced
by third space professionals and third space academics within
the liminal space (Manathunga, 2007) they occupy within the
higher education landscape and provides an `industry' (i.e.,
working in the higher education space) perspective. This
chapter also describes the difference between third space
professional and third space academic roles and the way
learning designers are perceived by traditional teaching staff,
and how this perception affects the way they function in both
roles. Using the lens of Homi Bhabha's concept of
ambivalence and liminal space (Bhabha, 1994), this chapter
highlights certain tensions and challenges faced by third
space practitioners in higher education as they navigate
expectations and assumptions held by traditional institutional
and discipline academics.

       I didn't really think I would end up being a third
       space academic. I actually stumbled into this role by
       chance. I worked as a casual academic for four years
       while completing my PhD. I truly enjoyed my role as
       an academic and just before my graduation I was
       acting as the unit chair for several units that were
       related to my area of expertise. After my PhD, owing
       to personal circumstances, I had to leave academia
       and I took a job in the corporate world. I brought to
       my corporate roles many transferable skills from my
       experience as a casual academic. I knew how to
       work technology, manage people, meet deadlines,
       prepare and deliver presentations and train and
       mentor people on the job.

       The pay and work in the corporate sector were good,
       but deep down inside I knew that I wanted to work
       in academia as I didn't want to `waste' my PhD.
       Wanting to go back into academia is also a cultural
       thing for me. I come from Southeast Asia, and I
       grew up in a multicultural environment. And we are
       measured by our achievements. Having a PhD and
       being an academic do rank quite high in terms of
       personal achievement. I personally pursued a PhD
       because I wanted to be an academic. But with a
       niche discipline background like Cultural Studies
       and Performing Arts, it was hard to get back into
       that discipline. So, after 11 years of not being in
       academia, I returned to working in the university
       and took on a third space professional role as a
       Senior Educational Designer. Within a year, I applied

108 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
       for a third space academic role within a faculty in
       the university, and I became a Lecturer, Learning
       Futures.
       I was very happy that I got an academic role, but
       there was also this sense of curiosity about what
       exactly I would be doing in this role.

Discipline-based academics

In many universities, the discipline-based academics
(Manathunga, 2007), also known as traditional academics,
experience a clear sense of belonging, because there is clear
alignment between their professional identity, the job they do
and the relationship these have to their discipline. Usually,
discipline-based academics do not hold any teaching
qualifications and they teach content based on their
knowledge of the subject matter as it relates to the field, and
they are usually trained in their area of expertise by way of
working or research. Their role is to teach in the discipline they
belong to with a minimum of contact time with students, and
they must prepare, curate or develop the teaching materials
and manage the administrative and content development
related tasks that are attached to this role. These may include
curriculum development, writing of assessments and rubrics,
developing teaching plans and learning content, lecture and
seminar teaching, as well as developing learning materials,
marking, grading, producing final reports, sitting on academic
committees, contributing to scholarship of teaching,
presenting at conferences and collaborating with other
institutions and getting grants from industry partners. This

                                                   space academics/professionals | 109
ties in very much with Boyer's scholarship model, where `the
priorities of the academic encompassed four main themes,
namely: teaching and learning, integration, application, and
discovery' (Boyer, 1990, p. 2). Discipline-based academics are
paid according to academic pay scales that recognise
seniority. Of course, this is a general description, and the role
of a discipline-based academic is by no means confined to
these elements. However, it is important to note that many
discipline academics love being academics. They are usually in
ongoing roles and because they fit in this space very easily,
they are happy to move from one higher education institution
to another to continue to grow their career.

Casual Academics/session tutors

Another group of academics that are part of the higher
education teaching staff are casual academics. This group is
made up of aspiring academics who are doing their PhD or
have just completed their PhD. They are generally seeking to
become academics after completing study or working in the
industry of their expertise. Casual academics often take on
several roles in the university including those of tutors,
seminar leaders, acting lecturers and acting unit chairs,
depending on the need for teaching staff within their school
and faculty. They engage in teaching and developing content
as needed. They usually work on short-term contracts, and
they do not enjoy the full remuneration benefits of paid leave
in many institutions. They do not have to do the administrative
work, but some might get paid to do it. They do engage in
research and are eligible for awards and grants, depending on
the particular higher education institution, but often this
research is either in their own time or limited.

110 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
Professional staff

The next important group of teaching and learning staff would
be the professional staff members who support administrative
functions in the universities. These professional staff would be
stationed in areas such as Finance, Student Enrolment,
Human Resources, Timetabling, Library, Information
Technology, Unit Site Development, Assessment Submission
and Office Procurement. There is no research load for
professional staff, and they can attend conferences and other
professional learning opportunities to enhance their
understanding of the higher education space without having
to publish or engage in research. In Australia, professional staff
do not have to work beyond agreed hours and they have
flexibility to go full or part time. They, too, often consider the
higher education landscape to be their home and place where
they belong.

Third space practitioners

While professional staff in the past have provided support for
administrative tasks, some of them have also, for the past two
decades or so, crossed into the realm of preparing teaching
and learning materials and co-designing teaching and
learning with academics, hence navigating a space in
between teaching and administration. They have become
known as third space professionals (Whitchurch, 2008). Figure
1 shows the liminal space that is occupied by third space
practitioners, who are often in both academic and professional
roles. This pool of staff, owing to the hybrid space they occupy,
have often struggled to find their place in the university and
hence are often `homeless' when it comes to finding their
place in the university setting (Manathunga, 2007). Unlike the

other categories discussed above, they often only have a very
vague sense of belonging within the higher education
landscape.

education institutions.

Third space professionals

Third space professionals are non-academic staff who come
under the umbrella of third space practitioners. They might be
educational technologists, or librarians, or school
administrative staff who create or assist with the creation of
teaching and learning materials to support teaching staff.
These are often professional roles such as Educational
Developer, Learning Designer, Instructional Designer,
Educational Technologist, among others. Third space
professionals have a varied educational background; many do
have postgraduate qualifications, sometimes related to the
discipline they work in. These roles are often categorised by
Higher Education Worker (HEW) levels in Australia. They are
non-teaching roles. They do provide capacity building or
professional learning to teaching staff members, but not
112 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding

because they have a teaching component attached to their
roles.

       I recall an incident when an academic whom I had
       not worked with in the faculty met me as I was
       making my cup of tea in the shared kitchen. She
       asked: `What is it you do?' I replied happily: `Oh, I
       help support academics in the faculty with their
       teaching and learning practices and material, I co-
       design their teaching and learning cloud site and I
       also help to review their assessment and rubrics,
       and I build academics' capacity to transition
       smoothly into the blended teaching space.' Her
       response shocked me: `Oh, I see ... I am a real
       academic, unlike you. I teach students in class, we
       have to teach several units, and we have a research
       load that we have to do. It's hard work. Very busy.'

       I stood there looking at her blankly. I sort of missed
       most of the words after she said `real academic'. My
       thoughts were along the lines of: How am I not a
       real academic? Why am I not a real academic? I
       have a PhD. I teach. I work on several units. I write
       learning objectives, I care about students and their
       learning experience. I care about all the things she
       cares about. I have a research load and I am so busy
       too! How am I not a real academic?

       Her reaction and response never left me and won't
       leave me as long as I am in this role.

According to Smith et al. (2021), third space academic is a term
used to describe roles that are held by non-discipline
academics who are not necessarily subject matter experts
although they support a wide variety of teaching academics
from all disciplines with curriculum development, assessment
and rubric design, learning design, content management,
project management, and people and time management, and
they have a research component as part of their workload
allocation model. These academics have migrated from other
disciplines (Manathunga, 2007), transferring their prior
identities and knowledge from their home discipline into
teaching. Karen Dowd and David Kaplan have categorised
academics into several groups; two that relate to third space
practitioners would be Mavericks and Connectors, as they are
both listed as being boundaryless (Dowd & Kaplan, 2005).
Dowd and Kaplan describe Mavericks as academics who are
independent and seemingly unconstrained by the structural
limitations of the tenure-track nature of academia; and
Connectors are academics who perceive their roles to go

114 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
beyond the traditional boundaries of teacher and researcher.
Within this conceptualisation, third space academics would sit
in between the parameters of being Maverick and Connector
in terms of academic career types. Their career trajectories in
terms of what they teach and learn are boundaryless, but they
are bound by academic requirements to publish. Academics
in these roles also have postgraduate qualifications including
PhDs that might or might not be related to the discipline in
which they work. In some universities they are described as
Academic Developers, Senior Educational Developers,
Learning Design Developers, among others, and they have
teaching, service and research components attached to their
roles. Their pay is classified according to academic pay scales
and they follow academic promotion pathways. Given that
discipline-based academics view them as not being `real
academics' owing to the lack of industry knowledge about
what exactly they do, third space academics often find it hard
to have a sense of belonging to their professional identity and
to the higher education landscape.

       When I became a Lecturer, Learning Futures seven
       years ago, I struggled for the first four years when
       people asked me what my job was about. I would
       tell them that I am an academic in the faculty, but I
       don't lecture in any of the units and I work with
       academics more than students. They would give me
       a puzzled look. I would quickly add that I am in an
       academic role, and I have a PhD in another
       discipline although I help to support teaching and
       learning in a completely different discipline. Usually
       I would have lost them at `I work with academics'. It
       was just too hard. No one understood the entirety of
       my role. So, I started to tell them I am a third space
       academic. Believe me, I didn't do any research
       about this term when I first started using it - it just
       seemed apt for my role because I knew that if I
       called myself a third space professional, then
       discipline-based academics and those who aren't
       familiar with that term would not take me seriously.
       But even now, people don't get what exactly I do.
       What in the world does third space academic mean
       to the lay person? You are either an academic or
       you're not! What is this blurred space that is
       attached to the role and identity?

Polymathic nature of the role

Similar to third space academics, the work that third space
practitioners do can be categorised as unbounded. This

116 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
distinguishes them from other professional staff (Whitchurch,
2008). Aranee Manoharan (2020) states that third space
professionals are polymathic in their expertise. She argues
that third space professionals are able to navigate multiple
lifeworlds and disciplinary areas within a university. As such,
they understand different professional motivations and are
able to connect with a range of occupational dispositions.
Polymathic (Manoharan, 2020) means to go beyond a singular
specialisation and to function with multiple expertise. It is not
a `jack of all trades and master of none' proposition. On the
contrary, third space practitioners, owing to the broad areas of
teaching and learning projects that they work on, can have in-
depth knowledge of more than one area of specialisation.

Table 1 shows the similarities and differences in role titles held
by third space professionals and third space academics.
However, there will be differences in work experience,
understanding of position descriptions and expectations of
the output for third space professionals and third space
academics. Even within the same university, the roles of third
space professionals and third space academics are not
defined by a standard set of position descriptions and they
often play a variety of roles within their capacity of supporting
educational development. Hence, they are often expected to
have a variety of skills, knowledge and practice about
educational development, learning design, curriculum
development and assessment and rubrics design. In the
current higher education landscape, the lack of role clarity
regarding the differences in expectations and functions may
cause third space practitioners to become more liminal in
terms of their understanding of their roles and their own
professional identity.

118 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
       I was never trained to the job I am doing now. I
       picked up all the skills, all the good stuff about
       teaching and learning practices, over the last ten
       years as I worked my way across the realm of being
       a third space practitioner.

       In my current role, I am very much involved in the
       designing, developing and deciding side of teaching
       and learning practices. When I first started as an
       academic developer, I had no clue what an LMS was,
       what terms like pedagogy and andragogy meant;
       for that matter, I had no idea what a flipped
       classroom was. But I have been exposed to all of
       them as an academic. I just didn't know that what I
       was doing had names and theories attached to it.

       Now, I am a fully-fledged higher education
       academic strategist - well, here's an additional term
       to describe third space academics/practitioners like
       me, and I do call myself that in my LinkedIn profile
       description.

Heggart & Dickson-Deane (2022) present several skills for
learning designers that are applicable to third space
professionals. These skills include `prioritisation of
communication and collaboration skills; we need to be able to
make adaptive decisions, we need to be able to work in teams'.
Very often, third space practitioners are involved in projects
which are of differing scales. They can be short-term or one-off
projects such as learning transformation or implementing a
new learning management system (LMS), or they can be
ongoing projects within a faculty or school such as subject

development and/or professional development. Given the
various projects that third space practitioners manage, they
also need to know project management. They need to know
how to manage their workload ebbs and flows. These are skills
that are not picked up in courses but are only developed
during work placements. These are the skills that discipline
academics might not necessarily have in their skill set,
depending on their discipline, and that is what makes third
space academics less `academic' in their view.

       I am not sure if you have noticed that for those of us
       who have been to interviews for any third space
       roles, one of the questions will focus on how well we
       can deal with difficult academics. Here they are
       referring to discipline-based academics. I can't see
       you, but I know that a few of you will be nodding.
       They have asked this question in all the interviews
       that I went for. And initially, I went home wondering,
       why are they asking about difficult academics? I am
       an academic and I don't think I would be difficult.
       But when I took my first few roles, and started
       working with discipline academics, difficult
       academics made up a good proportion of the
       people I have worked with. These academics are not
       difficult people, but because they don't understand
       my role, and they don't understand how as a non-
       subject matter expert I can help them, they simply
       become difficult because they don't want someone
       like me telling them how to teach their units.

Third space practitioners have been described as being in a
liminal space within the higher education landscape as they
work together with academics and professionals (Veles et al.,
2019). Their roles are described as `liminal, binary/overlap or
borderless' (Veles et al., 2019, p. 77). Although Bhabha (1994)
uses the term `liminal space' to describe the feeling of
dislocation experienced by both slave and master - the
coloured and the white - purely in the context of post-colonial
national identity, this idea of being in a dislocated space
applies quite well to the liminal space occupied by third space
practitioners in the higher education landscape.

According to Bhabha (1994), a liminal space is the space
occupied in the stairways where it is neither at the top nor at
the bottom. Third space practitioners are entrapped by their
liminal space of not being a discipline-based expert when they
work across various faculties and schools. They are often
perceived to be `lesser' than discipline-based academics, and
university professional staff members and fail to see the value
of their expertise in the area of teaching and learning. This is
because they do not get the validation they deserve when
they engage in their area of expertise. It can also be argued
that discipline-based academics and professional staff
members feel a sense of surprise, and discomfort at times, to
find that their expertise and knowledge of subject matter
content can be further enhanced when they are supported by
third space practitioners to provide better teaching and
learning experiences for both academics and students. Hence,
these three sectors that currently exist in the higher education
workforce often find that it is never easy to work cohesively.
These different spheres `then behave in accordance with a
neurotic orientation creating the challenges and tensions in
the way they work together' (Bhabha, 1984).

       Just before the 2020 pandemic, two of my third
       space practitioner colleagues and I started
       autoethnographic research about assumptions
       pertaining to the role that we held and how that
       had an impact on the work that we did in the third

  Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding third

       space. This research has been accepted for print in
       the form of a journal article and we are working on
       the paper now. What brought about this research
       was the fact that we realised we are not always
       talking about the same thing when we talk about
       templates, or unit build, or terms like chunking or
       curriculum development. One of my colleagues
       came from a teaching background and the other
       came from an information systems background,
       and I am from a cultural studies and theatre studies
       background. Our exposure to learning design work
       has been varied.

       I have worked on several learning management
       systems, but it is not my forte. I like working on
       curriculum development and that too from a
       holistic point of view. I love conducting high-level
       mapping meetings and doing audits to facilitate
       whole-of-course approaches. My colleagues in the
       research team like to work on assessment design
       and improving the learning design on the learning
       management system. And we realised that we all
       thought of different things during team meetings
       even as we nodded away to indicate our
       understanding of who was going to do what and so
       on. All of us had the assumption that we were
       working from the same page at the same level. But
       when we came together, we were unpleasantly
       surprised to discover that we had misunderstood
       our understanding of common terms such as
       templates, or unit content, or constructive

126 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
       alignment for that matter. We started to see that we
       had gaps in our understanding of what we were
       meant to do owing to this assumption that we all
       did the same thing in a very similar manner. That
       led to us having frank conversations about what we
       actually thought we knew about each other's work
       and what we thought discipline academics thought
       of our work. This started a great research project
       which is hopefully going to come to fruition very
       soon.

Much of the tensions and challenges experienced by third
space practitioners occur because of the boundless nature of
their roles. The fact that they do not sit within an easily
recognised function in the higher education landscape
creates a lack of a sense of belonging. This lack of a sense of
belonging and displaced boundaries cause constant
challenges to navigate in terms of understanding who they
are in the workplace, the impact of their role and the work
they do, thereby affecting their professional identity.

There are two sides to this notion of assumptions causing the
lack of a sense of belonging and adding to the tensions and
challenges of being a third space practitioner. One is the
assumptions that other colleagues, both discipline-based
academics and professional staff, make about the roles of third
space practitioners. For example, we have established that
discipline-based academics are not always receptive to ideas
about teaching and learning advice or support given by third
space practitioners. This could be due to a lack of knowledge
about the roles third space practitioners perform and/or just
an aversion to ideas suggested by people outside the sphere

  Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding third
                                                   space academics/professionals | 127
of their professional/industry knowledge. Their expectation of
third space practitioners is someone who is technologically
savvy; someone who will upload their teaching content into
the learning management system and set up their
assessment submission pages and discussion areas. This is the
type of administrative support teaching academics need to
make their work easier. They do not perceive third space
practitioners to be a support to aspects relating to teaching
and learning pedagogies, strategies and frameworks.

The other assumption that causes tensions and challenges is
the perception held by third space practitioners about other
third space practitioners' skills and knowledge. As stated by
Manathunga (2007) and Manoharan (2020), we come from
different roles outside the discipline we work in, and we are
not all trained in the same way. However, owing to similar
titles and roles, it is easy for third space practitioners to
assume that there will be similarities in work style,
management of time, meeting delivery timelines and so on.
However, in many cases, there will be instances where
learning designers join a team of third space practitioners with
varied skill sets and experiences but are expected to work like
the rest of the team. These unspoken expectations and
assumptions can be the cause of much tension and
misunderstanding among third space practitioners
themselves, and also strengthen misconceptions held by
discipline-based staff members about the work third space
practitioners do.

Assumptions of third space practitioners regarding their role is
a great contributing factor to internal tension and confusion.
Many a time, for the third space practitioner, be they learning
designers or educational developers or third space academics,
it is imperative that their voice is heard during learning design
or the scoping of teaching and learning projects. They assume
that their voice will be taken seriously. However, in many real-

128 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
life scenarios, this assumption is not met by people they work
with. Discipline-based academics can hold preconceived ideas
about how they will be working on a project. They often want
their voice to be registered as a teaching and learning
specialist or expert. For example, they may know ways to
enhance engagement of students and motivate self-regulated
learning.

    Case study

     Andrew is a subject matter expert in the School of
     Business. He attends the first scoping meeting with
     the learning design team in his faculty. At the meeting,
     Sarah, who is a learning designer, asks him about the
     support that he needs from the learning design team.
     Andrew replies that he wants Sarah to make the
     PowerPoint slides look nicer. Sarah asks him what he
     means by `nicer'. Andrew replies that he inherited his
     teaching slides and that they are just too fancy, there
     are bits about the way the content appears that he
     doesn't understand, and that he wants them to look
     less boring. Sarah takes notes that he wants transitions
     removed, information on slide to be updated and icons
     and graphics to be reviewed. Sarah asks if he has had
     time to review the content within the slides and if he
     wants to move some of the content in his deck of 71
     slides per week to the LMS, for example. Andrew stares
     blankly and states that he has not been given time to

     review the slides or the content. All he wants are
     presentable teaching materials.

     can Sarah provide to Andrew? Use the Padlet activity

Role clarity of third space practitioners

Many institutions are still not clear about the role third space
practitioners play. For example, many third space practitioners
will have similar job titles across the university but do very
different work depending on a few factors such as:

   who they work with
   which faculty they work with
   their existing workload
   the team they are part of, whether they are with a central

      team or within a faculty, and last but not least
   which project they are part of.

It can be really frustrating to see this sort of disparity and to be
able to do nothing about it as some of these factors are
beyond the control of the third space practitioners.

For some third space practitioners, the lack of role clarity can
cause tensions. There will be this constant battle about how
much of the work they must do and where they draw a line
before they have stepped into the work area of either a
professional or an academic. For example, academics may
only expect learning designers to add a few visual elements to

130 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
their teaching content without having to go into detail about
the purpose of adding the elements. They may not have
considered the cognitive load or universal learning design
aspects of being inclusive and presenting accessible materials.
And there will be a few academics who are not keen to involve
third space practitioners in the design or development of
assessment, simply because they do not view them as being
subject matter experts. These barriers cause tensions in the
work third space practitioners do. One way to navigate this
sense of frustration is to understand what is causing some of
these tensions.

       I recall an instance where I was working in a team of
       four third space practitioners: two third space
       academics and two third space professionals. We
       had had several discussions among ourselves about

  Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding third
                                                    space academics/professionals | 131
       our roles. Apart from the contribution made by third
       space academics to research, there were no clear
       indicators as to what distinguished the role of the
       third space academics from that of the
       professionals. As a third space academic, I often lead
       in unit redevelopment projects and take on the role
       of academic lead. The expectation is that I manage
       the project in terms of timelines, academic
       correspondence, meetings, content delivery, liaising
       with a third party for multimedia creation and
       delivery, and overall quality assurance of the project.
       However, in my absence, the third space
       professionals who do the learning design part of the
       work in the project can also do all these functions.

       Given that we worked on several projects at a time,
       we sometimes crossed over into the territory of one
       another, and sometimes I had to work on
       developing content into the learning management
       system as well. So, the boundaries were blurred. And
       that led to many frank conversations as to what the
       value-add of our presence would be for each project.
       I looked across other faculties and central teams
       within the university for some form of role clarity
       regarding third space academics and I realised that
       the role can never be the same for all. The way we
       work on projects really depends on the project, the
       discipline, the timing, and the intended outcome of
       the project. Not one learning and teaching team
       functioned the same way across the university. And
       this lack of clarity in the role can cause a lot of

132 | Negotiating the assumptions and identity tensions surrounding
third space academics/professionals
       internal and external tensions for all third space
       practitioners involved. I have at many times
       wondered why my colleagues in other faculties had
       more academic freedom or why they had more
       university-wide exposure to projects. I haven't found
       the answers.

The role clarity and the recognition of third space practitioners
must come from the institution for a start. When the higher
education institution makes the objectives and role clarity
associated with third space practitioners clear to the
university, for both academic and professional roles, it
becomes easier to navigate the tensions and challenges that
exist in these roles. In certain universities, teaching teams
comprise discipline-based academics and third space
practitioners. In that case, it is clear who does what and who
oversees what and they work towards a common goal of
delivering purposeful teaching and learning practices.

       I have often been asked if I would move out of being
       a third space academic. I am not sure, to be frank.
       There are always times that make me want to leave
       this role and go to a more research-focused role. In
       that way, I can get papers published and at least see
       a promotion in my lifetime as an academic.
       However, the team in which I work is really good. I
       have developed lots of good relationships in the
       faculties that I have worked in, and I can learn
       constantly in this role. There is always something I
       pick up in terms of tech expertise, or teaching and
       learning practice, or a current innovative
       assessment project and so on. And I have learnt to
       navigate my tensions and challenges. I am still
       navigating them, but I think I have learnt to accept
       my role's limitations and growth. So the short
       answer to the question is that I really don't know.

The aim of this chapter was to highlight that the role of third
space practitioners - both academics and professionals - is not
an easy ride, just like other roles in the higher education
landscape. There are many factors contributing to the
displacement that practitioners in the third space might
experience and endure. However, not all is gloom and doom.
Understanding that this role is in a liminal space, and that it
will take time for perceptions, assumptions and role clarities to
be worked out, will make working in this role a very rewarding
experience and possibly create a much-needed sense of
belonging.

learning design:
Reimagining the
teaching team

KATRINA THORPE; SHAUN BELL; AND SUSAN PAGE

Introduction

University graduates' capacity to work effectively with
Indigenous Australians to enhance equity has been a growing
concern for more than two decades. In that time, a variety of
reports have argued that university graduates can contribute
to improved outcomes for Indigenous Australians but that
requires the development of specific skills and knowledges to
enable them to work effectively with Indigenous Australians
(Behrendt et al., 2012; Bradley et al., 2008; Indigenous Higher
Education Advisory Council, 2006; Universities Australia, 2011).
There are similarities with universities in other colonised
nations - for example, Canada (Battiste & Findlay, 2002), New
Zealand (Jones, 2009) and Bolivia (Drange, 2011) - where
inequity remains of concern. Concurrently, there has also been
a growing need for staff to engage with Indigenous
Knowledges and to develop cultural capability (Universities
Australia, 2017). However, few universities in Australia have
ready-made professional development resources to ensure
that academic staff are prepared to teach, supervise
Indigenous research or develop relevant curriculum.

In the absence of such professional development resources, in

142 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
2019, a team of scholars from the Centre for the Advancement
of Indigenous Knowledges (CAIK) at the University of
Technology (UTS), set out to develop a suite of microcredentials
to address this significant gap. The suite of microcredentials
consisted of three, 3 credit point online courses. Recognising
that the learner group would be scholars from our own and
other Australian universities, the CAIK team aimed to develop
innovative offerings that allowed learners to progress
independently and at their own pace. In this chapter we outline
our approach to developing the first microcredential,
Supervising Indigenous Higher Degree Research, through an
innovative collaboration between a group of discipline experts
working with a group of learning designers and media
specialists.

The CAIK is an Aboriginal-led centre focused on teaching and
research in Indigenous Studies. The curriculum development
project reflected the motivations of the CAIK scholars,
including the need to grow Indigenous student participation
in higher degree research (Moreton-Robinson et al., 2020). The
project was also supported through an institutional
Postgraduate Strategic Funding Program grant, reflecting the
university's commitment to a national policy focused on
technological advancement through retraining and upskilling
of the workforce (Productivity Commission, 2017) and a global
pressure to digitise teaching (Weitze, 2015). Supervising
Indigenous Higher Degree Research curates a program that
is relevant to the academic workforce, draws on the CAIK staff
research strengths and contributes to social change through
supporting excellence in Indigenous education.

The grant provided a modest amount of funding which
facilitated the employment of an Indigenous project manager,
but critically, provided access to a team of learning designers to
work with the CAIK scholars on the design and development of
the course. Vital to the successful development of Supervising

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 143
Indigenous Higher Degree Research, was the collaborative
effort of the CAIK's discipline experts and the instructional
design team. The learning design team supported the
innovation the CAIK staff were so keen to embrace, by ensuring
that the `content' knowledge was presented in interesting and
engaging ways, and the design of the online learning was
conducive to student learning.

Through a reflective process, we found the success of our
collaboration hinged on three key factors: trust, iterative
discussion, and the combined skills of scholars and learning
designers. Through this collaborative process we have
reimagined the composition of a teaching team, beyond the
traditional academic model. In the next section we provide
a brief contextual background to Indigenous research
supervision and showcase examples from the microcredential
to illustrate the vital roles of each team member, illuminating
the creative synergy which propelled the teaching
development and inspired learning well beyond the
curriculum content.

Context

Indigenous research supervision context:
Supporting Indigenous higher degree
research

In Australia, Indigenous research has rapidly grown into a
prominently scholarly field (Moreton-Robinson, 2013; Nakata,
2007; Rigney, 1999) and internationally (Brayboy & Chin, 2018;
Smith, 2012) and includes methodological, methods and
ethical dimensions. There is also a growing literature related to
the supervision of Indigenous research and Indigenous higher

144 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
degree research (HDR) students (Barney, 2013; Moodie et al.,
2018; Trudgett et al., 2016). Growing from concerns about the
exploitation of Indigenous peoples and communities in
research (Smith, 2012), along with sector wide concern about
the intertwined problem of needing to grow the Indigenous
researcher population and the lack of Indigenous supervisors
or non-Indigenous supervisors of Indigenous HDR students,
with the capability to supervise or undertake ethical
Indigenous research (Hutchings et al., 2019), there have been
increasing calls for professional development for staff
(Australian Council of Learned Academies [ACOLA], 2016;
Behrendt, 2012; Trudgett, 2014). Many scholars in Australian
universities have limited knowledge of Indigenous research,
having not engaged with Indigenous Studies as part of their
own disciplinary education. Other scholars have come to
Australia more recently from overseas and do not have the
disciplinary, cultural or social knowledge to work effectively
and ethically in this field. Developing the professional
capability of non-Indigenous students and supervisors of
higher degree research to `work with and for Indigenous
peoples' was therefore a significant ethical driver for
curriculum development in this area.

The CAIK team previously delivered workshops on supervising
Indigenous HDR candidates for university staff. The workshops
included content such as Indigenous research methodologies
and ethics, as well as best practice in supervising Indigenous
graduate students and Indigenous research. We began the
development of the subject imagining that we would develop
our existing materials into a more efficient and potentially
widely available offering.

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 145
The microcredential: Supervising
Indigenous Higher Degree Research

Supervising Indigenous Higher Degree Research is a fully
online asynchronous subject that runs over six weeks. It was
first offered in December 2020 and in 2023 was in its sixth
offering. To date, it has attracted 230 learners from 18
universities across Australia. In the first cohort, learners were
primarily academics working in the humanities, social sciences
and health sciences with a few from the information
technology disciplines. Since this time, we have been pleased
to witness academics enrolled from the full diversity of
disciplines represented in Australian universities. It has been
exciting to see writers, plant scientists, mechatronics
engineers, architects, musicologists, astrophysicists and a
gastronomy historian (to name a few) share knowledge and
experience throughout the course. A number of learners
recently moved to Australia for research and teaching positions
and were interested in engaging with Indigenous
communities but felt that Indigenous peoples and research
were invisible within their workplaces. The wide interest has
been particularly encouraging at a time when university funds
were generally limited at the end of a few challenging years
due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

We sought feedback early, frequently and often from our
learners during the initial development of the microcredential,
and continued this practice through subsequent course
offerings, making adjustments in areas such as assessment
based on learner feedback. What is most heartening is the way
in which our learners have come to embrace the approaches
described and modelled in the subject.

Dr Elizabeth Humphrys, one of our early learners who was

146 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
interested in both supervising and Indigenous teaching and
learning, shared the following:

We have growing numbers of Indigenous students at my
university and in my School, so I completed the course to be
better prepared if I was asked to contribute to the supervision
panel of an Indigenous student in the future. The course was
incredibly useful in terms of the content, and one of the best
organised and designed training courses I've done. Despite
having done methods subjects at postgraduate level, many
of the ideas in the course - in particular around quantitative
Indigenous methodologies - were new to me. The most
significant outcomes to date have been on my undergraduate
teaching and in assisting a non-Indigenous HDR student.

The course also inspired Elizabeth's own practice:

The section of the course on Indigenous quantitative
methodologies led me to enhance the `data lab' weeks in our
subject Global Economies, where we introduce students to the
basics of locating, using and analysing statistics. Last year I
developed an extra topic for students on responsible use of
data using some of the ideas from the microcredential (with
acknowledgment to CAIK), and Maggie Walter and Michele
Suina's 2019 paper `Indigenous data, indigenous
methodologies and indigenous data sovereignty'. Students
also read about 5D data and the CARE Principles for
Indigenous Data Governance. This year I introduced an
additional tutorial case study on Indigenous employment,
where students use a 5D lens to explore data gathering
possibility and policy options.

Elizabeth further explains how her learning impacted on her
supervisory practice:

          The course was also useful in assisting one of my HDR
          students to plan their research methodology and apply

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 147
          for ethics approval. Their study on climate justice
          movements in part involves interviews with Indigenous
          activists. While this student's co-supervisor works in
          Jumbunna, as a wholly non-Indigenous team I felt the
          course provided a better framework than I'd had
          previously for this supervision. The course assisted me in
          advising him on research design, the CARE principles,
          and needing to work with relevant Indigenous people
          during the design of the methodology and prior to
          submitting the ethics application.

          Overall, the course was really thought provoking, and I
          have returned to my notes from it several times over the
          last couple of years.

The curriculum and learning design team

The course design team included the Director at that time,
CAIK academic staff, a learning designer, other learning design
professional staff, their senior supervisor, and was further
supported by educational media technologists and producers.
We also had significant contributions from many of the CAIK
doctoral students. What is potentially unusual or unique about
this project was how the combined academic subject matter
expert team and core members of the learning design team
met frequently at regular intervals over the course of more
than 12 months, and how we created a relationship and
workflow that generated a high degree of mutual
understanding and collegial respect.

The three discipline experts and the project officer working

148 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
on the project were all Aboriginal. All had expertise and
experience in Indigenous Studies and Indigenous research. The
Aboriginal members of the team had been working together
for some time and were familiar with one another's strengths
and approaches to disciplinary theory. There were three staff
members on the learning design team: a Senior Learning
Designer, a Learning Designer and a Learning Technologist,
all of whom were non-Indigenous. While the learning design
team were experts in learning design, they had less experience
in Indigenous education. The authors of this chapter include
two of the academic collaborators (Thorpe and Page) and the
Learning Designer (Bell) who worked most closely on the
curriculum design project. As the project developed, it became
clear that for both the academics and learning designers this
was `uncharted ground'. This was the first time the academic
staff had experienced such intensive learning design support
in the development of teaching materials. The academics had
no idea of the learner engagement that was possible in the
online learning environment and the potential for this mode
of delivery in developing a community of learners. The learning
design collaborators had varied experience in Indigenous
education and the Indigenous protocols that the academics
almost reflexively brought to the project.

While the academic team had experience writing content for
subjects using the Canvas Learning Management System
(LMS), this was mainly for `flipped classroom' learning where
students engage in preparatory activities such as watching a
pre-recorded lecture or engaging in set readings ready to
come to class to participate in deeper discussion and
structured in-class activities to enhance and consolidate
learning. In designing for this microcredential, we were
working towards an exciting and engaging, asynchronous, fully
online learning experience, with optional `live and online' Zoom
seminars to supplement the learning in Canvas. The examples

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 149
shared below show how the team approach led to far more
ambitious outcomes.

We (the authors) analysed the conversational modes,
communicative practices, and analogue and digital workflows
that constituted the main forms of our team's engagement
over the course of the subject co-design in the context of
scholarship of theories and practices that support quality
online learning design. At the time of our co-design
engagement, our learning designers were supported by
research-based practices and guidelines through the UTS
Model of Learning (University of Technology Sydney, 2019) that
worked to maximise the presence of learning experiences that
are authentic, aligned, active and social. These guidelines
provided a strong foundation; however, anyone working with
Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property (Janke, 2021)
acknowledges that there are significant complexities in the
design of quality online learning (Phren et al., 2020) in relation
to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, peoples,
knowledges and histories. Some of our team of designers had
prior experience in this domain at other institutions and had
some understanding and training of practices and approaches
that can better support such projects. As our further discussion
highlights, such understanding or adherence to available
protocol guidelines does not replicate authentic, consistent
and sustained collaboration between diverse members (or
stakeholders) of the academic and professional staff on the
project, or the specific experience and knowledge of an
Indigenous-led unit. Our reflection identified a number of
practices we undertook that we argue contributed significantly
to our success, including a `flat' team structure, common team
understandings and understanding of wider university
structures. A `structural' or organisational approach within the
co-design team meetings that was arguably `flat', enabled the
sharing by multiple voices and experiences.

150 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
Flattening the hierarchy

This lack of hierarchy within the group led to sustained
synchronous and asynchronous feedback discussions relating
to learner experience, content design and presentation, as well
as issues surrounding `modality', tone and voice. These
collaborative discussions were enabled by strong rapport with
honest, deliberate, and kind interactions between team
members. In addition, all the people who worked on the
project felt a strong sense of personal and professional learning
through this multiskilled and multidisciplinary engagement
and academic and professional staff collaboration (Cheek, 2021;
Osguthorpe, 2007). While our course design team were not
aware of this at the time, the work by scholars like Osguthorpe
and colleagues (2018) articulates an ethical or moral imperative
in learning design, with models that enable transformative
learning at all levels.

Seeking permissions and protocols

A `common point of understanding' among core team
members were the additional requirements around seeking
permission for materials used in the module, respecting
cultural and intellectual authority and ownership (Janke, 2021).
Some non-Indigenous team members had some specific
training and experience and understood concepts like
Indigenous Cultural and Intellectual Property rights, and they
worked with their non-Indigenous colleagues to understand
the `stakes' by exploring resources available through reputable
protocol documents, (Australia Council for the Arts, 2019), but
they could not rely on this knowledge in place of deliberate
discussion with co-design partners. This checking by the non-
Indigenous team members even where they had existing

 Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 151
knowledge is a practical demonstration of cultural humility
(Burgess et al., 2022; Cox & Simpson, 2020) that aims to `develop
and maintain respectful processes and relationships based on
mutual trust' (p. 2). Non-Indigenous people acting like experts
in Indigenous matters can often be abrasive for Indigenous
colleagues, so `checking in' is one of the elements contributing
to the development of trust.

Rapport and reciprocity

It is well recognised in the literature that relationship building,
rapport and reciprocity are important when working and
researching with Aboriginal communities and this can take
time (Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Studies, 2020; NSW Department of Community
Services, 2009). Indeed, taking time and providing the
appropriate resources are essential to ensuring successful
outcomes; however, one of the common criticisms is that
universities do not adequately accommodate this vital work
(Smith et al., 2017). The broader university environment
recognised our project's unique status as an Indigenous-led
project with a goal to exemplify best practice in respectful use
of Indigenous cultural and intellectual property. There was a
clear recognition that this approach necessitated different and
specific ways of working, including a higher degree of
consultation and collaboration with stakeholders including
students, artists, external academics and other experts.
Supportive management within faculty and the learning
design unit, including learning design supervisors who were
across issues related to ownership, copyright and permissions,
provided support within the project to allow for practical issues
like long lead-times to commence discussions with experts
and figures external to the university. As we discuss below, we
had support to engage media producers and design experts

152 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
who actively changed their processes to ensure our efforts to
enhance the presentation of content and create interactive
multimedia were respectful of issues related to cultural
sensitivity and appropriateness.

Enacting the curriculum development
collaboration

We have discussed the way in which our team structure and
institutional context might have contributed to, or enabled,
a co-design partnership that has produced a quality online
learning experience with an enduring impact on learners.
What enabled this in practice was how institutional supports,
moral/ethical investment in the work, specific experience and
expertise, and interpersonal and individual capacity building
all came together in the specific design of explicit `learning
moments' or objects within the Canvas LMS (see Figures 1 and
2 below). Our workflow built on existing co-design models and
learning approaches within UTS and more broadly, and
capitalised on a shared understanding of other common
academic production workflows, but was most significantly
enhanced by a `dialogic model' exemplified by the CAIK
academic team - a kind of open, collaborative, deliberative
conscious discussion - as well as specific design knowledges
of core team members. In practice, this often meant an `all in'
approach to the collaborative authoring and design of pages,
as we've outlined.

The examples below are from one of the pages within Module
2 (related to Indigenous research ethics) of the Canvas LMS
subject that helps highlight three important things we learnt
during this project, which are: (1) the importance of trust; (2)
the value of conversation and iteration; and (3) the strength of
a multidisciplinary team.

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 153
The importance of trust

The two figures below show how one page developed over
time. In Canvas, you can create pages through a combination
of rich-text and HTML formatting. The intuitive nature of the
platform meant that the learning design team invited our
academic partners to draft directly on the Canvas page,
fostering opportunities for the academic staff to learn and
develop digital skills in a supported environment (Huizinga et
al., 2014). Through this process, the team built the trust that
became a critical feature of the course development and which
is so important for success in collaborative relationships (Bond-
Barnard et al., 2018; Buanduchi, 2013). One of the useful features
of Canvas is that it is very hard to `break' something, and it
has robust versioning abilities which means it is also hard to
lose your work. The CAIK team took to Canvas with gusto, but
that does not mean it was always easy-going. Figure 1 shows
where we started in July of 2020, while Figure 2 shows a `final
version' of the page finalised in November. We authored this
page through 20 iterations of distinct edits, involving in-page
design, and many hours of online video discussion between
learning designers and academics as changes were made to
this single page.

We include this example for several reasons. Firstly, because
the text from the NHMRC Ethical conduct in research with
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Peoples and
communities: Guidelines for researchers and stakeholders
covers fundamental knowledge for researchers and research
supervisors working in health-related disciplines, and outlines
ways of thinking about ethical research guidelines more
broadly. Secondly, because we collectively found the
development of this page content challenging as the material
covered is important, but also somewhat `dry' and policy-
driven. The desire to move beyond the presentation of content
to learner engagement led to the pedagogical choice to use
a variety of media. The `After' page includes a short video,
interactive elements and a reflective task, as well as a link to

156 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
the original document to ensure learners could locate the
document for future reference. There is ample evidence to
support the improvements in student efficacy through
providing opportunities for learning across multiple media
modalities (Wayan, 2020), and providing learning that includes
a degree of meaningful interactivity, choice, and agency
(Dailey-Herbert, 2018). Those engaged in design work can easily
find helpful checklists and protocols to unpack the selection of
meaningful technology-enhanced interactivity.

Every learning design project has its challenges. Occasionally,
these arise from a disconnect between the academic and the
learning designer and team because they may have a different
vision for a specific resource, a page or whole subject! We
found that the only way around this was to `talk it out', and
a strong working relationship might be one of the `hidden
ingredients' in a successful course design build (Mason &
Lefrere, 2003).

The value of conversation and iteration

This leads, to the second point, which is the value of iteration
through ongoing conversation. This `teacher talk' has been
identified as important to successful design collaborations
(McKenney et al., 2016). In our case, this was via weekly
meetings and an agreed mode of communication in the form
of colour coded notes in the pages themselves - a bit like when
you collaborate on a document. This workflow was arguably
also very `flat' in structure: no single team member's comments
had any more or less prominence, and all comments were
visible to the whole team. Everyone worked together on the
pages, which resulted in a very clean and polished final
presentation, but it also meant a sometimes-messy process of
drafting.

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 157
We were able to work through the challenges related to the
NHMRC and other pages as we'd already developed a strong
and collaborative basis of trust because of our collective
response to design challenge we faced earlier in the project.

Early in our design journey we found ourselves needing to
down tools and talk through one such issue. Our team of
multidisciplinary designers had collaborated on an interactive
resource introducing learners to concepts of a `Welcome' and
`Acknowledgment of Country', which we made using a
common rich media authoring tool, using a standard
production workflow. The design concept for the artefact was
simple, comprising an engaging visual background with a
clickable object that revealed text content set against an
illustrated background depicting Australian flora - too easy,
right?

We were relatively early in the co-design of this subject, and
relationships between the CAIK team and the learning design
team were still forming. To say our team of designers were
keen to impress is an understatement - internally, we knew
this project had the potential to garner attention from senior
figures in other parts of our university, and our designers
working across early phases of the project also had a degree
of personal investment. We'd already had several conversations
and had some material in draft form, but we'd yet to `crack' the
overarching shape of the microcredential subject.

This is fairly common when designing a new learning
experience with a new group of co-designers, and as part of
our design process, we aim to rapidly design, prototype and
implement educational resources to `get us into the drafting',
with the goal of creating familiarity and comfort with the
authoring tools and process, and then iterating and refining
the materials once deployed. This workflow can sometimes be
at odds with the `durations' and timelines of the other kinds

158 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
of work that make up the workloads of our main co-design
partners, working academics: teaching and publishing.

In this example, the result of our different approaches led to the
selection of a visual element - a design featuring a flower, the
Gymea lily - that was not just inappropriate, but held important
cultural meanings that the learning designers were unaware
of - In this instance, we did not take the time to talk through
the design, and we rushed into production, hoping to spur our
new co-design partners into activity, without being conscious
of how our design choice was playing out in discussions within
the subject matter expert team.

What did this experience teach us?

   It is vital that learning designers work with their expert co-
      designers to understand the appropriateness of their
      learning design approach, especially when working with
      cultural content that carries a specific, sacred, or sensitive
      meaning.

   There is a wealth of protocol and guideline documents to
      support designers who are unsure of issues of process, or
      procedure. These resources will help, but trust and
      courtesy are arguably more important because protocols
      or guidelines cannot possibly provide the means to
      understand all situations, and should not be used in place
      of honest and direct conversation with co-designers. You
      cannot replace or replicate knowledge and mutual
      respect.

   It was not all bad news: this experience provided our
      academic co-designers their first real sense of the power
      of design and the `wow' factor and wonder that well-
      designed interactive learning can create.

The value of the multidisciplinary team

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 159
including learning designers, teachers and
academics

The importance of conversation leads to the third point: a
strong multi-disciplinary team can make all the difference in
the process of designing a good learning sequence. There is
now a growing body of research that highlights how differing
team structures and compositions can enable design through
`ill-structured' or poorly understood design problems and
contexts (Ertmer, 2008; Pan & Thompson, 2009; White et al.,
2021). There is also a growing interest in the affordances
provided by `third space' education professional staff who bring
their own expertise, and share common understandings or
motivations around work culture and goals with academic staff
(White et al., 2021).

Our project had the typical issues of overworked dedicated
academic staff managing multiple competing imperatives, on
top of commencing right at the start of the COVID-19
pandemic and our university's rapid transition to fully online
learning. We often met online over Zoom in between many
other Zoom meetings. There was also a degree of
experimentation and uncertainty around the scope and
ambition for the subject. We worked online, at first on
documents, and then in our LMS. Most importantly, though,
we engaged in a kind of relationship of mutual teaching and
learning. While our learning designers had some awareness of
some of the issues and concepts our microcredential subject
engages with, our academic co-design partners did need to
spend time to educate our learning design team so they could
understand enough to be able to effectively support our goal.
At the same time, our academic team were relatively unfamiliar
with the affordance, possibilities and limitations of the online
learning environment. Our learning design team spent time
engaging in forms of design thinking, prototyping and

160 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
troubleshooting to create activities, design resources and
engaging presentation of knowledge, as well as developing
systems to enable the smooth delivery of the completed
learning experience.

This dynamic resulted in meetings focused on content
creation, alongside discussions on the best ways to present
and deliver this content through digital and online learning
techniques. The academic team would engage in theoretical
discussions in an inclusive manner with the designers, inviting
us into the discussion and even considering some of the points
we raised deriving from our experience as learners of this
knowledge. There are ample accounts of negative dynamics
between academics and learning designers, often centred
around authority, positionality and our different roles and
drivers related to the creation of a learning experience or
product (Tay et al., 2023). It is common for learning designers
in Australian higher educational settings to be employed as
professional staff, although many also have teaching or
academic experience, or hold relevant qualifications.

In some instances, the specific experience of our learning
designers is that they often must take on the unpleasant role
of managing deadlines or chasing academic co-designers for
their contributions - the worst outcome being when a co-
design partnership is undermined or forestalled by disengaged
or oppositional team members, potentially using their
authority and position in a way that invalidates more junior
and precarious team members (Tay et al., 2023).This was not
the case in this project where mutual respect for different
competencies, skills and knowledges created a collaborative
and iterative workflow that enabled the production of highly
engaging and well- authored learning sequences.

We can see this successful co-authoring in the final version
of the NHMRC page introduced earlier. There are some good

 Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 161
learning design elements on the page. For example, we
present a `choice' for learners by providing optional links to
more information (e.g., to the NHMRC website); we also
`chunked' information in different formats like videos, and
through the `explore' interactive, which was made using a tool
called genial.ly. There is also a `scaffolding' activity that
progressively moves students to a stronger understanding of
the material through the `read, consider, compare' activity
using HTML layout, an H5P document tool and a Canvas social
poll.
A specific example can be seen in Figure 3 below, also from the
NHMRC page in Module 2. The creation of this image involved
the whole team discussing issues related to content
organisation, authenticity of imagery and design, and ease of
access and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
standards. Everyone on the team brought a perspective, and
the result is an inviting presentation of the content.

In designing the interactive, our interactives expert found that
the key was chunking the sections and deciding what
knowledge was at the core of all the information in what is a
very lengthy document. As for the visuals, we discussed how
we already had a style guide for this specific suite of courses
developed over many months, and it was important to use
this consistently to keep the course site clean and matching
the existing style. In our context at UTS, these style guides

Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team | 163
are typically `uncomplicated' and built out from stock assets.
In the specific context of our project, we required a greater
deal of collaboration with Indigenous Australian artists and
knowledge holders and practitioners, and as much as we could
we engaged external collaborators and licensed works. This
was not without complication, and required ongoing
conversations with the artists to ensure we engaged in
respectful repurposing of their work. In terms of the example
in Figure 3, this interactive collaboration between the design
team and the discipline experts led to excellent design and
content - which learners found deeply engaging. Dr Natalie
Morrison from Western Sydney University noted:

`This course has been exceptional. The flow, the materials and
all the presentation aspects are second to none. I will have
to rethink everything I do in my teaching practices - both to
reflect what I am learning here by intent (course materials) but
also that which is unintentional (the delivery format).'

Conclusion

While there has been much discussion of the digital revolution,
the scramble to switch to largely online learning in Australian
schools and universities at the beginning of the COVID-19
pandemic would suggest, at the level of the classroom at least,
that there has been less a revolution and more an intermittent
evolution. The need for skills development is clear (Sousa &
Rocha, 2019), but that development will require trust, ongoing
dialogue and, vitally, access to multidisciplinary teams. Skills
development for academic staff is important; however, there

164 | Indigenous-led learning design: Reimagining the teaching team
are specialist skills that for the sake of efficiency and
effectiveness require learning designers to be integral parts
of a teaching team. There is ample opportunity to increase
efficiency and effectiveness through the exploration of
different design models and team structures. As our
experience has shown, combining academic and professional
staff members, and encouraging the co-design of subjects and
enabling their co-development with support through funding
models, staffing resources and time, not only enabled the
creation of a unique, highly regarded and successful fully
online learning experience, it also generated significant
capacity for individuals and institutions who are further
supporting specifically Indigenous ways of learning and
teaching across the sector. Such is the strength of this
collaboration that we authors have come together to
document the journey and outcome of this Aboriginal-led co-
design process. Alongside this, we've seen substantial capacity
and knowledge growth of online learning approaches and
methodologies in our academic and professional staff, as well
as the learners who have undertaken the subject.

in learning

JOHN VULIC

Understanding your learners

       When I was in kindergarten I noticed that when the
       teacher would ask a question, children with their
       hands up wouldn't get asked to respond. The
       teacher had a tendency to pick children who didn't
       have their hands up to attempt the question. As a
       five-year-old, I figured out how to avoid
       embarrassment by raising my hand for every
       question, `gaming the system' in a way. On the rare
       chance that I was picked to answer, I had a back-up
       plan. I would say `I forgot' and escape through the
       laughter of the class. Reflecting on my schooling,
       Maths was always a subject where I gamed. With
       teacher-centred instructional approaches
       consistently used, the combination of possibly
       missing a key step, not understanding a procedure,
       not wanting to hold up the class, and not wanting to
       show that I didn't know something, meant I needed
       to game to get through each class. This was by
       pretending I was following along, nodding with
       agreement, and creative doodling penmanship.

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 175
       However, it didn't necessarily have to be this way.
       Reflecting on my schooling I'm left wondering
       whether some of my teachers knew this about me
       and what they could have possibly done to help me
       see myself differently in order to get the best out of
       my schooling.

At the core of effective learning design is a deep understanding
of students. It is crucial to recognise and address the unique
experiences, needs, and identities of all students to foster their
well-being and sense of belonging (OECD, 2023, p. 29).
Embracing diversity is essential for creating an inclusive
educational environment where every student feels
recognised and valued. Learning designers and educators
must acknowledge the significant impact of culture on
learning and adapt their teaching methods to align with the
sociocultural contexts and perspectives of ethnically diverse
students (Gay, 2018, p. 52). By understanding these
backgrounds, learning designers and educators can devise
materials and methods that resonate with students, effectively
bridging cultural and socio-economic divides. This approach
aims to help students see themselves in what they learn,
enhancing their sense of belonging.

In this chapter I'll introduce you to some inspirational
educators based in the United States that I have had the
pleasure of working with through a 21st Century Partnership for
STEM Education project titled Mathematical Thinkers Like Me.
The strategies and advice from these educators can be used
by both learning designers and educators in the design of their
learning. My first interview with Annie Fetter introduces you to

176 | Designing for equity in learning
a simple yet powerful technique to start understanding your
students - Notice and Wonder (Ray, 2013, pp. 42-55).

Interview with Annie Fetter

Annie Fetter is a Mathematics and Education specialist in the
Philadelphia area. Annie has been a key figure in formalising
the Notice and Wonder routine. This routine asks students
what they notice about something and what they wonder
about it. Student insights can be leveraged by the teacher to
guide the discussion towards critical thinking and deeper
understanding of the subject matter. This approach fosters a
student-centred learning environment, where curiosity and
inquiry drive the learning process. The routine is inclusive,
allowing all students, regardless of their skill level, to participate
and contribute. It also values all student observations and
questions, which can boost confidence and encourage
participation from students who might be hesitant to engage.
The routine also provides teachers with insights into students'
thinking processes, helping them to identify potential
misconceptions and knowledge gaps, and ultimately, help
them to understand students.

Designing Notice and Wonder

In 2011 at a National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)
Ignite Talk, Annie shared an anecdote to illustrate the Notice
and Wonder routine. In the clip Annie describes an experience
of sitting on an aeroplane next to a child and their father. Annie
noticed the child continuously asking his father questions
about what he saw out of the plane window, to which the
father would reply directly. Annie intervened at one point while

the father was distracted by encouraging the child to think
and express his thoughts on what he saw. This led to more
original and personal insights from the child, and the child's
father ultimately realising the impact of this approach. Annie
recalls the father saying that the Notice and Wonder routine
`really made my son think'. When applied to teaching subjects
such as maths, the technique demonstrates that even students
who supposedly `cannot do maths' can come up with insightful
mathematical observations when encouraged to explore and
think critically. Annie advocates for teachers to broadly adopt
this technique, emphasising its ability to leverage what
students notice and wonder, ultimately enhancing their
learning and understanding.

What issue does noticing and wondering
address?

       Annie: So school in general is not very great at
       nurturing and valuing students' ideas. And math is
       like the worst, right? It's like, you have to be able to
       replicate this set of things that somebody, white and
       male, figured out a while ago. And that's not entirely

178 | Designing for equity in learning
       true, but I think that's people's impression of it. And
       so what do we do to flip math around? How can you
       change math?
       Imagine in English class, even if you don't like it,
       occasionally you're asked to write about something
       that comes from you, from within you. Like tell a
       story of what you did over summer. You're bringing
       `you' to that classroom, and that matters, what you
       have to say matters. And in math class, that doesn't
       always happen. So the idea of starting off,
       particularly any scale of things, a unit, a lesson, a
       moment, by asking kids what they notice about
       something and what they wonder about it, that can
       really change how kids look forward to participating
       in that learning community.

What does Notice and Wonder look like in the
classroom?

       Annie: Let's assume that I'm going to ask kids to
       notice and wonder on paper for a few minutes
       because they're old enough to write things down,
       pick an age, say sixth grade. And then I might ask
       them to talk at their table and share what are three
       things you all noticed and three things you all

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 179
       wondered that you would like to share with the
       group.

       And then when they share those, I'm just gonna go
       around and ask every table, okay, table one, what's
       one thing you noticed? And I'm gonna write it on
       the board. Table two, what's one thing? So I'm
       assuming every table has things to share. Everyone
       has something to say, and I'm gonna go around
       once or twice, depending on the thing, and then say
       like, okay, does anyone have anything that we don't
       have up here that you think we should have.

       But I'm also not reacting to any of their ideas,
       because I don't want to judge them. I don't want to
       be like, oh, Marissa, you're really awesome. And then
       go like, John, what have you got? And John's sitting
       there going like, I don't have anything awesome. I'm
       not going to say anything. So you just want to go
       like, oh, thank you. Inside you're going like, that is
       awesome, or that is not as much as I hoped for, but
       you don't, it's all like, take it in. And write down
       exactly what they said, because another thing we do
       in math is we the grownups, tend to reword things
       to make them mathier or more concise or more
       something, because we think that's important. And
       all that's telling the kid is that their ideas aren't good
       enough, and that I have to fix them so that we can
       move on. So don't do that. Write down exactly what
       they said, don't judge what they said.

       If they say too much, you don't want to write it
       down, you say to them, could you say that shorter so

180 | Designing for equity in learning
       I can write it down? Put the onus on them to
       change their ideas. And then things that they
       wonder are really things that they wonder. But it's
       the same thing. Don't judge, write them down.
       If kids say a wrong thing, you just write it down. It's
       not big, you know, everyone's worried that, oh,
       there's a wrong answer on the board. First off,
       there's research that shows it's not that important.
       And secondly, it'll probably police itself out by the
       end. Like someone will go like, well, I noticed this
       but I also noticed that that doesn't agree with the
       other thing that someone else noticed. Or someone
       will say, Oh, those two things don't agree. Or some
       kid will go like, can I change mine?

How does Notice and Wonder change teaching
practice?

       Annie: I'm working with a high school teacher this
       year. And then she watched that video of the kid on
       the plane. She says a thousand times, but I think she
       was exaggerating. And then she tried to notice and
       wonder with her kids. And what happened was her
       kids were amazing and it could have ended there,
       but what happened was it made her much more
       open to notice and wonder, as a teacher who used

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 181
       to tell kids what to do and expect them to do it. And
       I suspect she was probably pretty decent at that, like
       a very traditional teacher model.
       She became much more open to their ideas and
       ended up doing much more facilitating than telling,
       because she's like, the kids can do the work. And so
       she describes herself as now a completely different
       teacher. Just trying noticing and wondering was like
       the catalyst that moved her from here to there. You
       know, it's not the only thing, it's not the only change
       she made, but she made that change and then
       things snowballed from there. And she's like, I'm a
       completely different teacher. And she was, I don't
       know, a 10, 15 year teacher at that point. So that's a
       big shift for someone to make.
       And I think just for kids to feel that they have ideas
       that someone's listening to, and for the teachers to
       elicit their ideas and start listening to them, and
       then getting better at hearing them, and valuing
       them, and then actually using them, that's a big
       change in a classroom. And I know a lot of people
       who say that it changed their careers. Like it saved
       their careers because of that shift in their room.

Thoughts on Notice and Wonder

Implementing the Notice and Wonder routine as a learning
designer or educator involves several key steps that are
straightforward to implement. First, identify the learning

182 | Designing for equity in learning
objectives you aim to achieve through this approach. Next,
select relevant content or topics and design observation
prompts to stimulate students' curiosity and observation skills.
Ensure your design of facilitated observation sessions also
prompts students to articulate their questions and curiosities
based on their observations, engage in discussions to explore
connections and deepen understanding. The design of
facilitated sessions should also provide guidance and feedback
throughout the process, and include follow-up activities to
extend learning. Building in reflective prompts for students to
reflect on the effectiveness of the routine and encouragement
for students to transfer their skills to other contexts may also be
beneficial.

Some key benefits stood out from my chat with Annie on the
Notice and Wonder routine. In particular, the routine serves as
a pivotal tool in promoting engagement, critical thinking and
deeper understanding in students. As Ray (2013, p. 55) notes,
`Learning depends on mulling, connecting, wondering, and
repeatedly thinking about, and noticing and wondering
enables this to take hold and blossom'. Consequently, I see
potential for the broader application of the routine across
domains outside of mathematics teaching. For designers and
educators, this method also promotes inclusivity, as it allows
for participation and contribution from all students. Each
student's contributions can build towards a complete
understanding of the problem (Ray, 2013, p. 55). Furthermore,
this routine also helps to shift the role of educators from merely
delivering information to actively promoting students'
engagement with ideas (Ritchhart et al., 2011, p. 26), something
learning designers also need to keep in the forefront of their
practice. Thus, this technique is not just a teaching strategy for
designers and educators to utilise, but a facilitator of a more
engaging, thoughtful, and inclusive learning environment.

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 183
Being culturally responsive

Cultural responsiveness in education can be defined as the
practice of `using the cultural knowledge, prior experiences,
frames of reference, and performance styles of ethnically
diverse students to make learning encounters more relevant
and effective to them' (Gay, 2018, p. 36). When reflecting on my
schooling, there were what I would term tokenistic gestures
to promote cultural responsiveness. Examples include
celebrating annual events, such as International Day, where
students could bring in and share food from a different culture.
However, beyond these isolated events, school really did
nothing to integrate cultural awareness into the everyday
curriculum and address the deeper issues of inclusion, equity
and respect for diverse cultures. The history, literature and
perspectives taught in the classroom remained predominantly
centred on the dominant culture, with little to no exploration
of other worldviews, histories, or contributions of students from
diverse cultural backgrounds. Growing up as a child of post-war
migrants, I often felt out of place at school, feeling that I didn't
truly belong there. This was true for me in maths, a subject
commonly seen as culturally impartial and objective, which
leads to questions about how teachers could broadly integrate
culturally relevant teaching methods (Matthews, 2018).

In multicultural societies, classrooms can be seen as melting
pots of diverse cultures, languages and experiences. This
diversity isn't just a demographic fact; it's a valuable resource
that can enrich learning for everyone. The cornerstone of
capitalising on this diversity is cultural responsiveness, being
able to design for learning experiences that `teach to and
through' the strengths of these students (Gay, 2018, p. 36).
Instead of seeing cultural diversity as a hurdle, it's viewed as an
asset that enriches education. This is crucial because students
may face negative learning consequences if they feel

184 | Designing for equity in learning
compelled to hide or downplay their identity, culture or
language (Nieto & Bode, 2018, p. 135). This mindset shift has far-
reaching effects on how teaching and learning take place. For
learning designers and educators, this extends beyond merely
recognising different cultures to actively integrating them into
the curriculum, design of resources, activities, teaching
methods and classroom practices.

The impact of this approach can be significant. Students who
see their cultures and backgrounds represented in learning
materials may experience a greater sense of belonging and
validation. This can positively influence their engagement,
participation and academic performance. However, achieving
genuine cultural responsiveness involves more than surface-
level changes. It requires ongoing self-reflection, professional
development and collaboration with students and
communities. As Hollie (2018, p. 18) emphasises, cultural
responsiveness `begins with you and where you are in your
heart and mind'. It involves questioning existing norms and
being open to deep, transformative change within educational
institutions. Additionally, it needs to acknowledge the inherent
complexity of diverse learning environments, such as concepts
like hybridity, recognising that students may identify with
multiple identities beyond race and ethnicity (Nieto & Bode,
2018, p. 139), and Intersectionality, a way of understanding how
different aspects of a person's identity, such as race, gender
and class, combine to create unique experiences of oppression
and privilege (Zack, 2024). In essence, cultural responsiveness
is not just a technique; it's a philosophy. It embodies a steadfast
belief in the value of each student's cultural heritage, coupled
with a commitment to ensuring that this value is
acknowledged, celebrated and woven into the fabric of
education.

My interview with Melynee Naegele introduces you to some
innovative and practical approaches that help learning

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 185
designers and educators to provide a rich understanding of
students, their culture and lives.

Interview with Melynee Naegele

Melynee Neagele is an accomplished middle-school maths
teacher in Oklahoma. Melynee stands out for her dedication
and inspirational teaching methods. Renowned for her
commitment to education, Melynee utilises an extensive array
of pedagogical tools to effectively engage and educate her
students. Her approach to teaching is characterised by
innovation and adaptability, allowing her to meet the diverse
learning needs of her students. Melynee's passion for teaching
and her ability to inspire young minds make her a remarkable
educator, widely respected in her field for her contributions
and the positive impact she has on her students. This part of
the chapter unpacks just a few of Melynee's tools.

Designing 4Hs of Belonging Centred Math
Instruction

One tool that Melynee has in her pedagogical toolbox is the
4Hs of Belonging Centred Math Instruction: Home, Hobbies,
Hopes and Heritage (4Hs), a heuristic and partner activity for

186 | Designing for equity in learning
students (Matthews, 2018). The heuristic presents four key areas
where students can find meaningful connections. This is
delivered via an interest interview questionnaire. These
questions encompass: `Home', covering regular activities and
the characteristics of their home environment, like cooking
or family interactions; `Hobbies', including personal activities
done weekly, such as playing sports or using smartphone apps;
`Hopes', related to individual aspirations, interests, or goals, like
career ambitions or financial management; and finally,
`Heritage', which connects students to their cultural traditions
or communities, aimed to instill a sense of pride through
elements like local heroes or historical figures in their
community. The questionnaire is followed by a partner activity
interest interview, which serves as a complementary tool to
the 4H framework. These interviews utilise the collective 4H-
related knowledge and experiences of the students in a class,
guiding the development of lessons that are deeply connected
to these 4H elements. Matthews (2018) also highlights
establishing trust and showing a real interest in the students'
lives as key factors that enhance the effectiveness and
genuineness of 4Hs, and essential for integrating students'
cultural perspectives into educational planning. With 4Hs,
students are encouraged to express their views on their culture
and interests from their own perspective, rather than relying
on assumptions that might perpetuate stereotypes.

How do you introduce the 4Hs?

       Melynee: During the meet-the-teacher night, I
       distributed the 4Hs questionnaire to parents,

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 187
       though not every family returned it. I explained to
       parents that understanding their child's interests
       and experiences through the questionnaire would
       enable me to personalise and humanise the
       learning experience.
       In class, I dedicate time to discussing the 4Hs with
       students, emphasising the relevance of math to
       their lives. We explore various methods for
       completing the questionnaire, including Google
       Slides, paper, or voice recordings.
       After collecting their responses, I compile them into
       a list and align them with curriculum standards. This
       snapshot of my class's interests allows me to
       integrate relevant examples into my lesson
       planning, ensuring that math concepts resonate
       with students.
       For instance, students interested in music can
       explore mathematical concepts like ratios and rates
       through musical notation. When planning lessons, I
       refer to this list to ensure that I incorporate students'
       interests into the curriculum.
       During class discussions, I reference the information
       gathered from the 4Hs questionnaire to reinforce
       students' connections to the material. This
       intentional approach helps students see themselves
       in the math curriculum, fostering engagement and
       understanding.

188 | Designing for equity in learning
Thoughts on the 4Hs of Belonging Centred
Math Instruction

The 4Hs of Belonging Centred Math Instruction presents a
valuable technique for both students and learning designers
and educators, to enhance the educational experience through
personal relevance and cultural integration. For students, this
method offers a platform to express their individuality and
connect their learning to personal aspects of their lives - Home,
Hobbies, Hopes and Heritage. This connection not only makes
learning more engaging but also aims to foster a deeper
understanding and retention of mathematical concepts by
relating them to familiar contexts. It empowers students by
valuing their backgrounds and aspirations, which can be
crucial for supporting self-esteem and motivation.

For learning designers and educators, the 4Hs technique
provides invaluable insights into students' lives, facilitating the
creation of more tailored and effective lesson plans. Dr Jamaal
Matthews in his 2018 working paper, `on mindset and practices
for re-integrating "belonging" into mathematics instruction`
(pp. 12-17), provides a clear and comprehensive justification and
methodology for implementing the 4Hs. By understanding
students' environments, interests, goals and cultural
backgrounds, learning designers and educators can design
and deliver lessons that are not only educational but also
empathetic and inclusive. This approach aligns with culturally
responsive pedagogy, grounded in four core pillars of practice
- "teacher attitudes and expectations, cultural communication
in the classroom, culturally diverse content in the curriculum
and culturally congruent instructional strategies" (Gay, 2018, p.
53). Furthermore, the emphasis on building trust and genuine
interest in students' lives strengthens the teacher-student
relationship, creating a more positive and conducive learning
environment. This technique, therefore, not only enhances

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 189
academic achievement but also contributes to a more
inclusive, respectful and supportive classroom culture.

Ingenious Influencers

Melynee also promotes the concept of Ingenious Influencers in
her classes. This involves introducing her students to famous,
inspirational or influential individuals each day and a quote by
that person. Promoting Ingenious Influencers in schools can
offer significant educational and cultural benefits, contributing
to a more inclusive and representative learning environment.
This approach aligns with the broader objectives of
multicultural education, as outlined by scholars like James A.
Banks (2015), emphasising the importance of incorporating
diverse cultural perspectives into the curriculum.

Can you walk us through your daily routine with
your students?

       Melynee: Absolutely. Every day, I start by introducing
       my students to inspirational figures such as
       Katherine Johnson and Ellen Ochoa, or individuals
       who resemble them and come from similar
       backgrounds. I find Dolly Parton to be particularly
       impactful. We discuss these role models and reflect
       on quotes that resonate with their dreams and
       aspirations.

190 | Designing for equity in learning
What happens next?

       Melynee: After our discussions, the students take
       the inspiration from these sessions and create vision
       boards. These boards serve as visual representations
       of their goals. They also write letters to themselves
       detailing how they plan to achieve these goals,
       which I then attach to the back of their boards.
       These letters are personal and confidential, serving
       as a commitment to their aspirations. At the
       midpoint of the year, we revisit their goals and
       progress. We discuss any obstacles they may have
       encountered and evaluate their achievements. I also
       check in on their well-being by revisiting what I call
       the 4Hs--asking if they have any additional
       questions or concerns.

What happens at the end of the year?

       Melynee: Towards the end of the school year, we
       revisit their vision boards. They have the opportunity
       to update them based on their growth and
       experiences throughout the year. It's a cyclical
       process that fosters continuous reflection and
       growth.

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 191
It sounds like a comprehensive approach. How
do you view the significance of each
component?

       Melynee: Each piece, from the introductions to the
       vision boards and goal-setting exercises, plays a
       crucial role in empowering my students and
       nurturing their aspiration.

How do you use Ingenious Influencers?

       Melynee: In my classroom, I have a dedicated space
       called `Ingenious Influencers Like Me', where I
       feature a daily quote alongside an influential figure.
       For example, today's quote is `Don't tell me the sky's
       the limit when there's footprints on the moon',
       paired with Ellen Ochoa. I make sure to highlight
       her achievements, such as being one of the first
       Hispanic women in space and her induction into the
       Astronaut Hall of Fame.
       After presenting the quote and the featured
       individual, I engage the students by asking them
       what they notice and wonder about our Ingenious
       Influencer and the accompanying mindset lesson. I
       encourage them to reflect on how these stories and

192 | Designing for equity in learning
       individuals can aid them in their goal-setting
       endeavours. This approach serves as a coaching tool,
       guiding them towards developing a growth
       mindset.
       Similarly, during math class, I incorporate a daily
       quote and an Ingenious Influencer as part of our
       warm-up routine. I then facilitate discussions on
       how these individuals' accomplishments can inspire
       and assist the students in achieving their own goals.
       By consistently incorporating these elements into
       our daily routine, I aim to instill a mindset of growth
       and possibility in my students. The expansive nature
       of my approach, which includes both daily quotes
       and overarching life principles, ensures that
       students are exposed to a variety of inspirational
       messages and themes. Following each presentation,
       I prompt students to reflect on whether the
       featured individual serves as a window or a mirror
       into their own lives, encouraging them to connect
       with those who resonate with their aspirations and
       values.

How do students relate to Ingenious Influencers?

       Melynee: What I've observed is that when students
       hear the stories of these influential figures, it often

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 193
       prompts them to share their own experiences.
       They'll say things like, `Oh yeah, she did this and
       that, which reminds me of something similar I've
       gone through'. I make a conscious effort to select
       figures who have relatable backgrounds or
       experiences to my students, which encourages
       them to engage with one another and recognise
       commonalities.
       I tailor the selection of these Ingenious Influencers
       based on the 4Hs, their Home, Hobbies, Hopes and
       Heritage. As the school year progresses, each
       student is likely to find connections with the
       individuals highlighted each day. This ongoing
       process fosters a sense of connection and
       community within the classroom as students
       recognise aspects of themselves in the stories of
       these remarkable individuals.

Thoughts on Ingenous Influencers

For learning designers and educators, designing experiences
that expose students to a diverse range of cultures and
perspectives in the educational setting is crucial for fostering
cultural competence among all students. A key obstacle to
culturally responsive teaching is `mainstream ethnocentrism
and hegemony' (Gay, 2018, p. 282), a tool that Ingenious
Influences directly challenges. Beyond merely being an
educational strategy, the promotion of Ingenious Influencers
and diverse cultural representatives in educational settings

194 | Designing for equity in learning
plays a pivotal role in advancing social equity and encouraging
cultural pluralism. It helps in dismantling stereotypes,
broadening students' understanding and appreciation for
different cultures, and preparing them to participate in a
multicultural society with respect and empathy. This approach
also aligns with educational goals of inclusivity, ensuring that
students from various backgrounds see their cultures and
histories reflected and valued in their learning environment. By
integrating a wide array of cultural perspectives into curricula,
educational environments not only enrich the learning
experience but also contribute to a more equitable and
culturally diverse society.

Designing collaborative maths

Reflecting on my experiences in mathematics classes, the
concept of collaboration is notably absent. Typically, these
classes were structured around individual tasks, with a strong
emphasis on personal understanding and performance. For
me, maths instruction often followed a traditional teacher-
centred instructional approach, where students listened to
explanations, took notes, and then worked through problems
independently. This format left little room for collaborative
learning, where students could actively engage with each
other to solve problems, share diverse perspectives, or develop
collective strategies. The focus was primarily on individual
comprehension and skill mastery, assessed through solo
homework assignments and tests. While this approach can aid
in developing personal responsibility and individual problem-
solving skills, it misses the opportunity to harness the benefits
of peer-to-peer learning and the rich, diverse insights that
collaborative discussions of different ways of seeing problems
can bring to mathematical understanding (Boaler, 2016, p. 59).
The lack of collaboration in these settings didn't just limit the

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 195
social aspect of learning; it also potentially narrowed the scope
of understanding, as it restricted the flow of ideas to a single
source, typically the teacher or the textbook, rather than
allowing for a more dynamic, interactive and multifaceted
exploration of mathematical concepts. This can potentially
prevent the establishment of a learning space where every
student, irrespective of their background, has the opportunity
to engage and contribute on an equal footing. While the lack
of collaborative learning strategies may enhance educational
disparities, Cohen & Lotan (2014, p. 23) note that if students are
properly prepared, heterogeneous groups can allow students
to use each other as resources, enabling exposure to
challenging material and developing basic skills with peer
support despite temporary skill gaps.

Virtual Math Teams (VMT)

Virtual Math Teams (VMT) is an online platform that represents

a progressive approach in mathematics education, leveraging

the power of digital technology to facilitate online collaborative

problem  solving  and                   interactive  learning

experiences. Developed as part of a broader research initiative

on technology-enhanced learning environments, VMT offers a

platform where students engage in mathematical problem-

solving and discourse in a virtual setting (Stahl, 2009). The

platform enables the use of activities made with Desmos and

Geogebra as its underlying workspace. A distinctive feature of

the platform is an inherent focus on turn taking. This is

promoted through a feature that allows only one participant

to be in control of the workspace at a time, to perform actions

such as manipulating interactives, or advancing and rewinding

screens. Anonymisation is a configurable feature for designers

and teachers within the platform. When activated, it allows

students to work together anonymously, fostering an

196 | Designing for equity in learning
environment where they might be more inclined to take risks
and experiment with their problem-solving approaches. VMT
allows students from diverse locations to collaborate via text
chat or voice to text, bringing together varied perspectives and
problem-solving strategies, thus enriching the learning
process (Roschelle & Teasley, 1995). Turn taking in the platform
is promoted by students taking or requesting control in the
shared space. Designers, teachers and students also have the
ability to replay VMT sessions to learn from student interaction
and chat conversations in each session. The Mathematical
thinkers like me (MLM) with Desmos Activities on Virtual Math
Teams video introduces students experiences with the VMT
platform.

Interview with Richard Tchen

Richard Tchen is an Educational Program Developer based in
Philadelphia. Richard has extensive experience co-designing
with teachers in VMT and analysing student interactions within
the platform. Both Richard and Annie Fetter make a point of
trying to meet with students where possible to get their views
on the platform and their input for improvements. They have
also been active in collecting rich asynchronous exchanges and
feedback from students via online Jamboards.

The importance of participation

       Richard: One major takeaway from my perspective
       [is] the sense that participation is important. When
       it doesn't happen, it's painful and it makes the
       experience a struggle. The depth of that feeling was
       particularly impactful on me, really impressed me.
       And ironically, having interviewed easily between
       the two of us, Annie and I, having interviewed at
       least half of, I guess, half of the eighth grade there,
       everyone was convinced that, oh, we are
       participating fully.
       Annie: It was also interesting that more of them,
       they were like, I think it's great, except when you're
       in the room with people who don't do anything. And
       it reminded me of these surveys, where they survey
       people of like, who's cheating on their spouse and
       who thinks their spouse is cheating and those
       numbers don't match up at all. It really seemed like
       they wanted to do math, they wanted to learn math,
       they wanted to have math conversations, they liked
       the environment, and they didn't want people to be
       lame. Worse off, they didn't want people to be jerks.
       So that was like when they spam the chat and all
       that. But I think there were two levels of you're a
       jerk, that's really not appropriate. And then you don't
       do anything. And it kind of almost made them sad,
       like, but wait, we're missing out on ideas and we
       want everyone to throw their ideas in so that we can
       think about stuff.

198 | Designing for equity in learning
As a designer, what do you look for when
replaying student VMT sessions?

       Richard: There's such a rich range of activities and
       experiences. I guess it's affirming that there is no
       such thing as a typical chat or a typical replay
       experience, a typical kind of VMT experience. I will
       say when I go through them, I do rely a fair amount
       on chat and on the system messages about control,
       I like being able to see it in the context of what's
       happening in the interactive space.
       So, you know, you can get a quick sort of overview
       about participation (in the VMT replayer). But I like
       to try to hear as much through the chat as I can
       about collaboration, about problem solving, and
       then texture that with observations from the VMT
       system messages about who's in control, how long
       they've been in control, how long it took for control
       to change when someone explicitly requested
       control or just made a suggestion, the unfulfilled
       proposition or something like that, you know,
       someone suggests an idea to the person who's in
       control and it never gets discussed and it never gets
       implemented.
       So I try to look through and see who participated,
       when they were participating, how much they
       participated. And even before that, I actually make a
       point of looking at the roster list that the teacher
       has assigned for the specific room and reconcile
       that against who actually entered the room.

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 199
       Because, as we know, the pandemic and the reality
       of many public school students' lives in the United
       States, especially at these Title 1 schools, it doesn't
       guarantee attendance, you know, and their teachers
       have to account for that. So I focus a lot on just basic
       attendance and speech and actions. And I will add
       that, or complicate the analysis by pointing out that
       some of my favourite moments have been entirely
       wordless. They may have not really materialised in
       chat, but they have consisted of students almost
       silently, it's like the educational collaborative
       equivalent of Adam Smith's hand in capitalism,
       where there was an idea that got passed from one
       person to another, but each person took a different
       interpretation on it or had a different insight into.
       And yet very few words were spoken in the chat, but
       control passed from one person to the next. And at
       the end of it, the chat became one of, okay, so which
       one are we going to go with? And the whole
       sequence was beautiful.

What advice would you share with learning
designers?

       Richard: I mean it's really humility. The more you
       design, the more you engineer, the more you're

200 | Designing for equity in learning
       serving the software as opposed to the
       opportunities for learning. There is, I mean, with
       executive functioning, there's a tremendous
       amount of educational benefit to inhibiting some of
       the affordances that you know you could bake into
       [the platform]. Sometimes less is so much more,
       especially when the more we want is more learning.
       Like there is a certain amount of lifting and pivoting
       and change that we want to elicit from students
       that too much technology will do for them. So it's
       about humility of what you can bring as a designer
       and humility about what you should assume about
       your students. And of course, humility about what
       brilliance they will have.

Thoughts on Virtual Math Teams (VMT)

VMT exemplifies a progressive educational platform where
students engage in real-time collaboration to solve
mathematical problems. This approach not only fosters
learning through diverse group interactions, enhancing
empathy and appreciation for different perspectives, but also
aligns with the needs of a globally interconnected world
(Johnson & Johnson, 2009). For me, a critical aspect of
collaborative tools like VMT is the design of pedagogical
sequencing and related considerations, both inside and
outside the platform, to help promote inclusive and equitable
learning. For example, working with students to develop

                                                  Designing for equity in learning | 201
collaborative norms may help ensure that every student has
an equal voice. As a learning designer or educator, one great
feature of Virtual Math Teams is its support of existing Desmos
and Geogebra activities. These may require some tweaking to
ensure they work within the collaborative context of the VMT
environment. For example, instructional prompts may need
updating to promote discussion via the chat functionality.

Ensuring equitable access and engagement for all students is
a consideration in the design of activities and resources before,
during and after interaction with the platform. As a teacher,
understanding when to intervene during online sessions is also
vital, ensuring that guidance is provided while maintaining the
collaborative integrity of the learning process. A fascinating
aspect of VMT is the ability to replay sessions, learn from
student interaction in the sessions, and iteratively improve
their lessons. Such approaches in platforms like VMT not only
enhance mathematical understanding but also ensure that all
students, regardless of their background, have access to a rich,
collaborative and equitable learning experience.

Final thoughts

This chapter introduces a few innovative pedagogical
strategies: Notice and Wonder, 4Hs of Belonging Centred Math
Instruction, Ingenious Influencers, and the collaborative online
platform Virtual Math Teams (VMT). Collectively, these
strategies and tools represent practical ways for learning
designers and educators to help create inclusive and engaging
educational environments. Notice and Wonder stands out as a
versatile tool that encourages students to actively engage with
their learning material, fostering critical thinking and curiosity.
It shifts the focus from mere absorption of facts to a more
interactive and reflective learning process. The 4Hs of

202 | Designing for equity in learning
Belonging Centred Math Instruction, on the other hand, brings
a personalised touch to learning by connecting class content
to students' homes, hobbies, hopes and heritage, thus making
learning more relevant, personal and engaging. Ingenious
Influencers, by introducing students to diverse role models and
thought-provoking quotes, not only broadens their horizons
but also instills inspiration and relatability, contributing to a
more culturally rich and motivating learning atmosphere.
Lastly, VMT, as a platform for collaborative problem-solving,
leverages digital technology to enhance mathematical
understanding through interactive and cooperative learning
experiences. Together, these approaches embody a holistic
and progressive educational philosophy that not only enriches
the student experience but also nurtures a more equitable,
thoughtful and inclusive learning community.

cultural responsiveness

NHUNG NGUYEN

Introduction and chapter objectives

Culture shapes our thoughts, perceptions, actions, and
communication styles. It plays a pivotal role in mediating our
learning experiences. Consequently, even in a learning
environment where teaching methods, resources, curriculum,
and relationships remain consistent, students may have
diverse experiences. This variance arises because learning and
experiences are processed through the lens of cultural
viewpoints, prior knowledge and experiences.

This chapter explores the importance of acknowledging and
celebrating cultural differences, and creating learning
experiences that are relevant to diverse learners. It provides
practical advice for learning designers to design learning
experiences that are culturally responsive. The chapter will:

   unpack the notion of design for cultural responsiveness,
   discuss why we should design for cultural responsiveness,
   provide strategies and examples on how we can design for

      cultural responsiveness, and
   explore some challenges that we may encounter in the

      journey of designing for cultural responsiveness.

206 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
Culturally responsive design

In today's globally connected era, learning designers are tasked
with the vital responsibility of shaping curricula and
pedagogical approaches that resonate with the diverse
cultural tapestries of learners' cultural backgrounds. This
evolving landscape emphasises the criticality of designing
learning environments that recognise, honour and actively
harness the rich cultural assets each learner contributes.
Within this section, we will explore the intricate dimensions of
designing for cultural responsiveness. To set a firm foundation
for this exploration, we will commence by clarifying the core
definition of culture.

Culture

Culture represents a multifaceted phenomenon that
encompasses evolving worldviews, traditions, beliefs,
knowledge and relationships that underpin a group's actions
and perspectives (Hargraves, 2022). While culture can be seen
in tangible elements like cuisine or attire, it delves deeper and
manifests in implicit behaviours associated with values, beliefs,
social roles and communication. Culture can be collectively
nurtured and shared among groups that are unified by history,
geography, linguistics, religious beliefs or socio-economic
status. However, culture remains fluid and multifaceted.
Individuals can have different experiences and perspectives
even within the same culture. This leads to nuanced variations
even among individuals within the same cultural group.

                                        Designing for cultural responsiveness | 207
Design for cultural responsiveness

Culturally responsive design embraces, deeply values and
celebrates the diverse cultural heritage, knowledge, skills and
dispositions that students bring into a learning environment.
The design prioritises creating a learning environment that
draws on students' inherent cultural backgrounds and
experiences as a resource (Taylor & Sobel, 2011). Leaners in this
environment are provided with opportunities to interact and
collaborate with one another to learn from one another and
develop multiple perspectives and ways of knowing. This
means the foundation of learning and educational design
becomes intertwined with students' unique cultural
perspectives, frames of reference, language and
communication styles (Wages, 2015). Culturally responsive
design not only champions academic growth, it also fosters
strong interpersonal relationships.

It is important to highlight that culturally responsive design
is distinct from concepts such as diversity and inclusion
initiatives. While diversity and inclusion initiatives try to
increase the representation of minority groups in a learning
environment, they may not necessarily address the inadvertent
cultural biases or stereotypes within the curriculum. Culturally
responsive design goes beyond mere representation. It actively
weaves cultural backgrounds and experiences into the very
fabric of the design.

Learners actively construct knowledge within a social context,
based on their prior knowledge, cultural background, and
experience (Kyei-Blankson et al., 2019). Their understandings
continually evolve through interactions with their
environment, peers and broader societal influences. Learning
is not a mere passive absorption of information. It is a dynamic

208 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
process shaped by interpersonal exchanges and cultural
scaffolding.

Learners bring their unique and personalised knowledge, skills,
and dispositions into a learning environment. Each learning
experience is encompassed by the environment or context
with which the learner engages (Boettcher & Conrad, 2016).
Their understandings are shaped by their unique cultural and
diverse backgrounds. Therefore, it is vital to value and weave
diverse cultural experiences into educational design.

Culturally responsive design weaves learners' cultural
backgrounds and life stories into course design, and harnesses
the cultural insights, prior experiences and perspectives from
diverse learners to make learning more personalised, relational
and effective for them. Designing for cultural responsiveness
draws on a wealth of diverse cultural insights, knowledge, skills
and attitudes that varied learner groups contribute to
educational settings. The design appreciates the distinct
attributes of majority and minority students. Its objective is to
equip learners to live in an increasingly multicultural world.

Educational theories underpinning
designing for cultural responsiveness

Designing for cultural responsiveness is underpinned by three
pivotal theories: Constructivist Learning Theory, Sociocultural
Theory, and Culturally Relevant Pedagogy. In this section, we
will outline the origins and core tenets of these theories, and
their relationships to cultural responsiveness.

                                        Designing for cultural responsiveness | 209
Constructivist Learning Theory

The origin of the Constructivist Learning Theory can be traced
back to Jean Piaget's work on cognitive structures and
developmental stages (Zajda, 2021). His research unveiled that
children actively construct their understanding of the world
by interacting with their environment. This perspective was
expanded upon by Lev Vygotsky, who introduced the notion of
socio-cultural influences on cognitive development (Daniels et
al., 2007).

From a constructivist perspective, learning is a process where
individuals construct new knowledge based on their prior
knowledge and experiences (Biggs & Tang, 2011). This implies
that learning is not passive but active, emphasising exploration,
interaction, and reflection.

Within the constructivist paradigm, learners' cultural and
experiential background is very important to their learning.
They construct new knowledge based on and through the lens
of their cultural knowledge and experiences. By integrating
these into the curriculum, learning designers can make
learning more meaningful and relatable. Designing for cultural
responsiveness can foster a deeper, more holistic
understanding of subjects, promoting both cognitive and
emotional development.

Sociocultural Theory

Sociocultural Theory originates from Lev Vygotsky, who
believed that individual cognitive development and societal
influences are inextricably linked. Vygotsky argued that our
cognitive development is heavily influenced by our socio-

210 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
cultural context. Tools from our culture - language, symbols,
and societal norms - mediate our learning.

From a sociocultural perspective, learning is a social process,
deeply intertwined with culture, interaction and the tools and
artefacts of the society of which we are part (Nguyen &
Williams, 2016). Individual cognitive processes are
fundamentally rooted in social interactions and the context.
Learners are not seen as isolated individuals in this perspective.
Instead, they are viewed as part of social, cultural, historical and
institutional networks. These networks influence their learning
experiences, knowledge acquisition and cognitive
development.

Vygotsky believed that cognitive development is mediated by
cultural tools, like language, and by the interactions within
one's community. These tools and interactions become the
pathways through which knowledge is co-constructed.
Culturally responsive design is about ensuring that these
pathways are as diverse, inclusive and representative as
possible. It recognises that for a learner from a different cultural
background, a story, an example, or even a phrase might hold
a completely different connotation.

Designing for cultural responsiveness is an embodiment of the
principles of sociocultural theory. It recognises that every
learner brings rich cultural backgrounds, languages,
experiences, knowledge, and beliefs into the educational
space. These are very important to who they are and how they
learn. Culture, society, and interactions shape their learning
experiences (Rogoff, 2003). Culturally responsive design in
education aims to tailor learning resources, instructional
strategies, assessment methods and the educational approach
to resonate with the diverse cultural backgrounds of learners.
This does not entail creating a different learning plan for each
student; rather, it is about incorporating varied perspectives,

                                          Designing for cultural responsiveness | 211
narratives, histories, and values into the mainstream content
(Gay, 2018). It is about ensuring that multiple voices are heard
and represented, and that no single dominant culture
overshadows the others.

Culturally relevant pedagogy

The term was introduced by Gloria Ladson-Billings in the 1990s
(Ladson-Billings, 1995). It emerged as a reaction to educational
environments that marginalised students of diverse cultural
backgrounds.

Culturally Relevant Pedagogy is about creating a holistic
learning environment where learners feel valued, are
motivated to learn, and are equipped to bring about positive
change in society. It has three components: student learning,
cultural competence and sociopolitical/critical consciousness
(Ladson-Billings, 2021).

   Student learning: At the forefront of Culturally Relevant
      Pedagogy is a commitment to ensuring learners achieve
      their full potential. It is important to promote intellectual
      growth without sidelining or undermining a learner's
      cultural identity.

   Cultural competence: This facet actively seeks to establish
      a symbiotic relationship between learners' home cultures
      and the educational environment. Rather than a scenario
      where learners' cultural identities are secondary or
      overlooked, Culturally Relevant Pedagogy advocates for
      these rich cultural narratives to be interwoven into the
      educational fabric. This not only contextualises learning
      but also empowers learners to recognise and value their
      culture in parallel with others, thus promoting a classroom
      culture of mutual respect and understanding.

212 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
   Sociopolitical consciousness: Beyond just acknowledging
      diversity, Culturally Relevant Pedagogy propels learners
      towards critical consciousness. It urges them to engage
      with, interrogate and challenge societal norms and
      structures that perpetuate inequalities. By doing so,
      learners are imbued with a sense of agency, transforming
      them from passive recipients of knowledge to active
      contributors working towards a more equitable society.

Culturally Relevant Pedagogy encourages learning designers
to view diversity not as an obstacle but an asset. It is about
infusing curricula with diverse cultural perspectives, thus
making education more holistic and reflective of the world
we inhabit. By adopting this pedagogical approach, designers
ensure that learners do not feel compelled to choose between
academic success and cultural identity - they can, and should,
have both.

Constructivist Learning Theory, Sociocultural Theory and
Culturally Relevant Pedagogy collectively champion the idea
that culture, experiences and backgrounds of learners are
central to the learning process. Constructivist Learning Theory
emphasises that individuals actively shape their knowledge
through experiences, highlighting the need to incorporate
cultural understanding to foster the learning experience.
Sociocultural Theory underscores the intricate nexus between
individual cognition and the encompassing socio-cultural
context. Culturally Relevant Pedagogy emphasises the triad
of student learning, cultural competence, and sociopolitical
consciousness. As we reflect upon these theories, it becomes
patently clear that to design for cultural responsiveness is to
recognise and celebrate the rich tapestry of diverse learner
backgrounds. It means weaving an educational narrative
where diverse cultural inputs are at the forefront, fostering a
holistic and enriching learning experience.

Why should we design for cultural
responsiveness?

In an era characterised by rapid globalisation and increasing
intercultural interactions, the importance of designing for
cultural responsiveness cannot be overstated. Designing for
culturally responsiveness values and celebrates the cultural
heritages of all learners. This section will unpack the answers
to the question of why we should design for cultural
responsiveness.

216 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
conform to the sociocultural and sociolinguistic norms of a
dominant culture group may lead minority learners to feel
alienated from a learning environment (White & Lowenthal,
2011).

A sense of belonging plays a pivotal role in determining a
student's academic success and emotional well-being. When
students see their cultures, languages, and experiences
reflected in the curriculum and teaching methodologies, they
feel valued and included. On the contrary, overlooking cultural
diversity or perpetuating stereotypes can inadvertently
alienate students, leading to feelings of isolation and
disengagement. White and Lowenthal (2011) argue that
perceived alienation may cause learners from minority groups
to withdraw from their tertiary studies. Furthermore, studies
have found that learners of colour frequently encounter
microaggressions, both within the campus environment and
during classroom interactions, and they feel that their
perspectives are unheard in curriculum (Suarez et al., 2018).

Bishop and Berryman (2010) conducted a research project on
culturally responsive professional development in New
Zealand. The educational inequalities in New Zealand are
prominently visible in schools between Mori students and
their Pkeh (New Zealand European) counterparts. Within
these mainstream educational settings, Mori students often
exit the schooling system prematurely. They are more
frequently subjected to school expulsions and suspensions
than their Pkeh peers. This phenomenon is not unique to
New Zealand. It is reflective of similar disparities faced by
marginalised student populations in other nations such as the
United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The
research goal was to help educators to raise academic
performance of New Zealand's indigenous Mori students. The
research found that the culturally responsive approach not only

                                         Designing for cultural responsiveness | 217
narrows the gap between top-performing and struggling
students but also elevates overall academic performance.

Taking a culturally responsive approach can potentially
enhance educational achievement (Gay, 2002). Multiple
scholars assert that a culturally responsive approach can be
pivotal for the academic success of learners from a diverse
range of cultural backgrounds (Green et al., 2017; Ware, 2006).
It can contribute to learners feeling valued and connected to
an online learning environment (Green et al., 2017). It enhances
performance across all cultural groups and ensures that
learners, irrespective of cultural background, can receive
support and encouragement to fulfil their educational
aspirations (Hindle et al., 2020).

Globalisation

Beyond academic outcomes, one of the primary objectives of
education is to prepare students for life. In a world where
intercultural interactions are commonplace, the ability to
communicate, collaborate and empathise with individuals
from different cultural backgrounds becomes crucial.
Culturally responsive classrooms serve as training grounds for
these vital life skills. By exposing students to diverse
perspectives and promoting intercultural dialogues, educators
foster critical thinking, open-mindedness, and a genuine
appreciation for diversity.

Nowadays, learning environments (e.g., online courses, face-
to-face classrooms, schools) have become more diverse due
to migration, international collaborations, and technological
advancements enabling online education. Learners are from
various cultural backgrounds. Designing with cultural
responsiveness in mind acknowledges the lived realities of our

218 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
globalised world, where intercultural competencey is no longer
a luxury but a necessity. By designing and fostering an
environment that respects and integrates diverse cultural
inputs, educators prepare students for an interconnected
global future.

Decolonial movement

The decolonial movement aims to shape education systems to
better represent the diverse cultures, histories, and experiences
of learners and address the existing power imbalances in these
systems (Kukulska-Hulme et al., 2023). In many countries, the
mainstream educational systems and curricula have been
predominantly shaped by colonial legacies, which often
prioritise Western perspectives and marginalise indigenous/
minority knowledge, practices and worldviews. This systemic
bias has contributed to achievement gaps between different
cultural and socio-economic groups. By intentionally designing
for cultural responsiveness, educators can challenge these
longstanding Eurocentric norms and give voice to the
previously silenced narratives. This helps to ensure that all
learners, irrespective of their backgrounds, have equitable
access to quality education and opportunities to excel.

To wrap up the discussion on why we should design for cultural
responsiveness, culturally responsive design does not solely
benefit minority or marginalised learners. When curricula
integrate diverse perspectives, they offer a richer, more
nuanced view of topics, benefiting all learners. This encourages
learners to step out of their comfort zones, challenge their
preconceived notions, and gain a more holistic understanding
of the world around them.

The process of incorporating cultural responsiveness also offers

                                         Designing for cultural responsiveness | 219
profound professional development opportunities for
educators. It necessitates a continuous process of self-
reflection, learning, and adaptation. As educators deepen their
understanding of diverse cultures, they become better
equipped to cater to varied student needs, enhancing their
efficacy and adaptability.

How can we design for cultural
responsiveness?

1. Laying the groundwork: Preliminary steps

1.1 Knowing yourself: Self-awareness and
reflection

In the realm of educational design, it is important to
understand and acknowledge our own beliefs and attitudes.
These foundational beliefs directly influence the design of
learning materials, interaction and overall educational
experiences.

Every learning designer brings with them a tapestry of
experiences, beliefs and values rooted in their own cultural
upbringing. These beliefs are often shaped by personal
experiences, societal narratives or established educational
approaches. Recognising and understanding one's own
cultural identity is essential, which entails delving into one's
family history, traditions, values and even biases.

We usually operate within a framework of beliefs and
assumptions. These impact the design decisions, from content
selection to educational paradigms that underpin the design.

220 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
The ripple effect of the design decisions can have profound
implications. For instance, learners perceive their capabilities
and potential within the confines of the designed
environment. A design infused with biases, even inadvertently,
can alter a learner's self-efficacy and belief in their potential.

A significant component of self-awareness is challenging one's
own assumptions about different cultural groups. Stereotypes
can limit a designer's understanding of learners' potential,
preferences, and challenges. Some common examples could
be that all Asian learners excel in mathematics, and that
students from lower socio-economic backgrounds lack
ambition. Another common oversight in educational design is
the inadvertent creation of content that caters predominantly
to mainstream cultural norms, thereby sidelining learners from
diverse backgrounds. To counteract this, designers can
maintain a balanced expectation, ensuring that content,
resources and tools are universally accessible and resonate
across cultural divides. Elevating design expectations for
inclusivity can bridge the gap between mainstream and
diverse learning experiences.

Culturally responsive learning design entails continuous self-
reflection. Designers should periodically evaluate their
strategies and tools, biases, and cultural nuances. By
recognising areas where existing beliefs might be limiting or
even counterproductive, designers can pivot towards more
inclusive and holistic strategies. A culturally responsive
designer is more than just a content curator; they are
advocates for an inclusive learning ethos. Such designers
challenge mainstream narratives and methodologies, always
searching for approaches that resonate with diverse learner
profiles.

Self-awareness and reflection is an ongoing process. Feedback
from students, peers, and community members can be

                                         Designing for cultural responsiveness | 221
invaluable in this reflective process. External perspectives can
shed light on blind spots that one might have. Journalling,
peer discussions or even structured professional development
activities could also be very useful for reflective practice.

   Prompting questions for self-awareness
   and reflection

           What personal beliefs and biases might I
             unknowingly bring into my designs?

           How can I mitigate the influence of my personal
             biases?

           How might my own cultural background and
             educational experiences shape the way I
             approach design?

           How can I broaden my perspective?
           Am I making assumptions about learners based

             on stereotypes, or am I truly understanding and
             addressing their unique needs and backgrounds?
           Do I ensure that the content I design is reflective
             of diverse cultural perspectives and not just
             predominant or familiar ones?
           Do I consistently challenge and update my design
             methodologies to ensure they are current,
             relevant, and cater to the evolving diverse needs
             of learners?
           Am I dedicating enough time and resources to
             continuous learning about cultures, experiences

222 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
             and histories different from my own to enrich my
             design practices?

Self-awareness and reflection are foundational for designing
cultural responsiveness. Embarking on the journey of self-
awareness and reflection might be uncomfortable at times.
We might unearth deep-seated biases or realise past mistakes
in our teaching practices. It is important to approach these
realisations with a growth mindset. Every insight is an
opportunity for growth, enabling us to create a more culturally
responsive and effective learning environment.

1.2 Getting to know the learners

Knowing learner demographics and their respective needs is
central to the design and implementation of a culturally
responsive educational context. By understanding who the
learners are, where they come from, and what unique
requirements they might have, learning designers can shape
instruction, content and assessment to be more relevant,
inclusive and effective.

Before addressing the specific needs of learners, it is important
to gather comprehensive data on the learner population. This
encompasses not only age, gender and ethnicity but also
languages spoken, socio-economic backgrounds, religious
beliefs and other cultural identifiers. Such a nuanced
demographic profile aids designers in predicting potential
needs, challenges or preferences among learners.

Once demographics are mapped, the next step is to delve
deeper into specific needs or challenges linked to these

                                        Designing for cultural responsiveness | 223
demographics. For instance, English as a Second Language
(ESL) learners might need additional language support, while
learners from certain religious backgrounds might have
specific holiday observances. By identifying these needs,
learning designers can better prepare and adjust the learning
environment.

   Examples of methods to get to know the
   learners

           Distributing surveys to learners can provide direct
             insights into their expectations, challenges or
             suggestions for the curriculum. These surveys
             should be anonymous to ensure honest feedback
             and can be tailored to gather information about
             both academic and non-academic needs.

           Open dialogues or focus group discussions with
             learners can offer richer qualitative data on their
             needs. Such platforms encourage learners to
             voice concerns, share experiences and provide
             feedback, aiding designers in understanding and
             addressing specific needs.

           Examining past data, such as performance
             metrics, drop-out rates or feedback forms, can
             help identify recurring challenges or needs tied to
             specific demographic groups. This historical
             perspective can inform current strategies and
             interventions.

224 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
           In many institutions and companies, there are
             specialised staff members - like counsellors,
             language specialists or special needs educators -
             who can offer insights into the specific needs of
             different learner groups. Collaborating with these
             professionals can provide learning designers with
             targeted strategies and resources.

Learner demographics and needs are not static; they evolve
over time. To remain culturally responsive, designers should
ensure that analysis of demographics and needs are regularly
updated, allowing them to stay attuned to any shifts or
emerging trends. Understanding learner demographics and
their specific needs is foundational to culturally responsive
education. By recognising, understanding, and addressing
these needs, with ethical considerations in mind, learning
designers can offer a learning environment that is culturally
responsive for diverse learners.

1.3 Engaging with communities

When it is possible, learning designers should engage with the
communities from which learners originate. Communities are
reservoirs of cultural capital. They house traditions, languages,
stories, and histories that can enrich the learning experience.
By tapping into these resources, learning designers can create
a curriculum that both mirrors learners' backgrounds and
broadens their horizons. This not only validates the identities of
learners but also fosters a sense of belonging and appreciation

                                        Designing for cultural responsiveness | 225
for diverse cultures. Incorporating community voices in
curriculum design ensures that the content is both relevant
and culturally sensitive.
Engaging with communities also equips designers with a
nuanced understanding of cultural norms, values, and
expectations. This knowledge can influence the design of the
content and learning activities, communication strategies, and
assessment methods. For instance, understanding the cultural
significance of certain holidays or practices allows the
scheduling of assessments or significant learning activities in
ways that respect and accommodate learners' cultural
engagements.

   Examples of methods to engage with
   communities

           Conducting workshops, focus groups or
             community consultations can provide invaluable
             insights into what should be incorporated in the
             curriculum, how it should be presented, and
             which pedagogical methods might be most
             effective.

           Building partnerships with local community
             groups, cultural organisations and elders can help
             in offering authentic learning experiences. Guest
             speakers, field trips, or collaborative projects can
             provide learning designers with firsthand insights

226 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
             into various cultures. Additionally, these
             partnerships can support designers with
             supplemental resources and guidance in
             delivering culturally responsive instruction.
           Maintaining open communication between
             educational institutions and communities is vital.
             This could take the form of digital
             communication platforms, regular community
             meetings or feedback sessions. Such channels
             ensure that community members actively
             participate in the learning design process and can
             voice concerns, provide suggestions or share
             resources.
           Collaborating with community advocates or
             cultural ambassadors enhances community
             engagement efforts. These individuals, often
             esteemed within their communities, bridge the
             gap between institutions, companies and
             community members, facilitating a mutual flow
             of information and trust.

Engaging with communities is very beneficial for culturally
responsive design. By establishing robust ties with
communities, learning designers can curate a learning
environment that celebrates diversity, recognises cultural
richness and ensures every learner feels acknowledged,
respected and valued.

2. Designing for cultural responsiveness

2.1 Empowerment through representation

For learners, seeing themselves reflected in the curriculum,
resources, and instructional design is a potent indicator of
belonging and validation (Green et al., 2017). Designing with
cultural responsiveness through representation ensures that
learners feel acknowledged, valued, and empowered. Here are
examples of how to infuse representation in educational
design.

   Examples of empowerment through
   representation

           Use diverse resources: When choosing materials
             for inclusion in the curriculum, whether they are
             texts, multimedia resources, or case studies,
             learning designers should actively seek out
             sources from diverse authors, creators,
             perspectives, and historical accounts. Learners
             should encounter a multitude of voices and
             narratives, ensuring that no single story
             overshadows the rest. When learners encounter
             multiple viewpoints, they are more likely to see
             the richness and depth of a subject.

           Employ a co-design approach: A co-design

228 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
   approach involves actively engaging a range of
   stakeholders including teachers or academics,
   cultural experts, community members and
   people from indigenous cultures in the design
   process. By adopting this approach, learning
   designers can ensure that the learning
   experiences and materials are culturally
   responsive and relevant to learners' diverse
   backgrounds. This engagement allows for a more
   holistic and inclusive design process, where the
   voices and perspectives of those who are often
   marginalised or excluded from educational
   discourse are brought to the forefront.
 Utilise visual representation: Incorporate diverse
   images, symbols, and illustrations in learning
   materials. Visual cues are powerful mediums of
   communication, and culturally inclusive visuals
   can foster a sense of belonging for learners from
   various backgrounds.
 Highlight diverse role models: Feature
   achievements and contributions of individuals
   from various ethnic, racial, gender and socio-
   economic backgrounds. This provides learners
   with role models they can identify with, fostering
   motivation and aspirations.
 Encourage diverse voices: Create a learning
   environment in which learners from different
   cultural backgrounds feel safe and encouraged to
   share their experiences, insights and perspectives.
   This not only enhances representation but also
   enriches the learning experience for all.
 Incorporate culturally relevant scenarios: When

                             Designing for cultural responsiveness | 229
             designing case studies, scenarios or examples,
             ensure they resonate with diverse cultural
             contexts. This allows learners to connect learning
             with their lived experiences, making the content
             more relatable and impactful.
           Invite experts: When designing courses and
             programs, experts can be invited and get involved
             in different stages of the learning design process.
             For example, Mori and Pacific/Indigenous
             experts are invited to work on the design and
             development of courses and programs of New
             Zealand institutions. These experts can work
             collaboratively with the team to brainstorm a
             course plan (an outline of the content,
             assessment and learning activities), writing some
             sections of a course, design some learning
             activities and assessment tasks, and/or review
             content and assessments. Inviting guest speakers
             from various cultural, professional or socio-
             economic backgrounds can introduce learners to
             a variety of lived experiences and expert
             knowledge. These engagements can also inspire
             learners by showcasing diverse role models and
             thought leaders in the field.
           Celebrate cultural events: Acknowledge and
             celebrate significant cultural, religious and ethnic
             events and festivals. This fosters a culture of
             respect and appreciation, underlining the
             importance of every culture in the educational
             community.
           Regularly review and update: The landscape of
             culture is dynamic and ever evolving. Regularly

230 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
             review and update learning materials to ensure
             they remain relevant and reflective of current
             cultural nuances and realities.

Empowerment through representation is an essential pillar of
culturally responsive design. It transcends acknowledgement
and moves towards holistic cultural responsiveness, where
every learner feels seen and validated. When educational
design mirrors the diverse tapestry of its learners, it sends a
powerful message: every story matters, every perspective is
valuable, and every learner is integral to the educational
journey. Through culturally responsive design, educators have
the profound opportunity to not just inform, but to empower
and inspire, laying the groundwork for a more inclusive,
understanding, and harmonious future.

2.2 Assessment and feedback

Within the realm of education, assessment and feedback are
pivotal components. When the educational landscape is
marked by a tapestry of diverse cultures and backgrounds, the
design of assessments and the way feedback is given must
be approached with cultural responsiveness. Below are some
examples of how to ensure assessments and feedback are
culturally sensitive and inclusive.

                                         Designing for cultural responsiveness | 231
   Examples of assessment and feedback

           Use diverse assessment methods: Different
             cultures may prioritise different modes of
             expression and understanding. Incorporating a
             mix of assessment styles - from written
             assignments and oral presentations to reflective
             journals, group projects and portfolios -ensures a
             more comprehensive evaluation of learners' grasp
             of content from various angles. Traditional tests
             may not capture the full range of a learner's
             understanding, especially if the learner comes
             from a background where different cognitive or
             communicative skills are emphasised. This variety
             acknowledges and respects the diverse ways in
             which learners from different cultures may best
             express their understanding.

           Provide choices in assessment: Rather than a rigid
             assessment structure, offering choices can be
             empowering. Some learners might excel in
             written tests, while others might shine in oral
             presentations or project-based assessments.
             Providing multiple avenues for learners to
             demonstrate their understanding acknowledges
             diverse skill sets and expressive styles.

           Provide flexible assessment timelines: Recognise
             that significant cultural, religious or familial
             events might clash with pre-set assessment

232 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
   timelines. Providing flexibility or alternative
   assessment dates ensures equity for all learners.
 Incorporate self and peer assessments: Self-
   assessment encourages learners to reflect on
   their work from their cultural perspective, while
   peer assessments can foster cross-cultural
   understanding as learners engage with and
   evaluate the work of their peers from diverse
   backgrounds.
 Provide contexts in performance tasks: When
   designing performance-based tasks, ensure the
   contexts or scenarios provided are culturally
   neutral or offer multiple culturally relevant
   options. This approach ensures that learners can
   engage with tasks in a meaningful way, rooted in
   their own experiences or understanding.
 Design culturally relevant assessment content
   and tasks: Design assessments that are free from
   cultural bias. Questions and tasks that assume
   familiarity with specific cultural references or
   experiences can inadvertently disadvantage some
   learners. Instead, opt for universally understood
   contexts or provide a balanced range of culturally
   diverse examples.
 Provide feedback that respects cultural nuances:
   Language and tone in feedback should be
   constructive and compassionate. Avoid idiomatic
   phrases or culturally specific references that
   might not be universally understood.
   Acknowledge the diverse methodologies and
   thought processes that learners might employ,
   understanding that there are multiple ways to

                             Designing for cultural responsiveness | 233
             approach a problem or topic.
           Pursue professional development: Continuous

             professional development can equip learning
             designers with the skills needed to design and
             implement culturally responsive assessments.

Assessments and feedback serve not only as tools for
measuring understanding but also as reflective mirrors for
learners. These indicate how the educational system perceives
and values them. When designed with cultural responsiveness
in mind, assessments and feedback can become powerful
instruments of inclusivity, equity and mutual respect. It is
essential that these tools, integral to the learning process, are
wielded with an awareness of diverse cultural backgrounds to
ensure learners feel seen, understood and valued.

2.3 Active engagement and participation

Achieving active engagement and participation is imperative
for educational design work. In diverse classrooms, the
challenge lies in ensuring that engagement and participation
are culturally responsive. By acknowledging and addressing
cultural nuances and variances, educational designs can offer
experiences that resonate universally, yet remain deeply
personal. Here are some examples of how to foster culturally
responsive active engagement and participation.

234 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
Examples of active engagement and
participation

      Design learning activities where learners can
        share their cultural heritage, knowledge, skills
        and dispositions. Examples are: (1) a discussion
        forum (an ice-breaker activity) at the beginning of
        a course where learners can introduce
        themselves, their cultural heritage, languages
        they can speak and their most important holidays
        in a year; and (2) oral presentations that allow for
        the sharing of cultural perspectives on a specific
        topic.

      Employ inclusive pedagogical approaches:
        Adopting pedagogies that honour different ways
        of knowing and learning is vital. For example,
        storytelling might resonate with some cultures
        more than analytical discussions. Similarly,
        collaborative activities might mirror community-
        oriented cultures, while individual projects might
        appeal to cultures that value autonomy.

      Encourage learner-led exploration: Learners can
        be instrumental in bringing diverse perspectives
        into the learning environment. Tasks that allow
        learners to delve into their cultural backgrounds
        or research global contexts can lead to enriching
        class discussions and knowledge exchange.

      Design contextualised content: Learners should

                                   Designing for cultural responsiveness | 235
             see their experiences reflected in the content.
             Case studies, examples and scenarios should pull
             from a variety of cultural backgrounds. This
             inclusivity validates diverse experiences and
             encourages active engagement from all learners.
           Use real-world tasks across cultures: Tasks that
             encourage learners to dive into cross-cultural
             scenarios or address global challenges compel
             them to view issues from various perspectives,
             fostering cultural responsiveness.
           Design inclusive collaborative spaces: Design
             platforms that celebrate diverse voices and
             experiences that enhance engagement.
             Encouraging discussions around cultural
             experiences, and comparing and contrasting
             them, can lead to rich, enlightening exchanges.
           Use reflection through cultural lenses: Providing
             learners opportunities to reflect on how a specific
             topic or lesson resonates with their cultural
             perspective encourages deeper connections and
             promotes understanding across different
             backgrounds.
           Provide feedback that honours diversity: Offering
             feedback should be done with cultural sensitivity
             in mind, acknowledging different perspectives
             and understanding that there is not always a
             `one-size-fits-all' answer. Feedback should be
             constructive, validating diverse approaches to
             problem-solving.
           Support varied interaction styles: Some cultures
             value group discussions and collaborative
             learning, while others might emphasise

236 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
             introspection and individual exploration. Flexible
             paths should accommodate these varied
             interaction styles, ensuring each learner finds a
             conducive environment to voice opinions, share
             insights or reflect.
           Use gamification with universal appeal: While
             gamifying learning experiences, choose elements
             like storylines, characters, names and challenges
             that are inclusive, ensuring they cater to a diverse
             audience and do not sideline any specific group.
             Some examples of names include: Marama -
             female character, Mori from New Zealand; John
             - male from England; Fhon - female from
             Thailand.
           Design for autonomy and cultural choice:
             Allowing learners to select culturally relevant
             resources or explore topics relevant to their
             backgrounds promotes autonomy and deepens
             engagement. By making cultural choices
             available, educational designers allow learners to
             carve out a personalised and relevant learning
             journey.
           Provide space for feedback: Open channels for
             feedback allow learners to share what
             perspectives they feel are missing or
             misrepresented. This continuous feedback loop
             ensures the content remains updated and
             reflective of diverse voices.

When striving for active engagement and participation,
designing for cultural responsiveness is essential for today's
diverse learning environments. Every learner deserves content

                                        Designing for cultural responsiveness | 237
and experiences that honour, respect, and reflect their cultural
backgrounds. By integrating culturally responsive strategies
into the design, designers can promote active participation
and build bridges of understanding and respect across diverse
learner groups. The goal is to create a learning environment
where every voice is heard, every experience is validated, and
every perspective is welcomed.

2.4. Multilingual approach

In the complex tapestry of today's globalised educational
context, a significant number of learners come from
multilingual backgrounds, bringing with them a rich linguistic
repertoire. As we push towards more culturally responsive
learning environments, employing a multilingual approach
becomes more and more popular. This can cater to diverse
learner profiles, enrich the learning experience and promote
deeper understanding and wider engagement. By offering
content in multiple languages or providing translation tools,
learning designers validate these diverse linguistic assets, and
help to remove the language barriers.

   Examples of multilingual approach

           Use multilingual tools and resources: Integrating
             tools like auto-translation software, multilingual
             glossaries or subtitle options can bridge linguistic

238 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
             gaps. Such tools empower learners to engage
             with content in their preferred or native language,
             promoting better understanding and reducing
             cognitive load.
           Integrate cultural and linguistic representations
             in content: By integrating diverse cultural
             narratives, idioms, examples and stories from
             various linguistic backgrounds, educators can
             make learning materials more relatable and
             engaging. Such representation reinforces the
             notion that every linguistic and cultural
             experience is valuable.
           Facilitate interactive multilingual forums:
             Facilitating spaces where learners can discuss,
             collaborate or ask questions in multiple
             languages fosters inclusivity. These forums can be
             supported by peer translations or educators
             proficient in various languages, making them
             accessible to all learners.
           Integrate language learning: In contexts where it
             is feasible, educational designers can integrate
             basic language learning modules. For instance, if
             a course has a significant number of Spanish-
             speaking learners, introducing basic Spanish
             terms or phrases related to the course content
             can foster cultural responsiveness and also
             enhance the learning experience for all
             participants. Embedding short courses from
             OpenLearn can be very useful.

Using a multilingual approach is a robust strategy to optimise
learning outcomes. By acknowledging and catering to diverse

                                        Designing for cultural responsiveness | 239
communicative and linguistic needs, learning designers can
create enriched learning landscapes where learners,
irrespective of their linguistic background, find the tools and
resources to thrive, engage deeply and achieve their full
potential.

Challenges around design for cultural
responsiveness

While design for cultural responsiveness is essential, achieving
this is not without challenges. One of the primary challenges
that educators face is the breadth and depth of cultural
diversity. It is not just about culture, race or ethnicity but
encompasses language, religion, socio-economic status,
gender, sexual orientation, and more. Catering to such
expansive diversity in a single learning environment (e.g.,
classroom or course) can be overwhelming. Striking a balance
where multiple perspectives are included without diluting the
core curriculum can be particularly daunting.

There is a thin line between understanding cultural tendencies
and falling into the trap of stereotyping or overgeneralising.
There is significant intra-cultural diversity, meaning members
of the same cultural group can have varied experiences and
beliefs. Designing educational content that respects this
nuance without resorting to reductive stereotypes is a complex
endeavour.

Many learning designers recognise the value of cultural
responsiveness. However, they may feel ill-equipped to
implement it due to a lack of resources or adequate training.
Standardised curricula and educational materials are often in
a dominant culture and sideline diverse perspectives and
experiences. Designers wanting to incorporate varied cultural

240 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
elements might struggle to find comprehensive, accurate, and
accessible resources that would allow them to design a
culturally responsive learning experience. They might need to
spend considerable time outside of their regular duties to
source, verify, and adapt materials - a task that becomes
daunting in the face of time constraints and workload.
Moreover, there is the pivotal issue of training. Not all designers
have been equipped with the tools or strategies to design in a
culturally responsive manner. Without adequate training, they
might either shy away from attempting to be culturally
responsive for fear of getting it wrong or, with the best
intentions, might inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes or
misconceptions.

In multicultural classrooms, significant language differences
can pose a considerable challenge. While the content might
be culturally tailored, if it is not linguistically accessible, the
effectiveness diminishes. Overcoming this might require
additional resources like translators, software, tools or bilingual
educators, which might not always be feasible.

The utilisation of student data in educational design could raise
ethical challenges. While student data can provide valuable
insights, it is imperative that ethical guidelines and protocols
are adhered to in order to protect the privacy and
confidentiality of students. These ethical concerns are
magnified when non-teaching staff, such as learning
designers, seek access to this sensitive information. Some
universities have strict policies about non-teaching staff
obtaining/retrieving student data.

Financial constraint is a significant hurdle in the journey of
designing for cultural responsiveness. Developing a
curriculum, learning modules and assessments that reflect a
vast array of cultural perspectives demands intensive research,
which necessitates the engagement of experts from various

                                         Designing for cultural responsiveness | 241
ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Employing such a
diverse group of experts is a financial commitment that many
institutions and companies might find challenging.
Furthermore, culturally responsive design often requires the
use of diverse resources, such as multicultural textbooks,
software tailored to cater to different linguistic groups and
interactive tools that honour varied cultural narratives.
Procuring or developing these resources involves costs that
can quickly escalate. Continuous professional development
sessions, workshops on cultural sensitivity and seminars on
global pedagogical trends necessitate both time and money.
Another financial challenge arises when trying to maintain the
relevance of culturally responsive materials. As societal norms,
cultural values and global events evolve, educational content
must be updated regularly to remain accurate and relevant.
This constant updating and revising is not just a pedagogical
demand but also a financial strain.

Summary of design for cultural
responsiveness

   Key Takeaways

   What?

     Culturally responsive design embraces, deeply values,
     and celebrates the diverse cultural heritage,
     knowledge, skills and dispositions that students bring
     into a learning environment. The design prioritises
     creating a learning environment that draws on
     students' inherent cultural backgrounds and
     experiences as a resource (Taylor & Sobel, 2011).
     Learners in this environment are provided with
     opportunities to interact and collaborate with one
     another to learn from one another and develop
     multiple perspectives and ways of knowing. This means
     the foundation of learning and educational design
     becomes intertwined with students' unique cultural
     perspectives, frames of reference, language and
     communication styles (Wages, 2015). Culturally
     responsive design not only champions academic
     growth, it also fosters strong interpersonal
     relationships.

                                        Designing for cultural responsiveness | 243
   Why?

     Learners' engagement and educational performance:
     Chuang (2016) highlights the positive correlation
     between culturally responsive approaches and
     enhanced learner engagement and performance.
     However, ignoring the cultural backgrounds of learners,
     or forcing them to conform to dominant sociocultural
     norms, can result in feelings of alienation, as discussed
     by White and Lowenthal (2011).
     Globalisation: In the face of increasing globalisation
     and diverse classroom compositions, designing for
     cultural responsiveness in education becomes very
     important. Culturally responsive design prepares
     learners for our globalised world and enhances
     intercultural competencies that are crucial in today's
     interconnected societies. The emphasis on cultural
     responsiveness is not only about equipping learners
     with knowledge but also about fostering essential life
     skills like empathy, collaboration and critical thinking.
     Decolonial movement: The decolonial movement is
     gaining momentum. It advocates for educational
     reforms that accurately represent diverse cultures and
     histories. This movement challenges the dominant,
     often Eurocentric narratives, and aims to rectify
     systemic biases and provide a more balanced
     educational experience.

244 | Designing for cultural responsiveness
How?

Designing for cultural responsiveness begins with
foundational groundwork that involves self-awareness
and reflection, knowing the learners, and engaging
with communities. Learning designers should be aware
of our own cultural biases and how these may
influence our work. We then get to know the learners,
their backgrounds, cultures, and needs. This will help
us to create relevant, inclusive, and effective learning
experiences. Engaging with the communities assists us
to access to valuable cultural capital. By tapping into
these resources, learning designers can create a
curriculum that both mirrors learners' backgrounds
and broadens their horizons and so fosters a sense of
belonging and appreciation for diverse cultures.
Once the groundwork is laid, learning designers can
focus on key areas to ensure cultural responsiveness:
empowerment through representation, assessment
and feedback, and active engagement and
participation. Empowerment through representation
involves integrating diverse voices and perspectives
into the curriculum and ensuring learners see
themselves reflected in learning materials.
Assessment and feedback strategies should be
designed to be culturally responsive. Educational
designers
modes of expression and understanding. Choices in
assessment that allow learners to demonstrate their

                                  Designing for cultural responsiveness | 245
     achievement and acknowledge diverse life experience
     and skill sets should be provided for them. Flexible
     assessment timelines that recognise that significant
     cultural or religious events might clash with pre-set
     assessment timelines should be also considered.
     Active engagement and participation can be used to
     foster culturally responsiveness. Some examples of
     design for active engagement and participation
     includes:

           Designing learning activities where learners can
             share their cultural heritage, knowledge, skills
             and dispositions.

           Adopting teaching strategies that honour
             different ways of knowing. For example,
             storytelling might resonate with some cultures
             more than analytical discussions.

           Using real-world tasks across cultures that
             encourage learners to dive into cross-cultural
             scenarios.

8. Working with
students with lived
experience of disability
to enhance inclusive
and accessible learning

KATIE DUNCAN AND RHIANNON HALL

Introduction

Much work has been done in higher education to create
inclusive learning environments and reduce barriers to
participation for groups that have historically been excluded.
People with disabilities are one such group, and although
accessibility is now `on most people's radar' in universities
(Wood et al., 2014, p. 147), more work is needed to ensure staff
have adequate knowledge and skills to provide accessible
learning environments for all students. Unfortunately, people
with disabilities continue to face ableism in the form of barriers
that prevent their full participation across all levels of society,
with disability rights violations ranging from violence and
exploitation, to a lack of services that allow people with
disabilities to have autonomy over their lives (Young & Thorne,
2023).

Ableism manifests across the university experience for
students in numerous ways, such as: low participation and
completion rates, higher levels of student debt than non-

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 251
disabled students, inadequate resourcing for accessibility
accommodations, and frequent reporting of stigmatisation
and discrimination (Dolmage, 2017, pp. 20-24). For people with
disabilities to have equitable access to higher education, the
development and maintenance of accessible learning
environments is vital. University staff, both professional and
academic, play a crucial role in fostering an inclusive culture
that prioritises and provides access for people with disabilities.
We define an accessible learning environment as one in which
students with disabilities can learn, participate and engage
without being hindered by access barriers. While there is
crossover in the aims and values guiding our work with those of
learning designers and educators, our position is professional
staff providing learning and teaching support and guidance
to academic staff. Our accessibility projects, especially those
involving students, tend to happen in what is often called the
`third space', in which professionals work across the
administration/academic threshold (Smith et al., 2021). In the
course of this work, we have found that the process of
developing effective services for staff often necessitates the
input of students, who are able to provide unique insight into
existing issues and collaborate with us on solutions. This
informs our approach in being facilitators of existing processes,
and inviting and encouraging students to be active partners in
(re)shaping them.

In our experience, encouraging staff to learn about and adopt
accessible practices can be a complex endeavour, yet it also
offers additional opportunities to involve and empower
students with lived experience of disability. Our approach
follows an increasing desire within higher education to
collaborate with students. Some of these approaches include
co-design, Students as Partners (Mercer-Mapstone et al., 2017),
inclusive pedagogies (Stentiford & Koutsouris, 2021) and
listening to the `student voice' (Seale, 2010). These are not

252 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
strictly methodologies, but rather flexible approaches that may
significantly vary in their delivery across different institutions.
These approaches typically involve a staff and student
exchange or collaboration at some stage of the learning or
design process, with the aim of using direct feedback from
students to inform and enable a better learning experience and
to enhance student life more broadly.

Our role as providers of, and advocates for, accessible learning
environments and practices has concentrated our efforts on
producing instructive content for staff to create and maintain
such environments. In this chapter, we explore why
accessibility in higher education would greatly benefit from
the engagement of university staff at all levels, why
collaboration with students who have lived experience of
disability is essential for effective results, and we further offer
advice drawn from our own experience in collaborating with
students for an informative campaign and suite of resources
aimed at university staff. We present our project `Students
Explain Digital Accessibility' as a case study and model for
working collaboratively with students to incorporate their lived
experience into accessibility advice for learning and teaching
staff.

Accessibility and social justice

Accessibility comprises many different things, ranging from
our legal to our social and ethical obligations. It helps to
understand the historical and political context we are building
on when working in accessibility.

In 1998, American author and disability rights activist James
Charlton published the seminal text, Nothing about us without
us: Disability oppression and empowerment. The title evokes

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 253
a clarion call that was beginning to gain prominence within
disability rights movements worldwide, capturing the
argument that people with disabilities `know what is best for
themselves and their community' (Charlton, 1998, p. 14). In over
two decades since Charlton's call, the slogan `nothing about us
without us' has continued to reverberate across activist spaces,
despite broader cultural attitudes often being slow to change.
For us as professional staff, this framework forms the basis
for our approach in advocating for accessible learning
environments for students and bolsters our commitment to
consultation with students who have lived experience of
disability.

For all university staff involved in shaping learning experiences
in higher education, inclusive principles are vital for responding
to current student demographics, ensuring that curriculum
remains relevant for contemporary demands, and improving
the learning environment to cater for a diverse (and
continuously diversifying) group of students. Beyond the
university context, inclusive higher education experiences are
an important factor in setting students up for success and
graduation, and they contribute to building a more diverse
workforce. Students living with a disability report lower rates
of satisfaction with tertiary study and are more likely to drop
out of university before they complete their studies
(Cherastidtham & Norton, 2018; Li & Carroll, 2019). While poor
learning experiences may not be the sole cause for student
attrition, they are an important factor that can be improved
with clear guidelines and adequate resourcing.

Inclusive practice in the context of higher education should
be conceived as creating a space for learning that is effective
and appropriate for all, and particularly for those who have
experienced barriers to education and general social
participation. The assertion that such spaces cannot genuinely
exist without the involvement of, and consultation with,

254 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
students who have lived experience is relevant beyond the
realms of disability rights and encompasses other marginalised
groups who have historically been excluded from higher
education. Additionally, while inclusive design practices
respond specifically to the requirements of certain groups, in
almost all cases, inclusive design holds benefits for everyone,
simply by providing a wider range of options and pathways
for learners to engage with educational content. This approach
also fits within the framework of Universal Design, described
by Jay Timothy Dolmage (2017) as a method that, when
employed in the context of education, allows `teachers to
structure space and pedagogy in the broadest possible
manner', a way of `building community, building better
pedagogy, building opportunities for agency' (p. 118).

In education, this framework is articulated as Universal Design
for Learning (UDL) and Universal Design for Instruction (UDI),
both of which have been shown to improve accessibility and
experience of students with disabilities (Black et al., 2015). While
UDL and UDI share common goals with digital accessibility,
tensions exist between these approaches, namely that a
`universal' approach does not specifically address accessibility
requirements or comply with recommendations for digital
accessibility. UDL can provide value for students with
disabilities when implemented alongside accessible practices
and may reduce the need for individual accommodations
(Ableser & Moore, 2018). As our work focuses on the experiences
of students with disabilities, our approach is based primarily on
digital accessibility practices.

Benefits of working with students with
lived experience of disability

Lived experience provides unique insight

Various student experiences in the higher education sphere,
whether they take place in person in a physical classroom, in
digital spaces via online learning or in the wider university
campus, are not necessarily designed inclusively. That is to say,
often these experiences are designed to fit assumed social
norms. When those doing the designing lack the lived
experience of someone who does not fit these norms, crucial
elements may be overlooked and present insurmountable
barriers for students with disabilities. Working with students
who have lived experience of disability can often reveal
shortcomings that designers in any field may be completely
unaware of.

Rosemarie Garland-Thomson (2011) utilises the concept of the
misfit to describe the social positioning of people with
disabilities in this context. In arguing for the inherent value
of the misfit, Garland-Thomson states that `the concept of
misfitting as a shifting spatial and perpetually temporal
relationship confers agency and value on disabled subjects at
risk of social devaluation by highlighting adaptability,
resourcefulness, and subjugated knowledge as potential
effects of misfitting' (2011, p. 592). In developing our project,
we purposefully sought out students who identified as having
lived experience of disability (noting that these students may
not always identify with the terms disabled or person with
disabilities), anticipating that the opportunity to hear directly
from them about the barriers of inaccessibility they had
encountered in their studies would reveal unknown
shortcomings of a learning design project.

256 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
Student agency

A positive outcome of involving students in the design process
for any type of work is that it increases the likelihood that
students will endorse the final product. Shelley Wright (2012)
argues that `powerful learning begins to manifest when
students take responsibility and ownership for their learning
when they become co-creators of their learning experience,
rather than their education being something that is done to
them. True student empowerment and engagement begins
when we cross the threshold of co-creation' (2012). While our
project was not a learning design project, this is a valuable
approach for design of any element of the university
experience.

The students we worked with often expressed a desire to be
able to tell their teachers when they encountered problems
with inaccessibility (or in some cases, for teachers to respond
to and respect their accessibility requirements when they were
informed of them). Our goal in the project was to act as
facilitators for students and connect their messages with the
staff audience - bringing into action the crossing of the
threshold discussed by Wright (2012).

Accessibility is crucial

Although the students we recruited for the project were
sought after for their accessibility expertise, their contributions
also provided important insight into aspects of the student
experience unrelated to accessibility. For example, while some
members of the group required captions for their learning to
be accessible, most appreciated the provision of captions and
found them helpful for other reasons. In our discussions,
students pointed out the ways that functions often regarded

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 257
as accessibility features provided important support for many
students, and for different reasons (such as the usefulness of
captions for students who speak English as a secondary
language). Alt text was not only important for students with
vision-related disabilities, it also provided information for
students who might not be able to load images due to a poor
internet connection. The benefits of accessible practices,
including overall improvement of digital learning
environments for anyone who uses them, form the guiding
principle for our messaging on accessibility.

Our project: Students Explain Digital
Accessibility

We are part of a learning and teaching support unit at the
University of Technology, Sydney. As of January 2023, UTS
employed 3,836 full- time equivalent staff members including
casual staff, and had 44,615 enrolled students, including
international students (UTS, 2023). The main UTS campus is
located in Sydney's Central Business District, and courses are
taught face-to-face, online and in hybrid formats.

Learning and teaching support for academics at UTS is
overseen by the Institute for Interactive Media and Learning
(IML), which is in the division of the Deputy Vice-Chancellor
(Education and Students). The team consists of academic and
professional staff who develop, coordinate, facilitate and advise
on a range of projects and initiatives that support and improve
the learning and teaching experience. The unit we are part of,
the LX.lab, is housed within IML and provides direct support
to academics in their learning and teaching, via face-to-face
and online consultations, events and workshops, and digital
content on our LX at UTS website. As well as timely support,

258 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
we also aim to upskill academics in using technologies and
enhancing the learning experience.

While the LX.lab now has a dedicated Inclusive Practices team
which supports and explores accessibility guidelines and
assistive technologies, this was not the case when the project
was carried out in 2020. Our small team consisted of a learning
technologist, a content officer and a media officer. As our
experience shows, a specialist role in accessibility is not
necessarily required for this kind of project.

This project was developed in response to our observations
of student experiences of inaccessible learning environments,
and a lack of resources for staff to consult when preparing
their subject materials. We had also observed that staff
inexperienced with accessibility barriers lacked an
understanding of the significant impacts for students. These
observations were made in workshops we held, in staff
requests for support, in our communication with academics
from faculties across the university, and most apparently in
requests for accessible alternatives and accommodations from
students registered with the UTS Accessibility Service.

Previous training sessions with staff were well-received when
we demonstrated an example of poor user experience by
showing how a screen reader would interact (or fail to interact)
with content that had not been formatted in an accessible
way. Colleagues expressed interest in seeing more examples of
the different ways that assistive technology users interact with
content.

These responses indicated to us that for staff to understand the
significance of unmet accessibility requirements for students,
they needed a more direct explanation and description of the
impacts from a user perspective. While we had been aware of
the gap in supportive resources for staff around accessibility,
the effectiveness of showing the impacts of inaccessibility from

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 259
a user perspective reinforced the importance of ensuring that
the voices of those most affected should be included in filling
that gap. In arguing for the concept of `nothing about us
without us', Charlton (1998) states that the slogan forces
`cultural systems to incorporate people with disabilities into the
decision-making process and to recognize that the experiential
knowledge of these people is pivotal in making decisions that
affect their lives' (p. 25). With our aim to provide clear and
comprehensive resources that we hoped would shape the
practice of staff, specifically by bringing their attention to the
real-world impact of accessibility, it was both an ideal
opportunity and essential to work alongside students with
lived experience.

Using a co-design approach

Co-design is a collaborative approach to design. It is about
designing with, not for, people. It brings the expertise of the
designers (or facilitators) together with the expertise of people
with lived experience to create and learn about something. Co-
design can be adapted and used in many different contexts,
for example product design, urban planning, healthcare,
technology and software development, social innovation and
activism, and education - in short, anywhere that design is
being undertaken to create something.

Co-design can be adapted to these different contexts, because
it is not a set process. According to McKercher (2020), `co-
design is about how we are being (our mindsets), what we
are doing (our methods) and how our systems embrace the
participation of people with lived experience (social
movements)'. McKercher sets out four key principles for co-
design:

260 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
   Share power: It is important that lived experience
      participants are able to make decisions in the co-design
      process, and that they are not just there in a consultative
      capacity.

   Prioritise relationships: It is important to build trust and
      create a safe space so that everyone can bring their
      authentic self to the process.

   Use participatory means: It is important that lived
      experience participants are actively engaged and are
      partners during the process.

   Build capability: It is important that facilitators enable and
      encourage the participants to be able to engage with the
      process. `Everyone has something to teach and something
      to learn' - and that goes for lived experience participants
      and the facilitators as well.

The Students Explain Digital Accessibility video series is an
example of co-design, as we were collaboratively designing the
videos together. We shared power with the students, by asking
them to write the script based on their own lived experiences.
We prioritised relationships, creating a safe space where we
listened and valued the experiences of our students. We used
participatory methods to ensure they were actively
contributing to the process. And finally, we were able to build
capacity - both of the students, by teaching them how to
create video content, write scripts, write blogs and present on
camera, and ourselves because we were able to learn a lot from
them about accessible content, which was one of the most
rewarding experiences as facilitators.

Our process

There is no set way to do co-design. However, there are several
key considerations for implementing a co-design project. In

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 261
this section we detail the key stages required for a successful
co-design process, using the Students Explain Digital
Accessibility video series as an example.

The key stages for the creation of Students Explain Digital
Accessibility were:

   planning and setting clear objectives
   recruiting participants
   creating a safe space
   collaborating and designing
   getting feedback.

Planning and setting clear objectives

It is important to have an idea of the goals you are aiming to
achieve from the beginning so that you can:

   streamline decision-making by having a clear direction
      and focus

   align all stakeholders' expectations so that everyone is on
      the same page

   set your target audience so you can take a user-centred
      approach

   develop an evaluation strategy to measure if you are
      successful.

For Students Explain Digital Accessibility, our objective was
to create a suite of videos targeting academics and learning
and teaching staff to build a better understanding of the
importance of accessibility in digital learning environments. To
do this, we knew we wanted to recruit a number of students
with lived experience of disability to help us develop the

262 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
content and appear in the videos to demonstrate how they are
impacted by inaccessible content.

To help communicate this and ensure that the project team
was on the same page, we developed a project brief. In our
project brief we articulated the overarching principles of our
project:

Extract from Students Explain Digital Accessibility project
brief:

Our project is guided by two overarching principles. The first
is a slogan often associated with international disability rights
movements, `Nothing About Us Without Us', which declares
that the structural inequities produced by disability oppression
cannot be dismantled without the involvement of those with
lived experience (Charlton, 1998, p. 3). The alignment of our
project with this statement necessitates the involvement of the
people who are most severely affected by the issue that we
seek to address, being students with disabilities, and positions
their voices and experiences as the most essential component
of the project. Our second guiding principle, which we often
employ in our own accessibility training for academics, is that
accessibility benefits all, is critical for some, and should be
recognised as a tool for enhancing digital learning
environments. This stance is well supported in scholarship on
inclusive/universal design (Gilbert, 2019, p. 25).

By setting out the objectives and principles at the beginning,
we were able to make decisions easily, provide clear
instructions for the students we worked with and map out our
project from beginning to end.

Recruiting participants

Compensation for participation

McKercher (2020) argues that in an authentic co-design
process, `co-designers must be recognised for their time and
not coerced into volunteering'.

Students should always be paid for work they do, especially
students from marginalised groups like those with lived
experience of disability. Students should only be involved in
projects when they can be appropriately compensated.

For the Students Explain Digital Accessibility we originally
applied for a UTS Social Impact Grant in 2020. These are $5,000
grants offered annually and administered through the Centre
for Social Justice & Inclusion to support researchers and
practitioners at UTS to maximise their contribution to positive
social change.

While our grant submission was unsuccessful (in part because
the work we were proposing was best covered by available
institutional funding rather than that particular grant
program), we were able to secure funding through the Centre
for Social Justice & Inclusion via the Access & Inclusion Plan.
This demonstrates that it is worth pursuing accessibility and
inclusion projects through multiple avenues and teams should
not be discouraged by initial failure - in short, do not give up.

Some ideas for finding funding include:

   small grant programs either within your institution or
      community grants (check your local council) and

   partnering with other units or organisations that have
      similar aims as your project.

enhance inclusive and accessible learning
Writing inclusive expression of interest/job
advertisements

It is important to be mindful of appropriate language when you
are crafting the job advertisement or expression of interest for
your co-design project. This will be the first impression of the
project and project team for the person with lived experience,
and it will be more effective and trustworthy for potential
applicants if recruitment information is written inclusively, with
clear expectations set out for the role. To make the process
positive and productive for your co-design participants, or
students, you need to create a safe space for them to be able to
share their own experiences. This starts with the language you
use when you are recruiting them, so it is important that you
set the correct tone and use person-first language.

Some tips for structuring the expression of interest/job
advertisement for your participants include:

   Use person-first language, such as `person with a
      disability' rather than `disabled person', as some people do
      not identify as being `disabled'. Appropriate language may
      differ depending on the context or the people you are
      working with. People who have the same disability or
      medical condition might prefer different language, so it is
      best to start with person-first language or ask people their
      preference.

   Start with the context of the project and the types of lived
      experience you need to fulfil the overall objectives of the
      project.

   Set the expectations of the role beyond their lived
      experience. For example, have criteria for the person that
      include the types of lived experience the project requires
      in addition to other skills or experiences they will need. For
      example: Will they need to collaborate? Will they need to

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 265
      be able to share their experiences? Will they need to learn
      new skills?
   Include the remuneration information and how the
      successful candidates will be compensated for their time
      and expertise.
   Include a position description so people are clear on the
      tasks that are going to be required of them.
   Do not ask people to disclose any medical or personal
      information. It is none of your business. Even if you need
      someone with specific lived experience, outline what
      types of experiences you are looking for, and then ask the
      candidates to tell you why they would be suitable for the
      role. This will allow them to disclose as much information
      as is relevant and/or they are comfortable with.

For example, for the Students Explain Digital Accessibility
videos in the job advertisement, where we were looking for our
Digital Accessibility Ambassadors, we outlined the project thus:

          The LX.lab is looking for current UTS students, with lived
          experience of disability, to become Digital Accessibility
          Ambassadors. This is a paid, short-term role to assist the
          LX.lab to create video resources on digital accessibility
          for academics across UTS.

We were clear that we were looking for students with
experience or some familiarity with using assistive technology,
or lived experience of disability, and who had some knowledge
of digital access requirements and accommodations. However,
they also needed to be capable of working collaboratively, of
reflecting on and sharing experiences and opinions, and be
willing to be the voice/talent/narrator for video content and to
offer feedback and critique on work.

It is also important that you make sure that the recruitment
process is accessible for your potential participants, so make

266 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
sure you ask them if they have any access requirements. Be
clear that this is to ensure they have an accessible experience
and that the information is not going to be used to inform
recruitment decisions.

Privacy is another big part of recruiting people with lived
experience. Not all people with disabilities want to disclose
details of their conditions or whether they have a disability, and
it is vital to respect and understand people's wishes in these
circumstances.

Sourcing participants

When the time comes to source your participants, it is helpful
to partner with a team or organisation that helps support
people with disabilities to help spread the word. In our
experience, people in these types of teams/organisations are
happy to share information about paid opportunities.

For this project, we were supported by the university's
Accessibility Services team who are the central contact point
for all students living with one or more disabilities, or ongoing
medical or mental health conditions. For Students Explain
Digital Accessibility, we were able to share our job
advertisement for our Digital Accessibility Ambassadors with
the Accessibility Services team to send out to students who are
registered with the service. We also shared it with the Careers
Team, in case there were students with lived experience of
disability who were not registered.

Depending on your context, recruitment might look different.
If you work in the tertiary sector, you could ask whether your
in-house accessibility support staff are able to assist you with
distributing job advertisements. If you do not have an in-house
accessibility team that you could partner with, you could look

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 267
into organisations that help support people with lived
experience of disabilities. Some Australia-wide organisations
include:

   Australian Network on Disability
   Deaf Australia
   Hearing Australia
   Neurodiversity Hub
   Vision Australia.

Creating a safe space

An effective co-design experience requires that all your
participants feel psychologically safe, so that they are able to
bring their authentic selves and collaborate and engage freely,
without the fear of judgement. In order to do that, you need
to prioritise relationships with your participants (one of the
principles of our co-design approach). This includes giving your
participants the space to be heard, and genuinely listening to
them.

Some other considerations to be mindful of include:

   modelling inclusive practices (beyond accessibility)
   implementing inclusive practices and everyone's access

      requirements
   structuring sessions in a way to encourage collaboration.

Modelling inclusive practices (beyond
accessibility)

People's lives and experiences are intersectional, and so it is

268 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
important to model inclusive practices outside of accessibility,
while also considering the ways in which intersecting identities
can affect a student's accessibility requirements. For example,
an Acknowledgement of Country that recognises the
traditional owners of the land on which you are holding your
sessions is generally a respectful gesture (particularly in an
Australian context, though this can also be appropriate in other
locations). You can also be inclusive of LGBTQIA+ participants,
and if you are comfortable to announce your own pronouns,
include pronouns on name tags or on the online platform you
are using like Zoom, provide opportunities for participants to
specify their own pronouns, and ensure that you use the
correct pronouns when communicating with participants.

Implementing inclusive practices

Before the session:

   Create accessible workshop materials.
   Share documents and slides beforehand to give people

      time to prepare; especially if they use assistive technology,
      it is good for them to have a copy that they can use with
      their assistive technology.
   Ensure the room and facilities are accessible, e.g., if you
      have students who use wheelchairs or other mobility aids.
   Turn on captions (this can be useful in hybrid, face-to-face
      and online sessions).

During the session:

   Use a microphone for hearing augmentation and to
      enhance sound clarity.

   Give participants multiple ways of engaging with the
      session (e.g., by writing/typing as well as verbal).

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 269
   Provide opportunities for people to reflect individually
      before discussing in smaller groups.

   Schedule regular breaks during the session and
      encourage people to take breaks whenever they need.

   Narrate what is on the screen. Do not assume everyone
      can see what is happening on your screen and describe
      essential visual content.

   Provide clear instructions, with unambiguous, specific
      questions.

Implement access requirements for all
participants

Once you have asked participants about access requirements
that might impact their participation, take the time to make
sure that these requirements are met.

If you know that someone is using assistive technology, make
sure you adjust the technology you are using so it will work for
all participants. You can also make sure that in their group they
have a scribe and/or reader, and that they can also read other
people's responses (it will not be enough to only assist with
input of information; they will also need to know about other
participant contributions to be able to fully participate).

Getting feedback and sense-checking with
participants

As co-design is about designing with and not for, it is important
that participants are given the opportunity to provide feedback
on the final product/service/video that is created.

270 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
The structure of the Students Explain
Digital Accessibility co-design process

We ran three collaborative sessions where we as facilitators
were able to learn from the students, in addition to providing
opportunities for them to learn new skills and connect with
one another. The following list shows how we structured the
sessions and phases of the project:

   Collaborative session one: responding to the accessible
      content practices

   Project team: content planning
   Collaborative session two: script- writing
   Individual: script- writing and check-ins
   Individual: filming
   Project team: editing
   Collaborative session three: feedback and blog- writing

      workshop
   Individual: blog-writing
   Launch event

Collaborative session one: Responding to
the accessible content practices

During the first session, we ran an icebreaker activity to ensure
that our five Digital Accessibility Ambassadors were introduced
and felt comfortable working together.

We then provided context for the type of work we do in the
LX.lab and our proposed plan for the videos. As we were
intending to put the videos on the LX at UTS website, alongside
our accessible content practices, we provided participants with
an overview of each of the content practices. We then asked

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 271
them to individually draw on their own experiences, explicitly
stating that there were no wrong answers and that they should
not feel pressured to come up with answers if they were not
sure or did not have any personal experience with a particular
practice. This was completed in a shared Google doc.

After allowing ten minutes for individual work and reflection on
each accessible practice, we then discussed it as a wider group.
This provided the students with multiple ways of engaging
in the session, in addition to having time to collect their own
thoughts and ideas and prepare for the group discussion.

This section created space for participants to share their
expertise based on their own lived experience. We were there
to learn from them, to create a safe space and facilitate the
conversation. Listening and valuing participants' experiences is
a key task for a facilitator.

Project team: Content planning

After the Digital Accessibility Ambassadors shared their
thoughts and opinions on the accessible content practices, it
was our opportunity to provide our expertise in video creation
and online content. The project team used responses from the
students to plan and structure the videos - their expertise also
helped us to refine our scope. For example, we removed a video
from our plans when we found that the topic did not resonate
with the participants.

During this time, we created our script template that would
remain consistent across the series. This template, or shell, was
used as scaffolding for the students to articulate their own
experiences.

272 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
Collaborative session two: Script-writing

During our second collaborative session we shared the
template script with the students. We provided advice on
script-writing and allocated time in the session for individual
work on scripts. The participants made decisions and were in
control of the content of the scripts that would be used in the
final videos.

The second session was also adjusted to meet changed access
requirements, as one participant needed to attend online. This
introduced us to the process of creating an accessible hybrid
meeting. While our set-up was not particularly well-suited for
the purpose, we were able to make adequate changes to
ensure that accessibility requirements of both the online
participant and those attending in person were met. Our
lesson from the experience was that it is always worth taking
the time to explore different ways of providing accessibility.

Learnings from our collaborative sessions

As discussed earlier in this chapter, people with lived
experience of disability have insight that can only be gained
through that lived experience. While we had knowledge of
generally accepted accessibility standards, online learning
during the COVID-19 pandemic had revealed further barriers
that had perhaps not been fully explored before this time.
Some of the issues raised in our discussions throughout the
project were:

   the importance of clear, good- quality audio in both
      recorded lectures and online classes facilitated via
      platforms like Zoom and Microsoft Teams.

   a typically low usage of captions and transcripts that

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 273
      impacted learning, not only for students with hearing loss
      but also for students living with other types of disabilities.
   a feeling of disconnection and lack of engagement with
      online learning.
   disorganised file management in digital learning
      management systems, which led to issues in finding tasks
      and details of assessments.
   poorly formatted documents lacking in readability.

Collaborative session three: Feedback and
blog-writing workshop

After filming and editing were completed, we ran our final
collaborative session with the students. This involved showing
them rough cuts of the videos, soliciting feedback from the
group and ensuring that we were representing them in
accordance with their personal preferences. This is an
important part of the process and is a way to share power with
your participants.

During this session we also ran a blog-writing workshop, so
that the students could write their own blog posts to promote
the video series. This provided further opportunity to amplify
their voices and be able to tell their stories to the learning and
teaching community in a more flexible format.

Other ways to enhance inclusive learning

Nothing beats working with people with lived experience and
being able to fully immerse yourself in a co-design process - we
cannot stress enough the richness that comes from working
with people with lived experience. However, it is
understandable that not all projects can be given the
resourcing (both time and money) for co-design. Co-design
may also not be appropriate for all-inclusive practice projects,
depending on circumstances like project length, expected
output, stakeholders and other factors. Consider the
suggestions below as alternative ways to create and engage
with accessibility practice:

Familiarise yourself with accessibility standards

Education providers have a legal obligation to take reasonable
steps to enable students with a disability to participate in
education on the same basis as a student without a disability.
The two key state and federal legislation that you need to know
about are:

   Disability Discrimination Act 1992 (Cth)
   Disability Standards for Education 2005 (Cth)

For learning designers, this includes designing inclusive and
accessible learning online learning environments.

The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are the

   Working with students with lived experience of disability to enhance
                                                inclusive and accessible learning | 275
international standards when it comes to web accessibility.
They are important for learning designers to know. They can
be overwhelming when you first encounter them, so if you are
new to accessibility you can start with the basics like the UTS
Accessible Content Practices.

Try using assistive technology, or your keyboard
only to access content

If you have designed a learning experience for students, try
accessing it using a screen reader, other type of assistive
technology or just your keyboard. While testing with a native
user will provide more value, having first-hand experience can
give you a better understanding of how they operate.

Screen readers, especially those designed for people with low
vision, tend to require a steep learning curve, but they will
provide you with a better insight for designing. A user
experience that works with a screen reader is likely to work for
all your students. NVDA is a free screen reader for Windows,
and Mac has many native accessibility features.

Use accessibility checkers and simulators (but
don't rely on them alone)

Many programs have an in-built accessibility checker. It is
important to use these tools in order to capture accessibility
issues that can be checked programmatically, such as missing
alternative text on images, colour contrast issues or heading
levels not being used sequentially. However, they cannot
understand your purpose or context so they will not be able to
determine if your alternative text is meaningful, or whether you

276 | Working with students with lived experience of disability to
enhance inclusive and accessible learning
have structured your document appropriately using heading
levels.

There are also a number of simulators available that can
simulate different types of disabilities like colour vision
deficiency, which can be helpful in selecting colour
combinations.

Find information and content from people with
lived experience

If you cannot work directly with students, there is still an
abundance of online content created by people with lived
experience. Seek out, read, and learn more.

Conclusion

Accessibility is a vital part of the big picture of inclusivity and
diversity. All people working in higher education play an
important role in advocating for and improving accessibility,
and ensuring that the voices of people with lived experience of
disability are included in planning and design processes makes
this practice more effective. Learning designers are particularly
well positioned to ensure that accessibility is considered from
the outset, and is embedded consistently in university learning
experiences. We encourage all learning and teaching
practitioners to take the time to learn about accessible
practices, look for opportunities to include students with lived
experience and make accessibility a permanent priority in their
practice.

Engaging staff in
inclusive learning
design

BRUNA CONTRO PRETERO

Introduction

I find that discussions about accessibility and inclusive learning
design are often best illustrated through the analogy of baking
a cake. Frequently, especially regarding digital accessibility,
learning experiences are designed only for accessibility to be
considered as an afterthought. Incorporating accessibility at a
later stage can be either impractical or excessively costly. To
put it into perspective, with digital products (such as software
and websites) as an example, rectifying an accessibility issue
in the final product might incur a cost of up to 30 times the
investment required for integrating accessibility from the
outset (Gualtieri, 2011). This issue persists in the domain of
learning design as well. When accessibility isn't a foundational
consideration, rectifying problems at a later stage inevitably
becomes more costly than if an inclusive design approach had
been embraced from the start (Burgstahler & Doe, 2015).

282 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
      Vignette 1: A costly oversight

       Once I was tasked with rendering a large council
       paper accessible. Unfortunately, accessibility was
       not prioritised from the document's inception; it
       was only addressed at the end. What should have
       taken minutes at the document's outset - e.g.,
       adjusting styles, headings and creating an
       accessibility plan - resulted in three more days of
       work. When seen in context, this scenario not only
       caused delays in other tasks but also inflated the
       final document's cost far beyond what would have
       been required had accessibility been incorporated
       during the planning stage.

Here's where the cake analogy proves invaluable.

Imagine building or creating your accessible learning
experience (e.g., an online learning module, a multimedia
resource, an alternative assessment) much like baking a cake.
Often, accessibility is treated as an optional embellishment
during the design phase. Essentially, the learning experience
is built, and afterwards, considerations are made for
incorporating certain accessible elements (such as checking
colour contrast and looking at alternative text) (Burgstahler &
Cory, 2010; Burgstahler & Doe, 2015). Using the cake analogy,
accessibility in this example would resemble the decorative
sprinkles on the top of the cake - something that's added for
decoration right at the end. However, for any learning
experience to genuinely achieve accessibility, it must be a
fundamental ingredient, just like adding baking powder to the

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 283
cake batter. Without baking powder, the cake may rise and
taste okay, but the reality remains that only a limited audience
would truly enjoy it. This is how I perceive accessibility - as one
of the main ingredients, and not an optional extra.

Similarly, even when the intent to integrate accessibility is
present from the beginning, its actual inclusion might get
delayed (Beetham & Sharpe, 2013). These setbacks often stem
from the complexities of incorporating Universal Design for
Learning (UDL), for example, and digital accessibility principles
into practice, which demand thoughtful considerations and
can momentarily stall projects (Burgstahler & Cory, 2010). The
challenge intensifies if designers still haven't fully integrated
inclusion and accessibility into their personal approach to
learning design.

      Vignette 2: The rushed decision

       In my role as an educational designer, I once
       collaborated with an academic seeking to revamp
       the presentation of biological/biochemical cycles for
       their students. This request came just a week before
       their content deadline. While accessibility always
       formed the bedrock of my design principles, in the
       urgency of the moment, I overlooked discussing it
       before delving into the design with the academic.
       We both found the idea of a drag and drop activity
       appealing, as it promised immediate feedback and
       an engaging way for students to test their
       understanding.

284 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
       However, upon reflection during the design process,
       I realised that drag and drop activities inherently
       pose accessibility challenges. Such tasks can be
       exclusionary for visually impaired students or those
       reliant on keyboard-only navigation. Despite the
       hours we'd already invested in conceptualising this
       activity, I decided to supplement the drag and drop
       with a detailed textual description of the cycle. Both
       the academic and I recognised the limitations of the
       activity and committed to revisiting and refining
       this approach for the course's next iteration.
       In hindsight, I could have:

             Enlightened the academic about the
                accessibility challenges associated with drag
                and drop activities.

             Considered alternative engagement tools
                from the outset.

       Thus, when collaborating with academics and other
       subject matter experts (SMEs) on content and
       activity design, always ponder:
       How can I ensure accessibility and inclusivity are
       central to this discussion?
       Am I unintentionally setting up barriers that might
       hinder student participation or engagement with
       this choice of activity?

Baking the cake is only one part of the challenge. Serving the
cake is as vital as baking it. Have you ever designed an inclusive
learning object that was pedagogically robust and fit for
purpose and yet struggled to gain support from fellow learning

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 285
designers, academics and SMEs to implement it?
Unfortunately, this is a more prevalent challenge than one
might assume. Often, we focus heavily on the product's design,
neglecting the strategy for implementation and adoption. That
is, we plan to bake the cake but don't necessarily think about
how, when and to whom we might serve it.

      Vignette 3: The power of relationships

       In one instance, I was tasked with developing and
       implementing a template for a learning
       management system (LMS) course site. This
       template encompassed all the essential elements
       for an effective and inclusive LMS course site:
       consistency and clarity in content organisation,
       accessibility-conscious and user-friendly interactive
       elements, engaging activities, etc. While academics
       recognised the template's benefits, its spontaneous
       adoption was minimal. Those who did embrace it
       were primarily academics with whom we had
       established a rapport. Before rolling out the
       template, we engaged these academics, guiding
       them through the process and illustrating how its
       usage would benefit them and their students. The
       successful adoption of the templates by these
       academics was only possible because we identified
       their needs and were able to `serve them the cake'
       in a way that seemed meaningful and relevant to
       them. Drawing from this experience and numerous
       others, I've become very mindful of how I promote

286 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
       the resources I create. These considerations now
       influence the planning phase of any project I
       undertake, acknowledging that, much like the cake,
       how I serve it holds equal importance.
       So, when working on inclusive learning design
       projects, always ask yourself:

             Do I know the needs of the academics and
                learning designers I am engaging with?

             How can I align their needs to what this
                learning experience has to offer?

             How can I make this learning experience
                relevant to academics and fellow learning
                designers involved in the project to increase
                buy-in?

             How can I be explicit in demonstrating the
                value proposition of this new learning object?

This chapter adopts the above-mentioned cake analogy to
delve into the planning, creation and implementation stages
of an inclusive learning design project. Just as we meticulously
plan, bake and serve a cake, we should similarly address each
phase of our inclusive learning design projects.

A recipe for success: Planning for inclusive
learning design

Baking a cake requires careful planning and consideration of
key ingredients. The same is true for the process of designing
an inclusive learning experience. In this section, we'll follow

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 287
the cake recipe analogy - exploring the essential questions of
what, who, how and why - to guide us through the crucial
planning stages of inclusive learning design. We'll then delve
into the ingredients necessary for creating a rich and authentic
learning experience that resonates with all learners.
We will use the example of creating an inclusive and accessible
online learning module in this chapter to illustrate the cake
analogy. Consider the following scenario:

      Scenario

       You are a member of the learning design team at a
       prestigious higher education institution. Your task is
       to collaborate with one or more subject matter
       experts (SMEs) to develop an online learning
       module. This module is designed to seamlessly
       replace a series of traditional lectures, presenting
       students with a rich and engaging exploration into
       dermatology and skin conditions. Below, we will dive
       into the essential steps you, as a learning designer,
       need to navigate to effectively plan and design this
       online module. Alongside each section (what, who,
       how and why), you'll encounter a checklist, detailed
       much like a well-curated recipe, acting as a concise
       guide to assist you in creating an online learning
       experience that is both impactful and inclusive.

288 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
What: Defining the online learning module

In the world of inclusive learning design, the `what' refers to the
learning module itself. What are the learning objectives? What
content needs to be covered? What are the desired outcomes
for learners? Just as a cake has a unique flavour and design,
your learning module should have a distinct educational
flavour that aligns with your objectives. Outline the key
concepts and topics you intend to cover. This stage sets the
foundation for everything that follows. Here, you also begin
forging meaningful connections with your fellow learning
designers, academics and additional SMEs - after all, `serving
the cake' truly commences during its preparation.

In this context, as a learning designer your first step is to hold
collaborative meetings with your SMEs to delve into the core
of your learning module. Your primary goal in this stage is
to identify what students should be able to achieve after
completing the module. For instance, should they be able to
identify the different layers and structures of the skin? Evaluate
skin conditions and recognise potential signs of infections and
infestations? Integrate these concepts with others learned in
other courses during their degree? Be able to apply diagnostic
principles and describe the best course of action? Or all of the
above? All these learning outcomes need to be documented.

Once the learning outcomes are fleshed out, it is important
to understand what content and scaffolding students would
need to achieve these goals. During these preliminary
discussions with the SMEs, the objective is to grasp the
learning goals and content scope, which shapes the trajectory
of the module's development. Additionally, building rapport
with your collaborators is vital from the outset. Understanding
their perspectives and needs ensures a cohesive approach.
Such relationships enhance collaboration throughout the

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 289
project, allowing you to tailor the module in a manner that
resonates with their expectations and expertise.

      Checklist

       ( ) Schedule initial collaborative meetings with
       SMEs.
       ( ) Clearly define and document the module's
       learning outcomes.
       ( ) Understand the core content to be covered in the
       module.
       ( ) Understand the needs and scaffolding required
       for learners to achieve the desired learning
       outcomes.
       ( ) Foster initial relationships with collaborators for a
       cohesive design approach.

Who: Identifying stakeholders

Like determining who will enjoy your cake, in the context of
learning design, identifying the `who' is about recognising the
stakeholders you will have to engage with to promote your
online learning module. Who are the academics and
professional staff who need to buy into this module? Consider
their diverse needs, preferences and potential challenges. Just
as you would customise a cake to suit the tastes of your guests,

290 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
tailor your learning module to cater to the needs and
expectations of your fellow learning designers and
collaborators.

In this phase, your foremost responsibility is to delineate a
thorough list of stakeholders invested in the online module's
success. Consider the following:

 1. Academics and SMEs: Their insights are crucial, given
      their subject expertise and understanding of student
      learning in this area. For instance, when developing this
      module, collaboration with a lead academic and several
      other dermatologists - each with distinct specialisations
      and teaching roles - might be essential.

2. Students: As the main consumers of the content, securing
      their initial feedback and understanding their learning
      processes is indispensable. Engaging them as co-
      designers and/or student casuals in the module creation
      can be advantageous.

 3. Technical support teams: These individuals ensure back-
      end functionality and module accessibility. Recognising
      their strengths and limitations is key. Collaborations could
      involve graphic designers, learning technologists and
      specialists in LMS and accessibility. Engaging them from
      the onset is crucial to facilitate the module's seamless
      creation and deployment.

4. Administration (Leadership, Councils, Committees,
      Working Groups, etc.): Their broader institutional
      objectives can offer alignment insights. Is there a
      committee overseeing curriculum alterations, like the
      introduction of new learning modules? Understanding
      your engagement responsibilities and potential
      endorsement requirements for the module with such
      committees is crucial.

 5. External partners: When the module is crafted in
      partnership or under the sponsorship of industry figures,

           Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 291
      understanding their expectations becomes imperative.
      For instance, if dermatologists seem eager to leverage the
      module's content in student placements, they might be
      another stakeholder group you'd have to engage with.

This comprehensive list becomes invaluable during the
module's implementation, providing clarity on stakeholder
preferences, aversions and motivations, thus assisting with
strategy not only for baking the cake but also serving it later.
This knowledge equips you to tailor the module effectively. Just
as you'd avoid making a peanut cake for an allergic friend or
would cater for different dietary requirements when baking a
cake for a birthday party, you can now adapt the module to
address each stakeholder's unique requirements.
With your list in hand, initiate stakeholder engagement
activities, ranging from focus groups and individual meetings
to surveys. As the module evolves, keep stakeholders updated,
integrating their feedback. This cyclical feedback mechanism
not only refines the module but also nurtures a shared sense of
ownership among all participants.

      Checklist

       ( ) Recognise and list all potential stakeholders.

       ( ) Engage with academics and other SMEs for
       content expertise.

       ( ) Gather preliminary feedback from students or

       ( ) Understand technical requirements and
       constraints with support teams.

       ( ) Align with administrative and institutional goals.

       ( ) Factor in expectations of external partners, if any.

       ( ) Keep stakeholders updated and involved
       throughout the process.

How: Designing with universality in mind

The `how' of the cake analogy translates to the design process
in inclusive learning. How will you make your cake? In our
context, how will you design your online learning module? This
is where the principles of UDL come into play. UDL focuses
on creating materials and experiences that are accessible and
effective for a wide range of learners by providing multiple
means of representation, engagement, and action and
expression (CAST, 2018). Just as you carefully select ingredients
for your cake, choose the suitable methods, media and
interactive elements that accommodate diverse learning
preferences and abilities (CAST, 2018).

With this in mind, here are some key considerations:

 1. Research and empathy: Begin by comprehending the
      diverse needs of your learners. This could entail surveys
      tailored for the targeted student cohort, direct interactions
      with students, or examining recent educational resources
      developed for this group to identify challenges they might

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 293
      encounter. For content of a sensitive or explicit nature,
      especially medical visuals, it's prudent to provide content
      warnings, ensuring students are forewarned and can plan
      and prepare before engaging with the topic.
2. Diverse representation: It is essential to diversify content
      delivery. Introduce a blend of text, video, audio and
      interactive simulations, catering to varied learner
      preferences or needs (CAST, 2018; Mayer, 2002). Ground
      your strategies in multimedia and cognitive load theories.
      While it's advantageous to offer diverse content forms, it's
      not necessary to replicate the same information across all
      mediums (Mayer, 2002). For example, when illustrating
      skin infections, a captioned video case study might suffice,
      allowing students multiple engagement points: viewing,
      reading captions, listening or perusing the transcript.
      However, avoid redundant content like duplicating the
      case study in text, video and infographic forms. Aim for
      diverse representation without overwhelming students
      with repetitive content (CAST, 2018; Mayer, 2002).
 3. Engagement and expression strategies: Incorporate a
      diverse array of relevant activities and assessments (CAST,
      2018). Though tools like discussion boards, quizzes, peer
      reviews and project assignments are available, utilise only
      those that align pedagogically with your learning
      outcomes and facilitate varied student expressions (CAST,
      2018).
4. Accessibility as a priority: Commit to making all materials
      universally accessible (CAST, 2018; W3C, 2022). This
      commitment could entail, but is not limited to, captioned
      videos, textual alternatives for images, and ensuring
      interactive elements are accessible via keyboard
      commands or screen readers and other assistive
      technology (W3C, 2022).
 5. Feedback mechanisms: Champion a culture of ongoing
      feedback from students, discerning the effective

294 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
      components and areas of improvement. Such insights are
      invaluable for module enhancement.
By meticulously embracing these strategies, you guarantee
your online learning module is as universally appealing as a
masterfully crafted cake, satisfying the diverse tastes and
needs of every learner.

      Checklist

       ( ) Anchor the design in UDL principles.
       ( ) Conduct initial research to understand diverse
       learner needs.
       ( ) Ensure diverse content representation (text,
       video, audio, etc.).
       ( ) Avoid redundant content across different
       mediums.
       ( ) Incorporate varied, pedagogically relevant
       activities and assessments.
       ( ) Prioritise accessibility in all materials.
       ( ) Foster a continuous feedback culture.

Why: Clarifying the purpose and benefits

In the cake analogy, the `why' signifies the occasion - a

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 295
birthday party, for instance. Similarly, the `why' in learning
design encompasses the purpose and desired outcomes. Why
are you creating this module? What benefits will it bring to
both the students and the institution? Clearly articulate the
reasons behind your module's existence. This will not only
guide your design decisions, it will also help communicate the
value of your module (`serve the cake') to academics and fellow
professional staff.

In this context, as a learning designer focusing on establishing
the purpose and benefits of your module:

 1. Identify the gap: Examine the current curriculum and
      ascertain any deficiencies or omissions. By recognising
      these gaps, you underscore the significance of the new
      module.

2. Articulate the value: Pinpoint what distinguishes this
      module from a traditional series of lectures. Whether it's
      presenting novel insights, offering adaptability and
      accessibility, or making more space for other equally
      important content to be covered, emphasise its
      distinctiveness.

 3. Implement iterative feedback: Institute a system for
      ongoing feedback, enabling an understanding of the
      module's strengths and areas for improvement, which aids
      in continuous refinement.

4. Engage in ongoing evaluation: Post-launch, periodically
      assess the module's relevance and efficacy. Make requisite
      modifications to align with evolving goals or learner
      needs.

By diligently shaping and revisiting the module's underlying
`why', you solidify its value-driven foundation, benefitting both
learners and the institution. This deliberate crafting, akin to
baking a cake for a special occasion, ensures the module's
enduring resonance and appreciation.

296 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
      Checklist

      ( ) Engage stakeholders to understand the
      module's significance.

       ( ) Identify and document gaps in the current
       curriculum.
       ( ) Articulate the unique value proposition of the
       module.
       ( ) Implement iterative feedback mechanisms.
       ( ) Ensure alignment with broader institutional
       objectives.
       ( ) Regularly communicate the module's purpose to
       stakeholders.
       ( ) Periodically review and refine the module's
       purpose post-launch.

Selecting the ingredients: Accessibility,
pedagogy and technology

Just as a cake requires the right ingredients to taste delightful,
an inclusive learning module needs specific components to be
effective. Accessibility must be woven into your design's fabric,
ensuring all learners can access and engage with the content

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 297
(Burgstahler & Cory, 2010; Burgstahler & Doe, 2015; Rose &
Meyer, 2002; W3C, 2022). A solid pedagogical framework
provides the structure for meaningful learning experiences.
Technology serves as the mixing bowl, enabling you to blend
various elements seamlessly.

Consider your pedagogical approach - how will you engage
learners? What interactive elements will enhance the learning
experience? Integrate technology that supports your
objectives, ensuring it is user-friendly and aligns with
accessibility standards (Beetham & Sharpe, 2013; Rose & Meyer,
2002; W3C, 2022). Just as you fine-tune the balance of flavours
in a cake by adjusting the ingredients, designers should find
the equilibrium between these elements to create a
harmonious learning environment.

Revisiting and drawing upon pedagogical frameworks can
inform your practice and help you use technology in a
meaningful, critical and accessible way within your learning
module (Beetham & Sharpe, 2013). Some examples of these
frameworks include TPACK, which helps you integrate
technology, pedagogy and content knowledge (Koehler &
Mishra, 2008). The SAMR model categorises technology use
into stages, from substitution to redefinition, allowing you to
understand the role technology will play in your module
(Puentedura, 2010). PICRAT is a model that draws attention
to the socio-cultural dimensions of technology in education
(Kimmons, et al., 2020) and Mayer's multimedia theory delves
into cognitive principles in multimedia design (Mayer, 2002). It
is important to note that these are just a few examples of the
many frameworks available to assist you depending on your
pedagogical goals.

For instance, you can leverage Mayer's principles of multimedia
learning when considering the integration of various elements
into your learning module (Mayer, 2002). Just as adding too

298 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
much flour can make your cake dense and dry, overwhelming
your module with excessive text, videos or activities can lead
to cognitive overload for learners (Mayer, 2002). By carefully
selecting and balancing your ingredients, much like ensuring
the right proportions of flour, milk and baking powder in a
cake, you can create a learning experience that is engaging,
effective and conducive to meaningful learning (Mayer, 2002).

As you progress through these planning stages, remember
that just as a cake's success relies on thoughtful preparation, an
inclusive learning module's success hinges on careful planning
and consideration. In the following sections, we'll transition
from planning to the creation stage, where we'll put these
concepts into action, much like mixing the batter and putting
the cake into the oven. By the end of this chapter, you'll have
a well-structured roadmap for engaging staff in designing
inclusive learning experiences that cater to the needs of all
learners.

Baking the inclusive learning module:
From recipe to prototype

With our planning complete, it's time to transition from the
theoretical to the practical - from the recipe in hand to the
actual act of baking. Inclusive learning design, like baking, is
a dynamic process that involves creativity, precision and
attention to detail. In this section, we'll delve into the `baking'
stage of our cake analogy, where we'll transform the
ingredients of planning into a tangible prototype of your online
learning module, all while utilising UDL as our guiding
principle.

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 299
Blending the ingredients: UDL as your base

Universal Design for Learning serves as the foundational recipe
for your inclusive learning module. Just as a cake requires a
well-balanced blend of ingredients, your learning module
demands a thoughtful combination of various UDL principles
- multiple means of representation, engagement, and action
and expression (CAST, 2018). Craft your content in ways that
cater to different learning preferences and abilities. Incorporate
various formats of content presentation - text, images, audio
and video - ensuring that learners have multiple avenues to
access and comprehend the material (CAST, 2018; Dalton &
Smith, 2019).

When incorporating UDL principles into your learning module,
it's important to avoid the pitfall of imbalance. Just like adding
too much sugar can make a cake overly sweet or too many
eggs can make it dense, neglecting or overloading your
module with certain elements can hinder the learning
experience. UDL encourages a balanced approach, similar to
achieving the right blend of ingredients in a cake recipe.
Provide multiple options for engagement, representation, and
action and expression, but do so thoughtfully. Ensure that each
element serves a purpose, aligns with your learning objectives
and doesn't overshadow the others (CAST, 2018; Dalton & Smith,
2019; Rose & Meyer, 2002). In doing so, you'll create a learning
experience that respects the diverse needs and preferences
of your learners while maintaining a balanced and effective
module design, much like achieving the perfect cake texture
through a harmonious blend of ingredients.

300 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
      Checklist

       ( ) Use Universal Design for Learning as your
       foundational design principle.

       ( ) Integrate UDL guidelines to cater to different
       learning preferences.

       ( ) Employ diverse content formats like text, images,
       audio and video.

       ( ) Aim for a balanced approach, ensuring each
       element serves a purpose and aligns with your
       pedagogical goals.

Taste as you cook: The importance of
prototyping

Imagine you're using a cake recipe for the first time. Before
you present the final product, you likely create a prototype to
ensure that the flavours and textures are just right. Similarly,
in learning design, prototyping is a crucial step. As you create
your online learning module, build a prototype to test its
functionality and effectiveness (Brown & Green, 2016). This
prototype acts as a working draft that allows you to identify
potential challenges and areas for improvement (Brown &
Green, 2016).

Just as you could bake a small version of your final birthday
cake, or test the batter mixture quickly by baking a mug cake

           Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 301
in your microwave or using an air fryer, you can design the
outline and skeleton of your learning module with your main
ideas and activities (Brown & Green, 2016). By doing so, you
can get some early feedback from students and stakeholders
before investing in the creation of the entire module (Brown &
Green, 2016). This prototype serves as a valuable testing ground,
allowing you to make necessary adjustments, refine your
approach, and ensure that the final product meets the desired
learning objectives (Brown & Green, 2016). Much like tasting a
small sample of your cake batter to make adjustments before
baking the full cake, prototyping in learning design allows you
to fine-tune your module for a more successful and engaging
learning experience.

      Checklist

       ( ) Think about simpler ways of representing your
       ideas for the module (e.g., storyboarding, designing
       one section of the module, outlining a skeleton for
       the module).
       ( ) Discuss these ideas with your stakeholders.
       ( ) Engage in this process as many times as needed
       before progressing to building the entire module.

Adjust to taste: Engaging with feedback

Just as you might gather feedback on your cake prototype
from taste testers, your learning module prototype needs input

302 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
from learners, academics and professional staff. Seek feedback
on the design and overall user experience. This iterative process
ensures that your learning module becomes a finely tuned
creation that resonates with its audience and your learners
and reflects the needs of your stakeholders. Incorporate
suggestions and address concerns to refine your prototype
further (Fisher & Wright, 2010).

Much like refining a cake recipe based on feedback from a
panel of tasters, incorporating suggestions and addressing
concerns raised by students and stakeholders enables you to
refine your prototype further. By actively involving a range of
individuals in the testing and feedback process, you increase
the likelihood of creating a highly effective and user-friendly
online learning experience that meets the needs and
expectations of all stakeholders (Fisher & Wright, 2010).

      Checklist

       ( ) Gather feedback on the design and user
       experience of the learning module prototype from
       students, academics and staff.

       ( ) Be prepared to engage in consultation more
       broadly if needed.

       ( ) Use an iterative feedback process to refine the
       prototype based on suggestions and concerns.

       ( ) Make adjustments that align with the needs and
       expectations of students and stakeholders to create
       a better online learning experience.

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 303
Baking for all tastes: Fine-tuning for
accessibility

You adjust to achieve the desired taste and texture as you bake
your cake. Similarly, when creating your learning module
prototype, pay special attention to accessibility. Ensure that all
learners can interact with the content seamlessly, regardless of
their abilities (Dalton & Smith, 2019). Incorporate features such
as alternative text for images, closed captions for videos, and
keyboard-friendly navigational elements. Just as a well-baked
cake delights all taste buds, an accessible learning module
accommodates all learning needs (Burgstahler & Doe, 2015;
CAST, 2018).

Incorporating well-established guidelines, such as the Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 and the Authoring
Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG), can significantly improve
the accessibility of your module (W3C, 2022). By revisiting the
key accessibility principles and considering these guidelines
during the development phase, you can ensure that your
module is inclusive and user-friendly for a wider audience
(W3C, 2022). It's also essential to be prepared to differentiate
and adjust aspects of your module as specific accessibility
needs and issues arise during user testing (Burgstahler & Doe,
2015). Like adjusting a recipe to accommodate different dietary
preferences and requirements, such as using lactose-free or
soy milk when baking a cake for a lactose-intolerant friend,
addressing unique accessibility challenges ensures that your
online learning experience considers the diverse requirements
of your learners (Burgstahler & Doe, 2015). By actively engaging
with accessibility principles and guidelines and being
adaptable in your approach, you can create a learning module
that is accessible and user-friendly for all (W3C, 2022).

304 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
Checklist

( ) Embed accessible practices throughout your
module (e.g., alternative text, closed captions,
transcripts, etc.)
( ) Review well-established guidelines and digital
accessibility principles to ensure optimal
accessibility.
( ) Be ready to adjust the module according to new
or specific needs and access requirements.

Vignette 4: The free fall

A few years ago, I was given the responsibility of
finalising a project that aimed to replace traditional
lectures with a set of online learning modules. The
project was initially assigned to a fellow learning
designer who was leaving our team. I received the
handover notes and access to the learning modules
and was asked to add the finishing touches and

 Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 305
       elements to each of them. Due to the project's tight
       deadlines, I had to work quickly and relied heavily on
       the handover notes and existing resources to
       complete the modules. Once I finished, I reached
       out to our SME to gather some final feedback, and
       that's when I learned that the modules did not
       achieve the intended outcomes and lacked
       sufficient content. As a result, a complete redesign
       was necessary, which inevitably led to a delayed
       launch date.

       This experience taught me the importance of
       feedback and consultation throughout the design
       process, from start to finish. Active engagement
       with stakeholders and careful consideration of their
       feedback is crucial for ensuring that the module not
       only meets its intended purpose but also satisfies
       the needs and expectations of SMEs.

       So, when engaging in inclusive learning design
       process make sure you ask yourself:

             How can I create a prototype of my learning
                design object that showcases my ideas to all
                stakeholders?

             Have I considered the goals of the project and
                the expectations and needs of students and
                stakeholders?

             How do I best engage with students and
                stakeholders for feedback?

             Have I consulted with students and
                stakeholders alike during all steps of the
                project?

306 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
             Have I addressed their feedback, suggestions
                and concerns?

Serving the inclusive learning experiences:
Strategies for engaging staff

After several rounds of prototyping, testing and refining, your
cake is ready for its grand presentation. Similarly, your inclusive
learning module, now well-constructed and refined, is ready to
be shared with your target audience.

In this section, we'll explore the importance of effectively
presenting your inclusive learning module to academic and
professional staff. Just as a beautifully decorated cake is a visual
delight, a well-designed learning module, when introduced
strategically, can capture the attention and engagement of
your stakeholders (Brown & Green, 2016).

With your prototype honed through the iterative process and
your learning module ready for presentation, you're one step
closer to successfully engaging staff in the realm of inclusive
learning design. Through the lens of our cake analogy, you've
successfully navigated the stages of planning and baking, each
contributing to creating a rich and impactful learning
experience.

Having successfully baked and refined your inclusive learning
module, it's time to shift our attention to the crucial task of
serving it. Just as a beautifully baked cake deserves to be
presented and appreciated by many, your thoughtfully

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 307
designed learning module awaits its moment of impact. In this
section, we'll explore the intricacies of serving your inclusive
learning experience to professional and academic staff,
ensuring your creation is acknowledged and embraced.

Tailoring to the audience: An analogy of
cake presentation

When serving cake at a birthday party, considerations for
guests' comfort and preferences are paramount. Children
might require sturdier surfaces, paper plates and utensils that
match their dexterity, while adults could probably manage
with only a few serviettes. Translating this to your inclusive
product, you must adapt your approach to resonate with your
target groups. Your online learning module, video content, or
alternative assessment may require different modes of
presentation to secure the necessary buy-in and usage.

For simplicity, we'll focus on two key audiences: professional
and academic staff, often at the forefront of a learning
designer's engagement.

Engaging professional staff: Applying a
f ramework

When embarking on the journey of engaging professional staff,
a well-constructed framework acts as a steady guide, ensuring
a strategic and holistic approach. This proposed framework
resembles the carefully constructed recipe one follows to
create a culinary masterpiece. Within this framework, every
step is orchestrated to foster understanding, collaboration and
commitment, ultimately leading to the effective adoption of

308 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
your inclusive learning module. Let's delve deeper into each
facet of this framework:

       A. Scoping research
       B. Creating interest, accountability and momentum
       C. Offering training and support -- training the
       trainer
       D. Dividing and conquering

A. Scoping research: Understanding the terrain

Imagine embarking on a culinary adventure in an unfamiliar
kitchen. Before selecting ingredients and techniques, you
explore the kitchen's layout, your tools and the culinary
preferences of your audience. Similarly, in the context of
engaging professional staff, conducting comprehensive
scoping research is the essential groundwork. Dive into their
work and identify their specific needs, challenges and
aspirations. This research is the foundation for your
engagement strategy. Start early and integrate throughout the
entire process.

B. Creating interest, accountability and
momentum: Igniting the appetite

In the culinary realm, a skilled chef knows that presenting a
visually enticing dish ignites diners' appetites. Similarly, in the

          Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 309
world of professional staff engagement, capturing attention
and interest is paramount. Demonstrate the significance of
your inclusive learning module by showcasing its direct
relevance to their work. Illustrate how it can elevate their
teaching effectiveness and enhance student learning
outcomes. Additionally, establish a sense of shared ownership
and responsibility by involving them in the decision-making
process. As they become co-creators, their engagement
naturally deepens, fostering a sense of accountability and
investment.

C. Offering training and support -- training the
trainer: Nurturing expertise

Just as a seasoned chef imparts culinary techniques to junior
chefs, nurturing expertise is critical to your engagement
framework. For instance, assemble a subset of fellow learning
designers and provide them with comprehensive training on
the nuances of your inclusive learning module. This `train the
trainer' approach empowers them to become advocates and
ambassadors (Brown & Green, 2016). Armed with knowledge,
they can effectively disseminate information, train their peers
and provide ongoing support. This strategy not only cultivates
a knowledge-sharing culture, it also fosters a collaborative
atmosphere where expertise is nurtured collectively.

D. Dividing and conquering: Collaboration with
precision

In a bustling kitchen, culinary creations come to life through
precise coordination and delegation. Similar precision is
needed when engaging professional staff. As you implement
your inclusive learning module, break down the journey into

310 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
manageable and actionable steps. Assign different tasks to
various team members based on their strengths and expertise.
Encourage collaboration, allowing each individual to
contribute in ways that resonate with their skills. This collective
effort not only expedites the implementation process but also
fosters a dynamic environment where diverse perspectives
enrich the overall outcome.

As you apply these steps within the proposed framework,
envision yourself orchestrating a culinary symphony, each note
harmonising to produce a delightful experience. By the time
you've engaged professional staff, the groundwork for the
successful integration of your inclusive learning module will
be firmly in place. In the forthcoming section, we'll turn our
attention to academic staff, exploring how to tailor your
approach to garner their enthusiastic participation in creating
an inclusive learning environment that caters to the diverse
needs of their students. Just as a perfectly executed dish
delights the senses, your strategic engagement with staff will
create a harmonious and impactful learning experience.

Engaging academic staff: A tailored
approach

Navigating the landscape of engaging academic staff requires
finesse and customisation, much like crafting an intricate dish
to suit varying palates. Just as a skilled chef tailors flavours to
different diners, you'll tailor your approach to academic staff by
following these proposed steps:

           Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design | 311
       a. Raising awareness and showcasing relevance

       b. Offering small, practical solutions

       c. Assisting integration into routine

       d. Providing avenues and tools for independence

a. Raising awareness and showcasing relevance:
An educational palette

Imagine presenting a sumptuous dish to a connoisseur - your
goal is to help them appreciate the nuanced flavours and
unique combinations. Similarly, when engaging academic
staff, begin by raising awareness about the vital role of inclusive
learning design within academic environments (Brown &
Green, 2016). Present how your learning module seamlessly
aligns with their teaching objectives, enriching the overall
learning experience (Brown & Green, 2016). Much like
presenting a dish's ingredients, showcase the elements that
resonate with their expertise and teaching philosophy. In your
approach, bridge the gap between their existing practices and
the potential of your inclusive learning module, emphasising
how their needs and expectations would be met through the
implementation of the designed experience.

b. Offering small, practical solutions: Culinary
touches of inclusion

Just as a master chef adds subtle seasonings to elevate a dish,

312 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
introduce academic staff to small yet impactful solutions that
enrich their teaching methods. These solutions are like the
delicate seasonings that bring out the best in the main
ingredients. Introduce user-friendly tools that seamlessly
integrate into their existing routines (Brown & Green, 2016). Or,
in our case, introduce ideas of how the designed online module
already incorporates some elements which would usually be
designed separately, such as formative and summative
assessments. These minor adjustments, analogous to culinary
garnishes, hold the potential to significantly enhance the
learning experience. By aligning these solutions with the
academic staff's current practices and pedagogical styles,
you're creating an environment where inclusive practices
naturally integrate, much like flavours melding in a well-cooked
dish.

c. Assisting integration into routine: Guiding the
cooking process

Academic staff benefit from support as they integrate inclusive
design principles and learning experiences into their teaching
routines, much like an apprentice chef benefits from guidance
to master complex techniques. Offer workshops, resources and
1:1 opportunities to ease the transition and implementation
(Brown & Green, 2016). This process is akin to guiding them
through a complex recipe, ensuring every step is executed with
precision (Brown & Green, 2016). In your approach, scaffold
academic staff's integration of inclusive practices, helping
them grow into effective facilitators of inclusive learning
experiences.

d. Provide avenues and tools for independence:
The art of culinary exploration

Just as a chef equips an aspiring cook with essential tools,
empower academic staff to independently implement
inclusive strategies and learning experiences such as your
online module and to even contemplate creating their own.
Provide resources, guidelines and tools that cater to their needs
and scaffold their learning process just like you would scaffold
student learning (Brown & Green, 2016). This stage is
reminiscent of a budding chef taking the skills they've acquired
to embark on their culinary explorations. Similarly, provide
academics with the avenues and tools to experiment and
adapt their practice, ensuring they are confident in their own
abilities and know when, how and who to ask for help. As you
traverse these steps, remember that just as a perfectly
executed dish delights diners' senses, your tailored
engagement with academic staff cultivates an inclusive
learning environment, fostering growth and enriching not only
these relationships but also the overall educational experience
of their students.

Conclusion

In this comprehensive chapter, we have embarked on a journey
guided by the delightful analogy of baking a cake to explore
the intricacies of inclusive learning design. Like baking a cake,
creating inclusive learning experiences requires careful
planning, thoughtful ingredient selection (considering
accessibility, pedagogy and technology), meticulous
prototyping and strategic engagement with staff. Through this
culinary lens, we've unveiled key strategies and practices for
designing, refining and serving inclusive learning modules to

314 | Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive learning design
academic and professional staff. As we reflect on this journey,
several key takeaways emerge.

We have learned that inclusive learning design is a holistic
process that goes beyond creating content. It requires active
engagement with students and stakeholders alike, ongoing
refinement and a commitment to ensuring that the designed
modules truly meet the needs of all learners drawing from UDL
and digital accessibility principles. Most importantly, we have
discussed and demonstrated the importance of considering
accessibility and inclusive design from the beginning, not as
an afterthought. Just as the quality of ingredients affects the
taste of a cake, the inclusivity and accessibility of your learning
design projects profoundly impact the learning experience. By
prioritising inclusion and accessibility in your practice, you
ensure you create experiences that are not only pedagogically
sound, robust and engaging but that are also welcoming and
inclusive of student diversity, regardless of their abilities.

If you are a new learning designer embarking on your inclusive
journey, consider these questions: How can you actively involve
students and stakeholders throughout the design process to
ensure their needs are met? How will you integrate
accessibility principles and inclusive design from the very
beginning? And how can you continually refine and improve
your practice to create truly inclusive learning experiences?
Remember, like a well-baked cake, the journey of inclusive
learning design is both a science and an art, and with
dedication and thoughtful practice, you can create educational
experiences that embrace diversity and enrich the educational
experiences of all learners.

MAIS FATAYER

Not just another textbook

In writing this book our primary aim was to provide a practical
resource for the use of learning designers in higher education.
We concentrated in particular on:

   Addressing the existing gap by providing an open
      textbook that focuses on diversity in learning design
      within the Australasian region.

   Different conceptual frameworks for learning designers
      for designing diverse learning environments, considering
      the challenges prevalent in higher education.

   Providing practical examples, evidence-based solutions,
      and draw from educational theory to shape socially just
      learning experiences.

The process of creating this book was intrinsically rewarding.
By choosing to produce an open textbook, we implicitly
convey our commitment to ongoing development. The shared
characteristics between designing for learning and authoring
open textbooks are their iterative, collaborative, and diverse
nature. Although this is the first edition of the book, we
envision its potential for growth, both within its chapters and
beyond, utilising the 5Rs.

A glimpse of each chapter

In each chapter, we aimed to explore the implications of the

                                                                                 Conclusion | 319
conceptual approach presented for fostering inclusivity and
diversity in learning design, and provide practical examples
and guidelines that learning designers can immediately apply
to their work.

Making socially just pedagogy a reality

In this chapter, Keith and Camille emphasise the importance
of inclusivity, going beyond just accessibility. They argue that
it's vital to create an inclusive learning environment by actively
involving students in the learning process, rather than focusing
solely on individuals or specific groups. They suggest that
learning designers should consider incorporating students as
active partners in the learning ecosystem to facilitate genuine
inclusivity and diversity. To do so, they introduce a framework
that combines Fraser's three dimensions of social justice with
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles and David
Wiley's 5 Rs of Open Education. While Keith and Camille
acknowledge the complexity of these three layers, they stress
the importance of an ongoing and iterative approach to
developing inclusive and socially just learning. Practical
examples are provided to demonstrate how this approach can
be put into practice, with a focus on authentic learning and
student involvement in alignment with the framework.

Designing inclusive learning experience
through open educational practices

Moving forward, Mais delves into Open Educational Practices
(OEP) as a catalyst for designing inclusive and socially just
learning environments. In her chapter she presents practical
approaches for the adoption of OEP in higher education,

320 | Conclusion
offering insights from Australia and other places around the
world. The chapter emphasises that learning designers must
embrace OEP in the design processes, and develop an
understanding of open education fundamentals. Further, the
chapter highlights the benefits of OEP in empowering
academics to update biased curricula, offer opportunities to
decolonise education and foster inclusivity amidst disruptions.

Negotiating the assumptions and identity
tensions surrounding third space
academics/professionals

The next chapter in this sequence, delve deeper into the
professional identity of a learning designer. Through the lens of
Bhabha's concept of ambivalence, the notion of liminal space
and reflecting on her own experience, Puva P Arumugam, the
author of this chapter, sheds light on the challenges and
tensions confronted by third space practitioners in higher
education. These challenges Puva find them arising in the
context of contrasting expectations and assumptions held by
traditional institutional and discipline academics. Key tensions
include the struggle to define the role of learning designers
(LD) within the academic framework versus their professional
identity, which is influenced by cultural factors. Additionally,
this chapter explores the polymathic nature of third space
practitioners' roles, a concept presented by Manoharan (2020).
Being polymathic involves transcending singular specialisation
and operating with a multifaceted expertise. Third space
practitioners, due to their involvement in diverse teaching and
learning projects, often possess in-depth knowledge across
multiple domains of specialisation. This chapter provides a
dynamic and interactive experience, with Puva's voice serving
as a guide through the multifaceted realm of learning

                                                                                 Conclusion | 321
designers. It delves into their professional identity and the
diverse array of skills they contribute to tertiary education.

Indigenous-led learning design:
Reimagining the teaching team

Chapter 5 of this book highlights the remarkable collaboration
between academic subject matter experts, learning design
team, instructional designer and Centre for the Advancement
of Indigenous Knowledges (CAIK) scholars to design and
develop the microcredential, Supervising Indigenous Higher
Degree Research. This exceptional partnership fostered
mutual understanding and a high degree of collegial respect.
Reflecting on the collaboration, Katrina, Shaun, Susan,
highlighted three key factors emerged as driving forces: trust,
iterative discussions, and the combined skills of scholars and
learning designers. The authors further illustrate their design
decisions they made during the process by offering concrete
examples from the subject. These examples showcase their
commitment to presenting content knowledge in compelling
format, their attention to cultural sensitivity, and their skills
in creating online learning experiences that enhance student
engagement and the learning outcomes.

This chapter exemplifies the guiding principle of `Nothing
about us without us' as the team actively engaged in co-
designing the subject with consultations from the Director of
CAIK. Furthermore, the team wholeheartedly embraced the
responsibility of preserving and sharing crucial cultural
knowledge, however, their crucial design decisions are
thoughtfully shared, with the intention of aiding fellow learning
designers undertaking similar projects.

322 | Conclusion
Designing for Equity in Learning

In this chapter, John took us back to his personal learning
experience in such an interesting and insightful way to then
introduce a range of innovative pedagogical strategies aimed
at fostering inclusive and engaging educational environments.
The strategies discussed - Notice and Wonder, the 4Hs of
Belonging Centred Math Instruction, Ingenious Influencers,
and the collaborative online platform Virtual Math Teams (VMT)
- collectively offer practical avenues for educators and learning
designers to enhance teaching practices. Throughout the
chapter, John offers engaging examples that illustrate the
instructional steps for implementing activities. He follows
these with real-life situations from the classroom,
demonstrating how these activities promote inclusivity.

Designing for cultural responsiveness

Chapter 7 is another lively chapter written with a personal
touch by Nhung Nguyen. Nhung emphasis that culturally
responsive design in education entails deeply valuing and
celebrating students' diverse cultural heritage, knowledge,
skills and languages. By fostering interactions, collaborations,
and multiple perspectives, this approach intertwines
educational design with students' unique cultural
perspectives, frames of reference, language, and
communication styles, ultimately nurturing both academic
growth and strong interpersonal relationships.

The importance of culturally responsive design is underscored
by several key factors: Learners' Engagement and Educational
Performance, globalisation and the Decolonial Movement.

The process of implementing culturally responsive design

                                                                                 Conclusion | 323
involves laying the groundwork by promoting self-awareness,
understanding the learners, and engaging with communities.
Furthermore, it requires empowering learners through
representation, implementing culturally sensitive assessment
and feedback, promoting active engagement and
participation, and adopting a multilingual approach to
enhance the educational experience.

Working with students with lived
experience of disability to enhance inclusive
and accessible learning

In chapter 8, Katie and Rhiannon call for university staff
particularly learning designers to pursue the requisite
knowledge and skills for crafting accessible learning
environments. They firmly believe that Ableism serves as a
primary barrier, contributing to low participation and
completion rates, increased student debt among disabled
students, insufficient resourcing for accessibility
accommodations, and frequent reports of stigmatisation and
discrimination.

They posit that University staff, including learning design
teams, play a pivotal role in providing accessible learning
environments. Despite acknowledging the intersection
between the accessibility and learning design teams, Katie and
Rhiannon highlight that both teams need to be working hand
in hand to support academics and guide them in creating
inclusive learning environments.

While recognising the challenge of upskilling academic staff
in accessibility, Katie and Rhiannon stress the imperative of
engaging students in developing effective services, as they can
provide unique perspectives and collaborate on solutions.

324 | Conclusion
Emphasising their approach to designing for accessibility, they
underscore the danger of excluding students with disabilities
from the learning experience design. They advocate strongly
for a co-design approach, positioning students with disabilities
as active partners in the design process, as these students can
reveal shortcomings that designers may be unaware of.

This is a call for learning designers to acknowledge the crucial
role of students with lived experience in shaping an inclusive
learning environment and fostering socially just education.
Katie and Rhiannon follow with practical examples, echoing
the call made by Keith and Camille in Chapter 2 that designing
with accessibility in mind means designing for everyone.
Additionally, they present a project focused on developing
resources that shape practices, providing guidelines for
learning designers to implement accessibility practices
effectively.

Baking a cake: Engaging staff in inclusive
learning design

In Chapter 9, Bruna sheds light on a pressing issue in learning
design-- the tendency to relegate accessibility to an
afterthought. She stresses that this neglect leads to significant
challenges--impracticality and increased costs. Using a baking
analogy, Bruna asserts that accessibility is as vital to learning
design as baking powder is to a cake, yet it's often treated as a
discretionary embellishment, akin to cake decoration.

Strategically positioned after Chapter 8, this chapter offers
valuable insights for learning designers. Through personal
vignettes, Bruna underscores the importance of considering
accessibility and inclusivity throughout the learning design
process. The chapter not only imparts practical advice but also

                                                                                Conclusion | 325
provides checklists guiding designers from initial stages to
feedback. Bruna introduces a structured approach by outlining
four stages of the learning design process--what, how, who,
and why. Weaving in the Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
framework, consistently emphasised throughout the book, she
reinforces UDL's pivotal role in creating inclusive and accessible
learning environments. Throughout the narrative, Bruna
engages readers, prompting reflection on their experiences as
learning designers. Thought-provoking questions encourage
a reevaluation of design decisions, processes, stakeholder
communication, and overall outcome quality.

This chapter issues a call to action, compelling us to reassess
our approach to learning design. It prompts deliberate
consideration of inclusivity as an integral, non-negotiable
element rather than an optional feature. This introspection is
crucial for steering the learning design process toward a
genuinely inclusive process.

Where to go from here

As the authors of this open textbook, we maintain an open-
minded stance towards receiving and responding to feedback.
We view feedback as a catalyst for initiating constructive
conversations that, ideally, result in the sharing of knowledge
and the creation of new insights for our learning design
community.

In this collaborative project, all chapters of our book are
accessible for viewing and comments through Hypothesis. This
streamlined approach allows for the prompt receipt of
constructive feedback without the need to directly contact the
authors. Upon receiving notifications regarding the feedback,
authors will diligently review and thoughtfully incorporate any

326 | Conclusion
necessary updates into the respective chapters, ensuring a
dynamic and responsive learning resource.

Final message to the learning design
community

As learning designers, we stand at the forefront of influencing
the learning process. The framework and the practical
approaches presented in this book provide an exciting
opportunity for us to initiate change. While we can certainly
begin implementing the practical solutions suggested, it's
crucial to delve deeper and understand how these strategies
function in real-world educational settings. We must consider
whether these approaches are equally effective for both
diverse and more homogeneous groups of learners. Are there
instances where customisation or alternative strategies might
be more appropriate for specific cohorts for example, where
the learners are from diverse ethnicities, races or religious
backgrounds? By critically examining the practical impact of
these ideas, we can tailor our approaches to ensure that our
efforts lead to greater inclusivity in learning, irrespective of the
learner's background or characteristics.

Accessibility

      Accessibility focuses on ensuring that environments,
      services, and tools are usable by everyone, particularly
      students with disabilities. It involves removing barriers to
      participation and making sure that everyone can engage
      with educational materials and activities on the same basis
      as their peers. This includes providing resources in
      accessible formats, such as screen reader-compatible
      documents or videos with captions, to comply with legal
      obligations under acts like the Disability Discrimination
      Act 1992.

Artificial Intelligence (AI)

      UNESCO World Commission on the Ethics of Scientific
      Knowledge and Technology, COMEST (2019) defines
      Artificial Intelligence (AI) into two distinct aspects:
      theoretical or scientific AI and pragmatic or technological
      AI. The theoretical aspect explores AI concepts and models
      to answer questions about human beings and other living
      things, intersecting with disciplines like philosophy, logic,
      linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science. It addresses
      questions about intelligence, distinguishing natural from
      artificial intelligence, the role of symbolic language in
      thought processes, and the possibility of achieving "strong
      AI" comparable to human intelligence. On the other hand,
      pragmatic or technological AI is engineering-oriented,
      leveraging branches of AI such as natural language
      processing, knowledge representation, machine learning,
      deep learning, computer vision, and robotics. It aims to
      create machines or programs capable of independently

332 | Glossary
      performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.
      The success of pragmatic AI is evident in its integration
      with information and communications technology (ICT),
      leading to widespread applications in areas like transport,
      medicine, communication, education, finance, law,
      military, marketing, customer services, and entertainment
      (COMEST, 2019).

Co-design

      The co-design process in learning design is a collaborative
      approach that involves various stakeholders, including
      educators, students, learning designers, and sometimes
      industry partners, in the creation and development of
      learning experiences and educational materials. This
      process emphasises partnership and shared decision-
      making to ensure that the learning solutions are effective,
      relevant, and engaging for the learners.

Inclusivity

      Inclusivity goes beyond providing access. It requires
      intentional and deliberate efforts to ensure that everyone,
      including students with disabilities, feels a sense of
      belonging at the university. Inclusivity encompasses
      designing resources and learning experiences from the
      outset in a way that considers diverse needs and
      perspectives. It's about creating an environment where all
      students feel valued and included, not just
      accommodated.

                                                                                     Glossary | 333
Nancy Fraser three dimensions of social justice

      Nancy Fraser outlines three dimensions of social justice in
      her work: redistribution, recognition, and representation.
      These dimensions are designed to address different forms
      of social injustices and inequities:

      Redistribution: Focuses on the economic aspect of social
      justice, aims to address inequalities in the distribution of
      resources and wealth and seeks to correct economic
      disparities by redistributing wealth, income, and
      opportunities to ensure a fairer allocation.

      Recognition: Concentrates on the cultural and social
      aspect of social justice, addresses issues of misrecognition
      or cultural domination where certain groups are devalued
      or disrespected based on their identity (e.g., race, gender,
      ethnicity) and calls for the affirmation and respect of
      diverse identities and cultural practices to combat
      discrimination and promote equal respect.

      Representation (or Political Justice): Pertains to the
      political aspect of social justice, deals with issues of political
      voice and participation, ensuring all individuals and groups
      have equal opportunities to be heard and influence
      decision-making processes and seeks to address political
      marginalisation and ensure fair representation in political
      institutions and public life.

      Fraser argues that a comprehensive approach to social
      justice must consider all three dimensions, as focusing on
      only one can lead to incomplete or even counterproductive
      outcomes. Redistribution without recognition, for example,
      may fail to address the deeper cultural injustices that
      perpetuate economic inequalities, and vice versa. Similarly,
      without proper representation, marginalised groups may

334 | Glossary
      lack the political power needed to achieve both economic
      redistribution and cultural recognition.

Open educational practices

      Open educational practices are a set of activities around
      instructional design and implementation of events and
      processes intended to support learning. They also include
      the creation, use and repurposing of Open Educational
      Resources (OER) and their adaptation to the contextual
      setting. They are documented in a portable format and
      made openly available.
