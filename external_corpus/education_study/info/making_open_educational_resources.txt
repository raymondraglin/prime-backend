A Collaboration Toolkit for Higher Education
Higher education and PreK12 are vastly different domains. As such, well-intended,
collaborative efforts between higher education and PreK12 do not always result in creation
of useful and reusable learning materials for PreK12 classrooms or effective, productive
partnerships. Making Open Educational Resources with and for PreK12: A Collaboration
Toolkit for Higher Education is a toolkit of instructional resources designed to support
higher education personnel who wish to improve or build strong and generative
collaborations between higher education and PreK12 educators.

The toolkit aims to expand use and re-usability of PreK12-centric learning resources through
informed practices regarding copyright, open-licensing, and accessibility and includes a
variety of resources: videos, presentations, transcripts, activities, guides, assignments, and
assessment tools.

Making Open Educational Resources with and for PreK12 is intended to prepare and
position practicing and future academic librarians and interested higher education faculty,
staff, and students consulting with librarians to address gaps related to PreK12 outreach.
Designed for use in formal graduate-level library and information science courses and
relevant for self-study by academic librarians already in practice, this toolkit includes a
variety of resources for learning and delivery by librarians to faculty and students in higher
education. While it is designed for librarians, it is also relevant to the broader audience of
interested instructional designers, higher education faculty, staff, and graduate students
seeking to improve the quality of their service to and collaborations with PreK12 educators.

           The toolkit is part of the Scholarly Communication Notebook, available at
                                    https://oercommons.org/hubs/SCN.

INTRODUCTION

Introduction

Higher education has a long history of outreach, sharing, and collaboration with formal PreK-12
education. Some outreach and collaboration attempts have been more successful than others.
In sharing this openly-licensed toolkit and the curriculum resources within, we hope to raise the
success rate of partnerships initiated by higher education in service to and collaboration with
PreK-12 administrators and teachers, expand the number of healthy, sustainable partnerships
between higher education and PreK-12, and broaden the availability of usable, customizable, open
educational resources created with and for for PreK-12 teaching environments.

Origins of the Toolkit

This curriculum guide and toolkit originated from a series of consultations between the authors,
a Higher Ed - PreK-12 liaison, and an open education and copyright librarian. It initially culminated
in a series of documents 1 including curator and OER contributor checklists, release forms, and
contributor agreements developed to support university students and faculty to create and share
open educational resources. We presented this work at the Open Education Conference 2021 under
the title "Boundary Spanners: Bridging Gaps Between Higher Education and PreK-122." After our
presentation, we decided to pursue more formal documentation of the project and its resources. In
our search for a publication venue, we realized that the Scholarly Communication Notebook (SCN)3,
a resource for training graduate students, especially those enrolled in library and information
science programs, may be a natural 6t for developing the types of skills librarians and others in
higher education need to assist others in forming informed and productive working relationships
with PreK-12 audiences.
  x | INTRODUCTION

 What is the Toolkit?

 The openly-licensed toolkit includes editable course materials--readings, slides and presentation
 transcripts, sample communication templates, assignments, and partnership evaluation forms.
 These are intended for self-study and mediated graduate and undergraduate instruction. The
 toolkit covers diverse areas of knowledge in a linear progression, including working with minors,
 educational standards-related issues, copyright, open-licensing, acceptable uses of third-party
 works, communication skills, empowering teachers to provide their expertise, and adapting and
 sharing openly-licensed works. Each section of the toolkit contains presentations or readings, and
 either self-assessment or re7ection questions. Some sections contain communication templates
 and customizable forms.

 Intended Audience

 This toolkit is designed for higher education faculty and librarians, instructional designers,
 graduate students, and undergraduates who aspire themselves, or to assist others, in building
 informed and productive outreach relationships with PreK-12 teachers, and to create relevant open
 educational resources for use within the PreK-12 context.

xii | HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT

HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT

Librarians and instructional designers at institutions of higher education are often tasked with
instructing or coaching faculty, staff, or students involved in curriculum-related or grant-funded
outreach projects to PreK-12 audiences. As this type of coaching is not a typical area of training
for librarians and instructional designers, we designed the toolkit for multiple user audiences: for
use by practicing professional librarians or instructional designers, and for active-student learning
course experiences within graduate-level library and information science and/or instructional
design courses. While these reader communities may conduct direct outreach to and within
PreK-12, we generally envision librarian and instructional design professions taking on the role of
instructor and coach to subject matter experts seeking to conduct PreK-12 outreach.

This material may likewise be used for project-based university-level education in which graduate
or undergraduate students form new outreach-oriented partnerships to contribute usable content
to PreK-12 learning environments. A third potential use for higher education faculty or staff, and
especially librarians and instructional designers involves leveraging open licenses on the various
presentations, transcripts, forms and templates to support and customize their outreach efforts
to PreK-12 generated from within higher education.

Philosophical and Praxis Framing

This toolkit is built on the premise that freely sharing educational materials is good, and that
sharing with open licenses is even better. Further, this toolkit assumes the reader and
collaborators' intent to build and share content under the conditions of open educational resources
(OER)--namely, that collaborators using this material intend to freely and publicly release their
original works for others to use under a license that permits free use, reuse, modi6cation and
sharing with others.
                                                                                                            HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT | xiii

Consistent with Davis (1989) Technology Acceptance Model1 which posits that the acceptance of
new practices, like new information technologies, depends on the perception of usefulness and
perceived ease of use, with ease of understanding (Rogers and Shoemaker, 1971)2) and self-e8cacy
(Bandura, 1982)3, the level of one's ability to execute a course of action being a determinant of
ease of use, and cost-bene6t analysis relating to perceived usefulness. We hope that readers
6nd that the concepts and practices shared within are understandable, easily transmittable, can
be combined with readers' and collaborators' expertise, and will ultimately be actionable and
productive.

xiv | HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT

Collaborative partnerships are as unique as the individual partners and their contexts, so advanced
topics on collaboration are not included. With regard to development of learning resources, we
have aimed to be agnostic regarding technical platforms, with the understanding that the best
environments in which to develop and share resources are ones that will actually be used.

How the Toolkit is Organized

The toolkit is organized sequentially in the order needed for learning, instructing and coaching
faculty, staff, and students within higher education, and those faculty, staff, and students
developing and engaging in collaborative partnerships with PreK-12 educators. Each of these
sections includes one or more of the following: video, presentations, transcripts, activities, guides,
assignments, assessments, templates, and self-assessment tools.

   Part I: Mastering the Context includes preparatory materials for all three levels of learners.
      These are designed to build foundational knowledge regarding collaboration challenges, best
      practices for direct work with students under age 18, an introduction to open educational
      resources, principles of copyright, a practical guide for 6nding, using and attributing openly-
      licensed images, an accessibility guide, and an introduction to empowering and building
      collaborative partnerships with PreK-12.
         These resources are designed to be used and presented by librarians and/or instructional
            designers who are engaged in instructing or coaching higher education faculty, staff, and
            students who will make the connections with PreK-12.

   Part II: Explore and Build a Collaboration is action-oriented and intended to enable an
      informed and re7ective practice for higher education personnel reaching out to PreK-12
      educators.
         These resources are intended for use by higher education faculty, staff, and students
            making connections with PreK-12 educators
                                                                                                            HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT | xv

   Part III: Develop and Evaluate Learning Resources describes adapting Creative Commons-
      licensed resources, includes guidance for adapting openly-licensed resources, tools for
      checking one's work, and obtaining structured feedback from a PreK-12 partner. A brief
      discussion regarding selection of software or hosting sites is included. The list of software/
      hosting options are speci6c to the current mainstream PreK-12 uses and are not intended to
      be comprehensive.
         These resources are intended for use by higher education faculty, staff, and students.

   Part IV: Share Learning Resources with a Broader Audience presents rationale for sharing
      with an emphasis on making the learning resources discoverable by a broad audience.
         This section is intended for use by higher education faculty, staff, and students, and
            PreK-12 partners.

   Finally, Part V: Evaluate Your Learning presents a self-assessment exercise
         This resource is intended for use by all learners.

When provided, slide decks are available in GoogleSlides and PPT. Each slide deck contains a text
transcript in the "notes" section of the Google slide deck and within the toolkit. Most slide decks
contain self-test questions throughout.
xvi | HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT

Navigating the Toolkit by Role and Paths through the
Material

Relevant to all roles are sections in Part I: Mastering the Context which is designed to encourage
development of baseline knowledge regarding: 1 documented challenges in PreK-12 and Higher
Ed collaboratives, 2 working directly with minors, 3 the case of open educational resources, 4
copyright, 5 using others' works, 6 6nding, using, and attributing openly-licensed images, 7
accessibility, 8 the need for librarians to reset expectations regarding their role, and the ultimate
purpose of the toolkit, 9 empowering teachers and building successful collaborative partnerships.
The toolkit is designed for use in formal instructional settings, speci6cally for use as an
experiential learning resource for courses in graduate programs in library and information science.
However, there are multiple paths through the material for collaborators with many different roles.

   Higher education librarians consulting with higher education faculty and students may 6nd it
      helpful to familiarize themselves to the point of being able to teach and respond to inquiries
      related to Part I: Mastering the Context, 13 adapting Creative Commons-licensed resources,
      and 16 share resources publicly, then review materials in Part II: Explore and Build and judge
      the relevance in providing these to collaborators conducting direct outreach to PreK-12
      audiences.

   School librarians engaged in such projects may be interested in taking a leading role teaching
      and leading PreK-12 teachers and administrators through content on chapters 3 open
      educational resources, 4 copyright, 5 using others' works, 6 6nding, using, and attributing
      openly-licensed images, 7 accessibility, 13 adapting Creative Commons-licensed resources, 14
      / 15 reviewing quality, and 16 sharing resources publicly.

   Instructional designers may especially 6nd material in sections 3-7 from Part I: Mastering the
      Context, 13 adapting OER and 14 self-test quality control checklists, and 16 share resources
      publicly. Each of these sections directly address issues and practices for developing learning
      content.

   Subject matter experts, graduate and/or undergraduate students in direct contact with
      PreK-12 personnel are encouraged to 6rst familiarize themselves with 1 challenges in
      collaboration between higher ed and PreK12 and 9 successful partnerships and empowering
      teachers to share their expertise.
                                                                                                           HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT | xvii

   PreK-12 teachers and administrators may appreciate learning about 1 challenges in
      collaboration between Higher Ed and PreK-12, 3 an introduction to open educational
      resources, resources on 4 copyright and 5 using others' works, 6 6nding, using, and attributing
      openly-licensed images, and 7 making resources more accessible. They may bene6t from
      discussing 12 improving a proposed collaboration, 13. learning to adapt Creative Commons-
      licensed resources, 15 teacher/administrator/school librarian reviewer rubric, and 16 sharing
      resources publicly.

Sample Scenarios

For readers without a speci6c scenario in mind, the following sample scenarios may spark some
ideas regarding potential uses of this material:

   A professor in earth science is enthusiastic for PreK-12 students to learn about new research
      they have published regarding Yellowstone National Park4. The research includes speci6c
      scienti6c methods and has practical impacts for understanding the geology of the park. The
      level of the research and language of recent articles is too advanced for PreK-12 students.
      The researcher wonders, "This is so interesting. How can I make this relevant to a PreK-12
      audience? How would I narrow the content to be useful? Is there any alignment with PreK-12
      standards? What might that look like in a PreK-12 context? Can I use this as a "broader
      impacts" part of a grant proposal5?

   A graduate student who studies video gaming thinks that PreK-12 students might be inspired
      for future careers in music, technology, or programming by exposure to methods for research
      in her area. How does this graduate student 6nd a teacher who might also be interested in
      exploring the feasibility of this idea and collaborating to develop learning resources around
      it?

   A librarian has been asked to provide guidance to a group of researchers who have a grant to
      create learning materials6 with and for speci6c PreK-12 grade levels in the area of their
      expertise. What value added does the librarian provide on copyright, open licensing, and
      training others?

   An undergraduate student in education is tasked with developing content for a PreK-12 class
      as part of an accredited college course. How can they get up to speed on all they might need
      to know in order to create something useful for the PreK-12 audience? Where might this
      student start? What is most important for the student to know?
xviii | HOW TO USE THIS TOOLKIT

Using the Toolkit in a Formal Instruction Setting

This modular toolkit contains assignments, activities, and links to additional readings which
provide practice or real-world application for those courses focused with an PreK-12 outreach or
consulting within higher education component.

The toolkit also provides introductory materials regarding open educational resources (OER) for
readers whom this concept may be unfamiliar. In an instructional setting OER may be adopted
"as is," arranged, curated, customized/adapted, or added to. Each level of practice has different
implications for the level of effort. Regardless of the route a teacher takes to use open educational
resources, there are things to learn and things to do that are not without effort. Here are some of
the costs--and things that teachers or collaborators involved in making OER may need to learn to
do. These are addressed within the toolkit.

   Locate OER
   Review OER
   (optional) Adapt or author OER
   Apply copyright, open licensing, and fair use knowledge
   Track added content, licenses, and required attributions
   Ensure the accessibility of the open educational resource for most users with disabilities

Other toolkits, such as the OER Starter Kit 7 contain even more practical information for OER
beginners.

PART I: MASTERING THE CONTEXT

Part I: Mastering the Content forms the core conceptual and technical knowledge librarians will
be expected to convey to higher education subject matter experts and those that subject-matter
experts will be expected to implement in the course of their project. It provides information
regarding the challenge of collaboration between higher education and PreK12 faculty, safety
information regarding working directly with minors, an introduction to open educational
resources, copyright considerations when planning to share, and options for using others' openly-
licensed works. A step-by-step guide is provided regarding finding and using openly-licensed
images. Introductory to intermediate information regarding accessibility for students with
disabilities is covered. Paradigm changing guidance is presented for librarians hoping to
establishing productive, collaborative working relationships with subject matter experts, and key
considerations for forming empowering relationships with PreK12 teachers.

Faculty in higher education have very different day-to-day work experiences and expectations than
PreK-12 teachers. These differences range from differences in job descriptions to use and planning
of time, number of hours in the classroom, criteria for promotion, level of administrative oversight,
level of contact with people outside of one's primary institution -- and beyond. This section aims
to inform readers of potential challenges in forming collaborative partnerships by individuals from
these seemingly similar but vastly different groups of educators.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Summarize the nature of challenges in collaborative partnerships between higher
             education and PreK-12 education.
           Locate permissions and created-works release documents12, and evaluation checklists
             relevant to open educational resources for PreK-12 materials created in higher education.

Presentation Abstract

Boundary spanners serve as linking pins between organizations and can also fill structural holes,
allowing networks with no previous connection to share information and resources. Using
boundary-spanner practices, this presentation summarizes efforts between one university and
area PreK-12 schools regarding development and broad sharing of relevant, adaptable PreK-12 OER
course materials. Many personnel in higher education want to share their knowledge with a broader
audience but lack the ability to create materials that best meet the needs of PreK-12 students.
We were able to address these issues through collaboration between university content experts,
teachers who have deep expertise in creating individualized learning materials, and processes and
platforms for curation and broad sharing. When learning resources are created by the university
in consultation with teachers, and shared as accessible and editable OER with broader geographic
                                  1. CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIGHER ED AND PREK-12 | VIDEO | 5

areas, the materials better fit the actual practice and needs of PreK-12 teachers, as well as allow
the university to expand its reach and impact. As PreK-12 teachers are required to provide
individualized levels of instruction and course materials for all students, it is critical that these
materials be easily and legally editable as well as accessible for students with disabilities. Some
of the most significant contributions of this work are in the areas of accessibility, copyright,
permission and ability to edit, and broad sharing. Our case study presents rationale, need, process,
and the artifacts (permission forms, checklists, and templates) developed together by two
"boundary spanners" in order to enable partnership, creation, curation, and free sharing of more
useful learning resources.

Video Transcript

Good afternoon everyone. Welcome to boundary spanners: bridging gaps between higher
education and PreK-12. I am Anita Walz and I serve as the assistant director of open education and
scholarly communication librarian at the university libraries at Virginia Tech. Hello everyone. I am
Julie Farley. The work that we'll be talking about today was completed while I was the university
PreK-12 liaison for the center for educational networks and impacts at the institute for creativity
arts and technology at Virginia Tech.

Thank you, Julie. Thank you to those of you who went ahead and took our informal survey. We would
love to see what kinds of roles you have and what you're interested in learning. It looks like about
half of you are instructors at the college and university level. We have some librarians. We have
some PreK-12 teachers. One student--maybe more than one student.
6 | 1. CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIGHER ED AND PREK-12 | VIDEO

And things that you want to learn:

   K-12 involvement
   Could this be applied to adult basic skills course?
   How did the partnership originate?
   How have you made it sustainable?

These are really great questions and areas of learning. If we don't address your specific question
we're planning to leave at least 10 minutes for questions at the end.

In this presentation we'll discuss the expectations, usefulness, and communication in sharing
between higher education and PreK-12. We will talk about misconceptions and implementation.
We'll also introduce this concept of boundary spanners and boundary objects. And as a potential
solution to these problems, we'll overview our project and what we did, how we got started, and
what we accomplished. Then we'll finally leave some time for questions. To give you some context
for this sharing between higher education and PreK-12, there is a big history, a long history of
sharing between higher education and PreK-12 and some attempts of sharing have been more
successful than others. Right now how a lot of teachers share their resources teacher to teacher
(usually in the same grade level or within the same school) and often a lot of sharing within school
districts. There is not a lot of sharing across districts. So higher education faculty, staff, and
students often want to share their resources. PreK-12 is very receptive to this usually because they
really want these expert materials authored by people that are outside of their classroom and are
really doing this new cutting edge research. But there can be some significant implementation
issues.

Some of the implementation issues include a lack of communication that we're not communicating
effectively across our different contexts. In fact, the sharing has been predominantly one-
directional: from higher education to PreK-12. When in reality, it is far better for this type of work
to be participative. Higher education faculty, staff, and students can create really great resources
but if they don't fit the context, they can't be personalized by teachers and they don't consider
the classroom environment in mind they're not helpful and they won't get used. There are some
implementation-related misconceptions on both sides.
                                  1. CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIGHER ED AND PREK-12 | VIDEO | 7

We'll talk first about the misconceptions by PreK-12 and then we'll move on to the misconceptions
by higher ed. The first one in PreK-12 is that teachers may believe that faculty and staff and
students in universities are required to do outreach, which is often not the case. And because they
believe that faculty, staff, and students are required to do outreach, they may believe that they
are skilled in doing outreach, which may not also be the case. Another thing to keep in mind is
that teachers may be looking for something to use in their classroom within the next month, but
in higher education there is often a grant funding cycle where you apply, you wait to hear, and
then you might get funding, you might not. So there can be dramatically different timelines. As far
as misconceptions by higher ed: there may be a lack of knowledge about what PreK-12 teachers
need in their classroom. For example, often teachers have to teach to standards that are set by
the state and prepare their students to take standardized tests at the end of the class. There
could be time constraints in the classroom, teachers may be required to cover a certain amount
of material within a certain amount of time, so they may not have more than a day or more than
30 minutes to do a certain outreach activity. Also teachers may be required to submit detailed
lesson plans that may have specific requirements based on their district. Someone who is not in
K-12 public education may not have the knowledge or skills to create the level of detail needed in
the lesson plan, and teachers may be required or may prefer to do differentiation for their students
meaning that they may make slightly different tasks for their students who have different skills.
So what's really the important takeaway here is recognizing that PreK-12 teachers are experts in
teaching their grade and they're experts at differentiating for their students. So, while teachers
may recognize that university faculty, staff, and students are experts in their field, university and
higher ed may not have that same recognition of teachers. Or even if they do they might feel that
they [those in higher ed] cannot or they should not ask PreK-12 teachers for guidance...that it might
be too much of a burden. But with these participatory partnerships it's really much more beneficial
to ask the the expert to help collaborate with you on your resources. And similarly to higher ed,
there's not an obligation for most PreK-12 teachers to bring outreach into their classroom.

Regarding implementation issues in higher education: there are a number of significant issues.
First of all, guidance is needed in several different areas. Guidance is needed regarding including
and sharing things that are not original to the author such as student works, third-party graphics,
and other sorts of elements. Guidance is needed regarding formatting. What kind of formats? What
kind of file types are helpful? If we assume that teachers want to customize the things that are
shared with them, what kinds of formats can they easily edit? And then lastly, why accessibility or
ADA compliance is important, and how to achieve this?
8 | 1. CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIGHER ED AND PREK-12 | VIDEO

How do we bridge this chasm? How do we bring together two different groups that have compatible
goals but different languages, different contexts, and assumptions about each other that are not
quite accurate? How do we work together? How can work that benefits both groups be coordinated
so that both may reach their goals and move forward in ways that are productive? How do we do
this when the work is of great benefit to both groups but is extra-- it's not required. It's really on top
of everything else. And then how do we make the common ground apparent to others --because
there is common ground.

One possible solution to this is the boundary spanner. A boundary spanner is a person who can
link an organization or groups to share knowledge and resources. One of the tools that boundary
scanners often use are called boundary objects. Boundary objects are any object that is part of
multiple groups and that can facilitate communication between these groups. Some examples of
this could be something like a business plan. It could be a map. It could also be things like field
notes to help share your information. So there's a wide array of what a boundary object can be. So
who is a boundary spanner? We are! And it's likely that there are probably more boundary spanners
in your organization than you might realize.

On this next slide we'll talk about what the roles of a boundary spanner are and their goals. This will
help you to identify if you might be a boundary spanner or if you have a boundary spanner in your
organization. So the biggest goal of a boundary spanner is to bring together diverse communities
in a productive way. Boundary spanners can be formal or informal--meaning that this could be
your job. You could be formally assigned to communicate between groups, or it could be informal.
It could just be something that you've discovered you're good at and that you're doing without
necessarily being paid or told by anyone to do that. But the big goal is to either link organizations
that don't have overlapping people in them or to span holes in networks. So you may have groups
of people that are separate and one person can help bring these groups together. So we're really
focusing on the idea here of mutually beneficial partnerships and that we don't need to be
recreating the wheel at the same time. So it's much more efficient for us to team up and to share
our resources.

Our project started with a referral from Julee's supervisor regarding copyright and open licensing
which is an area in which I (Anita) work. I was happy to meet with them. But something interesting
happened. So initially we thought that we would just talk with Anita maybe once or twice to get
some information and that after that we would be good to go. We would have everything figured
out. But what we really found is that it was much better for us to meet routinely and that we could
have this goal of creating documents that can scaffold what our creators are doing.
                                  1. CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIGHER ED AND PREK-12 | VIDEO | 9

So we're hoping that the documents we've created can really help guide the process that we're
going to talk to you about. We wanted to make the process more independent for potential
contributors. As we've alluded to before, we identified several areas in which the additional
documentation was needed:

        How our project started

        Consultation regarding copyright and open licenses [lead to] development of instructional
        documents and forms

        1. Further instruction needed regarding use of in-copyright third-party works, preferred file
            formats, and document accessibility

       2. a) Higher education students own their own work b) Faculty must have (non-coerced)
            permission from students to share student work

       3. CENI needs permission to "publish" works
       4. Process-management checklists (for authors and CENI)

This led us to create a review checklist for submitters. This clearly communicated to higher
education faculty, staff, and their students the best practices for designing shared content for
PreK-12, focusing primarily on ownership including (1) student works, and (2) other third party
works, so looking at things like fair use, open licenses, public domain, using your own original work,
and secondly accessibility of created resources for students with disabilities.

We also created a form to obtain permission from a third party (including students) to release
under an open license. This will be used by the submitter for students and or third party works. We
adapted a form so that submitters are giving permission to the Center for Educational Networks
and Impacts at Virginia Tech (the Center) to publish and release the materials under an open
license. And the last thing that we created were these process management checklists. These
are really review checklists to make sure that the submitter can ensure that they're submitting all
the things that they should be [submitting] like their content, any of their third-party agreements,
and that they're agreeing to let the Center publish their work. We've since learned that GoOpen
Virginia, which is the platform through which the content will be shared, provides some guidance
resources that meet some of these needs. These were added in July 2021. We also feel it's valuable
for Virginia Tech and for the Center to have customized instruments because we're finding more
projects within the institution that need this type of guidance.
10 | 1. CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIGHER ED AND PREK-12 | VIDEO

We're going to talk about what we accomplished and why it matters. One of the most important
goals that we've accomplished is that faculty can share more easily. Faculty, staff, and students
can share more easily--which was really our original goal. We wanted these people to be able to
get their resources out there in a widespread way that's going to work for teachers. We now have
documentation, or we have documents, that can be used in projects where faculty are creating and
sharing their original learning materials and incorporating students in the learning process to share
their [students'] original learning materials. With regard to my learning and learning in higher ed
about the K-12 context, there's a lot to be learned about past problems and existing processes, the
blind spots that higher ed may have toward PreK-12.

Knowing about the importance of a bi-directional flow of information in developing these these
tools has helped us to inform the collaborative ventures. We hope for the better.

And for me, I learned a lot more about copyright, open licensing, accessibility, and how some of
these things aren't necessarily as complicated and scary as they might initially seem. We also
found that we looked for these kinds these kinds of resources and we did not find them. So we
think the framework may exist in pieces but we're not finding that it exists anywhere else (or not
that we easily found). So we're working on an open publication regarding this project to document
some of our work. We have some additional findings and observations from our work in the form
of messages for higher education and then messages for PreK-12. So if we were to address a
higher education group that is interested in starting a project with PreK-12 teachers, these are the
messages that we would want to share: (1) PreK-12 teachers are experts at teaching, (2) that there
is a lot of effort that goes into creating a generalizable lesson plan that is shareable (it's complex,
it's not small and it's not easily accomplished), and (3) generally in projects like this, teachers who
create these sorts of resources don't own them (and they are usually paid for their contributions).

So, some questions that you can ask to help you create your partnership with K-12 could be things
like: (1) What standards are your students struggling with? This could help you get an idea of where
the teachers might need a real world example that could help their students better understand
the concept. (2) How much time do you have to spend on this specific task? This could help you
make sure that the thing that you're designing will fit into their classroom constraints. (3) Is there
specific terminology that should be included that you want students to be exposed to? With a lot of
educational standards, teachers are told to cover very specific terms in their lessons. So, including
those [terms] in yours will really help validate that and reinforce what teachers are teaching. (4)
What would make it easy for you to actually use the material? Creating something is great but if it's
really difficult to use, and it doesn't get used, then it's not as great.
                                 1. CHALLENGES IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN HIGHER ED AND PREK-12 | VIDEO | 11

So being able to have something that's easily-editable, for example, often helps teachers. (5) When
do you plan to teach the material? (6) How far in advance would you like to receive it? This is really
being aware that when a teacher receives a lesson plan they still have to review it and prepare for
implementation in their classroom. So, being aware of how much leeway they need to actually make
that happen [is important].

We're now going to talk a little bit about messages that would be appropriate for PreK-12 people in
these sorts of projects. Right, so keeping in mind as we discussed earlier that project timelines in
higher education can be much longer than they are in PreK-12 and may also have a higher degree of
uncertainty. For example, if you're applying for a grant, this project may or may not be funded which
indicates more uncertainty than teachers might anticipate in their classroom.

There's also [the reality that] if you apply for this grant you may not hear about a funding result for
months. So keeping in mind that maybe you're even planning implementation for something in the
next school year. Also knowing that without funding, higher education faculty, students, and staff
may not actually have an obligation or an actual opportunity to conduct outreach. And the outreach
generally isn't something that's rewarded by the tenure and promotion process.

2. WORKING WITH MINORS | PRESENTATION

   Julee P. Farley

Teachers and subject matter experts are involved in OER development processes, but the ultimate
audience for some OER will be PreK-12 students themselves. Some projects may feature direct
involvement with PreK-12 students. Others might not. This section provides background
knowledge on requirements for working with students under age 18. Before proceeding with in-
person work with minors, make sure to complete any training required by your institution.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Identify legal requirements and best practices for working with minors.

Slide Deck Transcript
Welcome to "So you want to do outreach: Training for working with K-12 teachers and students."
This training was based on materials originally created by the Center for Educational Networks and
Impacts at Virginia Tech.
The priorities for informal education may differ from formal education in that the goal of informal
education is to inspire and interest students rather than focus on acquiring facts. These priorities
[safe, fun, and educational] for informal education were created and pioneered by Dr. Phyllis
Newbill at the Center for Educational Networks and Impacts at Virginia Tech.
                                                                                     2. WORKING WITH MINORS | PRESENTATION | 15

Always remember that safety is the number one priority. If people do not feel safe or comfortable,
then they are not able to focus on learning or feel inspired. You must ensure that you are creating
a space that is both emotionally and physically safe for your learners. When you are leading an
activity, you are in a position of responsibility, and children and even teachers will look to you for
help.

The topics we will discuss are: ensuring you and anyone you are working with are never alone with
a minor and how to determine if you are legally bound to report abuse or neglect.

Never be alone with a minor in a physical or virtual space (e.g., Zoom) and do not allow others on
your team to be alone with a minor. This policy protects both the minor and the adult.

Consider this scenario and what you should do in this situation: A young person is the only other
person in the bathroom when you arrive there. What do you do? [Answer: The best choice is to go
find another bathroom to use. If that is not possible, you can wait until the young person leaves the
bathroom to use it or find another adult and take this second adult with you to the bathroom. All of
these solutions prevent you from being alone with a minor.]

Your organization may legally require you to report abuse and neglect. This is known as being a
"mandated reporter." Those who work in educational, childcare, and healthcare facilities are often
mandated reporters although the laws vary by state. If you are not sure if you are a mandated
reporter, you can check the laws in your state, talk to your supervisor, or contact the HR
department of your workplace. If you are a mandated reporter, your workplace will likely have a
procedure for reporting abuse/neglect, and you should familiarize yourself with it as well as take
any trainings your organization requires.

If you are a mandated reporter, you must report suspected child abuse and neglect. Remember
that a culture of silence allows abuse to continue.

Sexual abuse and sexual harassment are covered under Title IX (nine). Title IX is a federal civil rights
law, and it states that "No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from
participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."

Preventing and reporting abuse and neglect keeps people safe. Remember that abuse can be
emotional, physical, or sexual. Neglect is the failure to provide for a child's basic needs. Remember
that abuse is not rare.
16 | 2. WORKING WITH MINORS | PRESENTATION

To summarize the safety section: remember to never be alone with a minor in either a physical or
virtual space. Don't allow others to be alone with a minor. You may be a mandated reporter and be
legally bound to report abuse and neglect.

Priority number two is fun. You want your activity to be fun because if a learner is doing something
fun then they will likely want to learn more about it. If the activity is not fun, you probably won't
choose to learn more about that activity or that topic.

When planning your activity, you should include a hook, personal stories, and two-way
conversations. Make sure to leave out stereotypes, assumptions about relationships, and sensitive
topics. We will cover each of these topics in greater detail in the following slides.

A hook is a good way to get learners interested in and engaging with your activity. You can engage
learners verbally, by introducing yourself or your activity. You can also engage learners visually by
using color or displaying intriguing objects from your work.

You can also engage learners by sharing a personal story or a story from your work. For example,
you might talk about how you got in to your work, what is exciting or you, what makes your
experience different from others, or an interesting story about the history of your work.

Another way to engage learners and to increase learning is to encourage two-way conversations
in your activity. You encourage two-way conversations by asking questions as well as listening to
learners and responding to them.

Avoid stereotyping your learners based on any physical or observable characteristics. For example,
don't assume that only female learners will be interested in your activity and male learners will
find it boring. Also remember that teachers and students come from a wide range of backgrounds
and home living situations, some of which may make the learner feel uncomfortable or singled out
when discussed in front of their classmates.

Don't make assumptions about families and living situations, for example, assuming that every
child has a mother and father at home or that every child has their own room. Avoid talking about
sensitive topics such as tattoos, romantic relationships, sex, religion, politics, curse words,
alcohol/drugs, and partying and focus your language and conversation on your activity instead.
Your activity has the potential to reach and engage all learners and using inclusive language will
help make sure you achieve that goal.
                                                                                     2. WORKING WITH MINORS | PRESENTATION | 17

When creating an exhibit or setting up an activity, especially one where you may be at a table and
waiting for learners to approach you, think about how you can make your space a "yes" space. A
"yes" space is one in which you can say yes as much as possible and minimize the number of times
you will say no to a learner (e.g., ask them not to touch something). Put touchable items (remember
that touchable items can be used as a hook to engage learners in your activity) where they can
be touched. Create physical barriers for fragile items that you may not want to be touched and if
you must tell a learner not to touch something, set a clear expectation by letting them know not to
touch before presenting the object.

See an example of a "yes" space on the next slide: This exhibit pictured demonstrates a "yes" space.
There is a hook of a cool object to touch that is placed in an easily accessible area of the table.
There is also a hook of a person asking questions to promote engagement with the exhibit. This
exhibit does showcase fragile objects that should not be touched; notice how the fragile objects
are protected by a physical barrier. Think about how you can set up your space so that you can
maximize the number of times you say yes to someone who wants to engage with you and your
activity and minimize the number of times you will say no.

As a review of the second priority, "fun": 1) Make sure to include a hook, stories, and conversation in
your activity; 2) avoid stereotypes, assumptions, and sensitive topics; and 3) arrange your space to
be a "yes" space.

We will now move onto priority three: making your activity educational.

In this component of the training, we will discuss how to determine learner capabilities, language
use, making your activity sensory-friendly, how to choose an appropriate activity, and educational
standards in your state.

Consider the scenario presented on this slide: A boy in a wheelchair comes with his family to
your exhibit. His body is twisted, and he does not make eye contact with you. Should you address
him? The answer: Many diseases attack the body and not the mind. Assume that the child can
understand you until you have information otherwise and engage this learner as you would any
other learner.

Consider the scenario presented on this slide: Two children come to your exhibit with an adult.
One child is six inches taller than the other. Which one can understand bigger words? The answer:
Heights vary greatly among children. They might be the same age, or the shorter one may be older.
Learner capabilities are not related to their height.
18 | 2. WORKING WITH MINORS | PRESENTATION

We learned in the previous module that assumptions about learner abilities based on physical
appearance are not reliable. Instead, you can ask questions of children, beginning with simple
questions and asking more complex or difficult questions if the learner seems interested and
seems to understand you. You can also ask the learner to describe an object, which will give you a
good idea of their vocabulary and sentence structure skills.

Plan what you will say to learners during your activity, both to ensure that your content is age
appropriate as well as to ensure that your activity will take the amount of time you believe it will.
Once you have your script, you can use readability functions in Microsoft Word/PowerPoint or
readability score applications to determine the grade level for your content. Make sure that your
content is not too difficult or too easy. For example, a fifth grade reading level would likely be too
difficult for a second grader and too easy for a twelfth grader.

Try to ensure that your content is easy to understand for your learner group. Other resources that
may be helpful are The Thing Explainer book2 and The Up-Goer Five text editor3 both of which use
only the vocabulary of the 1,000 (or "ten hundred") most common words in the English Language.

When preparing your activity, remember that some sensory experiences may be overwhelming for
learners, which will limit their ability to engage with your activity. Having a written sign to describe
your experience may be useful, and if you have sensory aspects to your activity make sure to let
learners know about those ahead of time. Leave out bright lights and repetitive or loud noises if
possible. In general, avoid surprises, which may frighten some learners. Also, do not put pressure
on learners to engage with your activity if they seem hesitant; instead, let them engage at their own
pace.

When you are trying to determine what activity you should do, try to select something that you
think is interesting or exciting. If you're excited, your learner group will be able to detect your
excitement, and they will be more interested. You can also think about why you want to do
outreach, what has inspired you, and how this outreach might fit into the bigger picture of your
life and career. You can also ask local teachers or school administrators what their needs are. For
example, they may have difficulty meeting certain educational standards in standardized testing
or may have an existing venue for outreach in their district. You can also discuss with teachers
which grades or subjects may be best aligned with your activity; be sure to be honest about which
grade levels or ages you feel most comfortable talking to and if there are any subjects you feel more
comfortable talking about.
                                                                                       2. WORKING WITH MINORS | PRESENTATION | 19

 The state you live in likely has educational standards that schools must meet, such as standardized
 testing. These tests and standards typically cover key concepts and vocabulary that students must
 know.

 These standards vary by state and are related to student learning and achievement in grades K-12
 in English, mathematics, science, and history/social science, among others. Finding and becoming
 more familiar with the educational standards in your state may help you include important
 information in your activity and help you determine which subjects and grade levels may be most
 appropriate for your activity.

 As a review, remember to determine learner capabilities by asking them questions or asking them
 to describe objects. Make sure you plan what you will say in your activity and that your language is
 at an appropriate level for your learner group. If possible, avoid loud and repetitive noises, bright
 lights, and other overwhelming stimuli in your activity. When planning your activity, think about
 what ages you feel comfortable talking to as well as what interests you and what you are excited
 about; if you are excited, your learners are more likely to be excited. Finally, use educational
 standards in your state to help create your activity.

   Anita R. Walz

In this section, we introduce and describe characteristics of open educational resources (OER),
describe ways of using OER, methods of locating existing OER, and review pros and cons of OER for
PreK-12 teachers.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Define and differentiate open educational resources (OER) versus free resources.
           Describe the general level of awareness regarding OER in PreK-12 contexts.
           Articulate the work required to adopt OER.
           Try on a posture of "planning to share".
           Reflect on one's own current practice of sharing (or not sharing) under open licenses.
22 | 3. OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND THE CASE FOR PRIORITIZING, USING, FINDING, AND SHARING
OER CONTENT | READINGS

     Assignment

           Adapt or create a 10-15 minute interactive presentation and transcript you can use to
             introduce teachers to open educational resources. If you use materials that you did not
             create yourself, make sure that you have some sort of permission to use them, and be
             sure to attribute them (if required).

           Choose an open license for your presentation and write one paragraph regarding why you
             selected that particular license.

Introducing Open Educational Resources

Imagine finding a resource that fits your course. It fits how you or your collaborator tend to teach.
It has nearly all of the features you need and want. It aligns with course objectives or learning
standards. It would help students to understand key concepts and relationships and extend their
knowledge to other situations or tasks. The reading level is appropriate for your students. You
believe it will help students to collaborate with each other when critically evaluating and assessing
information, and that students will perceive the subject material as relevant. It is already free
online too. It is as close to perfect as it gets! You want to incorporate it into your course materials
and share your version with your colleagues.

Beyond these characteristics, what sort of upfront permission do you find most useful? Your
answer might be something like this: "I want to be able to copy and share it" or "I want to be able to
edit it to fit my students' needs and make copies for my students" or "I want my students to adapt
or build on this as part of their learning."

Using open educational resources may help educators get there.
3. OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND THE CASE FOR PRIORITIZING, USING, FINDING, AND SHARING OER
                                                                                                                    CONTENT | READINGS | 23

       Definition: Open educational resources (OER) are freely and publicly available teaching,
       learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released
       under an intellectual property license [such as a Creative Commons license] that permits
       their free use, reuse, modification, and sharing with others. They include full courses, course
       materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools,
       materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge. (Adapted from the Hewlett
       Foundation1)

The three main things to know about OER are:

 1. OER are freely and publicly available,
 2. OER have some form of upfront permission that allows free use, adaptation, and sharing, and
 3. OER can be exhibited in a variety of formats.

Something Greater Than "Free" is Here: OER versus Free
Resources

Educators especially value the ability to adapt and share. Freely-shared educational materials,
especially ones that are thoughtfully designed, reviewed, described, and released in a way that
maximizes the potential for others to find, evaluate, and use them can greatly expand a teacher's
toolbox. However, low awareness exists among teachers regarding how OER are different from
other "free" resources.

Free online works or items for which we own a print copy are still subject to copyright. Whereas, an
open license on an OER, often a Creative Commons license, allows the ability to reuse, modify, and
share content with others.

Teachers don't often know or understand this. In a 2020 study (n=2,137) of K-12 academics, 31%
percent of respondents indicated that they they are "Very Aware" or "Aware" of OER, but when these
numbers are controlled for awareness of Creative Commons, the rates drop to 24% (Seaman and
Seaman, 2020).2
24 | 3. OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND THE CASE FOR PRIORITIZING, USING, FINDING, AND SHARING
OER CONTENT | READINGS

Introduction to OER and OER creation engagement during in-service and pre-service teacher
trainings have been found effective practices for teachers to realize the large number of resources
available for diverse educational settings, and overcoming a lack of awareness and understanding
that keeps teachers from using OER.3

Examples

A few examples of open educational resources relevant to the PreK-12 contexts include:

The Work of OER

As mentioned in the section How to Use This Toolkit, there are several things OER adopters,
adapters, curators, and authors will need to do to leverage OER for instruction. These include
locating and reviewing OER. If you are adapting or authoring, it is necessary to apply copyright,
open licensing, and fair use knowledge. It is also necessary to track the licenses and required
attributions of added content. All instructors will need to review and some may need to obtain
assistance ensuring the accessibility of the selected course materials for students with
disabilities. Finally, as teachers are experts with regard to student needs, the resources will need
to be adjusted to fit desired pedagogical practices and technical environments. So, first: Finding
OER. (Note that a list of links for items included in "The Work of OER" are available at the end of this
section.)

Finding Open Educational Resources

Open educational resources are created by individuals and entities and are shared within social
networks via the web. Some networks are geographical with a digital presence, such as the
Washington OER Hub, the #GoOpenVA website, CUNY Teacher Education OER Hub, or
OERColorado. Others are contributed and curated into collections such as the K-12 Teaching and
Learning hub in OERCommons or MERLOT. There are sites from particular non-profit, association,
or university-affiliated entities such as PhET Interactive Simulations, Khan Academy, CommonLit,
ShareMyLesson, OpenUpResources or those affiliated with government and/or foundation-funded
projects such as BetterLesson (CC BY or CC BY-NC) or NASA (Public Domain). CanvasCommons
hosts a large number of OER directly importable into Canvas. Among sources popular in the North
American context but less relevant to PreK-12 environments are the Open Textbook Library and the
Pressbooks Directory. There are many others.

Several university libraries have developed tools to search for OER. These include OASIS (Openly
Available Sources Integrated Search) from SUNY Genesseo's Milne Library and the Mason OER
Metafinder (MOM) from Mason Publishing at the University Libraries at George Mason University.
Both search across multiple OER sources. Only MOM offers real-time searching. Finally, Google
Advanced Search can be helpful for locating openly licensed content. To use, scroll down to "usage
rights" and set to "free to use, share, or modify."

Reviewing Open Educational Resources

Multiple rubrics exist for evaluation of course materials at PreK-12 levels. Achieve offers its EQuIP
(Educators Evaluating the Quality of Instructional Products) designed to identify materials aligned
to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) or Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). In
addition, Achieve offers downloadable PDF rubrics for evaluation of open educational resources.

Projects may have their own rubrics for specific criteria they would like to have met. This could be
applied during the search process or after an adaptation or authoring process. One example is the
Curator Checklist for CENI projects, designed by the authors.
26 | 3. OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES AND THE CASE FOR PRIORITIZING, USING, FINDING, AND SHARING
OER CONTENT | READINGS

In the U.S. public school arena, overall curriculum policy and selection decisions are made by states
and/or school districts ideally in consultation with teachers and administrators. School districts
have various practices for evaluating curriculum. Nearly 40% of school districts did not use any
external review sites. Of those that chose an OER-based curriculum, 17% consulted EdReports
which offers evaluation of full-course OER, and 14% consulted AchieveTheCore, EdSurge,
LearningList (fee-based subscription) or NCEE (Seaman and Seaman, 2020). School districts
which have decided to #GoOpen were not listed as an information source for curriculum reviews,
but may be a helpful source of information in sharing their strategies.10

Applying Copyright, Open Licensing, and Fair Use Knowledge

A Creative Commons license can be applied to any of your original work. Use the Creative Commons
License Chooser to select a license. CC license icons can also be obtained here.

We will cover this topic in more depth in the next two modules.

Tracking the Licenses and Required Attributions of Added Content

Tracking the license, source, title, and author information for all added content will save a
tremendous amount of time later. Think of this as a citation manager. Here is a spreadsheet for
collecting this type of data [XLS], or copy the headers from the table to make your own. Note that
all visual elements will require alternative text, so that is also included in the table.

Accessibility

We will cover this topic in in the section titled "Make Resources Accessible for Students with
Disabilities."

Adjusting Resources to Pedagogical Practices and Technology or
Vice Versa

This is one place where teacher expertise is especially important. While teachers can certainly
expand their knowledge regarding the affordances of open educational resources (video--start at
23:34) and options related to learners are creators with agency--also known as open pedagogy,
teachers are experts regarding pedagogy in their contexts.

Supporting Teachers

The purpose of this toolkit is to support the reader as they support PreK-12 teachers or those in
direct collaboration with PreK-12 teachers. The work of OER is not without effort. It is possible
but requires knowledge and training, without which, teachers are less likely to engage (Misra,
2014). Misra cites a number of projects that prioritize teacher training regarding open educational
resources. You are welcome to use, build on, and create your own version of the presentation
"OER: A Quick Overview for Teachers" (PPT | slides) and the accompanying two-page Teacher OER
introduction handout (docx | gDocs). There are various other self-study resources to share and/or
build on in the OER Starter Kit.

PRESENTATION

   Anita R. Walz

Copyright is often perceived as an overwhelmingly complex or litigious topic. However, it does not
need to be necessarily so. Academics and teachers with access to accurate information, especially
when applied to particular contexts, can understand and feel comfortable implementing best
practices for their and others' materials.

The presentation and script "In Service of Others: Honoring Others' Copyrights -- and Making Your
Work Useful (to others)" provides a two-part overview of copyright and open-licensing concepts
and applications. Part I covers the basics of U.S. Copyright. These presentations are not legal
advice nor intended to be exhaustive; rather, they are relevant to what academics and teachers
need to know. Part I is about using others' original works, and Part II is about creating and sharing
works (in particular, sharing using open licenses) so that others have the flexibility to use the
resources in ways that meet their specific needs or audiences.

One example is the author's own adaptation of the slides and concepts for a different audience as

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Articulate copyright-related barriers in teaching, learning, and sharing.
           Describe what can be under copyright, how it gets there, who is a copyright holder, and
             how long copyright lasts in a U.S. context.
           Articulate and apply the default position of copyright regarding "ownership," refuting
             common myths about student work and online materials. Namely, that everything is
             created by someone--unless it has entered the Public Domain or is still owned by someone
             (e.g., instructors are not automatically free to use student work or things they find "free
             online").

     Assignment

         1. Read through the presentation and transcript for Part I (this section) and Part II (the next
             section).

         2. Document any questions including where the content is confusing.
         3. Reflect on what in the presentation is helpful. How could you shape it to make it more

             helpful?
         4. In two or fewer pages, reflect on what you would need to do to be able to be able to

             deliver some or all of this presentation.

Slide Deck Transcript

Introduction

Suppose you own a bicycle, or other very useful, mainstream item which is common for your
audience to own (e.g., a snow shovel, public transit pass, physics textbook, gaming console, etc.).
[interactive activity] Please raise your hand if you own a bicycle. [Hawa raises hand.] Ok, great. [ok
to put hands down but ask students for their names.] If Javier wants to borrow Hawa's bicycle, can
he? [discussion] No, he needs to ask. And if Hawa does not respond, can he borrow it? [discussion]
If Hawa says he can borrow it on Tuesday from 11:00-12:00, does that mean he can also use it on
Wednesday from 9:00-10:00, or for the rest of the year? If he has permission to use it to get to class
can he also use it in a competitive bike race? Can he paint it a different color? Since Hawa gave
permission to Javier, does that mean Max can also use Hawa's bicycle? No, of course not.
Copyright is a lot like this bicycle example. In the same way that someone owns even an unlocked,
unaccompanied bicycle, someone likewise owns the digital artifact you found freely on the web,
the picture published in a book you own, the architectural model you saw in Architecture Studio, or
the cool diagram you saw on a conference poster. In the same way as borrowing a bicycle, you must
obtain some sort of permission to use in-copyright works when those rights don't belong to you.
36 | 4. COPYRIGHT PART I: FIVE PRINCIPLES OF COPYRIGHT WHEN PLANNING TO SHARE | PRESENTATION

When teaching requires research and publication, we often want to integrate the actual materials
(not just citable ideas) into our own work. These are materials that someone else made. Do you have
any examples from your own life/work/studies when you wanted to do this? Our work is often better
when we draw on others' expertise and what they have made. Well, this poses a problem, doesn't it?
We WANT to draw on a lot of sources that we didn't create.

Two Dilemmas When Creating With Sharing in Mind

There are two questions here: 1) how to use others' work legally and ethically, and 2) making your
work useful for others who may need to customize or adapt it to fit their use.
While the following idea may be controversial, there is some expectation (a "should" if you will) that
if we expect others to share in a certain way, that we too should be willing to do the same. The
following information may help you to get there.

Part I: Five Things Everyone Should Know about Copyright

Let's step back to look at some relevant underlying principles, not about what we do, but about the
legal environment in which we function in the U.S.. We're going to quickly go through a series of SIX
principles that outline what you need to know about copyright. (We'll cover #6 in the next section.)
   4. COPYRIGHT PART I: FIVE PRINCIPLES OF COPYRIGHT WHEN PLANNING TO SHARE | PRESENTATION | 37

Principle 1: Unless otherwise marked, always assume that every artifact's copyrights are owned
by someone. That someone might be YOU. Like a bicycle, unless clearly marked, or you have a
highly informed reason to know otherwise. You should always assume that every created thing you
see or hear which is somehow preserved or "recorded" (legal experts use the phrase "recorded in a
fixed medium") has copyrights owned by someone. This also includes content you don't have to pay
for that you find on the internet.

This means that unless your employer, sponsor, or work agreement or policy says otherwise, you
have complete ownership over your original work! Note that in the U.S. most employers by default
assert ownership over their employees' work created on the job. However, if you are a university
student, you own your work (unless you're an employee or you have a prior arrangement with
someone funding your schooling costs). You are a copyright owner!

       Apply your new knowledge

           1. Who owns images you find on the internet?
           2. What about content found in physical or electronic books, DVDs, and/or streaming

                media owned by you (or to which you or your library subscribe)? Who owns that?
           3. True or false: An employer owns work-related, creative outputs of its employees.
       Answers:

           1. Who owns images you find on the internet? Likely other people.
           2. What about content found in physical or electronic books, DVDs, and/or streaming

                media owned by you (or to which you or your library subscribe)? Who owns that?
                The copyright holders of the materials. Likely other people. You may have access to
                the physical or streaming media, but you likely don't own any copyrights in the work
                unless you have an agreement in writing.
           3. True or false: An employer owns work-related, creative outputs of its employees. True
                (Note that some employers, like Virginia Tech, grant some but not all rights back to
                their employees through the university's Intellectual Property Policy.)
38 | 4. COPYRIGHT PART I: FIVE PRINCIPLES OF COPYRIGHT WHEN PLANNING TO SHARE | PRESENTATION

Principle 2: Copyright is automatic. Copyrights are established the moment a creative work
is fixed in a medium , even if you never add a copyright symbol  to the work. A copyright is
established by its creator the moment when they press "save," as soon as one's pen hits the paper
to create a doodle, or the moment when your smartphone camera takes a video or a picture.

       Apply your new knowledge
           1. Which of the following can be copyrighted, and why?
                     Recorded music from 2007
                     Photos I took with my phone
                     Pictures found using Google
                     Famous person's birthday*
                     Your phone's ring tone
                     TikTok video
                     Photos taken by your child
                     Unpublished journal article
                     Published journal article
                     Song you wrote but didn't write down or record*
                     E = mc2 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105...*

       Answer: Items with a * are not copyrightable

Works in a fixed medium created by human beings are automatically under copyright. Examples
include: a sculpture, a filed saved to your computer or the cloud, a doodle on a piece of scratch
paper, or a picture taken with your cell phone.
   4. COPYRIGHT PART I: FIVE PRINCIPLES OF COPYRIGHT WHEN PLANNING TO SHARE | PRESENTATION | 39

There are some things that cannot be under copyright. These include:

   Ideas, facts, data, common knowledge
   Narrative, image, song (when there is no record)
   Works clearly donated to the Public Domain
   Published in the US pre-1926*
   Created by U.S. Government employees acting in an official capacity
   Currently, works compiled by a computer such as an AI-generated image are not

      copyrightable.

*Note: The entry date of works into the Public Domain in the U.S. advances each year. As of Jan
1st 2023, it will be works published pre-1927. On Jan 1, 2024 it will be pre-1928, and so on. For more
info, see: https://copyright.cornell.edu/publicdomain.

Principle 3: All published works are destined for freedom from Copyright in the Public Domain,
but it takes a long while for them to get there. When copyrighted materials reach a certain age,
they "graduate" from Copyright and join the Public Domain and are free from copyright restrictions.
(Note that "I found this free online" is not the same as being in the Public Domain.) Original works
may also be donated or clearly marked by their maker as donated to the Public Domain (CC0).
However, works made by U.S. Federal Employees during their official duties are automatically in
the Public Domain in the United States.

So, in summary, works fall into three different categories: (1) works YOU made, whose rights you did
not sell or give away, (2) works someone else made, and (3) works in the Public Domain.

       Apply your new knowledge
       What is the Public Domain? How does a work get into the Public Domain?
       Answer
       As of January 1, 2022, works published in the U.S. prior to 1927 are in the Public Domain.
       However, this is a rolling date that changes every year. If it is no longer 2022, use Cornell
       University's "Copyright Term and the Public Domain Guide"2 to determine which works
       registered or first published in the U.S. are in the Public Domain.
40 | 4. COPYRIGHT PART I: FIVE PRINCIPLES OF COPYRIGHT WHEN PLANNING TO SHARE | PRESENTATION

Principle 4: Copyrights can be thought of as a creator's monopoly (in duration and use) over a
bundle of different rights. Relevant here are rights to copy, create other versions, publicly display,
and distribute your work. These last the author's lifetime, plus 70 years before graduating to the
Public Domain. Unless a work is clearly a "work for hire," for example, in a written contract, you as
the author have a monopoly on these rights.

       Apply your new knowledge

             Describe the monopoly an author/creator obtains when making something.
             How does the author/creator obtain this monopoly?
             What do these monopoly rights include?
             How long do these rights last and what happens to these rights when an author dies?

       Answers:

             According to 17 U.S. Code  106 and subject to sections 107 through 122, the owner
                of copyright under this title has the exclusive rights to do and to authorize any of
                the following: (1) to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords; (2) to
                prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; (3) to distribute copies
                or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of
                ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; (4) in the case of literary, musical, dramatic,
                and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual
                works, to perform the copyrighted work publicly; (5) in the case of literary, musical,
                dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural
                works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work,
                to display the copyrighted work publicly; and (6) in the case of sound recordings,
                to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.
                Source: U.S. Code  106 subject to sections 107-122.

             This monopoly is automatic.
             See above
             These rights last (for an individual) for their lifetime plus 70 years. Upon death, unless

                rights were transferred, assigned, or willed elsewhere, these rights become part of the
                author's estate and transfer to their heirs. The length of copyright for works created
                under corporate authorship is longer (120 years).
    4. COPYRIGHT PART I: FIVE PRINCIPLES OF COPYRIGHT WHEN PLANNING TO SHARE | PRESENTATION | 41

Principle 5: A creator/author may commoditize, license, or donate parts or the whole bundle of
rights.

As mentioned in principle 4, the "bundle" of rights relevant to us are rights to copy, create other
versions (derivatives), publicly display, and distribute the work.

An author may retain, sell, donate, and/or license parts (or the whole bundle) to one party (an
exclusive use) or to many parties, for limited times or for all time, within limited geographies or to
all geographies, in certain media or in an infinite number of types of media.

       Apply your new knowledge
       Which of the following can a copyright owner do with their original writings or other creative
       works in a fixed medium? Which of these are mutually exclusive (i.e., for which could a
       copyright owner not do both)?

             License an exclusive right to distribute copies
             Apply a Creative Commons license to the work
             Sell film rights separately from book publication rights
             Give away rights to make other versions or sequels
             Donate works to the Public Domain
       Answer:
       A copyright owner can do any of these things. If a copyright owner is extending exclusive
       rights, the copyright holder cannot extend those rights to anyone else.

PRESENTATION

   Anita R. Walz

Authors have multiple options when incorporating others' works (images, quotes, tables, etc.)
into their own works. When doing so with openly-licensed works it is important to consider that
downstream uses may adapt your work, and that it is a good practice to make that as
straightforward as possible. This is primarily so that others have the flexibility to use them in ways
that meet their needs and are not obligated to remove in-copyright elements because they lack
permission or would be required to think through a fair-use analysis in order to reproduce them.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Summarize why using Creative Commons licenses and CC-licensed works overcome
             many copyright-related challenges.
           Locate and interpret the terms-of-use for example items.

Slide Deck Transcript

If you own a bicycle, it's pretty clear that you have rights to lend it out, sell it, keep it, paint it, take it
on a world tour, and ride it wherever you are authorized to do so. And the same with materials in the
Public Domain1 (works that were created by a U.S. Government employee, or published in the U.S.
as of a 1920ish date). Note that works in the U.S. are continually entering the Public Domain--see
Copyright Term and the Public Domain from Cornell University for authoritative information. But
what about when someone else owns the bicycle [the middle bucket on the slide]? What rights do
you have if you are not the owner? Is there any situation in which (perhaps in a true emergency)
you might be justified in borrowing something you do not own for a use and duration that was
warranted?

Well, this poses a problem, doesn't it? Because we WANT to draw on a lot of sources when we
create. Our work is often better when we draw on others' expertise and what they have made. How
do we answer the second dilemma of using others' works? What exemptions exist for you to use
others' works, and what rights do others have to use your works?

Here is our proverbial bicycle again.

Copyright is a lot like this bicycle example. In the same way that someone owns an unlocked,
unaccompanied bicycle, someone likewise owns the digital artifact you found freely on the web,
the picture published in a book you own, the architectural model your classmate built and left in
your classroom or studio overnight, or the cool diagram you saw on a conference poster.
46 | 5. COPYRIGHT PART II: USING OTHERS' ORIGINAL WORKS LEGALLY (CREATIVE COMMONS, FAIR USE,
AND PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION

In the same way as borrowing a bicycle, you must obtain some sort of permission to use in-
copyright works when those rights don't belong to you. This includes student academic work,
because students own their own work! There is good news!

Principle 6: There ARE Legal and Ethical Ways to use
Others' In-Copyright Works.

There are three basic options. We'll take these from the bottom, up (in the order we typically think
of them) then we'll talk about level of effort, which is why they are numbered in seemingly reverse
order. You don't need to memorize every detail about these, just reflect on the three kinds of
exemptions that exist for using others' works (or others using your work).

3. Obtaining permission to use in-copyright materials for specific purposes (similar to obtaining
permission to borrow Hawa's bicycle).

2. Options established through U.S. Copyright Law which allow use of works under the terms of
"Fair Use" or the TEACH Act, on which some teachers will (rightly) rely on, or other exemption
documented in statutory law. Because the TEACH Act exemptions require that twenty-two factors
be met2 and one of those factors is "share only with my class," the TEACH Act exemption is not
useful for our "share for many uses and many classrooms" types of uses. We will not be discussing
the TEACH Act further.

And 1. Using materials under the terms for which permission has already been granted. This
permission is also known as a "license." (Note that CC licenses always require attribution--see the
Best Practices for Attribution - Creative Commons3 document at the bottom of the slide).

       Apply your new knowledge

           1. What are the three options for you to use another's work, or for others to use your
                work?

           2. Do these rules apply to work created by students?

                                                                                                         PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION | 47

       Answers:
           1. Obtaining permission, claiming Fair Use through the TEACH Act, and using materials
                under a license.
           2. Yes. See also your campus intellectual property policy.

       *Note that using another's idea, language, argument structure, etc., always requires citation
       as to affirm academic integrity and avoid plagiarism.

This [3,2,1] is the order in which we might commonly think of these options. However, if we think
of them from "least effort" to "greatest effort" we will start at with number 1--where permission is
already granted rather than seeking out new permission.

You don't have to recall all of the details (yet) but it is important for you to remember these THREE
options so that you can understand what practices are acceptable.

The three options are: (1) choosing to use works that already have a license allowing your specific,
proposed use (and yes, we'll talk more later about "specific, proposed uses"), (2) leveraging an
exemption in U.S. copyright law such as Fair Use, or (3) obtaining permission for your specific,
proposed use.
[Resource: A Framework for Analyzing any U.S. Copyright Problem4]

Let's talk quickly through these three relevant options in the Framework for any U.S. Copyright
Question. We'll dive deeper into each one momentarily.

After confirming that material is indeed in-copyright, we ask:

 1. Does the work already have a license permitting my proposed use?

         Creative Commons licenses (which always require attribution) are one such license which
            is appended on an in-copyright work;

         Another license might be covered in the "Terms of use" section described on a website.

(We'll return to Creative Commons licenses and Terms of Use in a moment.)
48 | 5. COPYRIGHT PART II: USING OTHERS' ORIGINAL WORKS LEGALLY (CREATIVE COMMONS, FAIR USE,
AND PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION

By way of analogy, this would be a bit like Hawa placing a sign on her bicycle stating "Free to ride on
Wednesday thru Friday from 4-6pm. Return in the condition borrowed or better."

    2. Is my proposed use more fair than infringing according to an informed Fair Use analysis?
Because you're not getting permission from the copyright owner or their authorized
representative, fair use is all about CONTEXT. A Fair Use analysis is one you conduct yourself to
determine if a use is more fair or more infringing. It's based on totaling up results for four factors
established by copyright law: (1) the type of use, (2) the character of work you're using, (3) how much
of the work you're using, and (4) the degree of harm to the commercial market for your proposed
use.

This would be like using Hawa's bicycle without her permission but in a way that has minimal impact
to her. You might use only part of the bicycle or use it in a novel way it was generally not planned to
be used (for a very limited time and in a very limited context).

Two helpful tools include

   The "Fair Use Evaluator"5 which can help you to organize your fair use evaluation, and
   Best Practices in Fair Use for Open Educational Resources (Pages 11-14)6.

(We'll return to Fair Use in a moment.)

If steps 1 & 2 are not fruitful, in other words, if there is no pre-existing license or if your Fair Use
analysis shows that your proposed use is more infringing than fair, move to the next step: seek and
obtain) permission.

    3. Have I obtained permission for my specific, proposed use? This is the copyright owner
indicating that they grant you permission for your specific, particular use. This would be like you
asking Hawa for permission to use the bicycle between 3-5pm on Tuesday, and Hawa saying "Yes,
you may use my bicycle between 3 and 5pm on Tuesday, but please don't ride it through the
mud." It usually involves a lot of context, e.g., where/to whom (how public or restricted the use or
distribution is), what format, how long, etc. (For further information, see the U.S. Copyright Office's
circular on obtaining permission.7.) We'll talk further about a helpful way you can obtain permission,
and establish helpful reuse rights as well.

In case you're looking for the overall framework, see the "Framework for Analyzing any U.S.
Copyright Problem"8.

Let's Look a bit Deeper at the Three Options

 1. Does the work already have a license permitting my proposed use?

As we mentioned earlier, a work might have a Creative Commons license or some other type of
open license. Alternatively, your proposed use might already be covered in the "Terms/Conditions
of Use" section described on a website.

Creative Commons Licenses

What are Creative Commons licenses? Creative Commons licenses are free license markers that
a copyright owner or their authorized agent add to an original work. The licenses do not remove
copyright but are a layer on top of copyright, and move the permission to use the work from "All
Rights Reserved" to "Some Rights Reserved." They enable the creator of a work to indicate to others
what uses are permitted.

There are six licenses (at the bottom) and two Public Domain markers (at the top). The licenses
have up to four icons each as you can see on the right: BY attribution (the person, which reminds us
that we are required to give attribution), NC or Non-Commercial (the crossed out currency system
which indicates that primarily-commercial uses are prohibited), SA or ShareAlike (the leftward
arrow which indicates that any adaptions must be licensed under the same terms as the original),
and ND or No Derivatives (the equal sigh which tells us that we cannot make, build-on and
redistribute a changed version). The two public domain markers (CC PD and CC0 indicate
respectively, that a work has "no known copyright," or that it has to the degree possible been
donated to the Public Domain by its creator and marked as such.

The public domain markers and licenses are displayed in order of freedom--the most freedom at
the top to the least freedom at the bottom. They are named according to the sequence of their
icons. For example, the fourth one in the list is referenced as: CC BY SA or Creative Commons
Attribution ShareAlike.

The bottom two icons are ND or "no derivatives," and do not allow redistribution with changes.
While they are still valuable, because they do not allow adaptation and sharing, they are not
considered to be open licenses. Nor are works marked as ND or "no derivatives" considered to be
open educational resources (OER).
50 | 5. COPYRIGHT PART II: USING OTHERS' ORIGINAL WORKS LEGALLY (CREATIVE COMMONS, FAIR USE,
AND PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION

Here is an introductory brochure on Creative Commons licenses.9

What do the licenses allow, require or prohibit people from doing? Because we are specifically
concerned about making our resources useful for others (including others making their own
versions with changes), we've included in our discussion only those licenses which allow adaptation
and redistribution in the chart below. In short, "ND" licenses are not included.

Figure 5.1: Unpacking Creative Commons licenses

There are a lot of things you are permitted to do with Creative Commons licensed works (those that
allow derivatives, anyway). These are often called the 5R permissions (retain, reuse, revise, remix,
and redistribute).10 As mentioned before, there are some restrictions. There are CC-licensed works
that prohibit primarily commercial uses (NC or "NonCommercial"). And, there are others which
require any versions or derivatives to have the same license (SA or "ShareAlike").

One VERY IMPORTANT thing to know is that all CC licenses always require attribution (BY or
"Attribution"). You can read about the licenses (and read the individual licenses) here.11 If you're
displaying or reproducing something with a Creative Commons license that allows derivatives,
you must list the title, author, source (URL), and CC-license under which it was used. Further
information regarding how to do this is available in Creative Commons' wiki site, Best Practices for
Attribution.12
     5. COPYRIGHT PART II: USING OTHERS' ORIGINAL WORKS LEGALLY (CREATIVE COMMONS, FAIR USE, AND
                                                                                                         PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION | 51

If a picture, photo, textbook, etc. has a Creative Commons license on it which allows derivatives,
you may incorporate it into your own work, or build on it with attribution. You'll also want to make
certain that the licensed works within your overall work are compatible with the overall Creative
Commons license you put on your work.

For example, if your overall license allows commercial use (CC BY, CC BY SA), best practice is
not to include items that cannot be used commercially (CC BY NC, CC BY NC SA) within. For
further information, see the Creative Commons FAWs and compatibility chart at Wiki/cc license
compatibility.13

If you're interested, this six minute introductory video provides more background on the origins
of Creative Commons licenses and why someone might want to use them. See this video at:
https://youtu.be/BlhJUJ9DC4A.14

Terms of Use as a Second Alternative

If a resource does not have a Creative Commons license, sometimes the "Terms of Use" on a parent
website or in the front matter of the resource indicates what rights you might have. Here are two
examples: U.S. Geological Service15 and TeacherTube16. Can you come up with a third example?
Possibly one which is more permissive?

Let's talk about specific, proposed uses. Here are several examples of specific, proposed uses:

   Display a high-resolution image of an original that is in-copyright in a class lecture once per
      semester every semester.

   Insert an excerpt of a published paragraph or image and cite it. Distribute the overall work
      under a specific Creative Commons license.

   Reproduce a thumbnail image on the internet in a non-commercial setting to a global
      audience.

   Reproduce a high-resolution image in a commercial printed and (in perpetuity) digital
      publication with an anticipated print distribution of 1,000 and a digital subscriber audience of
      15,000.
52 | 5. COPYRIGHT PART II: USING OTHERS' ORIGINAL WORKS LEGALLY (CREATIVE COMMONS, FAIR USE,
AND PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION

For which of these would you conduct a fair use analysis? For which would you already know that
you should obtain permission? Do all of the examples have enough context (when, where, who, how
much, public versus restricted, whether is is an economic impact) for you to even do a fair use
analysis? What other information would you need?

You might ask, "What does my specific use mean, and why does this matter?" In the same way as
lending a bicycle, owners of things may wish to enforce limits on how long you do something with
their work, where it is shared, and how it might be changed (in the same way that Hawa might say
"No, I don't permit you to use my bicycle in a race through the mud," or "No, you may not borrow it
for a week.")

How about this example? Thinking about your specific use, especially how broad it is, can help
you know how much effort your project might be. Take a moment to read through the example
"allowable uses." Which seem most permissive? Which are more restrictive but still useful? If
someone wanted to use your work, would they be able to do what they wanted to do?

Take a moment to compare proposed uses with allowable uses. Then we'll give you a chance
to document your specific use and if we want to later, we'll return to this and to examine the
possibilities for whether or not you can use something in the way you've proposed, and how.

Now, it's your turn. What is a specific use you might have? What might you want to use? How? How
much? Answer each of the questions on the "Your Turn" slide. [Sharing (optional) or return to this as
an exercise/follow up exercise.]

Let's Talk About Fair Use. Is my Proposed Use More Fair Than
Infringing According to an Informed Fair Use Analysis?

This is not a trick question. Not all educational use is fair use. And your proposed use in
class--especially if you are planning to share in a context broader than your classroom--is broader
than prior situations you may have considered. A proposed, specific use should include aspects of:

   How do you hope to use the copyrighted work?
   How creative (vs. factual) is the work? Has the work already been published?
   How much or how substantive is the part of the work you are using?
   Does my proposed use harm the original copyright holder's market for their work?
     5. COPYRIGHT PART II: USING OTHERS' ORIGINAL WORKS LEGALLY (CREATIVE COMMONS, FAIR USE, AND
                                                                                                         PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION | 53

There are a few things to know about fair use:

   Section 107 of the Copyright Act17 provides the framework for Fair Use. It describes the four
      factors.

   Not all educational use is fair use.
   Outreach and sharing beyond your classroom changes the "purpose and character of the use."

Uses are on a continuum. Some may be more fair. Some may be more infringing. If your proposed
use is not as "fair" as needed, a key question to ask is "how can I make my use MORE fair." In detail,
here are the four factors from the U.S. Copyright Office:

       What is Fair Use?
       Fair use is a legal doctrine that promotes freedom of expression by permitting the
       unlicensed use of copyright-protected works in certain circumstances. Section 107 of the
       Copyright Act18 provides the statutory framework for determining whether something is a
       fair use and identifies certain types of uses--such as criticism, comment, news reporting,
       teaching, scholarship, and research--as examples of activities that may qualify as fair use.
       Section 107 calls for consideration of the following four factors in evaluating a question of
       fair use:

           1. Purpose and character of the use, including whether the use is of a commercial
                nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes: Courts look at how the party
                claiming fair use is using the copyrighted work, and are more likely to find that
                nonprofit educational and noncommercial uses are fair. This does not mean, however,
                that all nonprofit education and noncommercial uses are fair and all commercial
                uses are not fair; instead, courts will balance the purpose and character of the use
                against the other factors below. Additionally, "transformative" uses are more likely to be
                considered fair. Transformative uses are those that add something new, with a further
                purpose or different character, and do not substitute for the original use of the work.

           2. Nature of the copyrighted work: This factor analyzes the degree to which the work
                that was used relates to copyright's purpose of encouraging creative expression. Thus,
                using a more creative or imaginative work (such as a novel, movie, or song) is less likely
                to support a claim of a fair use than using a factual work (such as a technical article or
54 | 5. COPYRIGHT PART II: USING OTHERS' ORIGINAL WORKS LEGALLY (CREATIVE COMMONS, FAIR USE,
AND PERMISSION) | PRESENTATION

                news item). In addition, use of an unpublished work is less likely to be considered fair.
           3. Amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work

                as a whole: Under this factor, courts look at both the quantity and quality of the
                copyrighted material that was used. If the use includes a large portion of the
                copyrighted work, fair use is less likely to be found; if the use employs only a small
                amount of copyrighted material, fair use is more likely. That said, some courts have
                found use of an entire work to be fair under certain circumstances. And in other
                contexts, using even a small amount of a copyrighted work was determined not to be
                fair because the selection was an important part--or the "heart"--of the work.
           4. Effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
                work: Here, courts review whether, and to what extent, the unlicensed use harms
                the existing or future market for the copyright owner's original work. In assessing this
                factor, courts consider whether the use is hurting the current market for the original
                work (for example, by displacing sales of the original) and/or whether the use could
                cause substantial harm if it were to become widespread.

       In addition to the above, other factors may also be considered by a court in weighing a fair
       use question, depending upon the circumstances. Courts evaluate fair use claims on a
       case-by-case basis, and the outcome of any given case depends on a fact-specific inquiry.
       This means that there is no formula to ensure that a predetermined percentage or amount
       of a work--or specific number of words, lines, pages, copies--may be used without
       permission.19

As a last resort: Have I obtained permission for my specific, proposed use?

And, finally, as a last resort: obtain permission. Again, obtaining permission goes beyond just
asking for permission. Just as you need a "yes" from Hawa to use her bicycle, you must get a "yes"
to be able to copy and redistribute the work. Further information for requesting permission is
available in the U.S. Copyright Office circular #10.20 You'll need to identify and contact the owner of
the work, describe what you want to use, and when and how you want to use it. You might also ask
for the in-copyright work to be released under the same Creative Commons license as your overall
work. And, get it all in writing.

In Summary

There are some things you can do when you don't have enough rights , are not sure that you have
enough rights, or when your Fair Use analysis is more infringing than fair:

   Look for alternatives: Find openly-licensed or Public Domain equivalent material that meets
      the same need.

   Look for ways to make your use more fair. Use less, smaller, lower resolution. . . only as much
      as is necessary.

   Use a work in a different or transformative* way than it was intended. Add value to the work.
   Obtain permission. When, where, how much + may I release this under the same open license

      as my work?
   Create your own original work. Take your own picture. Make your own drawing. Put the idea in

      your own words (and cite it!).

 Review / Discussion questions

     List the three options for you to use another's work, or for others to use your work.
     If you want to incorporate part of someone else's work into yours, describe the steps you would

       take to determine if that is ok.
     Which of the three options seem easiest for incorporating others' work in your own?
     Which of the three options require that you think most carefully about your "proposed use?"

       Why is that important?
     Does any of this change your thinking about how you might share?

         Discussion
             1. What sorts of third-party works might you want to incorporate into your OER?
             2. What options do you have for incorporating third-party works into your original work?
             3. Compare and constrast the options for incorporating third-party works. What are the
                 benefits to you? What are the benefits (or risks) to downstream users?

6. FIND AND USE OPENLY-LICENSED
IMAGES: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE | GUIDE

   Anita R. Walz

Images, figures, and other graphic elements are among the most frequently used Creative
Commons' licensed materials incorporated into others' original works. This step-by-step guide
walks you through how to not only find openly-licensed graphic elements, but how to create or find
an attribution statement which is required per the CC license when reusing Creative Commons
licensed works.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Use terms and synonyms to find relevant CC-licensed images or graphics.
           Download and correctly attribute Creative Commons-licensed images.
           If working with pictures that include people, be able to locate pictures of more diverse
             people, and describe model rights and the "right to publicity".
60 | 6. FIND AND USE OPENLY-LICENSED IMAGES: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE | GUIDE

     Assignment

         1. List up to three animals, vegetables, or common household items.
         2. Search for pictures of one or two of the items using the sources below. Document your

             search and what you found in 1 page.
         3. Provide an attribution for at least one image from each search environment.
         4. If the images you found include people in them, see if you can find pictures you can use

             which are more representative of the diversity of your intended audience1 and read about
             model rights or the "right of publicity."2 Describe the conditions under which you could
             use a photo of a recognizable or famous person.
         5. (optional) Compare and contrast coverage available from the various search tools.

Find and Use Openly-Licensed Images: A Step-by-Step
Guide

Searchers most frequently ask how and where to find openly-licensed graphics or photos. This
three step guide aids those seeking openly licensed images.
STEP 1: Create a list of search terms
STEP 2: Use specific search tools to find relevant openly-licensed images

   openverse https://wordpress.org/openverse
   Wikimedia Commons https://commons.wikimedia.org
   Google Advanced Image Search https://www.google.com/advanced_image_search

STEP 3: Determine if you can use what you find--and correctly attribute it

   Do you need more help?

STEP 1: What are you Looking for?

List your key search terms and synonyms for each concept below.
   Example 1: book OR manuscript OR textbook OR reading material
   Example 2: pachyderm OR pachydermata OR elephant
  
  
  

STEP 2: Use Specific Tools

openverse (formerly Creative Commons Search)
   Go to: https://wordpress.org/openverse
   Enter your selected search terms. Optional: use the drop down menu to limit to images or
      audio. Press "Search." In this example, we will search using the word "dolphin."

                           Figure 6.1: openverse search interface (annotated)
62 | 6. FIND AND USE OPENLY-LICENSED IMAGES: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE | GUIDE

   The search results are shown below. Use the "Filters" in the upper right hand corner to filter
      your search results by use, license, image type, file type, aspect ratio, image size, or source, if
      you wish.

 Click on the image you want to use, copy the attribution information (as seen below) and add
   both to your document.

         Figure 6.3: Example of individual item display in openverse (annotated)
64 | 6. FIND AND USE OPENLY-LICENSED IMAGES: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE | GUIDE

   Click on "Get this image" to double check the license and author information, and download the
      image and add it (and the attribution statement) to your document.

NOTE: In this case, we discover that the name of the author in Flickr, likely the source of the image
in openverse, is different than in openverse. The author may have uploaded this under two different
names. Or, someone else may be falsely claiming credit. Best practice is to use and attribute the
oldest instance of the image and attribution. In this case, we cannot tell what the upload date
is in openverse. Checking this in a reverse image search tool like Tineye (https://tineye.com) or
Google Reverse Image Search (https://images.google.com) can help us to determine which version
of the image is oldest and/or largest or highest resolution, and thus which attribution is likely to be
correct. As the image in Flickr was uploaded in 2006, it is older than any of the other options, so we
will credit the photographer, Ste Elmore, in the attribution.
In this case, this image is attributed as: (c) Ste Elmore. 2006. Dolphin Encounter CC BY 2.0

Note: Flickr.com is the host website for this image. The download interface will look different
depending on where the image is hosted.

   From the search results, I have clicked on an image to look at. The image appears on the right
      hand side of the screen as seen in the figure below. Within your search, click on the button
      "More Details" to see more details regarding the image you selected.

   Review the image (especially file size/resolution). Write your attribution statement; include
      the title, author, source/URL, and license (with links for each). Add the attribution statement
      and the downloaded image to your document.

In this case, the attribution would be:

You must follow the terms of the license. Will you?
Yes / No

   Attribution
         Attribution is always required.
         Test your knowledge by looking at good, good enough, and insufficient attribution
            statements provided in Best practices for attribution of Creative Commons licenses3
         Attribution is easy, but specific: A simple rule-of-thumb to remember is TASL (title,
            author, source/URL, license)

Here are three examples:
              1. Example: [Title] by [Author] [Source/URL] [License]
             2. Example: VertiCrop System by Valcenteu https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/
                  File:VertiCrop.jpg CC BY SA 3.0
             3. Example: (c) Valcenteu VertiCrop System CC BY SA 3.0

Write your attribution statement here AND copy it into your document

   Certain licenses have restrictions
         NoDerivative (ND) licenses do not allow you to modify and re-share the item.
         ShareAlike (SA) licenses require that you release your version under the same license
         NonCommercial (NC) licenses prohibit primarily commercial uses

Are you incorporating "insets" or small portions that have a different license than the overall
work?

Think of this as adding something to a fruit salad rather than a smoothie. An "inset" makes up only
a small portion of the overall work (i.e., it is a discrete object such as a photograph which generally
maintains its integrity.)

Yes / No

7. MAKE RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE FOR
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES | READINGS

   Anita R. Walz

It is important to know how to design documents. This section provides an introductory to
intermediate overview of basic accessibility features for all readers, and especially those who are
blind or have low vision. There are many types of disabilities. What helps one person might cause
problems for another; this chapter focuses on understanding the priorities for accessibility and
addressing primarily vision-related accessiblity approaches and skill development.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Make the case for why accessibility matters.
           Be able to articulate the P.O.U.R. (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
             framework for accessibility.
           Describe and implement basic accessibility measures for documents.
           Gain experience using one or more accessibility checkers.
           Identify additional resources to progress in understanding accessibility frameworks, user
             needs, tools, experiences, and possible solutions.
78 | 7. MAKE RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES | READINGS

     Assignment

           Skim the entire chapter and briefly review the types of resources and tools provided
             under section "understanding and implementing P.O.U.R." and in the "Resources and
             Additional Reading."

           Read the 15-minute guide for creating accessible documents1 from the National Center
             on Accessible Educational Materials.

           View the creating accessible documents video playlist (approximately 20 minutes)2 from
             the National Center on Accessible Educational Materials.

           Choose a file type or technical platform which would likely be used by a PreK-12
             collaborator, such as MSWord, LibreOffice, or GoogleDocs. Insert at least one content item
             for each category in the list below into your document. (Math is optional if you are not in a
             technical field.)
                   Apply a first-try accessibility solution to each of the items.
                   Evaluate the accessibility of your work using an accessibility checker.
                   Provide your first-try document, a description of where your efforts were successful
                      and where they need improvement, and a final "as accessible as you can
                      reasonably make it" document.

Why Accessibility Matters

The Americans with Disabilities Act3 defines a disability as a "physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more major life activities of an individual". Varying abilities and
disabilities may be congenital, progressive, temporary, or onset at any point in life. They exhibit
themselves along the range of all types of sensory experiences and functions. Disabilities present
in three ways: hidden, visible, and emergent. While some disabilities are observable, many are not
visible or obvious.
                               7. MAKE RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES | READINGS | 79

The diversity in visible, hidden, and emergent abilities necessitates knowledge, creativity, and skill
on the part of learning resource creators. As content-creators our goal should be to proactively
provide useful access in multiple ways with the recognition that one size truly does not fit all.
In many cases, solutions for accessibility are as unique as the people who utilize them; what is
accessible for one person might introduce barriers for another person. However, it is possible to
create proactively to meet a wide range of accessibility needs.

Universal Design is the process of creating products (devices, environments, systems, and
processes) that are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within
the widest possible range of situations (environments, conditions, and circumstances). Universal
Design emerged from the slightly earlier concept of being barrier-free, the broader accessibility
movement, and adaptive technology and assistive technology. It also seeks to blend aesthetics
into these core considerations.

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is a set of principles for curriculum development that gives all
individuals equal opportunities to learn and provides a blueprint for creating instructional goals,
methods, materials, and assessments that ideally work for everyone. Rather than a single, one-
size-fits-all solution, UDL offers a flexible approach that can be customized and adjusted for
individual needs.45 Because we are working with the creation of electronic documents, our focus
in this section is primarily on accessibility for readers with low vision or who are blind.

Readers who are blind or have low vision often use software programs with a speech synthesizer
or braille display to read text displayed on a website or in an electronic document. The reader uses
key commands to navigate or perform more specialized functions within the structure of a page or
document. The following videos demonstrate use of screen readers by readers who are blind or low
vision.

The P.O.U.R. Acronym

A helpful acronym for remembering the goals of accessibility for document development especially
within an HTML or web environment is P.O.U.R. or Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, and
Robust.

   P--Perceivable. Perceivable information and user interface include alternatives to meet
      individual needs. For example: text alternatives for non-text content, captions, and
      alternatives for multimedia. Perceivable focuses on presentation of content in different ways,
      and content that is easier to see and hear.

   O--Operable. Operable user interface and navigation includes functionality available for a
      keyboard (rather than just a mouse), and different input modalities beyond a keyboard. Users
      have enough time to read and use the content, content does not cause seizures and physical
      reactions, and users can easily navigate, find content, and determine where they are.

   U--Understandable. Understandable information and user interface includes text is readable
      and understandable, content appears and operates in predictable ways, and users are helped
      to avoid and correct mistakes.

   R--Robust. Robust content and reliable interpretation includes content is compatible with
      current and future user tools.

The P.O.U.R. acronym comes from the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)9, an
international standard developed through the W3C process. The goal of the process is to provide
a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets individual, organizational, and
governmental needs internationally.

Understanding and Implementing P.O.U.R.

The National Center on Accessible Educational Materials at CAST (National AEM) further expands
and applies the P.O.U.R. Principles in their webpage designing for accessibility using the P.O.U.R.
principles:10

Perceivable: To present information in multiple ways, one may:

   Add text descriptions to your images.
   Include closed captions and transcripts.
   Provide sufficient color contrast.
                               7. MAKE RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES | READINGS | 81

   Do not use color alone.
   Make your text readable and legible.

Operable: To help learners navigate information independently using their preferred tools, one
may:

   Provide a clear structure with headings.
   Create descriptive links.
   Check for keyboard accessibility.
   Provide sufficient time.
   Avoid content that flashes

Understandable: Using consistent and predictable design to support learners' understanding one
may:

   Provide clear directions.
   Aim for consistency.
   Use plain language.
   Identify the language.

skills, see: https://aem.cast.org/create/understandable

Robust: Content that works for learners on current and future technologies, including assistive
technologies, is robust. To make your content robust you may:

   Provide descriptive metadata.
   Perform an accessibility check.
   Test for accessibility with people.

Tools for Getting Started

S.L.I.D.E. Acronym for Creating Accessible Documents

Also useful is National AEM's S.L.I.D.E. acronym11 which provides an entry point for authors working
in MSWord or GoogleDocs that may be new to implementing accessibility in open educational
resources or other documents:

   S--Styles are used for section headings.
   L--Links are descriptive and meaningful.
   I--Images have text descriptions.
   D--Design is perceivable, with high contrast.
   E--Evaluation is holistic and authentic.

Accessibility Solutions for Readers Who are Blind
or have Low Vision

Meeting some common accessibility needs is possible. The following list provides tasks a
document creator can do to proactively improve their documents for a diversity of visual abilities.

 1. Organize your document and use properly nested headers. Instead of calling out different
      sections of a document with bold, italics, or changes in capitalization, use Header1, Header2
      etc. features commonly found in authoring software and nest them correctly. This makes
      document structures more easily navigable, and requires you as a document creator to deliver
      a well-organized document. Using and correctly nesting headers especially benefits readers
      who rely on screen readers. A well-organized document benefits everyone.

 2. Be consistent and predictable with placement of figure titles, table headers, captions, and
      other repeating elements. For example, knowing that a figure title will consistently be
      displayed before a figure makes it easier to navigate a document.

 3. Describe visual elements using alternative text (alt-text), in-context descriptions, or long-
      text descriptions. Figures, diagrams, drawings, and photos can add a great deal of value to
      a document but are of reduced value to people with visual impairments. Describing these
      elements in the surrounding text, in alt-text, or linked and at the end of a section or chapter as
      long-descriptions can provide the information intended to be conveyed by the image in a way
      that is accessible to readers who otherwise could not visually process the image. Alternative
      text is a specialized description attached to the computer code of the image and read by
      screen readers.121314

 4. Use transcripts or closed-captioning for audio-only materials. Audio materials are particularly
      problematic for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. As audio materials are often
      problematic for listeners who are accessing materials not in their native language, dialect, or
      regional accent, transcripts aid a broader audience than those who are deaf or experience
      hearing loss.

 5. Color. There is a lot to say about color. First, avoid using color as the only way to convey
      information. Use something other than or in addition to color, such as dashed or dotted lines or
      patterns to convey information.15 Second, the contrast between text and background color is
      also important. In general, smaller fonts and text/background combinations with less contrast
      are less readable. WebAIM's color contrast checker16 is a helpful tool for measuring to what
      degree the color and size of text on particular color of background is accessible. And third,
      various technologies can be used to transform the reading experience of a document to make
84 | 7. MAKE RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES | READINGS

      it more effective. For example, some software changes the darkness or color of text from the
      beginning to the end of a word, making reading faster for readers with dyslexia. Other software
      provides options for inverting colors, controlling contrast, and light and dark modes. While
      end-user technologies are not something that a document creator has control over, knowing
      what functionality is available can better inform document creation practices.
 6. Links. In a digital environment, let the reader know what to expect when clicking on a
      hyperlink. There are several parts to this: First, link to meaningful, descriptive text rather than
      hyperlinking the phrase "click here." If an external file rather than a website will be opened or
      if a new browser tab will open, clearly indicate that by adding [PDF], [DOCX], or [New Tab]
      as part of the hyperlinked text. While URLs can be useful in the case of a print version, if you
      are working in an HTML environment you can display them and use an ARIA label17 For more
      context, see this Rebus Community post.18. A screen reader will read the ARIA label instead of
      reciting a lengthy, an perhaps annoying URL.
 7. Tables. Because screen readers read tables horizontally -- cell by cell and row by row -- tables
      need row or column headers to provide context for each cell's data. Tables should always
      have a table title or caption, and a complete set of row or column headers. Cells should have
      adequate padding, and merged or split cells should be avoided. Further instructions exist for
      complex tables which include those with merged/split cells or with more than one row or
      column of headers. Methods for accessibility of tables will vary depending on the software in
      which you are creating your document. See the end-of-chapter resource list below for more
      details.
 8. Mathematical formulas. The facility of a person with sight disabilities (who is blind or has low-
      vision) to access mathematical equations depends mainly on two factors: the type of software
      or braille reader the person finds effective for use in reading formulas, and the machine-
      readability of the document. Beyond the web, equations generally appear in documents as: (1)
      text which is acceptable for simple equations (e.g., a+b=c), or (2) as an image with alternative
      text. Both of these are accessible for most screen readers, though there is some variation in
      which fields alt-text for an image is stored and which fields screen reader softwares access
      for alternative text. Because mathematical formulas can be difficult to typeset, it can be
      tempting to merely insert pictures of mathematical equations. If alt-text is not included and
      included in fields accessible to the screenreader software a reader is using, pictures of
      equations are not helpful to readers who are blind or have low vision. (Creation of spoken alt-
      text for math equations is also possible.) We suggest that document creators working with
      math should typeset math using the approach best for the document type they plan to provide
      to readers. Various tutorials exist online. A search for "how to put math equations in _____"
                               7. MAKE RESOURCES ACCESSIBLE FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES | READINGS | 85

      [e.g., Moodle, Canvas, D2L, MSWord, PPT, etc.] should reveal which type of editor, language, or
      syntax is supported by that system. There are three main paths, some of which are convertible
      to other forms, some with some effort.
       a. MathType is formula editor and equation writer supported by OpenOffice, MSOffice (for

            PC and Mac) and web applications such as Gmail and Google Docs. MathType equations
            in MSWord can be converted to and from LaTeX and math markup languages TeX, LaTeX,
            and MathML can be entered directly into MathType.
       b. MathML is an XML markup language designed to display both mathematical structure
            and meaning. Because MathML with MathJax19 renders or displays in many browsers and
            systems, it is often considered the best choice for accessibility of math on the web.
            ASCIIMath and ASCIIMathML are also occasionally used for math on the web.
       c. LaTeX is a non-WYSIWYG document preparation system that is commonly used for
            medium to long technical publications of nearly any type or format. It is built on top of TeX
            macros which enable application of custom styles. It is a popular typesetting approach in
            academic authoring and in some disciplinary publishing contexts LaTeX most commonly
            exports to PDF. However, making accessible PDF documents from a LaTeX-generated file
            requires use of a command line interface and has a steep learning curve.20 LaTeX can also
            be converted to HTML and MathML, which may make it more possible for screen readers
            to access on the web. This can be done using TeX4ht21 or via the command line using
            PanDoc22 or via other methods.23

Various tools exist for remediating PDFs to make math accessible, but it is preferable (for the
purpose of not having to re-remediate if making changes and generating a new file) to embed
accessibility into the originating source file (.docx, GoogleDocs, etc.) and to share that file rather
than only sharing a PDF that has an added layer of remediation.

8. RENEGOTIATING THE TRADITIONAL
REFERENCE/INSTRUCTION LIBRARIAN AND
PATRON RELATIONSHIP | READINGS

   Anita R. Walz

This section will be most relevant for librarians or librarians-in-training. Taking on a longer-term
role as a consultant or coach requires a paradigm shift regarding the librarian roles. Ultimately, it
requires renegotiation of what may be considered a traditional reference/instruction librarian and
patron relationship.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Librarians and future librarians will be able to articulate ways in which a consultative
             partnership is different than a traditional one-and-done teaching, reference, or short-term
             consultative relationship.
           Non-librarian subject matter experts will be able to identify some of the expectations on
             which they may be asked to operate, and those they may need to navigate in the future in
             order to form productive working relationships with healthy boundaries among individuals
             with very different job expectations than their own.
92 | 8. RENEGOTIATING THE TRADITIONAL REFERENCE/INSTRUCTION LIBRARIAN AND PATRON
RELATIONSHIP | READINGS

     Assignment

           Interview a respected, experienced librarian regarding their experiences working as both
             a reference or instruction librarian, and in ongoing collaborative partnerships with subject
             matter experts.
                   In comparison, how have their expectations varied?
                   At what point in their career did they begin to differentiate between consultations
                      and partnerships, if they have?
                   What advise might they give a new librarian regarding forming long-term
                      collaborations with subject matter experts?
                   If they have navigated boundary-setting, how have they done this successfully?

Being a consultant or coach is much more of a partnership than a transactional relationship.
Rather than one or two-shot instructional sessions on a somewhat predictable schedule or a one-
and-done reference interaction, the librarian's role as a consultant or coach will most likely require
iterative consultations, collaborative goal setting, regular checkins, identification of preferred
methods for communication, and articulation of clear expectations from both parties. The
expectation for a consultative partnership is best established at the start of a consultative or
coaching relationship but will need to be revisited throughout the partnership.

Faculty and graduate students consulting with you need to know what they should expect from a
librarian in a consultant or coaching role--and such librarians are wise to also articulate what they
expect from faculty.

Being a librarian in a consultant or coaching role requires that you:

   Carry yourself as an equal in the partnership. Even though you are coaching, your collaborator
      owns their project. They are ultimately responsible for doing the work. The librarian coach or
      consultant is not the collaborator's assistant or research intern. While the librarian could help
      the collaborator with many additional things, the librarian's role is consultant and coach. The
      librarian must learn to say "no" and not offer to take on work beyond the role of consultant
 8. RENEGOTIATING THE TRADITIONAL REFERENCE/INSTRUCTION LIBRARIAN AND PATRON RELATIONSHIP |
                                                                                                                                     READINGS | 93

      and coach. The librarian teaches, encourages, and helps the collaborator to plan and problem
      solve. But, the librarian does not do the collaborator's work for them. The collaborator's role
      is to lead and complete their project. Even if a librarian is still learning, the librarian should
      expect that their role, time, and expertise be respected by the individual or group who is
      consulting with them;
   Work to understand collaborators' goals, unarticulated needs, and assumptions and double-
      check your understanding by communicating clearly regarding what you perceptive those
      goals, needs, and assumptions to be;
   The librarian should be able to clearly indicate the type of assistance you are able to provide,
      not provide, and are able to communicate in a timely manner when an ask or need goes beyond
      your role or capacity;
   Develop or encourage your collaborator to develop shared, asynchronous ways of tracking
      project progress -- so that you both have a high-level view, a dashboard, of the project steps
      and status. Use a shared whiteboard, shared GoogleSheet, Trello board, or some shared place
      to keep track of project progress.
   Find a trusted colleague or mentor to help you (librarian) reflect on whether you are
      overextending yourself beyond your role and how to reinforce communication regarding your
      role;
   Have (or build) a referral network for parts of the request which are beyond your capacity;
   Request feedback regarding your contributions.

Renegotiating the relationship also requires that the faculty member or group who is consulting
with you or being coached fulfill their obligations, do the work, and be mindful of the value of your
involvement. Working with them has a cost--it means that you are not doing the many other things
on which you could be spending your time and expertise. It is also helpful when those coached
share with the librarian the impact of the librarian's work. In a typical reference interaction, a
librarian might never know the long-term impact of their contribution.

Modeling good practice is helpful for others in their formation of healthy long-term relationships.
The same dynamics of coaching will be expected of the collaborator, the faculty member or
graduation students consulting with the librarian, when they begin a partnership with a PreK-12
educator.

Collaborative higher education/PreK-12 partnerships require planning and evaluation to be
successful. Collaborative partnerships require:

   Joint planning between all parties involved
   Meaningful and measurable outcomes for all parties
   An evaluation plan to determine which outcomes were met
   Opportunities for iteration and improvement
              9. SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS AND EMPOWERING TEACHERS TO SHARE THEIR
                                                                                                            EXPERTISE | PRESENTATION | 97

Explicitly state who the audience is for the work. The audience could be all kindergarten students,
female students in 6th grade, or students who are graduating high school without employment
or college plans. The audience could also be earth science teachers, high school counselors who
need recertification, or administrators who want to learn about emotional intelligence. Having a
specific audience is best so that you can tailor your project to meet the needs of this group. If you
try to make your project applicable to too many groups (for example, designing an activity that both
an elementary and high school student would enjoy), you may make your project meaningless to
both groups.

Once you know who your audience is, that will help you know who to approach for building a
partnership. If your project involves earth science, you may approach the science administrator
of your school district to start your partnership. In general, approaching administrators is
recommended over approaching specific teachers, because administrators can ensure that
outreach is spread equitably throughout the school or district. You may also want to suggest
involvement of a school librarian or media specialist as part of the project in addition to a teacher
or group of teachers. School librarians may be interested in expanding their knowledge about OER
as part of their role in supporting classroom teachers.3

Once you know who to approach, you should first investigate any existing partnerships with the
school or district. Your goal should not be to become an expert in the school district, but rather
to know the current events and have a general familiarity with the school. We discuss how to
complete this research at length in the assignment in the next chapter "Before You Approach Your
School District."

Discuss mutual goals and benefits with the school district. Make sure that you are both getting
some of your needs met and that the project is aligned with your higher level, long-term goals. This
may take more than one conversation.

Make sure to communicate and be honest about what you need from the beginning of your
relationship. Make sure to be direct and don't use jargon that is specific to your field. Your goal is to
be clearly understood by someone who is likely outside of your field.

As part of this communication, make sure your timeline is clear and that it works for your partner.
You should also present and discuss an evaluation plan, describing how the evaluation will help
shape your project (formative evaluation) as well as how you will determine if the goals and
outcomes were met (summative evaluation).
98 | 9. SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS AND EMPOWERING TEACHERS TO SHARE THEIR
EXPERTISE | PRESENTATION

When working with schools, make sure that you keep their working timelines in mind. For example,
many schools require approval by the school board to participate in grant funded projects. These
meetings likely happen once a month, so leave time to ensure that you can get all the approvals you
need.

Be very clear in what you are asking for and what you need. If you are not sure, start a conversation
with the school about what their needs and resources are.

Be mindful of the return on investment, not just for yourself, but for your partner. What is in it for
them? What will they get out of participating in this project? Is the project sustainable in some
way?

Above all else, respect your potential partner and remember that they are likely experts in their
field. Avoid making assumptions and demands; rather, try to create a partnership of equal value
and power. Explore any requirements the school may have in place for working with minors (we
provide some training in our slide show: Working with Minors). Treat the school/district you
approach as an equal and valuable partner.

In order to achieve impact, you must have a strategy. Just as research is conducted thoughtfully
and with specific goals in mind, outreach should also be done thoughtfully and with specific goals.

Make your strategy for achieving impact consistent with the technical project tasks. For example,
if you are studying novel research methods in geology, make sure that your outreach can be related
to your field of research. This alignment will likely make outreach more interesting and easier for
you.

Make sure you know what you will be doing for implementation and evaluation. When doing
outreach, always plan your activities at a detailed level. Try to estimate, or ask someone familiar
with your audience, how much time each task will take and how difficult it will be for your audience.
Make sure your outreach can be done in the time allotted but not so quickly that everyone is sitting
around doing nothing. You may allow opportunities for students to explore on their own or have a
"back-up" activity in case your first activity takes less time than expected. Ensure your task won't
be too challenging and disheartening for your audience or so easy they lose interest.

For evaluation, how will you evaluate your impact? You should evaluate the impact of your outreach
from both your perspective and the perspective of your partner. Ensure that your outcomes were
met or determine why they were not met.
              9. SUCCESSFUL COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIPS AND EMPOWERING TEACHERS TO SHARE THEIR
                                                                                                            EXPERTISE | PRESENTATION | 99

Examples of outcomes can include both learning outcomes (e.g., what did the students learn from
this experience?) and experiential outcomes (e.g., was this activity fun and enjoyable?) as well as
interest and career outcomes (e.g., are students more interested in this field?) among others.

Finally, ensure that your activity is appropriate and relevant to your audience. Make sure that
this activity aligns with what students are learning in the classroom or with the professional
development goals of the district and teachers.

Email is a great way to introduce yourself and your work, but most teachers, school librarians, and
administrators will also want to have a phone call, zoom meeting, or in-person talk to learn more
about you and your work. Provide opportunities for talking to create a better partnership and to
make sure that you and your partner are on the same page. When possible, try to defer to the
needs and wants of the potential partner you are approaching. Is parking on campus difficult? Go
to their workplace. Do they find responding to emails too time consuming? Give them a call. Try to
be flexible and considerate.

Workday hours in a school district likely differ from the typical nine-to-five. Most of the time that
teachers have at school is spent with students; teachers lack flexibility for mid-day meetings and
may need to schedule meetings before or after school, rather that during the school day. If a
teacher asks you to meet them during their planning period, arrive promptly and leave on time.
Allow time for checking in to the school, which will often have some security and sign-in measures.

Teachers and administrators are experts in their field. Remember to respect their expertise and
ask for their opinions.

When empowering teachers and administrators to provide feedback, the first step is to convey
your respect for their expertise. Tell your partner that you value their knowledge and skills and that
you would also value their input and feedback on your work. If needed, remind your partner that
feedback is a way to ensure alignment of the project with your goals and needs.

Ask for feedback in a professional manner, remembering your partner's timelines and needs. Make
sure that you don't ask for feedback at the last minute and that you've discussed the way to provide
feedback with your partner. We provide a model for this discussion in the Rubric for Teacher/
Administrator Review and the Template for Inviting Review Teachers and Administrators.

10. BEFORE APPROACHING SCHOOL
ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS, OR SCHOOL
LIBRARIANS | READINGS

   Anita R. Walz and Julee P. Farley

A significant amount of public information may exist regarding the school district you plan to
approach. This section outlines potential sources of publicly available information and why
understanding these contextual details may be helpful to know about before approaching a school
district.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Thoughtfully consider a potential conversation with a school district administrator. This is
             especially true if you do not have prior familiarity with the geographical area or its school
             system.
           Be prepared with some practical, contextual information before meeting with school
             administrators or teachers. Being prepared in advance will save you time in the long run,
             and show that you are doing your part to inform yourself before asking for a meeting.
104 | 10. BEFORE APPROACHING SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS, TEACHERS, OR SCHOOL LIBRARIANS |
READINGS

     Assignment

     Gather practical, contextual information before approaching school administrators or teachers.
         1. Review the information types below and gather information relevant to the school district
             you wish to approach.
         2. Write up a no more than 1-2 page summary of what you learned.

Assignment Goals

   Gather practical background information
   Learn whether a previous relationship has existed with the district (and if it has been good or

      bad, from the perspective of one side of the partnership)
   Identify some district or school goals to mention in your conversation
   Be able to identify where your potential topic or project might fit within state standards of

      learning, next generation science standards and/or foundational skills for your area
   Get the "vibe" by gathering practical and readily-available information

The goal is not to become an expert in the school district or particular school or to make a case
for exactly where a potential project fits. While you have deep subject matter expertise, school
administrators and teachers have deep expertise regarding the characteristics and needs of their
particular contexts. The goal of this exercise is rather to gather contextual information about the
school district and its context to get the "vibe" prior to approaching and meeting with a school
district representative.

Information to Gather

   General awareness regarding where the district is excelling;
   General understanding of district goals;

         Review the district's strategic plan;
         Any recent requests for volunteers in areas of need;
   Basic demographic information (such as languages spoken, geographical notes, etc.);
   Any current issues, events, or news (from local news/newspaper/social media, etc.);
   District/school schedule (school breaks/link to calendar);
   Types of schools in the district (public, private, special focus, charter, etc.);
   Location and travel time between your location and prospective sites;
   Contact information for the district area administrator and/or school's principal and assistant
      principal;
   Past partnership experiences with the district (positive, negative);

Contextualize

   Review state standards relevant to your school district and identify where (or if) your topic or
      area of expertise might fit;

   Think through foundational skills for your area of expertise. How might these be engagingly
      presented for audiences of different ages? Be ready to brainstorm.

Potential Sources of Information

   School district website--look for strategic plan and budget request documents
   Local news (newspaper/ news website)
   Social media
   The school's website (may or may not be helpful)
   People! Your colleagues may have worked with the school district or a particular school before

11. INITIATING A CONVERSATION WITH A
SCHOOL DISTRICT: WHO TO CONTACT AND
HOW | READINGS

   Julee P. Farley

This section addresses how to reach out to a school district and includes sample email templates
for making a first contact in a school district.

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Explore potential contacts.
           Demonstrate making an informed, initial contact with a school district.
108 | 11. INITIATING A CONVERSATION WITH A SCHOOL DISTRICT: WHO TO CONTACT AND HOW | READINGS

     Assignment

     The authors suggest that you start a conversation with the school district, district curriculum
     coordinator, or a pre-designated contact rather than a particular teacher. The school district can
     point you to a school and contacts that would be the best fit for their needs--rather than starting
     at the school or teacher level.
     Bring what you learned in your information gathering stage, and build on that:

           You might have learned almost nothing from your web search regarding the school
             district, and there might not have been previous collaborations between your institution
             and the school district.

           Or, you might have learned a great deal about the school district from your web search
             and conversations with colleagues about past partnerships.

     When approaching a school district, aim to:
           Affirm that they are most familiar with their needs. Do not assume that you are an
             expert in the school district or school. They are most familiar with their needs.

What to Ask

These are helpful questions to consider and to ask administrators and/or teachers when forming a
relationship and cooperatively shaping your activity. You may not need to ask every question (e.g.,
you may not need to ask what the district needs are and what standards need to be met). Consider
if you have specific follow up questions you may need to ask or questions specific to your situation.

   Does your district/classroom have any needs that I can help meet? Are there any learning,
      career, or social standards that my activity could help meet? What help feels welcomed right
      now?

   What do your students already know about the topic in my activity?
   Are there any terms or information I should include in my activity?
   How much time do you have/do you want to spend to complete my activity in the classroom?
   What kind of materials and technology do you have available? What should I provide?
   How long before the in-class activity do you need my materials in order to be prepared? Will

      you be able to provide feedback to me on my activity and changes I should make before
      using the activity in your classroom? Will you provide feedback to me after classroom
      implementation to improve the activity for future groups?
                                                     12. IMPROVE A PROPOSED COLLABORATION | GUIDED QUESTIONS | 111

12. IMPROVE A PROPOSED COLLABORATION
| GUIDED QUESTIONS

   Julee P. Farley

Collaborations are effortful for all involved. Sometimes the value to PreK-12 outweighs the costs,
and sometimes it does not. This reflection activity asks those early in the process of engaging in
direct contact with PreK-12 schools or districts whether a higher education personnel's proposed
project indeed provides value to the school or district in the context of what work PreK-12 teachers
are being asked to do beyond their existing responsibilities. The key questions are: Is the
proposed project and approach helpful for one's potential PreK-12 partners? How might you or
another from higher education adjust your approach to make this collaboration and its outputs
more valuable to PreK-12 districts, schools, or teachers?

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Reflect on the level of effort and level of benefit of your proposed project for the school
             district.
           Describe adjustments needed and how to introduce and discuss those adjustments with
             PreK-12 collaborators.
112 | 12. IMPROVE A PROPOSED COLLABORATION | GUIDED QUESTIONS

     Assignment

     Please read and consider the questions and prompts below. You may choose to only think
     about the prompts rather than writing answers down, but writing the answers will likely provide
     higher quality responses and serve as a point of reference for future discussions.

         1. Articulate in a clear and simple manner the current needs of the school or district. You
             may describe one need or multiple needs. Describe how you found out about these
             needs (e.g., informed by school administration, found information on a website, etc.).

         2. Describe the value your project adds. Does your project provide a solution the school or
             district needs? Be specific in how much value you think your project will bring and how
             you are providing a solution. List specific steps and proposed outcomes when possible.
             Try to describe all the proposed benefits your project will provide.

         3. What work is required on the part of the teacher, school, or district to implement your
             project? Do you create more work or are you using existing school mechanisms that make
             implementing your project easy? How much time will it take to implement your project?
             Are special skills needed? Are unique supplies or additional funding required? Are there
             any drawbacks to implementation of your project?

         4. Compare the value added and benefits of your project to the work required and
             drawbacks of the project. Do you add little value with a lot of work? Do you solve an
             important problem with minimal extra effort required on the part of the school?

         5. Summarize how your project as proposed is suited to the current needs of the school
             district. Ideally, you should create a solution to an important problem that is easy to adopt
             and implement on the part of the school, but it's important to ensure that at least the
             benefits outweigh the costs of implementation.

        6. If you have a PreK-12 collaborator, discuss a summary of this reflection and your solution
             for their input. Ask if they would like to proceed, further adjust the proposed plan, or
             share other feedback.

   Anita R. Walz

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Articulate the value of adapting learning resources.
           Make informed and user-centric decisions regarding what software to use.
           Demonstrate how to adapt an openly-licensed resource.
           Demonstrate how to correctly attribute adaptation of a Creative Commons licensed work.
116 | 13. ADAPTING CREATIVE COMMONS-LICENSED RESOURCES | GUIDE

     Assignment

           Practice and demonstrate your knowledge by creating an informal, short, narrated video
             (under 5 minutes) or slide show with script (6 or fewer slides) of you adapting an openly-
             licensed resource in a software with which you are already familiar. Your video or slide
             deck should clearly mention each of the steps listed below in "Steps to Adapt."

           With a partner acting as a PreK-12 teacher and you acting as a consultant from higher
             education, practice and demonstrate the process described above by actually adapting
             an openly-licensed resource. Switch roles and repeat. Write a 2-page reflection on your
             interpersonal and process-oriented approaches to the assignment. What questions or
             additional needs for learning did these interactions raise?

Adaptation Guide

As a faculty member, graduate student, undergraduate student, librarian, or instructional designer
you may be asked to demonstrate how to adapt existing openly-licensed materials for classroom
use and re-sharing under the same license. Many teachers will already know parts of this process,
but might not have experience with how all of the pieces fit together. This guide describes rationale
and steps for adaptation. The assignment at the end of the guide provides practice for
demonstrating how to accomplish these steps.

Why adapt?

Teachers generally want to scaffold learning in their courses to fit their specific learners' needs.
Reading or comprehension levels may differ from class to class. Teachers may also wish to adjust
materials to fit multiple languages, audiences, or differences in local characteristics.
                                                  13. ADAPTING CREATIVE COMMONS-LICENSED RESOURCES | GUIDE | 117

Why share back?

Sharing your changes and improvements back to the community in a way that people can find them
is a powerful way to contribute back to other educators. Your improvements and changes may be
just what someone else is looking for!

Documenting Changes and License Requirements

Other teachers who are considering using your work benefit when you include a summary of what
you changed. This is helpful for them in differentiating between versions that may otherwise
appear relatively similar. Documentation that changes were made is also required by the license if
you are modifying a Creative Commons licensed work. See "Giving Credit" below for more details.
Also note that CC licenses marked as "no derivatives" do not allow sharing of "derivative" or modified
works.

The human-readable and legal versions of Creative Commons licenses are available here.1

Technology for Editing and Sharing

A teacher must have: (1) access and (2) either already know how to use the software or be able
to quickly and easily learn it. The best technologies for editing and making openly-licensed files
available are those which will actually be used. Consider that teachers may have a range of
technological facility and comfort levels depending on their training and subject area. Schools
and school districts may also influence whether use of a learning management system (LMS) is
mandated or not. (Most LMS will import SCORM-compliant or thin-Common Cartridge files, and
OER Commons allows such files to be attached to OER within their system.) Other districts or
schools may lack an LMS and rely on word processing software or photocopying. Choose to work in
software that will support the project and be usable for the people involved.

A few options in no particular order include: MSWord, LibreOffice, GoogleDocs, OER Commons
OpenAuthor2 (overview3), Merlot's Content Builder4, LMS software such as Moodle, Canvas, etc., or
code or typesetting languages such as HTML or LaTeX.
118 | 13. ADAPTING CREATIVE COMMONS-LICENSED RESOURCES | GUIDE

Naming Conventions and Metadata

Documents with metadata and a standardized naming convention are easier to contextualize and
retrieve. Ensure that metadata appropriate to the file type you are creating or adapting has a
descriptive file name, and even the most basic metadata (author, date, copyright statement, etc.)
on it. If the software in which you are working provides metadata fields, use them!

Giving Credit

All Creative Commons licenses require that you attribute the original source and provide four
specific pieces of information. This may be done in a variety of ways. It is preferable to include this
information on the actual document rather than only in the metadata of the system which hosts
the document. This information is brief and commonly included in the "references" or "fine print." It
must include the following elements, according to the acronym TASL:

   Title
   Author
   Source (URL)
   License

Example:  Juanita Rivera. Hola amigos. CC BY NC-SA 4.0

You must also indicate if you made any changes.

For example: Angelica Juarez CC BY NC-SA 4.0. Adapted from  Juanita Rivera. Hola amigos. CC
BY NC-SA 4.0 (Replaced three photos)

Recommended Resource

Best practices for attribution of Creative Commons-licensed materials5 is available online.
                13. ADAPTING CREATIVE COMMONS-LICENSED RESOURCES | GUIDE | 119

Steps to Adapt

1. Evaluate the overall file.

       What Creative Commons license does it currently have?
             Confirm that the material to adapt has an overall license that allows adaptation
                and resharing. These licenses include CC BY, CC BY NC, CC BY SA, CC BY NC SA.
                (Materials without a license, or those with a CC BY NC-ND or CC BY NC-ND do not
                permit adaptation and resharing.)

       In what format(s) is it available (and can you easily edit it in that format or pull it into your
          desired format)?
             Obtain editable source files if at all possible. PDF editing does not enable text to
                flow across pages, thus limiting one's ability to make major changes. It also requires
                special software (Adobe Acrobat DC).

3. Identify changes you wish to make.

        Consider adding your own original language and illustrations
        Consider adding excerpts or images with open licenses from others

              If you wish to incorporate already-licensed materials (such as photos) examine
                whether their license is compatible with the overall license of the main work.
                  a. A helpful chart on license compatibility6 is available online

4. Make your changes
5. Cite (and attribute) the items you added to the work. Add your name as the adapter and re-

    release under the same overall license if the license of the base material is a "SA" (ShareAlike)
    license (e.g., Angelica Juarez CC BY NC SA. Adapted from  Juanita Rivera. Hola! CC BY
    NC SA 4.0. Added photo of native flowers by Angelico CC BY 4.0). Use best practices for
    attribution of Creative Commons-licensed materials7 to ensure that all attributions have all of
    the requirement elements.
6. If you are sharing in a place such as OERCommons, include a few short sentences in the
    abstract that differentiates your work from the one you adapted.
7. Share your openly-licensed source files and finished files back to the community

16. SHARE RESOURCES PUBLICLY | GUIDE

   Anita R. Walz

Resources shared with a limited audience, however excellent they are, are limited in value because
they are not findable. They lack access by a broad audience. This section describes rationale for
public sharing of openly-licensed resources and a list of selected places and methods by which to
share. If you created something you think is helpful to one person, why not share it more publicly so
that others who are looking for the same material might also benefit?

     Learning Objectives

     Learners should be able to:
           Be able to articulate hosting options to your collaborative partner.
           Be able to articulate options for indexing to your collaborative partner.
           Reflect on sharing.
130 | 16. SHARE RESOURCES PUBLICLY | GUIDE

     Assignment

         1. Read through the chapter and explore the links within.
         2. Document the available hosting options for the school or school district with which

             you are partnering, including broadly-available authoring tools like open author tools
             in OER Commons or MERLOT, or creating and sharing publicly via an LMS. Are digital
             preservation and/or stable links a priority for any of these hosting options? How does one
             submit materials, or create an account and submit materials? How publicly available are
             such resources?
         3. Document the existence of state or province-level link-sharing sites, such as OER
             Commons Microsites or Hubs. Describe the requirements for joining, criteria for
             submissions, and the steps for submitting materials. What credentials are required or
             used to create an account?
         4. Document, submit, and implement your plan for sharing your resource with a broader
             audience.
         5. Write a 1-2 page reflection: As you work with your school and/or district, what themes do
             you notice regarding administrator or teacher response to the invitation to share publicly?
             Why do you think this is? If there is resistance, how might you address the issues being
             raised?

A Guide for Sharing

Why Share?

If something works well in a classroom, the documentation of that activity and/or learning
resources may be of value to another teacher. The learning resources are of even more value when
they bear an open license, thus allowing others to customize the resources to fit their classroom
specific needs.
                                                                                        16. SHARE RESOURCES PUBLICLY | GUIDE | 131

Enabling Others to Discover Your Work

There are several things teachers/authors/adopters may do to make their openly-licensed
resources more findable and usable by others. These include:

   How you describe the material
         Descriptive abstract regarding the intended use of the materials
         Standards alignment
         Lesson plan for how to use the materials and in what order

   Host your material where it can be:
         Indexed,
         Crawled by search engines, and/or
         Where people are looking for such resources

   Raising awareness of the existence of your resource(s)
         Telling others about your work via formal and informal information channels
               Teacher associations and conferences
               School newsletters and newspapers
               School district social media
         Leveraging partner communication channels
               University-School partnership networks and listservs

Aside from informal one-to-one sharing, the best places to share openly-licensed resources are
the places where people are looking to find such materials.

Hosting

Publicly-available electronic versions of learning materials are always "hosted" somewhere,
whether that be in OpenAuthor in OER Commons, an Institutional Repository at a university in your
state or province, in an LMS, GoogleDrive, or some other site which "serves up" content for public
view.

Note: There are many other places to host openly-licensed content. In terms of longevity, it may be
helpful to host your content in more than one place. As platforms become obsolete, links break and
content becomes unretrievable. University repositories generally implement digital preservation
methods to prevent broken links when upgrading their technologies. Some but not all hosting
environments do this as well.
132 | 16. SHARE RESOURCES PUBLICLY | GUIDE

Sharing Hosted Resources

Once you have a stable, long-term publicly available place to host your content, you may wish to
also have it indexed in a variety of "referatories" by submitting the link and description of the item.
See the selected list of places to share below.

   The first places to share your materials are national/international:
         OER Commons https://www.oercommons.org
         MERLOT (California State University) https://www.merlot.org

   You may also want to share your resources via a state or province OER Commons Microsite or
      Hub or other state/province-level open repository or sharing site.

       For example, the Virginia Department of Education funds #GoOpenVA, an OER Commons-
       cloud-based microsite for PreK-12 materials at GoOpenVA (https://goopenva.org). Click here
       to read more about the VA DOE's support for the #GoOpenVA program1 [Archive].

As of the time of publication:

   OER Commons has K-12 microsite partnerships with Ohio, Utah, Virginia, North Carolina,
      Arizona, Sun West Schools in Saskatchewan, Michigan, and Wisconsin. The following are
      publicly accessible:
         North Carolina DPI, GoOpenNC https://goopennc.oercommons.org
         VA DOE, GoOpenVA https://goopenva.org
         MI DOE, GoOpenMichigan https://goopenmichigan.org

     Wyoming, Nebraska, Iowa, Alabama, North Dakota, Pennsylvania, Oregon, and Washington,
       and Missouri (https://www.oercommons.org/hubs/missouri) also have hubs on OER
       Commons (https://www.oercommons.org/hubs).

     There is also a hub on OER Commons for K-12 Teaching and Learning
       (https://www.oercommons.org/hubs/k12)2

 There are various other platforms and hosting options. Several platforms are discussed in the
 2017 recording "Seven Platforms You Should Know About: Share, Find, Author, or Adapt Creative
 Commons-Licensed Resources" http://hdl.handle.net/10919/76739.
