Making Ripples: A Guidebook to Challenge Status Quo in OER Creation was
produced by the Rebus Community, an initiative of The Rebus Foundation.

Rebus Community is a non-profit organization that helps educational institutions
build human capacity in OER publishing through professional development.
Through our work at Rebus Community, we aim to cultivate an emerging
generation of OER leaders, increase the representation of many academic
perspectives, and prioritize student learning and experience in order to increase
equity in education. We think an engaged community is the most powerful tool
in open education, and we've witnessed the impact of bringing creators together
under a common framework of support.

Rebus Community is supported by generous funding from the William and Flora
Hewlett Foundation, a leader in philanthropic support for education, environment,
and global development. We are deeply thankful for The Hewlett Foundation's
support in our work and vision.

What you are about to read is a work in progress, and only a small synthesis of
some equitable practices in OER creation. It is unmistakably not the creation of a
single person, but rather a collection of stories and insights from my experience
in open education. Who is cited and quoted in this guide has been chosen with
great care and thought. Many thanks to all participants, facilitators, and partners in
the Textbook Success Program cohorts in Louisiana (in the Interactive OER for Dual
Enrollment project) and Massachusetts (via the Remixing Open Textbooks through
an Equity Lens grant), whose contributions, ideas, and insights shaped and inspired
this Guide.

My own experiences have undoubtedly influenced how I see the world, therefore
this positionality statement is an effort on my part to recognize my own prejudices
and work to overcome them. I am a white, disabled and chronically ill settler of

disruptors from previous, present, and future generations have done and are still
doing.
To previous generations who have laid the foundation for positive change, thank
you. Thank you for your courage to speak truth to power, your kindness to share
with and care for one another, and your continuous efforts in making a better world.
To the people currently doing the work of challenging the system, thank you. Thank
you for honouring those who came before us, for sharing your stories, and for
pushing for radical change.
To future generations, may you always remember those who came before you. May
their courage, honesty, and radical love nourish you to continue their work. I hope
for a future where wrongs are made right, where people are given what they need
and are owed to thrive in life, where autonomy and sovereignty is respected. A
future with more joy, truths, and community than hurt, lies, and isolation.
To all of you reading this, I hope the stories and storytellers within this guide inspire
you to call and continue to call for change.

Quote from Communications Sessional Instructor, Adam Vincent, PhD.

 A ripple effect: a situation in which one event or action produces effects which
                                   spread and produce further effects:

The front cover is an image of rain falling in a body of water, with several ripple
effects. The reason this image was chosen was because the circles of impact all
connect. When an object (such as rain or a stone) disrupts a still body of water, the
water moves in ripples across the entire water. A similar ripple effect also occurs in
education, among many other fields. These ripples can be big or small - positive or
negative. What ends up happening when multiple ripple effects occur - each ripple
flows effortlessly into the other. The ripples incorporate into one another create a
harmonious blending. With each ripple, you'll notice momentum builds and can
have far-reaching effects. As OER creators, our purpose is to create a ripple effect in
our classrooms - beginning with a resource. Just by reading this, you have already
chosen to be a catalyst for change, to push yourself to respond to problems in

                                                                                                                                                                    Introduction | 1
education with equitable solutions, and embrace the complexity and messiness of
the process with courage, honesty, and humility.

     Learning Objectives

     By the end of this section, you will:
         1. Understand the purpose of the guide;
        2. Learn about the guide's structure;
        3. See the big picture with the ripple effects.

Introduction

Making Ripples: A Guidebook to Challenge Status Quo in OER Creation offers
readers a short resource to expand their understanding of inequities in the
educational systems through breaking down the work into smaller pieces with
opportunities to reflect, identify strategies for action, and locate resources and
community members to connect with. The purpose of this guide is to explore
strategies for you as OER creators to incorporate equitable practices into your
workflows.

It is not enough for educators to acknowledge Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (often
shortened to the acronym DEI or EDI) as a priority - action must follow. As an
organization, Rebus is dedicated to building a new, collaborative model for open
resource creation in partnership with the OER community. Infused in this model
are our core values around collaboration, community, equity, care, and respect. We
believe this focus is critical to creating & implementing valuable resources, and can
have impacts beyond a single resource, individual, classroom, or institution. With
OER, we have the opportunity to challenge the status quo and build a new status
quo that is more malleable and flexible. We hope you will join us in building this
future!

This guide was written for different audiences, because while the roles we play
in our institution may be different, the underlying goal is the same: to educate.

2 | Introduction
Whether you're a librarian helping faculty pick out texts, an instructor teaching
classes, an administrator supporting classrooms & pedagogy, or a student entering
a classroom - your goal is to teach and learn.
Making Ripples centers the importance of storytelling and how storytelling can
support your journey into developing OER with diversity, equity, and inclusion at
the core. This guide has been structured in five parts, with each part containing
opportunities to both reflect and take action:

                 A visualization of the ripple effect.

  1. Purpose of OER Creation: This section emphasizes the importance of
      collaboration and intentionally centering students while discussing the

                                                                                                                                                                    Introduction | 3
      purpose of creating OER.
 2. Storytelling in Education: What stories we tell - and how we tell them -

      matters. In this section, you'll learn about ethical storytelling and recognize the
      impact that storytelling has on teaching and learning.
 3. Equity-minded Pedagogy: After considering how we tell stories, we invite you
      to reflect on your pedagogical beliefs and practices - and align them with
      equitable practices to have a positive impact on student learning.
 4. Practices as Community Service: This section focuses on the importance of
      lifelong learning, collaboration with community partners, and recognizing how
      open pedagogy and practices can be integrated into social justice.
 5. Beyond OER: In this section, you're asked to deeply reflect on education's role
      in society and consider ways in which you can take teaching and learning well
      beyond traditional educational institutions, creating ripple effects to enact
      positive change in the world.

       While it includes strategies to keeping equity at the forefront of your OER creation process, this
       guide also encourages you to:

            · Reflect on your role in education to transform your pedagogical practices by incorporating
                equitable methods and interactions into teaching and learning

            · Connect and collaborate in and beyond your institutional setting in ethical ways to build
                equitable relationships and knowledge exchange

            · Emphasize and practice reciprocity in teaching and learning by seeking every opportunity as
                an educator to contribute back to communities

            · Embrace the complexity and messiness of the process with courage, honesty, and humility

Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in Open Education

Because genuine, intentional, and impactful equity work begins at the individual
level, it is our hope that the learning opportunities in this resource will set off ripple
effects to enact as much positive change inside as well as outside of the academy.
It is impossible to extricate the work we do with students in classrooms, libraries,
campuses, etc. with the world outside it. Every decision made outside of education
impacts education, and vice versa. Skills not taught in classrooms, leads to a lack of

4 | Introduction
specific skills in the world. For example, how we have predominantly taught history

courses in both Canada and the United States have often excluded the voices, the

stories, and the painful truths of these countries. Fast forward to generations of

citizens being taught eurocentric, exclusionary narratives around history, and we

have seen the devastating impacts of that - from low civic engagement to hateful

legislation being passed. It is crucial we as educators think about these connections

often and discuss them with our students. It is through these open and honest

conversations that we are able to learn from one another. And when we learn

together from one another, we can have much farther-reaching effects than us

And when we learn together                doing it alone.

                 alone.                   current practices. You'll also find
                                          resources from members of the open

community so you can connect and collaborate with community members who are

doing this work. A big facet of open education is not reinventing the wheel, so as

you read this, remember you are not alone - lean on the open community for

support, guidance, and sharing of ideas.

To further inspire your own educational equity journey, you can watch a Tedx talk
by Nicole West Burns on Building Critical Consciousness for Educational Equity
below.

Before you begin the video, reflect on the following:

· What do the terms equality and equity mean?
· What are your responsibilities to your students?

As you watch the video, pay attention for:

· Why is thinking about student experiences in schools important?
· What do you learn about the mainstream public education system?

After viewing the video, reflect on:

· What vision do you have for the educational system and society?

                                                                   Introduction | 5

         1. Recognize the importance of collaboration and relationship building while creating learning
             experiences;

        2. Identify collaboration opportunities to incorporate and highlight representative stories in your
             resource;

        3. Conceptualize how to intentionally centre the student experience while designing your OE.

8 | Purpose of OER Creation
Introduction

A quote from Ryunosuke Satoro

In order to create a ripple effect when creating an OER, we must identify and
clearly articulate its purpose. The human aspect of OER - the humans that create
and use OER - is the most important part of OER - while the desired outcome
of a completed resource is great, the collaboration journey is just as important.
Collaboration and intentionally centering students are two important themes that
you'll find embedded throughout this guide, and open education more broadly.
The purpose of creating an OER is two-fold: collaboration and centering student
learning.
Often when we think of creating OER, our minds immediately go into project
management mode with the end goal of producing a resource. What if we paused
and reframed our desired outcomes? Rather than just reaching an end goal of a
final OER, what if we stopped to remind ourselves that the relationships built and
strengthened throughout the publishing process is in itself a goal. As you will see,

                                                                                                                                                                   Introduction | 9
how an OER is made can have a noticeable impact on the final product. Making
(and reading) an OER is a collective effort.

Our experience of having delivered the Textbook Success Program (TSP) multiple
times shows us the direct relationship between the experiences of collaborating
on OER projects and the different successful outcomes of learning: the changes in
skills, strategies, relations, attitudes, etc.. We acknowledge that collaboration takes
time. But who says it's less efficient in the long run? Of course, in the short-term,
meetings take time and OER projects are often running on a quick timeline. We
think shared ideas, feelings of being respected and being on the same wavelength,
are a good investment for the future because they will enable everybody's growth
and connection on multiple levels, including institutional capacity and greater
contributions to society. Completing a project with a smaller scope and thoughtful
approaches may pave the way for bigger and better work in the future.

Collaboration is tied very much to the idea of telling representative stories. For you
to create an equitable OER, it is important to bring in different perspectives into
your work and let this diversity help your OER improve.

Journalist Sydney J. Harris (1917-1986)      "The whole purpose of
famously said that "the whole purpose of  education is to turn mirrors
education is to turn mirrors into
windows." I believe what he meant by               into windows."

this is that mirrors reflect ourselves - our own principles, norms, values, and

worldviews - in the same way a mirror can reflect our ignorance and fears. Windows,

however, can bring to light dark sides and show us a world we don't know - in the

same way education seeks to remove ignorances and fears, teaching us more about

ourselves and each other. How we look at the world depends on our lived

experiences, values, and worldviews. OER provides educators with ample

opportunities to challenge the status quo and create new paths forward.

Collaboration

       Collaboration, as we understand this supportive approach, works best when we adopt the following
       three principles, whereby people:

            · work together as equals;
            · develop shared meaning about what they're doing; and
            · show consideration for each other.

Collaboration can take many shapes throughout the open publishing process -
people can collaborate on co-creating materials, and then at later stages (such as
the adoption phase), they can lead lively discussions around ideas for use and remix.
Something I appreciate about OER is its flexibility and uniqueness that every project
has. Projects can consist of small, single author teams to large scale teams. Who
you collaborate with and how you collaborate shapes the impact your resource
can have. Having a diverse and representative mix of people on your project lets
different perspectives and experiences shape the book, so it's not just a product of
one person and actually reflects the experiences of readers who are multiple, varied,
and complex.

12 | Collaboration
                            While collaborating on Pulling Together: Manitoba

                            Foundations Guide (Brandon Edition), the Manitoba

                            Foundations Group immediately recognized the

                            importance of collaboration and relationship building.

                            This adaptation is the work of many communities in

                            shared within the resource with the hope that readers

                            take their learning off the page, as deeper

                            understanding is experienced when readers

                            thoughtfully engage in the activities that go beyond

                            the resource itself. This open resource honoured

Edition)                    project, non-Indigenous collaborators learned to focus

on building relationships and trust, and to put the needs of Indigenous

collaborators at the centre of the project.

The Artist Statement highlights both the purpose of the guide and the
collaboration journey that went into making it:

"The end of the birch bark canoe bleeds off the page to represent the space
that there is for everyone on this journey. The river flows from the foreground
to the background, from left to right, and ebbs back and forth to express
the journey's path into the unknown, and acknowledges the organic nature
of it. The only way forward is together, guided by our grandmother and
grandfather's teachings of the land."

Another example is the "how these books were produced" section of Introduction to
Philosophy: Epistemology, a part of the Introduction to Philosophy open textbook
series. This section explains why the series was created and how. Series editor,
Christina Hendricks, on the process:

"Each of the books has its own editor, and multiple authors from different
parts of the world who have expertise in the topic of the book. This also
means that there will inevitably be shifts in voice and tone between
chapters, as well as in perspectives. This itself exemplifies the practice of

Intentionally Centering
Students

It's crucial to never lose sight of who your audience is: students! As Robin DeRosa
(2015) puts it, "when you use OER, you change the relationships among you, your
students, and your course materials." You're creating this resource for their learning,
growth, and development. You want to engage students in work that is meaningful
to them. This means that all activities and assignments should have a purpose,
which is clearly defined and explained to students. Why are students doing these
assignments? How does it link to and help them achieve the learning objectives?
How does it relate to the real world, their lives, and their community?

                                       A great example of writing for students is Business
                                       Writing for Everyone by Arley Cruthers. This resource
                                       contains interactive H5P activities for students to
                                       test their learning, and activities for further
                                       reflection that instructors can use in the classroom
                                       or assign as homework. Additionally, it clearly lays
                                       out the purpose of the OER, including how to use it,
                                       and provides flexible learning opportunities for
                                       students depending on their needs.

                                       Whatever your role in education, you can ask

                                       yourself how students and their learning is

Front Cover of "Business Writing       impacted with the use of OER, either positively or
for Everyone" by Arley Cruthers        negatively, and determine if open resources are
                                       right for your students. What types of barriers do

students in your area face? Often, OER is considered a magical tool that saves

students money and works well. That said, how does the use of an online-only OER

support or hinder the learning experience of a student with no access to technology

(whether that be an Internet connection or reliable access to a computer)? Can you

create offline formats for students? If so, will they still have the same experience?

Which students in your class are more likely to struggle with these decisions, and

which students are more likely to benefit from these decisions?

16 | Intentionally Centering Students
The open publishing projects we support not only enhance the educational
experiences of students, they also help students feel seen and supported on a
personal level. The goal is making your OER as impactful as possible. When we
centre the student experience while designing OER, we again have an opportunity
to challenge the status quo and create equitable learning environments and
experiences for students.

     Pause & Reflect: Intentionally Centering Students

          While planning out your project, ask yourself:
               · Why do you want this resource to be open?
               · What do you want this resource to accomplish?
               · Whose lives may be improved?
               · How does your teaching impact the student experience?
               · How does the selection of texts, knowledge, and assessments impact the student
                   experience?
               · Are we excluding students solely based on our own preferences for tools and techniques?

     Action Plan: Involving Students

     Imagine that you are an OER project team.
     As you are contributing to the project as either a subject matter expert, an instructor, an instructional
     designer, a librarian, a student, a community member, you are wondering how in your unique role you
     help your team gain insight into the user perception and other feedback data needed to improve the
     OER you are working on? What ideas come to mind?

Introduction

A quote from late Ojibway author, Richard Wagamese

This quote is one that has stuck with me since the first time I read it. A belief I've had
for many years put so beautifully into words. When we learn about each other, sans
judgment, we recognize each other through a lens of compassion and care. With
compassion and care comes kinship. I deeply appreciate learning about people and
hearing stories about their lives and backgrounds. One's lived experience influences
how we think and navigate the world. Learning about other lived experiences
outside your own provides insight and is essential to making the world a better,
safer, and more equitable place.
Think about how you currently interact with peoples' stories - both professionally
and personally. Notice if you tend to make assumptions while listening. Education
is storytelling. And the way we teach and tell stories is seldomly neutral. Narratives
structure human comprehension, and shape our ability to imagine and achieve
transformed futures within education.

                                                                                                                                                                  Introduction | 23

OER? What are the stories of your field?

24 | Introduction
Importance of Storytelling

What you are trying to do with your OER is to create the best possible story for your
subject matter at hand, and in doing so to shape the legacy of your discipline and
what you leave behind. As you're seeing here, storytelling comes into play as an
important tool when creating or adapting an OER.

When we think of how this applies to the classroom, learning the stories of your

students, as well as sharing your own, is an invaluable practice. We are all complex

humans with different lived experiences that influence how we view and navigate

the world. Take the time to learn and appreciate the stories of each of your students

- as Richard Wagamese notes, when "we take the time to share those stories with

each other, we get bigger inside, we see each other, we recognize our kinship - we

"When we take the time to    change the world, one story at a time."
  share those stories with
                             This practice of getting to know your
 each other, we get bigger   students may seem like an obvious one,
 inside, we see each other,  but think back to how you get to know
we recognize our kinship -   the people around you. Are you taking
we change the world, one     the time to make connections with
                             people's stories and how they move
        story at a time."    about the world? What values do they

hold and how might they be similar or different to yours - and in what ways might

they clash or work well together? It's important to remember that the goal of this is

not for any one story to dominate the narrative, rather, the stories come together to

tell a much larger story of your classroom, your workplace, your community. You can

learn how the people around you (colleagues, students, community members, even

friends and family!) like to learn, ways they prefer receiving feedback, best ways to

communicate with them, how they got to where they are now. These simple

prompts allow us to delve deeper into people's stories while also allowing them the

autonomy of how far in depth they want to share.

     Pause & Reflect: Positionality Within Stories

     When thinking about the following questions, use the following example to support you in answering:
     Think of the story of being a student. How might the narrative and perspectives of the story be
     different with teachers talking about student experiences versus students talking about their own
     experiences.

          · What is the storyteller's relationship to the story and how is the narrative impacted by that?
          · Whose voices are centered and whose are excluded?
          · Whose stories are being told? What is the narrative being told?
          · What principles, norms, values, and worldviews will inform the selection of knowledge in your

             OER?

     Using our Storytelling & Communications Template, situate yourself within your OER project and
     examine the status quo in your discipline by evaluating one or a few materials commonly used.
     with the prompts provided, we invite you to co-develop a shared project vision for your OER.

26 | Importance of Storytelling
Ethical Storytelling

Stories are often political and/ or personal, so it's important to be mindful of how you
tell or share stories. In her 2009 TedTalk, novelist Chimamanda Adichie emphasises
the importance to acknowledge the richness in stories and how we often amplify
single stories over multiple streams that co-exist.

       "Stories matter. Many stories matter. Stories have been used to dispossess
       and to malign, but stories can also be used to empower and to humanise.
       Stories can break the dignity of a people, but stories can also repair that
       broken dignity."

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them
                    online here: https://press.rebus.community/MakingRipples/?p=410#oembed-1

In teaching, storytelling can be a powerful means to grapple with, and respond to,
the complexity of the world around us. When you understand that stories are never
innocent, you can use them to do important ethical and political work. You can tell
stories in ways that are open and accountable to diverse beings on this earth.

Ethical storytelling is the practice of honouring strong standards of consent, trust,
reciprocity and transparency as the guiding principles for sharing our own or other
people's stories. It centres the storytellers as the experts of their own narratives and
frames people by their aspirations and contributions rather than by their problems.
It is also conscious of power dynamics to avoid the perpetuation of harm through
misrepresentation, erasure or extraction of knowledge. At best, ethical storytelling
has the power to move people to action, inspire hope, influence connection and
change within our communities and humanity at large.

Alterio and McDrury (2003) argue how stories provide great pedagogical
opportunities for students to examine and learn from complex professional
situations through reflective dialogue and thus encourage educators to incorporate
stories into learning and assessment processes, granted that they consider a range
of ethical issues, including confidentiality, anonymity, ownership of stories, the
problem of projection and presentation of practice examples.Asking yourself what

                                                                                                                                                        Ethical Storytelling | 27
stories you are telling and what means you are employing to tell them, will help
"enlarge the dialogic spaces of possibilities in which we act, think, and reimagine
the world together with others, and how they restrain or impoverish these spaces."
(Meretoja, 2017, p. 2)

As Meretoja (dito) posits "a nuanced analysis of the uses and abuses of narrative
for life is possible only when we are sensitive to the ways in which narratives as
practices of sense-making are embedded in social, cultural, and historical worlds.
We are always already entangled in webs of narratives. They are integral to the world
that precedes us, and they make it possible for us to develop into subjects who are
capable of narrating their experiences, sharing them with others, and telling their
own versions of the stories they have inherited."

At any point, when you share someone else's story, pause to critically reflect on the
principles you will be rooting your OER. The On Screen Protocols Pathways report
provides us with a suitable framework for Indigenous principles, namely respect,
responsibility, consent, reciprocity. Since they carry forward in all aspects of content
creation, they apply OER as well. Respect is a fundamental value in Indigenous
societies and thus is applied to all aspects of life.

It's important to understand that as OER content creators you have a responsibility
to the people and communities whose stories and information you wish to present.
Reciprocity is a cornerstone in the creation of partnerships, which include fair
compensation, the sharing of benefits, informed consent, and community
empowerment. Maybe this plays out in you supporting your BIPOC students in
empowering ways or you will be closely collaborating with BIPOC colleagues.
Determining consent and ownership of oral traditions and stories is often
challenging because permissions best in a number of places and vary depending
on the nature of the story being told. So take the time to consult and achieve
consent, particularly for collectively held stories.

Committed relationship-building does lay the groundwork for collaborative
interpretative processes of sense-making and genuine mutual decision-making
from the very beginning of the story creation process to its end. Collaboratively,
you can share stories that are truthful and authentic, educational and empowering,
nuanced and dignifying. Our Storytelling & Communications Template provides
you with some additional questions to consider when you are thinking about
storytelling as it pertains to your OER.

28 | Ethical Storytelling
     Pause & Reflect on Ethical Storytelling

     An ethical storytelling approach raises questions like:
          · Who is the audience?
          · Whose voices are centered and whose are excluded?
          · Whose stories are being told? What is the narrative being told?
          · Does the story honour everyone's identity, integrity, and dignity in a way they would recognize if
             they read the story?
          · Why do you want to share this story?
          · How can you tell stories that honours the similarities and differences between yourself and the
             story?

Perspectives in Curriculum

As educators, it's critical for us to reflect on the roles we play in the classroom.
Teachers are often positioned as the "experts" on a subject, and this expertise
is further solidified as these individuals have the power to create the learning
materials (open or not) that are used in classrooms around the world. The impact
of our stories in curriculum is two-fold: not only do we determine what forces and
individuals have had influence on a discipline, but we also hold the power to shape
the minds of those students and scholars who might take it further.
Dr. Tadashi Dozono notes that there is "inevitably some sort of bias and ideological
influence going into how this narrative is being presented" -- partly due to our
own positionality as individuals as well as the contexts that have informed our
own educational development. We must be very cognizant of how power shapes
discourse, for instance in the language we use in our learning materials -- how are
minoritized groups mentioned or depicted? (Dozono). Who are these stories written
for? (Krawec). Is it enough to have images and pictures of different groups, or can
we invite speakers and others to the classroom or to contribute to content so there
is no further erasure of critical perspectives?

                                                                                                                                             Perspectives in Curriculum | 31
     Pause & Reflect: History writing as a dinner party

            "We have this idea of history as a series of knowable events but think about something as simple
            as a dinner party you were at last year. Think about how different your memories of that event
            are from your friends who were also there. Even if you all kept diaries and wrote down what
            happened. You'll have evidence, maybe somebody kept the bill which details the things
            everyone ordered but that bill won't say anything about what each person thought about their
            own plate or that of somebody else. If you tried some of the food from another plate, which
            appetizes your shared and what you shied away from.
            That's history. We have receipts and photographs, recollections and diaries. These things help us
            to create stories and most of these stories are things we have collectively agreed upon. Stories
            that are are reinforced because they get taught in school and written in books and made into
            films and plays."
            -- Patty Krawec

     Think of whose voices and stories can be legitimized in educational materials, and whose accounts may
     be silenced. About whose voices dominate a discipline. About how individuals and groups get
     characterized. And how the c for instance in required college courses about History. Think of how you
     could be part of a movement and story that changes this all!

Look beyond performative inclusion of marginalized perspectives in your learning
materials, but rather embody in your practice a commitment towards reshaping
your discipline. This means updating textbooks, but also rethinking course
outcomes, shaping more engaging assignments, adjusting your assessment scale,
and more. What you teach and how you teach it matter significantly.

In the podcast episode below, Dr. Tadashi Dozono shares his research on epistemic
violence in world history classrooms and curriculum. The podcast host Josie Gray
and her guest talk about textbooks, standardized curriculum, queer theory, the
power of grammar, and allowing students to bring their own ways of knowing into
the classroom.

Tadashi Dozono is an assistant professor of history/social science education at
California State University Channel Islands. Through cultural studies, ethnic studies,
queer theory, and critical theory, Tadashi's research emphasizes accountability
towards the experiences of marginalized students by examining the production of
knowledge in high school social studies classrooms. Read the transcript for this

Introduction

A quote from the late author and social activist, bell hooks.

As educators, our goal is to create a ripple effect in our classrooms -- a great way we
start to have an impact is with our curriculum and resources used. Our approach to
teaching and learning - and the frameworks we use to teach and learn - play a role.
Teaching is hardly neutral -- be it what you teach or how you teach it. The stories
we tell and the truths we speak (or don't speak) matter. Intentionally or not, how
you ask students to learn and demonstrate their learning may privilege some while
harming others. There are proactive strategies that can support you as you work to
create a more equitable and inclusive learning experience, regardless of whether
your role in this field is as a teacher, librarian, administrator, technologist, or
something else. In this section of the guide, you can think of pedagogy as the
methods and practices that guide your creation and support of learning
experiences in the classroom.

                                                                                                                                                                  Introduction | 39
Before you begin designing your OER, reflect on your own learning experiences.
What are your own ways of thinking and learning? How does this influence
how you teach or work with others? For example, I have difficulty learning and
understanding when content is in academic language, so I tend to teach by
breaking concepts down to simple, plain language and building from there. Others
may learn best with more technical terminology. Neither ways of learning are
wrong, per se, but it is important to look at how we learn, how that impacts our
teaching, and how that may be a pathway for some and a barrier for others.
Thinking back on your own experiences can be a great starting point when thinking
about the needs of your students. From this point, you can easily expand outwards
-- asking colleagues at your institution, people in your field, and most importantly
the students you work with what their learning needs are.

     Pause & Reflect on your own learning experiences

          · What do you find most beneficial to your learning?
          · Are there barriers to your own learning? If so, what are they?
          · What do you remember of past teachers of yours that made you feel welcome, heard, and

             engaged?
          · Did everybody else in that classroom feel as engaged, heard, and welcome as you did?
          · Think of your students - do they have particular interests, barriers to learning, or accessibility?

40 | Introduction
Aligning your Pedagogy with
Equity

As you design and create your OER, there are a few considerations to think of along
the way, including knowing yourself and knowing your students. Earlier in ethical
storytelling (link back to this section), we mentioned that it's good practice to reflect
on your positionality as it relates to storytelling. Ask yourself the same questions,
only now consider how that impacts your pedagogical approach:
What is the storyteller's relationship to the story and how is the narrative impacted
by that?
Whose voices are centered and whose are excluded?
Whose stories are being told? What is the narrative being told?
It's key to remember that while you are creating an OER, it is merely a tool and
OER-enabled pedagogy does not equal equitable pedagogy. We can still replicate
harmful beliefs and practices in open education. To create positive change within
the classroom and more generally in education, pedagogy needs to centre equity.
But what does that look like?

In Designing for Care, the authors explain how "imagining better pedagogies is the

first step in creating a powerful learning environment." In this case, better

pedagogies go beyond the delivery of course materials. It "means more humanizing

pedagogies that embrace the fact that the people in our learning environments are

fantastic, curious, unpredictable, capable, and multi-layered." (Jerod Quinn; Martha

Burtis; Surita Jhangiani; and Catherine J. Denial) Pedagogies that emphasize our

shared humanity leave room for the cultivation of skills and knowledge for both

students and educators by interrupting traditional pedagogical practices and

promoting collective learning.                       "Imagining better
                                              pedagogies is the first step
There are so many different types of
pedagogies, some more equitable than              in creating a powerful
others. Below is a short list of just a few.     learning environment."
As you read through these, consider

what you like and dislike about each one, and notice any overlaps or gaps. Think

about what's similar and what's different to your current pedagogical approach. Are

there pedagogies you haven't considered until now? Are there equitable
pedagogies not listed here?

                                              Open pedagogy is rooted in the belief that
                                              education should be accessible, participatory,
                                              and empowering for all learners, and that
                                              openness and collaboration are key to achieving
                                              these goals.

                                              Culturally-responsive Pedagogy identifies and
                                              nurtures students' unique cultural strengths to
                                              support student success and well-being.
                                              Student learning, cultural competence, and
                                              critical consciousness are the three essential
                                              components of culturally relevant education
                                              that Dr. Gloria Ladson-Billings (1995) lists.

Graphic of four pedagogies: Open, Culturally  Critical pedagogy is a theoretical framework
Responsive, Critical, and Trauma-informed.    that emphasizes critical thinking, social justice,
                                              and the promotion of democratic values. As
                                              such, teaching is a political act that can engage
                                              teachers and students in dialogue about
                                              existing power structures and the ways in which
                                              to address oppression in education.

                                                                               Trauma-informed Pedagogy is a method of
teaching that is dedicated to understanding the various traumatic events that students may
encounter and validates how these may affect their ability to learn (Imad, 2021).

     Pause & Reflect on your Teaching Impact

     Every day as educators we must ask ourselves crucial questions:
          · How does my teaching style integrate into my curriculum and course design?
          · Does my teaching style uplift or suppress diverse perspectives?
          · Does my teaching style invite critical thinking and/or feedback?

Student-Centered Course
Design & Facilitation

When it comes to course design and delivery, there are many strategies to
centering DEI. In the storytelling section, we mentioned the idea of getting to
know your audience through storytelling. The act of storytelling can be a great
pedagogical tool to build relationships and trust with your class, and show care.
While there is no "one size fits all" approach to teaching nor learning, being student-
centered and flexible is one of the best tools to keep in your toolbox!

Student-centered design can be broken down into two distinct categories: content
and processes. Content refers to the materials and resources you use in the
classroom -- are the materials and resources diverse and allow for flexible learning
opportunities? Processes asks you to consider the best types of activities to allow
for diverse learners to understand the content - this could be large-group or solo
activities - are you encouraging and supporting students to demonstrate their
understanding of content in a variety of ways on tests, projects, and/or
assignments?

Consider co-designing class expectations, syllabi, texts, and assignments with your
students to increase engagement and active learning. Co-designing learning
experiences provides students with agency in what they learn and how they
demonstrate their learning. It also removes assumptions about students since you'll
be designing with them, not for them. Open licensing can be a great way to keep
syllabi, texts, and assignments up to date and reflect the students in your classes.

  "OER loses its power as a                         If you plan on using open licensing, be

                                                    for them. It's important to note that very

permissive open licenses may not work for all content, contexts, or creators. When

44 | Student-Centered Course Design & Facilitation
it comes to open licenses, many in the open education community do not feel that
the CC-BY-ND (no derivatives) is actually considered open, but this sentiment fails
to consider that not all knowledge can or should be accessed completely open. Britt
Dzioba (2021) explains that "OER loses its power as a community driven effort if we
only focus on the goal of making all knowledge accessible, in-spite of community
desires." Learn the protocol for knowledge sharing when it comes from outside your
culture. Allow the holder of this knowledge to self-determine their license. Check
out our Office Hours episode on Talking to Students about Open Licenses and the
Licensing chapter of A Guide to Making Open Textbooks with Students for more
information.

There are multiple benefits to co-creating materials with students. Aside from
relationship building, collaborating with students puts students into an active
learning environment, where they can create rather than consume knowledge. It
can also help support OER sustainability, as pointed out by Sam Arugnwa in the
Office Hours session What Happens When My Author Leaves? Policies to Support
OER. (2022) On the topic of renewable assignments, Sam notes: "David Wiley talked
about having students do homework that would live forever essentially. And that
would contribute to making the world a better place. And I thought that is our
sustainability plan. Our students come to our class to learn. We can choose to
make that learning more affordable by making their textbooks open resources.
But we can also do it in a way that we partner with them, we do what we call
collaboration with our students and make it part of their homework." To see more
student collaborations in OER, check out Pressbooks' collection.

     Pause & Reflect on Content and Processes to Support Equitable Learning

          · How does the selection of texts, knowledge, and assessments impact the student experience?
          · How could you organise a curriculum to maximise long-term retention and transfer of

             knowledge?
          · What elements should inform a student-centered course-design and delivery?
          · How important is it to see students as whole persons in the teaching process?
          · From your experience as a student/instructor/librarian/support staff or administrator, what good

             and effective examples for content and processes do you know and can share with the teaching
             and learning community?

                                                                                                              Student-Centered Course Design & Facilitation | 45
     Action Plan: Cater to Unique Student Needs

     Using the following resource, begin thinking of some ways you can meet students' needs.
     Cards for Humanity is a great site that generates two random cards and challenges you to think about
     how you can meet their needs.
     While this game offers broader scenarios outside a typical classroom environment, it can be a good
     exercise to help you think about the wide and whole range of characteristics that students walk into
     classrooms with, so be sure to consider a variety of learners, lived experiences, and accommodations.

Feedback & Flexibility

Feedback plays a large role in teaching and learning - for both students and
educators alike. After reassessing your pedagogical approaches to better align with
equity and centering students in your course design and delivery, you can gain
further insight into your OER and pedagogies by listening to the input of students!
Nothing's perfect and we all get it wrong at times but it's how we respond to
getting it wrong and what we do with that feedback that matters. Take a moment
to think about how you handle feedback - how often do you ask for feedback? Who
do you ask for feedback? How do you respond to constructive feedback?

Formative feedback, specifically, is a strategy of providing ongoing feedback in
order to better understand and improve upon your teaching, resulting in improved
learning environments for students. Focus on formative feedback for teaching
development: A guide (University of Calgary, 2016) notes that "interpreting
formative feedback is a highly reflective process, which incorporates the instructor's
beliefs, intentions, and strategies, and the learners' experiences."

Feedback and flexibility work alongside each other. When you receive feedback,

you're given the flexibility to make changes based on that feedback. This takes

some reframing. Something that's helped me is reframing why people provide

feedback. Feedback helps us all get better - remember if students are taking the

time to let you know what's not working for them in the classroom, that is not an

attack - it's a learning opportunity. Your students care enough to let you know and

want you to improve for future students. When we get to the place where we

understand feedback as care, we become more open to flexibility and adapting our

ways.                                     When we get to the place
                                             where we understand

Wilfrid Laurier University educational developers, presents a few more examples of
questions to ask.
Next, consider the ways in which you can gather feedback from students - from
creating a feedback form at the back of your OER to offering office hours to have
virtual or in-person conversations or providing space in assessments to provide
feedback. Also think of ways to embed feedback into your resource as it's received.
Maybe this means reviewing feedback after a course is complete, or once a year to
look at feedback and consider possible changes.

     Pause & Reflect on Intentional Feedback

          · Think back to a time when you received feedback. What did it feel like? Why?
          · What constitutes constructive feedback?
          · How often do you ask for feedback from students? Not just about the course itself, but your

             teaching style?
          · What does being intentional about course material mean to you?
          · What are ways that you can show care in your OER design, as well as the classroom?

     Action Plan: Solicit Feedback

     Create a feedback form for the back matter of your OER. Feedback forms can be as simple or as
     detailed as you'd like. Below are some examples that you can use as reference:

Introduction

A quote from lawyer and civil rights activist, Marian Wright Edelman.

When talking about equity in education, it must be emphasized that we are not
trying to fit equity into the current inequitable systems operating. When we try to
create equity within the systems that create inequities, we often end up replicating
inequitable practices and beliefs. Sarah Hare asks us to "consider how openness,
when disconnected from its political underpinnings, could become as exploitative
as the traditional system it had replaced" (Sarah Hare, Open at the Margins). This
quote calls attention to the need for us to look at the systems we interact with
and highlight the educational practices we use by making connections back to the
communities around us.
The central metaphor of this guide is the idea that our actions have ripple effects.
This chapter highlights an overarching overview of methods and practices that
you, as an educator, can take to contribute to equitable systems outside of the
classrooms, beginning with a commitment to lifelong learning. It also asks you to

                                                                                                                                                                  Introduction | 53
consider how you can make connections to communities outside of the classroom ,
making learning a communal endeavor. Finally, we discuss how all of these lessons
learned along the way can be shared back to the broader community, whether
that's in open education or elsewhere.
Think about your own values and how they align with actions that you can take
in your departments, institutions, and more broadly in higher education, to shift
educational systems to become a socially just environment. For faculty, this could
look like taking your lectures or presentations and hosting events more public
beyond the classroom, such as a library. Most libraries allow people to book spaces
for free for educational purposes. What if you were to take a lecture and deliver it at
a library, opening up that knowledge to a wider audience? For administrators, are
there ways to invite a wider range of communities to events on campus?

54 | Introduction
Listen, Learn, Act: Lifelong
Learning

We often hear the expression "listening and learning". While listening and learning
are two very important pieces in advancing social justice, there's something critical
missing -- action. The world we live in requires to go beyond passive acts of listening
and learning, and lean into action and growing. We have an opportunity with open
education to reimagine education broadly -- from our pedagogies and practises
to the larger economic, social, and political barriers to education -- by making
educational content easily accessible to anyone, shifting learning from "traditional
education in brick and mortar institutions to a more flexible and accessible
approach for learning for all." (Dr. Fawzi Baroud, 2017)

Pause for a moment and think about the work you do professionally. Now think
about what that looks like outside of work. How do you advocate for equity in your
personal life? How do you challenge yourself outside of work? What role can you
play in larger social justice movements?

To me, equity in a teaching and learning context means recognizing our
positionalities in the classroom and making adjustments to imbalances in power. It
involves respect and reciprocity between teacher and student - as they act in both
roles throughout the course.

 "If we fear mistakes, doing   Even with the best of intentions, DEI
 things wrongly, constantly    approaches can fail. How do we hold
evaluating ourselves, we will  ourselves accountable? As bell hooks
 never make the academy a      said in Teaching to Transgress, "If we fear
                               mistakes, doing things wrongly,
    culturally diverse place   constantly evaluating ourselves, we will
    where scholars and the     never make the academy a culturally
    curricula address every    diverse place where scholars and the
                               curricula address every dimension of
        dimension of that      that difference."
             difference."

Lifelong learning starts to have a ripple effect when you grow and exchange with

                               Listen, Learn, Act: Lifelong Learning | 55
others, which is why professional development has a more fruitful impact when you
seek mentors, or when you seek a group where you can actually have discussion.
This is when you can begin to see the potential, but also have greater potential to
really change things. Being open to learning, unlearning, feedback & change.

You may be asking yourself, how does this all fit into OER? I often think back to the
CARE Framework. Authored by Lisa Petrides, Douglas Levin, and C. Edward Watson,
this framework seeks to "be explicit about the values that we think are core to the
OER movement, including the practices of individuals and organizations that are
involved in the production, dissemination, and use of OER." These four core values
- contribute, attribute, release, and empower - seek to increase participation in
the open community by recognizing contributions from collaborators, offering tools
for sharing OER, and empowering both students and educators by promoting the
participation of new and non-traditional voices in the creation and adoption of OER.
(Petrides et. al)

I like the idea of the CARE framework and oftentimes think of CARE as Connecting,
Attributing, Reflecting, and Empowering. I believe connection is the number one
value and practice that makes open practices more equitable. When we connect
with one another and learn about each other we, as Richard Wagamese writes,
"we see each other, we recognize our kinship - we change the world, one story at
a time." Next is attribution. We cannot do the work we do without collaboration.
Collaboration without acknowledging others' knowledge and input is plagiarism.
Attribution is more than just citing someone else - in many cases, correctly
attributing or citing lessons learned to their original authors should be recognized
not just as a courtesy, but an opportunity to reflect and acknowledge the lived
experiences of the author and those around them. We then move onto reflection,
as learning without reflection is just passive consumption of knowledge. Lastly
is empowerment, which directly relates to attribution. While attribution
acknowledges the lived experiences of both individuals and groups, empowerment
takes this recognition a step further by addressing the social, cultural, political, and
economic factors that affect education. This empowers people and groups to take
part in decision-making and reclaim agency and control over their lives. (WHO)

As you continue reading this guide, think about the ways in which you may already
practice the CARE framework and make note of them. Next, identify where there
may be gaps in your practice and ways you can contribute.

     Pause & Reflect on the Historical and Modern Practices in Education

          · What is the history of higher education in your local area?
          · Reflect on the past three years. What lessons have you learned about social justice practices in

             your institution?
          · What values is your current understanding and practice rooted in? What hopes for change do you

             have for an equitable teaching and learning in higher education tomorrow?
          · What does equity in teaching and learning mean to you today?

     Action Plan: Transform your Practices

          · Part 1 - Browse the CARE Framework to reflect your current OER practices. Do your current
             practices have the intended impact? Can changing approaches or branching out enhance the
             impact of your work?

          · Part 2 - Plan for one equity-centered professional development opportunity (e.g. online webinar,
             department meeting, in-person conference, asynchronous course, etc). What types of professional
             development opportunities are available? Do they support an equitable school environment?
                   While attending: pay attention to the values being communicated, the voices presenting,
                      the design of the space? What is missing to make it truly equitable? For example, are masks
                      required and basic accessibility accommodations provided unprompted? Are a wide range
                      of people represented in both guests and speakers? Is the space welcoming and accessible?
                   After attending: make sure to apply at least one aspect of critical reflection into your own
                      equity practice.

Connecting to Community

To properly address student needs, it can be helpful to build partnerships with
different disciplines and communities. When we say community, there are a
number of communities you may belong to -- from coworkers and peers at your
institution or industry, to community, cultural, and/or student organizations.

Interdisciplinary collaborations bring multiple perspectives to a discipline that
enables a deeper learning of the subject matter. Interdisciplinary can mean a
multitude of disciplines, inside and outside of academic institutions. A friend and I
had a discussion the other day about his experiences in education. He mentioned
that most of his first year courses had a core instructor but several guest speakers,
each lecturing about their different expertises in the same discipline. He noted
it made classes more engaging and that he ended up with a wider depth of
knowledge in the subject matter. Below are some points to consider as you are
thinking about collaborating with community partners. While planning a
collaborative OER project, be mindful of knowledge extraction vs. knowledge
exchange by:

   · Giving communities the recognition that they deserve
   · Centering impacted people when conducting research, writing, and decision

      making
   · Remembering your experience can be a catalyst for someone else's journey in

      advocating for equitable education
   · Being intentional, and ensuring that everything you do in the classroom is

      flexible. This benefits both students and yourself!

Think of open practices as community service. Connecting your content to the real
world benefits not only your students, but a wider audience. I think back to my
undergraduate experience and one particular class comes to mind - my third year
community psychology course. My professor opted out of a traditional textbook,
instead curating specific readings and news articles. Each session we were provided
with a news headline that related to the topic of the class and had open discussion
around it. This style of teaching substantially changed how I learn, as I was able to
hear about classmates' lived experiences and how the content we were studying
connected to the real world.

58 | Connecting to Community
Pause & Reflect on Community Engagement

     · Are there community members and industry professionals who can come into your class to
        speak?

     · Are there ways to expand your knowledge of your field? (such as networking or joining a
        community of practice)

     · How can you bring back lessons learned into departmental conversations or in other volunteer
        work that you're doing in the community?

     · How can current OER be adopted or adapted outside the classroom?

Action Plan: Join a Community of Practice

Join a community of practice. This could mean to introduce yourself, crowdsource a question, or share
an interesting OER resource with the group. Simply clicking on each part in the accordion allows you to

Sharing Back

Maya Angelou once said, "when you learn, teach. When you get, give." I appreciate

this quote because it highlights the importance of reciprocity and challenges

educators to turn their educational strategies into a common project that can help

others. Humans learn from one another and have a responsibility to share back with

each other. Think back to the last time you read and/or heard about another

educator's practices and were inspired - would you have learned about their

practices if they hadn't shared that?            "When you learn, teach.
                                                   When you get, give."
The previous chapter emphasized that
OER creation must be social justice in

action, and in order to do that you need to make connections between education

and community. A key feature of equitable education and a value that Rebus and

many others in the open education field holds is humanizing learning. One way to

humanize learning is through storytelling. Storytelling is a fundamental part of

being human - stories let us share information in ways that create connection. In

the context of OER, storytelling allows you to:

1. Situate your role in the work and describe the story of your pedagogy and
    practices;

2. Practice reciprocating your learning through sharing.

There are many possible foci for stories to narrate and share with the wider
education community, such as resources and practices, pedagogical approaches
and what they're rooted in, etc.

60 | Sharing Back
     Pause & Reflect on Reciprocating Learning

     Consider making sharing the story of your own learning a practice. Maybe that's sharing back in
     conferences or just chatting with other folx in industry.

          · What recent equity and OER learning of yours are worth sharing? How and with whom do you
             want to share?

          · How have you previously shared your learning?

     Step 1: Think about a person in the Open Education sphere whom you would like to interview and
     consider the following questions:

          · Who would like to interview and why?
          · What do you like to learn about and from that person?
          · How would you like to conduct the interview?
          · In what ways would you share back the information?
     Step 2 (Optional): If feasible, conduct the interview. With permission from the interviewee, publish your
     learning in your preferred format.

Reimagining Education to
Make Ripples Beyond the
Academy

A quote from activist, academic, and author Angela Davis.

Zooming out a bit further, this chapter asks you to consider ways in which you can
take teaching and learning well beyond the classroom to address wider barriers to
education - to think about the wider ripple effects of your action. You'll notice in
this chapter there isn't one particular strategy - rather a culmination of strategies
laid out in the guide to support your call to action of challenging the status quo
in education and advocating on multiple fronts for more equitable access to
education.
In order to change the systems we operate in, you have to begin by unlearning

                                                                                      Reimagining Education to Make Ripples Beyond the Academy | 67
the indoctrination learned in our current education system. Starting at a young
age, children are taught about society's norms and values through our education
systems. Education is a tool that can be used for good or bad. Educational
institutions in Canada and the U.S. have been a place of indoctrination, assimilation,
and exclusion since their beginnings. Examples of this include segregated schools,
mandatory attendance at boarding and residential "schools", and even
enfranchisement. Both of these countries deem education as a fundamental right
and social good. However, rather than using education as a tool of lifelong learning,
curiosity, and civic engagement and responsibility, both countries have instead
used education as a tool to reinforce the settler-colonial narrative of these countries
founded on stolen land and slavery. From discriminatory hiring and admission
practises to Eurocentric curriculum and pedagogical practises, these institutions
have been and continue to be primarily rooted in a European colonial mindset.
As former Senator and former chair of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
Murray Sinclair famously said, "education is what got us here. Education is what will
get us out." It's crucial for educators to connect education work beyond pedagogy
and OER, as this work does not matter if the material conditions for people do not
improve. In the words of Gholdy Muhammad, "we live in a period where there's no
time for "urgent-free pedagogy." Our instructional pursuits must be honest, bold,
raw, unapologetic, and responsive to the social times." (Muhammad, 2021).

Every decision made outside of education impacts education - take the example
listed above of the current push to ban the teaching of critical race theory in
school. Reimagining Education: Beyond the Rhetoric, from the Mahatma Gandhi
Institution of Education for Peace and Sustainable Development (UNESCO Library)
notes that this perpetuation is "because we look at education purely as an
instrumental perspective - as a means to an end - an end which is material wealth
and social status, propagating the I vs. you and the us vs. them."

One way to reimagine education is by leveraging teaching methods where
educators and students have agency to learn about things that make sense in
the realities that aren't separate from their lives. By applying classroom learning to
students' own lived experiences and encouraging curiosity and critical thinking, we
can shift education from an extractive manner of taking from communities to a
reciprocal process of connecting classroom learning to community and connecting
communities to learning. We can nurture curious, critical thinkers who are
compassionate and caring for the communities around them. We can also create

68 | Reimagining Education to Make Ripples Beyond the Academy
safe learning spaces for students to bring their whole selves into the class, and feel
a deep sense of belonging.

Educators work to serve the needs of the communities in which they work, but how
do you know the needs of a community if you don't seek that out? A good first step
is paying attention to the news. See whose stories are told, how they are told, and
by whom. What you'll see is individualized narratives turned into generalizations
of groups of people. These generalizations turn into stereotypes, negative attitudes
and biases. Stereotypes turn into prejudice, including biased thinking which turn
into discriminatory beliefs, actions, and policies (a good example of this is the
banning of critical race theory in many states). These discriminatory actions turn
into systemic discrimination, operating across the full spectrum of income,
education, health, housing, culture, policing, public infrastructure, and beyond.

This can be done by making learning opportunities and materials available to a
variety of places outside of a classroom, such as community centers, immigration
centers, detention centers, libraries, etc. In the previous chapter, the example of
hosting educational events in more public spaces, such as libraries was brought
up. Other examples could include civic literacy guides for voters distributed for
free online and at city or community centres, or introductory resources to civic
engagement and responsibilities, so citizens are aware of their rights and
responsibilities and are able to make informed decisions. The beauty of open
educational resources is that they're designed for people to easily access them. OER
in this regard can be reimagined and utilized far beyond the walls of a classroom,
allowing* members of our community opportunities to learn pivotal information
they may not otherwise be able to access. Can you think of any examples of
learning materials being used outside of the traditional academic setting?

the potential of open education is only going to be possible to the extent that it
roots out structural racism. We must be more ambitious about dismantling racist
policies, practices, and ideas through our work." (2020) The cost of inaction on the
part of educators (no matter your role in the educational system) is immeasurable.
You, as an educator, hold a lot of responsibility and power to write the future! All of
us as people have to shape the future too -- we are both sides of the coin; minting
a new currency to propel the world forward.

     Pause & Reflect on the Larger Ripple Effects of Education

          · What do you consider your role in society as?
          · What do you see the role of education in society as?
          · Look at the open education movement - who are the initial founding voices of OER? Who are the

             loudest voices? Why did you buy into open education? Why are you doing this work? How are you
             doing this work? Who are you doing this work for? Whose values is this movement rooted in?

A note from the Rebus Community

We are working to create a new, collaborative model for publishing open textbooks.
Critical to our success in reaching this goal is to ensure that all books produced
using that model meet the needs of all those who will one day use them. To us,
open means inclusive, so for a book to be open, it must also be accessible.

As a result, we are working with accessibility experts and others in the OER
community to develop best practices for creating accessible open textbooks, and
are building those practices into the Rebus model of publishing. By doing this, we
hope to ensure that all books produced using the Rebus Community are accessible
by default, and require an absolute minimum of remediation or adaptation to meet
any individual reader's needs.

While we work on developing guidelines and implementing support for authoring
accessible content, we are making a good faith effort to ensure that books
produced with our support meet accessibility standards wherever possible, and to
highlight areas where we know there is work to do. It is our hope that by being
transparent on our current books, we can begin the process of making sure that
accessibility is top of mind for all authors, adopters, students, and contributors of all
kinds on all our open textbook projects.

Below is a short assessment of eight key areas that have been assessed during
the production process. The checklist has been drawn from the BCcampus Open
Education Accessibility Toolkit. While a checklist such as this is just one part of a
holistic approach to accessibility, it is one way to begin our work on embedded
good accessibility practices in the books we support. Wherever possible, we have
identified ways in which anyone may contribute their expertise to improve the
accessibility of this text.

We also welcome any feedback from anyone who encounters the book and
identifies an issue that needs resolving. This book is an ongoing project and will be
updated as needed. Although there are currently no known accessibility issues in
this directory, we do link to external resources within it, and we cannot guarantee

that the resources we are linking to conform to accessibility guidelines. If you
encounter an accessibility barrier or would like to submit a correction or suggestion,
please do so using the Rebus Community Accessibility Suggestions form.

Review Statement

Making Ripples: A Guidebook to Challenge Status Quo in OER Creation was
produced by the Rebus Community, a non-profit organization building a new,
collaborative model for publishing open textbooks. Critical to the success of this
approach is including mechanisms to ensure that open textbooks produced with
the Community are high quality, and meet the needs of all students who will one
day use them. Rebus books undergo both peer review from faculty subject matter
experts and beta testing in classrooms, where student and instructor feedback is
collected.

Each chapter in this guide went through at least two reviews:

   · An initial draft underwent close reading and response by members of the
      Rebus team.

   · A revised draft went through an open peer review by two open education
      advocates.

Reviews were structured around considerations of the intended audience of the
book, and examined the comprehensiveness, accuracy, and relevance of content.
Reviews were also focused on relevance longevity, clarity, consistency, organization
structure flow, grammatical errors, and cultural relevance. See the review guide for
more details. Changes suggested by the reviewers covered numerous areas and
were incorporated by the lead author and editor.

The team at Rebus would like to thank the reviewers for the time, care, and
commitment they contributed to the project. We recognise that peer reviewing is
a generous act of service on their part. This book would not be the robust, valuable
resource that it is were it not for their feedback and input.
