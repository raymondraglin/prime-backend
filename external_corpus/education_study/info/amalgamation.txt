THE WRITING PROCESS

In order to write a good paragraph or essay, good writers need time and a step-by-step
approach. Even writers who are writing in their first language have to change the words,
grammar, punctuation, and sentences several times. Good writing comes from rewriting. In
most writing classes, you will practice different writing processes. While there are many
possible steps, there are three main stages:

 EXERCISE 1

INSTRUCTIONS: Write a word or phrase from the diagram that matches the definitions below.

     1. __________________ The first (not final) version of your writing
     2. __________________ To make big changes, such as adding or omitting information
     3. __________________ To put your ideas on paper without worrying about details yet
     4. __________________ To make little changes, such as fixing grammar
     5. __________________ The subject of your writing
     6. __________________ To think of many possible ideas (some that you won't even use)
     7. __________________ To focus your writing on a more specific idea
     8. __________________ Suggestions for changes to your writing

WHAT IS A PARAGRAPH?

 EXERCISE 2

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the paragraph below. Can you complete these sentences with a word?

             In academic writing, a paragraph is a group of ____________ that are all about one
      ____________ idea. One paragraph in academic writing is often different from a
      paragraph from newspapers, magazines, websites, or a fictional story. In academic writing, a
      paragraph usually has three parts: first, there is a ____________ sentence, then there
      are some ____________ sentences, and at the end there is usually a ____________
      sentence. Each part of an academic paragraph plays a special role; that means each part of
      an academic paragraph has its own job to do.

 PARAGRAPH STRUCTURE

Now, take a moment to look at the three parts of a paragraph in the diagram below. Does it
help you to finish the paragraph above? Think about what each part of the paragraph should
do. Also, notice how the paragraph looks. (Don't worry about understanding the words; it's not
written in a modern language!)

 EXERCISE 3

INSTRUCTIONS: Complete the sentences matching the term with its definition.

topic sentence  supporting sentences                     concluding sentence

1. ____________________________ can do many things. It can restate the main idea. It
     can summarize the main points. It can make a prediction about the topic or offer a
     suggestion. In an essay, they sometimes transition to the next paragraph.

2. ____________________________ tells the reader what the paragraph is going to be
     about and gives the writer's idea about the topic (that's called "the controlling" idea or
     " the main idea").

3. ____________________________ support the main idea in several ways by giving
     examples, details, definitions, telling the events of a story, or giving reasons, etc. It's
     important that these sentences give specific information in order to be interesting and
     useful for the reader.

 EXERCISE 4

INSTRUCTIONS: Number these sentences in order to make a paragraph. Start by identifying
the topic sentence.

                                                      The Process of Writing
          ____ After that, the best thing to do is just write the whole first draft.
          ____ Once you have a topic, the first thing to do is brainstorm and outline.
          ____ For many students writing is one of the most difficult subjects, but by

                     following some simple steps, it doesn't have to be painful.
          ____ Following your teacher's feedback will improve your writing.
          __5_ If you feel stuck while writing your first draft, take a break to clear your

                     mind.
          ____ Finally, carefully read your teacher's feedback and follow their instructions

                     if they ask you to write a second draft.
          ____ These two steps go well together because you'll need to get ideas with a

                     brainstorm and then organize them with the outline.
          ____ By following these steps, you will find that writing an essay is a piece of

                     cake.
          ____ As soon as you have a finished draft, ask a friend or a tutor to read your

                     paper before you give it to your teacher.

 TOPIC SENTENCES

Look at the two parts of the topic sentence from the paragraph "The Process of Writing" that
you organized in the last exercise.

The two parts of a topic sentence are the topic and the controlling idea. The topic tells the
reader what the whole paragraph will be about. In the paragraph from Exercise 4, the topic is
writing. The controlling idea explains the writer's opinion or idea about the topic. What does
the writer want to say about the topic? What's the writer's point? In this topic sentence, the
writer's controlling idea is that writing is easier if you follow the steps they are going to
explain.

 EXERCISE 5

INSTRUCTIONS: The sentences below are all topic sentences taken from different paragraphs.
Circle the topic and underline the controlling idea in each one.

     1. Climate change is one of the most serious problems facing the world today.

     2. One of the most important academic skills to practice daily is reading.

     3. There are five simple steps to changing a flat tire on your car.

     4. Social media platforms are all about communication, but they work in different ways.

     5. Good writing is rewriting.

     6. Cats make better pets than _____________________________.

          NOTE: Look more closely at the last item. Compare your answer with a classmate's
          answer. Notice how you have the same topic, but you might have different controlling
          ideas. That's why it is so important that your topic sentence tells the reader both
          parts: topic + controlling idea.

 EXERCISE 6

                         1. INSTRUCTIONS: Choose the best topic sentence (A, B, or C) to complete the
                         paragraph below.

                              A. Dogs are better for young children than toys, phones, or TV.
                              B. Having a dog can teach a child about being responsible.
                              C. There are many negative results when ignoring a pet dog.

                                ________________________________________________. When a child has
                        a dog, they are responsible for taking care of it every day. This includes tasks
                        such as feeding, watering, and exercising the dog. It also includes making
                        sure the dog has a clean and comfortable place to sleep, and taking it to the
                        vet for check-ups and vaccinations. By taking on these responsibilities, a
                        child can learn to be organized and to manage their time effectively. They
                        can also learn how to problem-solve if they encounter any challenges while
                        caring for their dog. In addition, taking care of a dog can help a child develop
                        empathy and compassion, as they learn to understand the needs and
                        feelings of another living being. Overall, having a dog can be a great way for
                        a child to learn about being responsible and caring for others.

                        2. INSTRUCTIONS: Write a topic sentence for this paragraph. To write a good
                        topic sentence, read all of the supporting sentences carefully to decide what
                        the writer's main idea is. Then look carefully at the concluding sentence. The
                        topic sentence and the concluding sentence often share some information.

                                ___________________________________________________________ One
                        of the first things to do is to identify sources of money and begin searching
                        for the right house. It is crucial to consider the size of the house and if it will
                        meet the needs of the family both now and in the future. If the family is
                        planning to grow, it is necessary to find a house with enough space for
                        everyone. After finding a house that is the right size, the next step is to
                        research the neighborhood. Many people overlook this step, but it is crucial to
                        know about the area in which the house is located. The neighborhood is
                        where people will be spending a significant amount of time and raising their
                        family, so it is important to find a place that is safe and has good schools. It is
                        also important to consider factors such as traffic, noise, and pollution when
                        choosing a neighborhood. With careful consideration, buying a house can be
                        a wise investment in one's future.

 SUPPORTING SENTENCES

In this course, you will study different types of paragraphs and essays. Each type of
paragraph or essay can use different ways of explaining your idea. A strong paragraph has
several supporting sentences that do this job. They help to make the main idea clearer and
more believable to the reader. How many supporting sentences do you need? Well, that
depends on your topic. A complicated topic usually requires more sentences than a simple
topic. You use as many sentences as you need to explain your idea clearly and completely.
For this course, it is a good idea to have at least three to four supporting sentences. However,
academic paragraphs in college writing often have 10 or more sentences!

Supporting sentences give the reader specific supporting details, such as:

      examples
      definitions
      descriptions
      facts (time, date, place, number, percentage, etc.)
      explanations
      stages, steps, instructions
      different points of view
      ... and many other types of information.

For example ...

Topic sentence                            Supporting details

A vegan diet is the best choice to avoid         What is a vegan diet? (definition,
heart disease.                                      description, example)

                                                 Why is it the best choice?
                                                    (explanation)

                                                 How do we know this? (facts, figures,
                                                    statistics from research)

                                                 What do others think? (opposite
                                                    points of view)

Paragraph
          A vegan diet is the best choice to avoid heart disease. Vegans eat only food from

plants; their diet includes no animal products, such as meat, milk, eggs, butter, or even honey.
Food from plants lowers cholesterol, which is one of the major causes of heart disease. A
vegan diet is also generally high in nutrition and low in fat. According to a government report,
even a vegetarian diet lowers the risk of heart disease by 29%. Some people think that vegans
do not eat enough protein, but a balanced diet keeps them healthy. Therefore, a vegan diet is
one way to prevent heart disease.

 EXERCISE 7

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the two paragraphs below. Then answer the questions that follow.

                A. People who form close relationships with other people tend to be
                     happier than those who do not. The number of friends a person has is
                     not important. When it comes to happiness, what matters most is the
                     quality of the relationships. Close relationships are ones that usually
                     involve the sharing of feelings, mutual respect, acceptance, trust, fun
                     and empathy. As long as the relationships are deep, a person will
                     experience greater levels of happiness.

                B. People who exercise regularly are usually happier than people who
                     avoid exercising. People with good exercise routines are always
                     improving both their physical and mental well-being. In fact, research
                     has shown that exercise can be as effective as medication in treating
                     depression.

     1. Look back at the types of supporting details described earlier. Which kinds of
          supporting details does each paragraph use?

                A. __________________________________________________________

                B. __________________________________________________________

     2. Which paragraph is better? Why?

     3. Do both paragraphs have enough support for an academic essay? If not, how can
          they be improved?

 EXERCISE 8

INSTRUCTIONS: Review the types of information that you could include as supporting
sentences below. Then answer the questions that follow.

      examples
      definitions
      descriptions
      facts (time, date, place, number, percentage, etc.)
      explanations
      stages, steps, instructions
      different points of view
      ... and many other types of information.

          What kinds of support could be used to write a paragraph about the following
          topics? Use the types from the list above. Remember that most paragraphs
          use more than one type of support.

          1. The bravest moment of your life
          Type(s) support:

          2. Taking an amazing photograph
          Type(s) support:

          3. The differences between high school and college
          Type(s) support:

 CONCLUDING SENTENCES

Usually, the last sentence in a paragraph is the concluding sentence. Its job is to help the
reader feel that the writer has expressed a complete and finished idea. It closes the
paragraph by helping the reader move from the small details of the supporting sentences
back to the big picture of the topic sentence, or controlling idea. There are many simple and
creative ways to end a paragraph!

The concluding sentence can ....
      give advice or make a suggestion about the topic to the reader
      make a prediction or offer hope for the future
      give the writer's feelings or opinion about the topic
      restate the main idea from the topic sentence
      summarize the main points from the supporting sentences
      transition the paragraph's topic to the next paragraph's topic

 EXERCISE 9

INSTRUCTIONS: Look back at the two paragraphs in Exercise 7. Which paragraph doesn't have
a concluding sentence and which one does? How do you know? Write a concluding
sentence for the paragraph.

          Paragraph # ______

          Concluding sentence: _______________________________________________________

          ___________________________________________________________________________

 EXERCISE 10

INSTRUCTIONS: Look again at the concluding sentence in the paragraph titled "The Process of
Writing" (Exercise 4):

By following these simple steps, you will ind that writing an essay is a piece of cake.

Does the above concluding sentence ... (check  all that apply)
          ... give advice or a suggestion
          ... make a prediction or offer hope
          ... give the writer's feelings or opinion
          ... restate the main idea
          ... summarize the main points
          ... transition from the idea of one paragraph to the idea of the next paragraph

Amalgamation - Unit 1: Moving From Paragraphs to Essays  11
 EXERCISE 11

                        1. INSTRUCTIONS: Choose the best concluding sentence (A, B, or C) to
                        complete the paragraph below.

                              A. A person's friends and the media will affect their decision to get a
                                    tattoo.

                              B. The unfortunate fact about tattoos is that they are impossible to
                                    remove.

                              C. A tattoo can be a public sign to show what is important in a
                                    person's life.

                               It is not always the influence of other people or the media that results in
                       a person getting a tattoo. Many people decide to wear tattoos in order to
                       express their artistic nature, their beliefs, or their feelings; in other words, they
                       get a tattoo to show and express their individuality. A musician in a rock band
                       may get a tattoo of a guitar on the arm. Some environmentalists may tattoo
                       pictures of endangered animals on their shoulders. Lovers may tattoo each
                       other's names over their hearts. _____________________________________.

                        2. INSTRUCTIONS: Try writing a concluding sentence for this paragraph in two
                        different ways.

                               The human brain is very mysterious and only partially understood. Many
                        questions about the brain have not yet been answered. For example, why do
                        we need to sleep or why do we dream? There is a lot about the brain that we
                        do not yet understand. In fact, people used to think of the brain as useless
                        stuffing. Of course, scientists now know the brain is our control center.
                        Scientists also know about the basic functions of the different parts of the
                        brain. The surface of the brain is called the cerebral cortex. It is the part of the
                        brain that makes us intelligent, and it consists of four parts called lobes. The
                        front lobe is where much of our thinking and feeling happens. The top lobe
                        processes information which is coming from parts of our bodies, such as our
                        skin and muscles. The side lobe plays an important role in hearing, speech
                        and long-term memories while the back lobe processes images from our
                        eyes. ________________________________________________.

                           A. Restate the main idea from the topic sentence

                           B. Make a prediction about the brain

                                           The Process of Writing

       For many students writing is one of the most di cult subjects, but with a
little bit of organization and a good attitude, writing can be a very simple
process. Once you have a topic, the first thing to do is brainstorm and outline.
These two steps go well together because you'll need to get ideas with a
brainstorm and then organize them with the outline. After that, the best thing to
do is just write the whole first draft. If you feel stuck while writing your first
draft, stop and take a shower or go for a walk to clear your mind. As soon as you
have a finished draft, ask a friend or a tutor to read your paper before you give it
to your teacher. Finally, carefully read your teacher's feedback and follow their
instructions if they ask you to write a second draft. Following your teacher's
recommendations and asking questions about them will ensure that you get the
best grade possible. By following these steps, you will find that writing an essay
is a piece of cake.

PARAGRAPH PRACTICE

This is a good time to practice writing a paragraph using the ideas that
we have discussed.

ASSIGNMENT - Paragraph practice

INSTRUCTIONS: Choose one of the topics below. Use Google Docs to write
a paragraph of 8-10 sentences. Start with a clear topic sentence with a specific controlling
idea. Then add meaningful supporting sentences that explain the topic sentence. Finish your
paragraph with a concluding sentence that wraps it up. Follow the formatting on the
previous page. When you are finished, share your Google Doc with your teacher.

Choose one of these topics:
      Describe an interesting neighbor you have had.
      Describe something you could never give away.
      Describe a place you will never forget.

          The supporting sentences add specific supporting details.
          The final sentence makes the paragraph feel complete and finished.
          The sentences are in a logical order, and the information flows well.
          Grammar errors are not distracting or confusing.
          Mechanical errors (spelling, punctuation, capitalization) are not distracting or
          confusing.
          The paragraph follows the formatting on the previous page.
          The paragraph has 8-10 sentences.

                                            Something I Could Never Give Away
             There are many possessions that are special to me and that I could never give
      away, but one of the most special is my family photo album. This photo album is filled
      with pictures of my family and friends, and it helps me to remember all of the special
      moments and events that we have shared together. One of my favorite photographs in
      the album is a picture of my family on vacation at the beach. We are all smiling and
      happy, and the sun is shining bright in the background. Each time I flip through the
      pages of my photo album, I am reminded of the love and joy that surrounds me. The
      photo album is more than just a collection of pictures. It is a collection of memories
      and a way for me to hold onto the past. It helps me to remember the good times and
      the people who are important to me. I could never give it away because it is too special
      to me and it holds a special place in my heart.

GRAMMAR: PARTS OF SPEECH

Before we start to write essays, it's important to think about
the parts of a sentence. Why? Well, good essays need good
paragraphs, and good paragraphs need good sentences.
Knowing the parts of sentences will help you to understand
your teacher's feedback about grammar. Another benefit is
that it helps to know these words so that you can also
search online to find more information about grammar.
This skill makes you a more independent learner who can
answer your own grammar questions.

Sentences have two kinds of words:
      content words (words that make meaning)
      function words (words that make structure)

 EXERCISE 13

A. Content words

INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the bolded words in each group below. Decide which group contains
countable nouns, non-countable nouns, verbs, modals, adjectives, or adverbs.

1)___________________          4) ___________________
a smiling woman                The man is smiling.
a good movie                   Who saw a good movie?
an educated child              We have educated ourselves.

2) ___________________         5) ___________________
How much work is there?        Unfortunately, I can't.
I need some help.              He sometimes comes early.
Would you like sugar?          The police can drive fast!

3) ___________________         6) ___________________
Parents shouldn't spank.       ESOL students are hardworking.
Animals can feel and think.    There are many assignments.
The climate might get warmer.  How many times did it happen?

B. Function words

INSTRUCTIONS: Match the function words with their name; then answer the extra question(s).

____1. in, of, about, between  a. Articles (Which are definite and which are indefinite?)
____2. the, a, an              b. Prepositions (Which show time? Which show places?)
____3. she, him, my            c. Conjunctions (FANBOYS: What are F, N, O, and Y?)
____4. and, but, so            d. Pronouns (Which are subjects? objects? possessives?)

C. In the southern parts of the U.S., the climate is usually  N = noun
     warmer and wetter.                                       Prep = preposition
                                                              Pro = pronoun
                                                              V = verb

GRAMMAR: SENTENCE TYPES

English has four types of sentences: simple, compound, complex and compound-complex. In
this course, we will focus on just the first three. It's important to understand sentence types
because good writers use a variety of sentence types to make their writing more interesting.

 SIMPLE SENTENCES

Simple sentences contain one subject/verb pair and
express a complete thought. For example:

          Sara sang at the concert last night.

However, a simple sentence may contain more than one
subject, as in the following example.

          My wife and I got married in Japan.

Simple sentences may also contain more than one verb as in the next example.

          The child cut his hand and cried loudly.

Likewise, simple sentences can have two objects with certain verbs.

          The students study English and math.

 EXERCISE 15

INSTRUCTIONS: Here are some other examples of simple sentences and their subject/verb
patterns. Circle the subject and underline the verbs in the sentences below. (The number of
subjects and verbs is given in the parentheses.)

     1. The movie wasn't very interesting. (subject, verb)
     2. My friends and I disliked the movie. (subject, subject, verb)
     3. My friends and I cooked and ate the meal together. (subject, subject, verb, verb)
     4. I might watch TV or read a book after dinner. (subject, verb, verb)

Amalgamation - Unit 1: Moving From Paragraphs to Essays  18
 COMPOUND SENTENCES

Compound sentences have two simple sentences
joined together by a comma and a coordinating
conjunction. There are seven coordinating conjunctions:
for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so (often called FANBOYS). Use a
comma before a coordinating conjunction that joins
two simple sentences.

NOTE: Do not be confused between a coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence and
a compound verb in a simple sentence. Study the following examples carefully. We saw in
Exercise 12 how there can be compound subjects.

          My friend plays the guitar and writes music.

This is a simple sentence with a subject (friend) and a compound verb (plays/ writes).

          My friend plays the guitar, and he writes music.

This is a compound sentence -- two simple sentences joined by a comma and a
coordinating conjunction. The subject of the first simple sentence is friend and the verb is
plays. The subject of the second simple sentence is he and the verb is writes. Notice the
comma. You always need a comma when using a coordinating conjunction and a second
complete sentence.

Some FANBOYS are used commonly (and, but, so), while others are used less often. Here are
the meanings of some of the less common coordinating conjunctions:

      for = similar meaning to because or since; it introduces a reason
      yet = similar meaning to but at the same time or but nevertheless
      nor = not; often used with neither

 EXERCISE 16

INSTRUCTIONS: Join these two complete sentences together with a coordinating conjunction
(FANBOYS) to make a compound sentence. Remember to use a comma!

     1. We wanted to give a presentation on Monday. The weather delayed it for two days.
     2. We could go camping for vacation. We could go to the beach for vacation.
     3. I want to get a better job. I am taking courses at night.
     4. I've got to get this paper done. I have class in ten minutes.
     5. My teacher said I should study more. My spouse agreed.
     6. I do not want this. I do not want that.
     7. I want to go to the party. I feel I shouldn't because I wasn't invited.

Amalgamation - Unit 1: Moving From Paragraphs to Essays  19
 COMPLEX SENTENCES

Complex sentences contain clauses. Clauses are
groups of words that contain subjects and verbs.
There are two types:

      independent (main) clauses
      dependent (subordinate) clauses

An independent clause, in addition to containing a
subject and verb, expresses a complete thought. It
can stand alone as a simple sentence. It doesn't need
anything more. That's why it is called "independent."

A dependent clause, however, needs something
more. By itself, it is just part of a sentence or
fragment. It must be joined to an independent clause.
It depends on something else to make sense to the reader.

In this course, you will study the three types of dependent clauses in English:
      adjective clauses (groups of words with a subject and a verb; together they describe
          nouns)
      adverb clauses (groups of words with a subject and a verb; together they describe
          verbs and adjectives)
      noun clauses (groups of words with a subject and a verb; together they work as
          nouns)

When you join dependent and independent clauses together, you create complex sentences.

Amalgamation - Unit 1: Moving From Paragraphs to Essays  20
 Complex sentence using a dependent adjective clause

 The adjective clauses that we will study start with who, that, where, which, and whose.

                           Example                                     Explanation
                                               independent clause or simple sentence
Vancouver has many interesting places to
shop.                                          dependent adjective clause

which is the largest city in British Columbia

                                          Complex Sentence

                Vancouver, which is the largest city in British Columbia,
                             has many interesting places to shop.

                           Example                                     Explanation
The person does not have auto insurance.       independent clause or simple sentence

who hit my car                                 dependent adjective clause

                                            Complex Sentence
                The person who hit my car does not have auto insurance.

Remember:
      An adjective clause always comes after the noun that it describes.
      Use commas when it adds extra information. Do not use commas when the new
          information is essential or necessary.
      Never use that inside an adjective clause with commas.

 Complex sentence using a dependent adverb clause of time or
condition

 Adverb clauses of time usually start with words like when, as soon as, if, until, unless,
 before, and while.

                           Example                                 Explanation
I will tell her the news.                  independent clause or simple sentence

as soon as I see her                       dependent adverb clause of time

                                       Complex Sentence

                      I will tell her the news as soon as I see her.
                      As soon as I see her, I will tell her the news.

                           Example                                 Explanation
The students will take the test tomorrow.  independent clause or simple sentence

unless the weather is bad                  dependent adverb clause of condition

                                   Complex Sentence

The students will take the test tomorrow unless the weather is bad.
Unless the weather is bad, the students will take the test tomorrow.

Remember:
      When the dependent clause is first, we use a comma.
      We don't use a comma when the dependent clause is last.

 Complex sentence using a dependent adverb clause of
reason (cause), result (effect), or contrast/concession

 This diverse group of adverb clauses usually start with words like because, although,
 even though, as, and whereas.

                           Example                                  Explanation
I went to bed early.                        independent clause or simple sentence

because I was tired.                        dependent adverb clause of reason

                                    Complex Sentence

                      I went to bed early because I was tired.
                      Because I was tired, I went to bed early.

                           Example                                  Explanation
My neighbors threw a loud party last week.  independent clause or simple sentence

even though I asked them not to             dependent adverb of contrast/concession

                                          Complex Sentence

Even though I asked them not to, my neighbors threw a loud party last week.
My neighbors threw a loud party last week even though I asked them not to.

Remember:
      When the dependent clause is first, we use a comma.
      We don't use a comma when the dependent clause is last.

 Complex sentence using a dependent noun clause

 This diverse group of noun clauses usually start with words that look like questions, but do
 not have the same word order as questions: who, what, where, when, why, where, etc.

                 Example                                         Explanation
                                         independent clause or simple sentence
I already know.

what you said                            dependent noun clause

                                 Complex Sentence
                          I already know what you said.

                 Example                                         Explanation
                                         independent clause or simple sentence
Tim taught me.
                                         dependent noun clause
when to use noun clauses in my writing.

                                           Complex Sentence
                 Tim taught me when to use noun clauses in my writing.

Remember:
      Noun clauses can do any job that a noun does: subject, object of a verb, object of a
          preposition, or subject complement. However, the most common job is as an object of
          the verb. Examples:
                            I want to know what you said. (object of the verb)
                            What you said hurt my feelings. (subject of the verb)
                            I probably disagree with what you said. (object of the preposition)
                            Lies are what you said. (subject complement)

WHAT IS AN ESSAY?

An essay is a collection of paragraphs. If you can write a really well-organized paragraph,
then you can probably write a fantastic essay because paragraphs and essays do similar
things. Just as there are three parts of a paragraph that have a specific job, each paragraph
in an essay also has a special role.

 EXERCISE 18

INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the diagram below. How are parts of a paragraph similar to or
different from parts of an essay?

The topic sentence of a paragraph is similar to _______________________ of an essay.
          What's different?

Supporting sentences of a paragraph are similar to _______________________ of an essay.
          What's different?

The conclusion sentence of a paragraph is similar to _______________________ of an essay.
          What's different?

 INTRODUCTION PARAGRAPHS

The first paragraph in an essay is called the introduction. Introduction paragraphs have three
important parts:

      hook - something interesting that gets the reader's attention
      background information - helps the reader understand the essay
      thesis statement (with topic and claim) - tells the reader the subject and what the

          writer wants to say about the topic

In a basic essay, the introduction paragraph is often compared to a funnel. This is because
the first few sentences are more general and each following sentence becomes more and
more specific with details, facts, examples, and explanations until the reader reaches the
thesis statement. The thesis statement is the most narrow and specific sentence.

 EXERCISE 19

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the paragraph below. Then label each part of the paragraph.

1. What is the writer's feeling about the four stages of culture shock?
2. Can you guess what the writer will explain in the body paragraphs?
3. How many body paragraphs would you expect in this essay?

Amalgamation - Unit 1: Moving From Paragraphs to Essays                  27
 EXERCISE 20

INSTRUCTIONS: Decide whether each hook below
is strong or weak; explain why.

     1. In this essay, I will write about pets.
     2. When you compare TikTok and YouTube, you

          actually learn a lot about internet privacy.
     3. Technology has evolved since humans began

          using it millions of years ago.
     4. Wikipedia says that January comes after

          February in 2023.
     5. One October night, I learned the lesson of my

          life.
     6. Up to 48 animals have been saved from extinction, according to a new study from

          South University.
     7. When you told me to write about the internet, all I could think about was social media.
     8. Why would anyone want to travel to the moon?
     9. You might think you know all about Portland, but some historical details will shock you.

 EXERCISE 21

INSTRUCTIONS: Read each thesis statement. Is it OK? Or is something missing? If something is
missing, can you rewrite it?

     1. Three important things show that Portland and Seattle are very different cities.
     2. Oregon is a state.
     3. They are very useful for international students who study in the United States.
     4. The process of decorating a cake.
     5. A difficult choice.

If you are confused or unsure, don't worry! We'll practice these things more
and more as we write paragraphs and essays all term.

Amalgamation - Unit 1: Moving From Paragraphs to Essays  28
 BODY PARAGRAPHS

Introduction paragraphs are different from the typical paragraph structure because they
have a hook and a thesis statement. Body paragraphs, however, are just normal paragraphs
with a topic sentence, supporting sentences, and a concluding sentence. However, each
body paragraph must connect directly to the thesis statement. In other words, it must help to
explain the author's point.

 EXERCISE 22

INSTRUCTIONS: Read these body paragraphs for an essay about culture shock. Make notes:
Underline the topic sentence of each paragraph. Then look at the concluding sentences.
What connections do you see?

                   Culture shock begins with the "honeymoon stage." This is the period of time when a
        person first arrives in which everything about the new culture is strange and exciting. In this
        stage, students may be suffering from "jet lag," but they are thrilled to be in the new
        environment, seeing new sights, hearing new sounds and language, and eating new kinds of
        food. This honeymoon stage can last for quite a long time because students feel they are
        involved in some kind of great adventure. It's easy to understand why this period of time is
        called a honeymoon.

                   Unfortunately, the second stage of culture shock can be more difficult. After a student
        has settled down into his or her new life, working or studying, buying groceries, doing laundry,
        or living with a homestay family, they can become very tired and begin to miss their home
        countries and their family, girlfriend/boyfriend, and pets. Another issue is that all the little
        problems in life seem to be much bigger and more upsetting in the foreign culture. This
        period of cultural adjustment can be very difficult and lead to the new arrival rejecting or
        pulling away from the new culture. This "rejection stage" can be quite dangerous because the
        visitor may develop unhealthy habits (smoking and drinking too much, being too concerned
        over food or contact with people from the new culture). This stage is also considered a crisis
        in the process of cultural adjustment. As a result, many people choose to go back to their
        homeland or spend all their time with people from their own culture, speaking their native
        language. Sadly, experiencing problems and engaging in negative behavior during this stage
        can negatively impact a student's success in school.

                   The third stage of culture shock is called the "adjustment stage". If a person makes it
        past the challenges of the second stage, this is the part in the process when they begin to
        realize that things are not so bad in the new host culture. One thing that can help is the
        student's sense of humor. Another thing that can help is when students realize that they are
        becoming stronger by learning to take care of themselves in the new place. Things are still
        difficult, but the student is now a survivor. It's likely now that the learner will succeed and
        move on to the next stage.

                   The fourth stage can be called "at ease at last". Now the student feels quite
        comfortable in the new surroundings. They have learned to cope with most problems that
        occur, especially if they have developed the language skills they need to clearly communicate
        their needs. Students may still have problems with the language, but they are strong enough
        to deal with it or find a resource to help them if they can't resolve the issue. They don't feel
        afraid that they will be judged or hurt by others. In this stage, if a student meets someone
        from their country who has just arrived, they can be the expert on life in the new culture and
        help the new student to deal with their own culture shock.

                                                A good conclusion paragraph does at least three things:

                                                     1. restates the main idea from the thesis statement
                                                     2. summarizes the main points from the body

                                                                 paragraphs
                                                     3. offers a final thought, which could:

                                                                a. give advice or a suggestion about the topic
                                                                            to the reader

                                                                b. make a prediction or offer hope for the future
                                                                c. give the writer's opinion about the topic

                                                      NOTE: Do not include any new information in the
                                                      conclusion. That belongs in a body paragraph.

 EXERCISE 23

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the conclusion paragraph from the essay about culture shock. Then
answer the questions that follow.

                     1 International students who stay in a new country for a while can expect to go
          through the whole process of culture shock from the "honeymoon" stage to the "at ease
          stage". 2.Though sometimes the process can repeat with each new experience. 3. Each
          stage has different effects that include a range of emotions, from excitement to frustration
          and even depression. 4. However, if a student takes the time to recognize the predictable
          pattern of behavior and emotions that people experiencing culture shock go through, they
          can easily find ways to overcome any negative emotions.

          Write the number of the sentence that...
                     ___ restates the main idea from the thesis statement
                     ___ summarizes the main points from the body paragraphs
                     ___ends with a final thought

          Choose the type of final thought you think this sentence uses:
                     gives advice or a suggestion about the topic to the reader
                     makes a prediction or offer hope for the future
                     give the writer's feelings or opinion about the topic

 EXERCISE 24

INSTRUCTIONS: Read this short essay called "Effects of Stress". Add a concluding paragraph
that restates the thesis, summarizes the main points of each body paragraph, and leaves
the reader with a final thought about the topic.

                                                               Effects of Stress

                   There is a famous expression in English: "Stop the world, I want to get off!"
         This expression refers to a feeling of panic, or stress, that makes a person want
         to stop whatever they are doing, try to relax, and become calm again. 'Stress'
         means pressure or tension. It is one of the most common causes of health
         problems in modern life. Too much stress results in physical, emotional, and
         mental health problems.

                   There are numerous physical effects of stress. Stress can affect the heart.
         It can increase the pulse rate, make the heart miss beats, and can cause high
         blood pressure. Stress can affect the respiratory system. It can lead to asthma.
         It can cause a person to breathe too fast, resulting in a loss of important carbon
         dioxide. Stress can affect the stomach. It can cause stomach aches and
         problems digesting food. These are only a few examples of the wide range of
         illnesses and symptoms resulting from stress.

                   Emotions are also easily affected by stress. People suffering from stress
         often feel anxious. They may have panic attacks. They may feel tired all the
         time. When people are under stress, they often overreact to little problems. For
         example, a normally gentle parent under a lot of stress at work may yell at a
         child for dropping a glass of juice. Stress can make people angry, moody, or
         nervous.

                   Long-term stress can lead to a variety of serious mental illnesses.
         Depression, an extreme feeling of sadness and hopelessness, can be the result
         of continued and increasing stress. Alcoholism and other addictions often
         develop as a result of the overuse of alcohol or drugs to try to relieve stress.
         Eating disorders, such as anorexia, are sometimes caused by stress and are
         often made worse by stress. If stress is allowed to continue, then one's mental
         health is put at risk.

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the paragraphs below and choose the best transition word from each
pair of suggestions.

     1. A dog is completely dependent on its owner for all its needs, including the need
          for good health and a safe environment. [Therefore, / As a result,] being
          responsible for a dog also means taking care of the dog so that it stays
          healthy. [Furthermore, / However,] the owner must take responsibility for the
          safety of the dog and the safety of the people it comes into contact with.

     2. Most people go through a lot of planning when they buy a house.
          [Therefore, / Besides] finding financial support, they also need

conclusion.

      In your introduction paragraph, include an interesting hook, background information,
          and a clear thesis statement with both a topic and claim.

      Start the body paragraph with a clear topic sentence. Add supporting sentences to
          explain the topic sentence.

      In the conclusion paragraph, remind your readers of your thesis and purpose.
          Summarize your main points. Give your readers a sense that the story is done.

Format

                                                  My Collection of Memories
                 Many possessions are special to me, but one of the most special is my family
      photo album. This photo album is filled with pictures of my family and friends, and it
      helps me to remember all of the special moments and events that we have shared
      together. However, my family photo album is more than a collection of pictures. It is
      really a collection of memories and a way for me to hold onto the past. That's why I
      could never give it away.
                 My family photo album helps me to remember the good times and the people
      who are important to me. For example, there is a picture of my entire family around
      the dinner table. The day is a special holiday in my culture. Everyone is laughing and
      chatting as we enjoy a delicious meal together. This picture brings me memories of
      the happiness that my family and I shared on that special day. The photo album
      captures all of these special moments and memories that we have shared together.
      There are photos from vacations, holiday celebrations, and other special occasions.
      Since I now live in a di erent country, this album is a way to feel close to the people
      who are far away.
                 Another reason that my family photo album is so special to me is because it is a
      source of inspiration and motivation. When I look at the pictures, I am reminded of all
      of the amazing things that I have experienced. It motivates me to create new

memories and experiences in the future. For example, there is a picture of my friends
and me at a music festival. The photo shows us dancing and having a great time. I look
at the photo, and I immediately smile. This picture reminds me of the fun and
freedom that I felt at that moment. I don't want to forget that. It inspires me to seek
out new adventures and experiences in the future. The photo album inspires me to
appreciate the present. I always remember to make the most of every opportunity that
comes my way.

          In conclusion, my family photo album is a possession that is very special to
me. I could never give it away. The photo album is a collection of memories and a
source of inspiration and motivation. Every time I look at the pictures, I am reminded
of the love and joy that surrounds me. My family photo album is something that I will
always treasure and keep close to my heart.

 CHOOSING A TOPIC

Narrative paragraphs and essays tell stories. Before you start, you need to choose a topic.
What will your story be about? Exercise 2 gives you four different topics (we call them "writing
prompts"). You'll choose one. First you'll write a paragraph, and then later you'll use that
paragraph to write an essay.

 EXERCISE 2

INSTRUCTIONS: Rank the writing prompts below. 1 = most interesting; 4 = least interesting.

____ A. Write about a time in your life when you solved a problem or overcame a major
          challenge at work, at school, in a specific place (like a hospital, a grocery store, a hotel,
          a city) or in a personal relationship.

____ B. Write about a person outside of your family who has made a meaningful difference in
          your life in some way.

____ C. Write about an experience you had while traveling and how you feel it changed you.
          You can write about any kind of trip away from home, near or far.

____ D. Write about a time that you failed to do something that was important to you, whether
          in school, at home, at work or with your friends. How did you react to that failure? Did
          anything positive come out of it? What?

 BRAINSTORMING WITH A MIND MAP

A mind map is a visual way to brainstorm a topic. It is different from just making a list of ideas
because it helps you to break a topic into parts. You can see relationships between the
different pieces of the whole topic.

 EXERCISE 3

INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the mind map below. Which topic do you think this student has
chosen to write about?

Amalgamation - Unit 2: Telling a Compelling Story  4
 EXERCISE 4

INSTRUCTIONS: Use the mind map outline below to brainstorm ideas for the prompt you
chose to write about. For the section on plot, just focus on the main events and don't worry
about the details.

Amalgamation - Unit 2: Telling a Compelling Story                                             5
 NARROWING A TOPIC

Your first goal is to only write one paragraph about this event. This means you need to focus
on the most important parts. Look at the brainstorm again and notice what parts of the story
this writer decided to omit (leave out).

 EXERCISE 5

INSTRUCTIONS: Go back to your brainstorm on the previous page and narrow your topic. Find
elements of the story that make it difficult to explain in only one paragraph. Draw a single line
through them. Don't erase or black out any of your ideas-you might use them later!

PARAGRAPH PREPARATION

This is a good time to practice writing a paragraph using the ideas that
we have discussed.

ASSIGNMENT - Paragraph preparation

INSTRUCTIONS: You chose a topic. You brainstormed with a mind map.
Now write a rough draft of a paragraph. Remember to start with a clear topic sentence with
a specific controlling idea. Then add meaningful supporting sentences that explain the topic
sentence. Finish your paragraph with a concluding sentence that wraps it up. This is a first
draft - a place to start. You will be able to rewrite this paragraph in the next assignment
before your teacher evaluates it.

WHAT IS NARRATIVE WRITING?

A narrative is simply a story, and the purpose of narrative writing is to tell stories. Any time you
tell a story to a friend or family member about an event or incident in your day, you are doing
a form of narration. In addition, a narrative can be factual or fictional. A factual story is one
that is based on actual events from real life. A fictional story is a story that is made up from
your imagination; in this kind of narrative, the writer of a fictional story can create characters
and events..

The main difference between factual and fictional narratives is based on the writer's purpose.
The writers of factual stories try to retell the events as they actually happened. Writers of
fictional stories create the characters, setting, and plot in order to tell the story. Biographies
are examples of factual stories, whereas novels are examples of fictional stories.

Why is this an important skill to learn? Sometime in your life, perhaps at work, at school, or
even in a court of law, you may be required to write this way. For example:

     a first-person essay about your achievements for a scholarship application
     a second-person letter of complaint to a company about a time when you were

          treated unfairly

     a third-person narrative report for your boss about a problem on the job

 POINT OF VIEW

Every story has a point of view. In your first paragraph, the story is probably told from your
point of view because you are the narrator. This narrative point of view is called "first person."
There are several other points of view that writers can use in narrative writing. When a writer
chooses a point of view, there are many things to consider:

      Who is your audience? In other words, who will read your writing?
      What is the purpose of your writing? Is it to inform, persuade, or entertain?

 EXERCISE 6

INSTRUCTIONS: Use the picture to answer the questions below.

  What's the setting?
  Who are the characters?
  Through whose eyes are you

      looking at the events in the
      room?
  How do you think this person
      feels about what's happening?
  What do you think the story will
      be?

Amalgamation - Unit 2: Telling a Compelling Story  8
 Pronouns to show point of view

Narrative stories can be told from many points of view. To write in a way that is clear and
easily understood by the writer, it is important not to change the point of view without a good
reason. It is important to keep using the same pronouns to match the point of view.

 EXERCISE 7

INSTRUCTIONS: Complete the chart below with the correct form of the pronouns.

                           SINGULAR PRONOUNS

        Subject    Object  Possessive                      Possessive  Reflexive

* "they" can also be used for third person singular. We'll talk more about this later in this unit.

        Amalgamation - Unit 2: Telling a Compelling Story                         9
 EXERCISE 8

INSTRUCTIONS: Use the correct form of the pronoun for each point of view.

1. First person

                     __I_ am so tired. ____ stayed up late trying to do ____ homework, and then
          ____ parents started fighting, so it was difficult to go to sleep because they were
          yelling so loudly. ____ really hate it when ____ parents fight. ____ sometimes
          wonder if they even care about ____ or ____ feelings. Other times, _____ blame
          _____ for their fights because they sometimes fight over questions I ask. Still this
          family is _____ -- it's the only family _____ have and _____ love them.

2. Second person

                     _You_ look out into the classroom and see some of ____ students doing
          disrespectful things. One student that ____ see is sleeping. At first, ____
          get angry. Then, ____suddenly realize that she might be sick or have problems
          at home. As soon as ____think of this, ____ feel bad for getting angry.
          ____ remind _____ that ____ always need to consider that something else may be
          causing the problem with ____ students' behavior. ____ promise to always ask:
          is the problem theirs or ____?

3. Third person + verbs

Now, change the 2nd person text (2. above) to third person. Also, add the verbs back into the
story. Use singular pronouns and keep the story in the present (don't change to the past).

                     ____ ____ out into the classroom and ____ some of ____ students doing
          disrespectful things. One student that ____ ____ is sleeping. At first, ____ ____
          angry. Then, ____suddenly _____ that the student might be sick or have problems
          at home. As soon as ____ ____ of this, ____ ____ bad for getting angry. ____
          _____ _____ that ____ always ____ to consider that something else may be
          causing the problem with ____ students' behavior. ____ ____ to always ask:
          is the problem theirs or ____?

A special note about academic writing (writing in college)
In academic writing, writers usually use third person to write about a topic in a way that is not
personal. However, a college or university may ask for a personal essay written in first person
as part of the application process. Also, your instructors may ask you to write personal essays
in order to reflect on or explain your reaction to some class activities or your learning process
during a course. Second-person point of view are usually used in fictional, instructional, and
less formal writing. Third-person point of view is used in both fictional writing and formal,
academic writing. Remember: The choice depends on your audience, your purpose, and your
style!

Amalgamation - Unit 2: Telling a Compelling Story  10
 Pronoun agreement

Pronouns must agree with the words that they replace. They must agree in gender, number,
and point of view. Remember that you must use "third person -s" with present tense verbs of
third person pronouns. For example: She looks / He sees / It helps. This is called subject-verb
agreement.

A special note about "they"
One pronoun that has flexible grammar is the pronoun "they". In the tables on page 9, you
might have noticed that they, their, them, themselves are generally used as third person
plural. However, these forms are not only for plural pronouns. They can also be third person
singular! This may be new to you because older textbooks did not show the way we really use
these words. However, nowadays it is normal and accepted to do this.

Three different situations where we use 'they' for one person:
      You don't know the person's gender.
      The person's gender doesn't matter or you don't want to reveal it.
      The person's gender is nonbinary1.

Example: Someone tells you they have a child. You could ask, 'How old are they?' without
needing to first ask about the child's gender. The grammar for "they" is the same (use `are'),
but the meaning is not plural. You are only talking about one child.

Problems with pronoun agreement
A common grammatical error that writers make is called a point of view shift. A point of view
shift occurs when a story begins in one point of view, such as first person (I, my, me), and then
later the writer accidentally shifts to second- or third-person point of view.

 EXERCISE 9

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the following paragraph carefully. Look for shifts in point of view. Can
you find seven mistakes? (Remember to correct the pronoun and, when necessary, its verb.)

                     Over spring break, I visited my older cousin, Diana, and she took me to a
          butterfly exhibit at a museum. Diana and I have been close ever since she was
          young. Our mothers are twin sisters, and she is inseparable! Diana knows how
          much I love butterflies, so it was their special present to me. I have a soft spot
          for caterpillars, too. I love them because something about the way it transforms
          is so interesting to me. One summer, my grandmother gave me a butterfly
          growing kit, and you got to see the entire life cycle of five painted lady
          butterflies. I even got to set it free. So when my cousin said they wanted to take
          me to the butterfly exhibit, I was really excited!

1 Nonbinary gender means not one gender or the other -- not only a woman, not only a man. Maybe neither, maybe
both, maybe in between, maybe third gender, maybe 'neutral' gender, or maybe something else.

PARAGRAPH PRACTICE

Let's continue working on our narrative paragraph with special attention
to audience, purpose, and point of view.

ASSIGNMENT - Paragraph practice

INSTRUCTIONS: Start with the paragraph that you wrote in class at the
beginning of this unit. Rewrite the same paragraph in three ways:

      first person (I, me, my, we, us, ours)
      second person (you)
      third person (he, she, they, it)

Use Google Docs to write three versions of the same paragraph. Each paragraph should
have at least 8 sentences. Each paragraph will have a different point of view (perspective).
That means that each paragraph will use different pronouns. Pay attention to subject-verb
agreement, too

Start each paragraph with a clear topic sentence with a specific controlling idea. Then add
meaningful supporting sentences that explain the topic sentence. Finish your paragraph with
a concluding sentence that wraps it up. Use the same formatting as Unit 1. When you are
finished, share your Google Doc with your teacher.

This is how your teacher will evaluate your work (1 point each; total 8 points):
          The topic sentence has a clear topic and controlling idea.
          The supporting sentences add specific supporting details.
          The final sentence makes the paragraph feel complete and finished.
          The sentences are in a logical order, and the information flows well.
          Grammar errors are not distracting or confusing.
          Mechanical errors (spelling, punctuation, capitalization) are not distracting or
          confusing.
          Each paragraph follows the formatting from Unit 1 and has at least 8 sentences.
          The content of the paragraph tells a complete story using elements of characters,
          setting, plot, and conflict.

GRAMMAR: SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

 SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

Narrative writing is usually written in chronological order. In other words, stories typically have
a beginning, a middle, and an end. The events in the story are typically organized by time.
One thing happens. Then another thing happens. Certain transitional words and phrases
help to keep both the reader and writer clear about when things happen in the story.

 EXERCISE 10

A. General setting
     INSTRUCTIONS: Combine words on the left with words on the right to make common
     time phrases.

 PAST TENSE FORMS FOR NARRATIVES

Narrative tenses are verb tenses used for telling stories. If a story is in the past, then the writer
uses a range of past tense verb forms to tell the story. There are four past narrative tenses:

  Verb tense                How it's used                          How it's formed
Past simple
               I had an accident on Tuesday.    Affirmative: -ed or irregular
               I slipped and fell in the mud.   Question: auxiliary verb + base form
               Did you have an accident?        Negative: auxiliary verb + no + base form
               It didn't rain all night.

Past           I was walking home late at       was / were + (not) + present participle
continuous             night.                   (Ving)
(Progressive)
               Was he walking home?
               You weren't walking home.

Past perfect   I had chosen the wrong shoes     had + (not) + past participle (V3)
                       that morning.

               Had she worn the right shoes?
               He hadn't considered the
               weather.

Past perfect   It had been raining for eight    had + (not) + been + present participle
continuous             hours earlier that day.  (Ving)
(Progressive)
               Had it been raining all day?
               It hadn't been raining for too
               long when I left.

INSTRUCTIONS: Find two examples of each of these verb forms for each of the tenses in the
sentences above.

        Past Simple

        A future form used
        in the past
        Past continuous

        Past perfect

Focus on use and meaning
INSTRUCTIONS: Remember, all stories have a beginning, middle, and end (a general time
frame). Which past tense verb forms can be used to ...

___________________________  describe the main events of the story

___________________________  describe the background events during the time
___________________________  of the story
___________________________
                             describe events that happened before the time
                             of the story or before other main events in the
                             story

                             describe events that happened after the time of
                             the story but still in the past from now

 PAST TENSE TIME ADVERB CLAUSES WITH SUBORDINATING CONJUNCTIONS

Another way that you can make the sequence of events clearer and more interesting for the
reader is to use subordinating conjunctions to make adverb clauses of time. An adverb
clause of time shows when something happens. Adverb clauses of time usually start with
subordinating conjunctions like since, when, as soon as, until, unless, before, after, while, and
as.

 EXERCISE 14

INSTRUCTIONS: Use one of the subordinating conjunctions (since, when, as soon as, until,
unless, before, after, while, as) to connect the example sentences in the chart below.

Main                            Subordinating  Dependent
clause                          conjunction    adverb clause

 EXERCISE 15

A. INSTRUCTIONS: While there are many possible ways to complete the sentences below,
change one of the verbs to past simple or to past continuous tense to show which events
are background or main events. Then join the two sentences with because, when or while.

                1. My classmate ______________ (give) me a ride ______________ it
                     ______________ (rain) very heavily.

                2. My brother ______________ (arrive) ______________ my parents and I
                     ______________ (still have) dinner last night.

                3. I ______________ (work) a summer job in a restaurant ______________ I
                     ______________ (meet) my future husband.

                4. The police ______________ (stop) him ______________ he ______________
                     (drive) too fast on a neighborhood street.

                5. It ______________ (snow) ______________ I ______________ (look) out of the
                     window last night.

B. INSTRUCTIONS: First, match the two sentence halves. Then, decide which verb is best as
past simple and which verb should be past perfect. Use any conjunction you'd like to
connect the two sentences and write them in the spaces below.

1. She (speak) Spanish really well     A. she (live) in the same house all r helife.
2. I (leave) my umbrella at home       B. they (be) nervous when they got on the plane.

GRAMMAR: ADJECTIVES AND ADVERBS

 ADDING DESCRIPTION TO A NARRATIVE

So far, you have chosen a topic, brainstormed it, and reviewed past tense forms, and
practiced using some of the time phrases and adverb clauses that will help to sequence your
narrative. Now, it is time to add descriptions to your narrative! Two key parts of speech that
help add interesting description are adjectives and adverbs.

 EXERCISE 16

INSTRUCTIONS: Circle the adjectives and underline all the adverbs in the sentences below.

     1. As he walked, he looked carefully at the thin ice in front of him.
     2. While waiting to pick up a close friend recently at Union Station, I was reminded of an

          unforgettable train trip.
     3. The days were warm, but the nights were rather cold.
     4. Unfortunately, illness has always been a problem for traveling people.
     5. The Student Leader Club is a great way to meet friendly and motivated students; I go

          there quite frequently.

Adverbs

Adverbs can play many different roles in describing a verb. They can describe the frequency,
manner, degree, place, and time, as well as express our attitude or opinions about those
actions. Here is a list of adverbs that are especially helpful for writing narratives.

 Frequency    Manner            Degree     Place                   Time      Attitude
(How often?)  (In what            (How  (Where?)                 (When?)     (opinion)
                                much?)
               way?)
                            much
sometimes     accidentally  very        everywhere               just        fortunately
seldom        suddenly                  here                     previously  hopefully
                                                                 yesterday   obviously

 EXERCISE 17

INSTRUCTIONS: Look back at sentences in Exercise 16. Classify each of the adverbs
and add them to the chart above. Can you add any other examples?

              Amalgamation - Unit 2: Telling a Compelling Story                           22
Forming Adverbs

Adverbs are usually made from adjectives by adding the suffix -ly.

            Adjective                        Adverb                                     Examples
beautiful                  beautifully
warm                       warmly                                         The garden is beautiful.
happy                      happily                                        Ann sings beautifully.

                                                                          The room is warm.
                                                                          Joe smiles warmly.

                                                                          I am happy.
                                                                          I will happily help you today.

Here are the spelling rules for forming adverbs:

  Adjective ending in ...       How to make the adverb                                  Examples
-y                         Change the y to i and add -ly
                                                                          heavy  heavily
anything else              Just add -ly                                   lazy  lazily

                                                                          nice  nicely
                                                                          loud  loudly

However, there are some important exceptions:

       Adjective                                                     Adverb
good                   well
late                   late ("lately" means recently; it is not the adverb form of late)
early                  early
fast                   fast
hard                   hard ("hardly" means not much; it is not the adverb form of hard)

Also: Some words look like adverbs, but they are not! Some examples are lovely, deadly,
lonely, and friendly.

 EXERCISE 18

INSTRUCTIONS: Circle the correct form of the word, adjective or adverb, that best completes
the text.

                   One day, when I was washing the (dirty / dirtily) dishes, I noticed that the
          water was draining out of the sink much more (slower / slowly) than usual. It
          drained so (slow / slowly) that I went to the store and bought a bottle of
          (specially / special) drain cleaner. I used the drain cleaner and the water
          seemed to drain a little (fastly / faster). However, the following day the drain
          worked even more (slow / slowly). I spent $100 on (different / differently) kinds
          of drain cleaner, but none of them worked (good / well). At this point, I realized I
          couldn't (possible / possibly) fix it myself. I called a plumber to come and fix
          my drain. While he was cutting a small hole, he (accidental / accidentally) cut
          the hot-water pipe. Hot water sprayed over the plumber, onto the floor, behind
          the counters, under the refrigerator! It was a
          (surprising / surprisingly) disaster.

 EXERCISE 19

INSTRUCTIONS: Practice using adverbs that show attitude to add description to these
mini-stories. Use the first sentence to start, then add two more sentences that are
connected to the story using the adverbs.

1. I had been having so many strange dreams every night.
Obviously, _____________________________________________________________________
Unfortunately, _________________________________________________________________

2. I was having trouble making friends at my new school.
Gradually, _____________________________________________________________________
Eventually, _____________________________________________________________________

3. Silence fell across the classroom.
Suddenly, _____________________________________________________________________
Fortunately, ____________________________________________________________________

4. I thought I saw my best friend walking down the street.
Immediately, ____________________________________________________________________
Surprisingly, _____________________________________________________________________

 ADJECTIVES

There are a number of simple and common adjectives: small, yellow, and round. However,
most adjectives are made by adding suffixes to nouns and verbs. A suffix is a group of letters
that have meaning and are added to the end of a word.

 Forming adjectives using -ed and-ing

Many adjectives are formed from verbs. For example, the verb to frighten can be used as an
adjective by adding -ing to make a present participle or -ed to make a past participle.

      The present participle (-ing form of the verb) refers to something or somebody that
          causes the feeling. Example: The frightening dog was barking at my cat.

      The past participle (-ed form of the verb) is used to express how a person is affected
          by something. Example: My frightened cat ran quickly away from the dog.

 EXERCISE 20

A. INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the pictures above. Then use the verb to excite in different adjective
forms (-ing or -ed) to complete each sentence below.

From this point of view:                 From this point of view:
1. The man on the island is __________.  3. The island is __________.
2. The boat in the ocean is __________.  4. The man on the boat is __________.

B. INSTRUCTIONS: Change the verb into the correct form by adding -ing or -ed.

     1. Students sometimes are nervous and ________ when the teacher calls on them. They
          don't want to make an ________ mistake. (embarrass)

     2. The ________ video didn't help me. By the time I left the lesson, I was totally ________ .
          (confuse)

     3. The results of my effort were really terrible and ________ . My ________ boss helped
          me fix the problem.(disappoint)

     4. Grammar and math are often seen as ________ topics, but I was never a ________
          student at PCC. (bore)

     5. The results of the election were ________ to many Americans. Even the media were
          ________ (surprise)

     6. I am completely ________ because of the rainy weather. I always find cloudy skies
          ________. (depress)

Forming adjectives using other suffixes

There are many types of suffixes for forming adjectives. In the following chart, there are some
very commonly used ones along with their meanings.

Amalgamation - Unit 2: Telling a Compelling Story  26
 EXERCISE 21

INSTRUCTIONS: Add the suffix to the root to form adjectives. Then add one more adjective
that uses the same suffix.

 ENHANCING A DESCRIPTION

When you add description to your essay, you want to use adjectives that make the reader
hear, see, smell, taste, and feel the things that you are describing. You want to activate the
reader's senses. Adjectives and adverbs make your writing more interesting and more useful
to your reader.

 EXERCISE 22

INSTRUCTIONS: Think of three adjectives for each noun. Try to appeal to at least three
different senses:

chocolate          _____________  _____________    _____________
the ocean          _____________  _____________    _____________
a little boy       _____________  _____________    _____________
an accident        _____________  _____________    _____________
the grocery store  _____________  _____________    _____________

Finally, in order to make your writing more interesting, try to use specific words. In academic
writing in general, it is important to avoid using empty words like big/small, good/bad, a lot
of, things, stuff, somebody, and anything. These words are common in spoken English, but in
academic writing you want to use the most specific word you can. Look at how this very
simple, general sentence is much more interesting when specific and descriptive words are
added.

      General sentence: We saw some nice things in the shop.

      Specific and focused: We noticed some large, colorful art books arranged neatly on a
          welcoming display table in Powell's Bookstore.

 EXERCISE 23

INSTRUCTIONS: Rewrite the following sentences using adjectives and adverbs.

     1. We ate some good food at a restaurant.

     2. At sunrise, we heard the birds sing.

     3. He was driving a nice-looking car.

     4. The old person walked slowly down the road.

     5. The moon appeared over the tops of the trees.

ORGANIZING A NARRATIVE ESSAY

Your teacher will give you feedback on your narrative paragraph. Then it's time to expand
that paragraph into a full essay. Let's review the important parts of an essay and what they
look like in a narrative essay.

      The introduction paragraph needs a hook to attract the attention of the reader. It also
          needs background information to tell the reader the time and setting of the story. Most
          importantly, the introduction paragraph needs a clear thesis statement to connect
          the reader to the main idea behind the story. The thesis statement should give the
          reader an idea of the purpose of the story: to teach a lesson, to explain a problem, or
          to give the reader enjoyment are just a few reasons why people enjoy narrative
          stories.

      Body paragraphs can be organized in many ways. For example, if your story lasts a
          few days, start a new paragraph for each day. If your story involves traveling from
          place to place, you can start a new paragraph when the characters arrive at a new
          location. It's a good idea to start a new paragraph when something in the story
          changes. Each body paragraph focuses on one idea that supports the thesis
          statement of the essay.

      The conclusion paragraph can bring the reader into the present (after the story), but
          must remind the reader of the main idea of the story again. What should they
          remember about the story? What is your message? The reader should feel they have
          reached the end of the story and that nothing is missing.

Look at how the student expanded their paragraph below into a full essay on the next page.

 MODEL STUDENT PARAGRAPH

            I recently took a trip with my mother to visit my father at a re-education camp in

    northern Vietnam. We traveled by train from Binh Trieu to Hanoi. It was a di cult trip,

    and we had many problems finding the camp. At first, we were told we had to wait three

    days to see my father. I became sick during that time, so my mother asked for an earlier

    visit. When we finally saw my father, he was thin and had darkened skin. It was so

    emotional to see him. We didn't have much time to spend together before we had to go

    back home. After saying goodbye, my mother and I returned home. The trip was hard

    and we were under a lot of stress, but my mom's love for my dad was very strong.

                                                      An Unforgettable Trip
               While waiting to pick up a close friend recently at Union Station, I was reminded
    of an unforgettable train trip that my mother and I took in 1981. We went to visit my
    father, who was living in a re-education camp in northern Vietnam. It was a di cult
    time for us all, and the political situation was terrible. Our trip from Binh Trieu Station to
    my father's camp taught me the strength of my mother's love for my father through
    hard, strange, and stressful times.
               On December 20, my mother and I carefully packed rice, sugar, salt, milk, meat,
    and several kinds of dried fish to take to my father, who was being held in Hanoi. Early
    that morning, we rushed o to Binh Trieu, a small train station near my house in
    southern Vietnam. After buying two tickets, we got on the train, found two seats, and
    stored our luggage. It took us almost four days to get to Hanoi, arriving in the evening.
               When we got to this city, which we had never visited before, we felt like fish out
    of water. After getting o the train, most of the other passengers quickly dispersed
    because they knew exactly where they wanted to go. We, on the other hand, felt lost
    because we didn't know how to get to my father's camp or what transportation we
    should take. Then a man standing beside a motorcycle with a small trailer attached
    came up and asked my mother, "Where are you going?" When my mother explained
    that we were going to visit my father at Hanoi's re-education camp, he smiled and said,

                                                                                                                                  2
"Don't worry." He continued, "I'll take both of you. It takes about two hours." He
helped us put our luggage into the trailer. Finally, we arrived at my father's camp at
midnight, and my mother paid the driver.

          We were taken to a cottage that had no furniture or electricity. There were some
candles burning on the walls. The air in this low-roofed cottage was very humid. Over
thirty people were waiting there to visit husbands, sons, or other relatives. Because of
the long trip, we were quite tired, so we fell asleep on the ground almost immediately.
The next morning, the director of the camp came and told my mother that we had to
wait at least three days to see my father, that we could see him for only one hour, and
that it was an annoyance for him to have to arrange for visits on such short notice.

          My mother and I were deeply disappointed, but we waited and slept in the cottage
without blankets. The evenings were cool and the nights rather cold. As a result, I got
sick, and my mother had to stay up at night to take care of me. My mother expected me
to improve, but I only got worse, so she cried and requested that the director allow us to
visit my father sooner than scheduled. Finally, he reluctantly agreed.

          I had tried to imagine my father's appearance and voice, but it was hard because I
hadn't seen him for eight years. Although I was sick, I sat up in a chair in a small room
beside the cottage waiting with my mother to see my father. At the same time, seven
other women and four other children were sitting around waiting for their relatives.
Everyone was silent; we just looked at each other without talking. Suddenly, the door
opened. Eight men stepped in and sat down face to face with their wives, children, and
friends. At that important moment, my father, who was thin with darkened skin, sat
opposite us. My parents looked at each other but didn't talk for a while. When I looked
around, I saw other people looking at each other without speaking. My parents had tears

in their eyes. My father held and kissed my mother's hand. A little later, my father held
me tightly, kissed me on the forehead, and asked me many everyday questions such as,
"How are you? Have you been good? How is school? What are you doing in your free
time? Did you go somewhere last summer?" He listened to every single answer, touched
my face, and reminded me of something he always included in his letters: "You must
obey your mother and help her in any way you can and not forget to write to me
whenever you have time."

          I was deeply moved by my father's appearance, voice, and words back then. The
visiting hour had gone by so fast that I couldn't believe it. However, I felt very satisfied
and happy to have seen my father. After that, my mother kept visiting my father twice a
year until he was released on June 8, 1987. My family came to the United States in 1993.
Since then, my father has been working for an electric company, and my mother has
been staying home taking care of my father, brother, older sister, and me. I'm often
reminded of our amazing trip and the strength of my parents' love when I look up and
see him eating my mother's cooking with us at the dinner table.

WRITING ASSIGNMENT: ESSAY 2

You studied many things about grammar and essay structure. Now it's
time to put them to work in another essay that builds on the paragraph
you wrote earlier in this unit.

ASSIGNMENT - Narrative essay

INSTRUCTIONS Start with the narrative paragraph that you already wrote. Choose the version
that you like best (first person, second person, or third person). Then expand this paragraph
into a full narrative essay. Follow these guidelines:

      Organize your story with an introduction paragraph, at least one body paragraph for
          each major idea or part of the story, and a conclusion paragraph. You should have
          between 4 and 6 paragraphs.
                 In your introduction, include an interesting hook, background information, and
                     a clear thesis statement that previews your story and gives the reader a sense
                     of purpose. Think about the lesson of the story.
                 Start each body paragraph with a clear topic sentence. Add supporting
                     sentences to explain the topic sentence.
                 In the conclusion paragraph, remind your readers of your thesis and purpose.
                     Give your readers a sense that the story is done.

      Use time words, phrases, and adverb clauses of time to explain when things happen.
      Use appropriate forms of past tense verbs when telling the story. Try to use different

          past forms to make the story come alive or add surprise twists (for example, using
          past perfect to tell about something that happened before).
      Use a variety of sentence types and vocabulary.
      Add description with adverbs and adjectives. Be specific! Don't be vague or
          superficial.

Format

      Type your essay using Google Docs.
      Use Times New Roman 12 point font or something similar.
      Use a margin of one inch on all sides.
      Double-space the lines.
      Use page numbers in the upper right-hand corner.
      Add a header in the upper left-hand corner with your full name, class, assignment,

          and date.
      Add a title, centered at the top of the page.
      Indent each paragraph by using the TAB button on your keyboard (not the spacebar).
      Use your own words. Do not copy from another source. That is plagiarism and results

          in 0 points for this assignment. If you use information from an outside source,
          paraphrase (use your own words) or quote (use exact words inside "quotation
          marks"). Either way, you must say where you found the information.
      Proofread carefully for grammar, capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.

                                                 Seeing a New World
          As I stepped o the bus and walked through the busy streets of the small
African village, I knew that my life was about to change in ways that I could never
have imagined. The people there were kind and welcoming, and I felt a deep sense of
community and connection. My experience in Ethiopia changed my life. It taught me
about the importance of giving back and being grateful for what I have. It opened my
eyes to the world and showed me the beauty and resilience of the human spirit. The
experience gave me a new life.
          One of the ways that my experience in Ethiopia changed me was by helping me
to appreciate the people in my life. The village leaders invited me into their homes
even though we came from di erent cultures and spoke di erent languages. One day,
they shared a traditional meal with me. It included a big piece of injera bread. There
were many kinds of sauces and stews on top of the bread. We ate it together. This
kindness and generosity reminded me of the importance of relationships. We are all
di erent, but we can still find ways to connect with each other and do good things.
          Another way that my experience in Africa changed me was by inspiring me to
make a di erence in the world. I had the opportunity to volunteer at a local school. I
helped teach English to the children. It was interesting to learn how the local language
is di erent from English, but we often still talk about the same things. However, these

children taught me more than the local language. They taught me about being grateful
for what I have and the importance of helping each other. Some didn't have good
living conditions, but they still came to school and wanted to learn. This experience
showed me the power of education. It showed me that I can help others. More
importantly, it showed me that it is my responsibility, too.

          In addition to helping me appreciate people and giving back, my experience in
Ethiopia also changed me by helping me to connect with my own sense of purpose. I
had the chance to learn about the traditions and customs of a di erent culture. It was
very di erent from my culture, but I still felt a part of the community. I felt like I
wanted to do good things for this community. We all had di erent skills and ideas.
Now I think that I appreciate cultural diversity more.

          Overall, my experience in Ethiopia changed my life. It introduced me to new
things and showed me a new part of the world. It also taught me the importance of
giving back and being grateful for what we have. It has changed me in many ways. It
has helped me to appreciate the people in my life, to do things for other people, and to
connect with my own sense of purpose. This experience has been an important and
unforgettable part of my life.

PRE-WRITING

 VOCABULARY OF PROCESS ESSAYS

Our daily lives involve all kinds of step-by-step processes like
cooking, opening a bank account, or applying for a job. These types
of processes are often explained through written instructions or
"how-to" guides. Likewise, we can use writing to explain more
technical or complex processes like how glass gets recycled, or how
plants transform sunlight into energy to grow. This type of writing is
usually called process analysis writing.

 EXERCISE 1

INSTRUCTIONS: The words below are useful words when explaining a process. Use a
dictionary to look up any words that you don't already know. Then use your critical thinking
skills to organize them into four groups of three words each. Explain your reasons for these
groups.

CHOOSING A TOPIC

Read the following process analysis writing prompts below. Look up any words that will help
you understand the topic better. Choose carefully because you will develop this idea into a
longer piece of writing later.

 EXERCISE 2

INSTRUCTIONS: Rank the prompts (a, b, and c) with 1 being the one you most want to write
about and 3 being the one you don't think is very interesting.

 Navigating higher education Institutions in the U.S.

____ a) Think about all the things you need to learn how to do just to be a student at
school! Many of these things don't even involve studying or learning about your major, but
how you must do them well in order to succeed in college.

                                registering, dropping and paying for classes; parking in the school's
                                parking lot; finding and buying textbooks for your classes; using
                                services like tutoring, counseling, the library or other types of support;
                                communicating with your instructors when you are struggling to
                                understand; using Zoom for remote classes; studying independently in
                                D2L for online courses

Choose one or two related topics from the box and write a paragraph explaining how to do it
for a new student at your school.

 The art of being an adult

____ b) Think about all of the skills that a young person needs to learn when they become
an adult. Typically, these types of skills are not taught in school, nor do parents regularly take
the time to explain them. Instead, you must learn them through trial and error.

                                  saving money for the future; making a budget; banking; paying bills
                                  and other debts; doing taxes; setting life goals; following laws;
                                  understanding politics and voting; parenting; maintaining health;
                                  buying and maintaining a car or home; managing personal
                                  relationships in a positive way

Choose one important skill for growing up and write a paragraph to a younger person
explaining how to do it.

 Developing a career

____ c) Think about all the work it takes to start a new career. For many people, a job is a
major part of their identity; for others, it's just something they do to make money. Either way,
starting or changing a career requires many different skills.

                                  writing a resume and formal letters; writing reports; participating in
                                  an interview; giving a presentation; working on a team; using special

PARAGRAPH PREPARATION

Let's start putting our ideas into a paragraph form.

ASSIGNMENT - Paragraph preparation

INSTRUCTIONS: You chose a topic. You brainstormed with a list. Now write
a rough draft of a paragraph. Remember to start with a clear topic
sentence with a specific controlling idea. Then add meaningful supporting sentences that
explain the topic sentence. Finish your paragraph with a concluding sentence that wraps it
up. This is a first draft - a place to start. You will be able to rewrite this paragraph in the next
assignment before your teacher evaluates it.

WHAT IS PROCESS WRITING?

First, don't confuse "process writing" with the "writing process".
      Writing process is the set of steps a writer uses to write something
      Process writing is a kind of writing where the authors describes how to do something

Almost everything you do involves following a step-by-step process. From riding a bike as
children to learning various jobs as adults, you first needed instructions to learn how to do the
action. Similarly, you have probably had to teach things to others, too. So you know how
important good directions are--and how confusing they can be if they are not clearly written.

A process analysis essay explains:
      how to do something, or ...
      how something is made, or ...
      how something works.

The organization of a process essay usually follows chronological order. That means it follows
the sequence of steps as they happen. If a series of steps is simple and easy to understand,
then they can be grouped into a single paragraph. More complex processes are better
explained in an essay with several body paragraphs. The steps are grouped into stages, and
each stage is its own body paragraph.

Why is process analysis writing important for you to learn? Sometime in your daily life,
perhaps at work, at school, you may be required to write or read and understand:

     a set of instructions for a coworker to follow in order to do a task at work
     a contract with a company that shows what steps will be taken to complete a job or

          service like painting a house, repairing a car, or fixing the plumbing

     a description of a complex medical procedure or instructions for healing after a

          surgery

     a summary or description of a scientific or technical diagram that shows your

          understanding of a complex process for a college class

 AUDIENCE AND PURPOSE

There are generally two types of process analysis texts. The first one is called an instructional
process, and this type is commonly found in do-it-yourself books, "how-to" magazines, and
internet websites. It is used to explain how to do something. The other type of process
analysis text is a complex process analysis. It is used to explain how something works. These
types of texts are written for technical processes like making products in a factory, or for
scientific processes like describing how plants make energy. Think about who is going to read
your process analysis writing -- and your purpose of writing -- before you choose which style
to write.

Amalgamation - Unit 3: It's a Process  7
 EXERCISE 3

INSTRUCTIONS: Read these process paragraphs and answer the questions below.

Example 1: To make a good cup of coffee, you need some coffee beans, water, and a way to
brew the coffee. First, you grind the coffee beans. Next, you heat some water until it is just
below boiling. You pour the water over the coffee in a filter and let it drip into your cup or pot.
You can adjust the strength of the coffee by using more or less coffee or water. Finally, if you
want, you add cream or sugar and enjoy your cup of coffee.

Example 2: The American people elect the President of the U.S. every four years. On Election
Day, they vote for the President and Vice President. The candidate who gets the most votes in
each state wins that state's "points," which are based on the number of representatives and
senators the state has in Congress. A candidate needs at least 270 points to win.

Example 3: Paper is made from fibers, which are tiny strings of material. The most common
fibers for paper are made from wood, but fibers from other plants and recycled paper can
also be used. To make paper, the fibers are mixed with water to create a mixture called pulp.
The pulp is then poured onto a screen, which is a flat frame with a fine mesh. The water drains
out of the pulp. It leaves a thin layer of fibers on the screen. The screen is pressed and dried to
create a sheet of paper. The paper is then cut into the desired size and shape.

 WRITING TOPIC SENTENCES FOR PROCESS PARAGRAPHS

Writing clear topic sentences is a very important skill in academic
writing. It helps you to write paragraphs, but writing strong topic
sentences for paragraphs can also help you write thesis statements for
essays. A topic sentence tells the reader about the paragraph, while a
thesis statement tells the reader about the essay.

 EXERCISE 4

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the following paragraphs and add a topic sentence that best explains
the topic and main idea of each one.

     1. __________________________________________________________________________.
          You begin by making a list of what you want to say and getting any slides or other
          things you will use. Practice your presentation to feel more confident. On the day of the
          presentation, arrive early to set up your equipment. Wear the right clothes and start by
          saying hello and giving a short overview of your talk. Use slides or other materials to
          help explain your points. Speak clearly and confidently, making eye contact and using
          hand gestures. At the end, summarize your main points and allow time for questions.
          After the presentation, send a thank-you note or email, and be open to feedback.

     2. __________________________________________________________________________.
          First, they need to decide how much money they can afford and save up for a down
          payment and closing costs. Then, they should get approved for a mortgage loan so
          they know how much they can borrow and what their monthly payments will be. After
          that, they can look for houses online or with the help of a real estate agent. When they
          find a house they like, they can make an offer through their agent. The seller may
          accept their offer or make a counteroffer. The person and their agent can then talk
          about the final details of the sale, including the price and any conditions. It's also a
          good idea to have a professional check the house for any problems. Once everything
          is settled and the inspection is done, the person will sign the papers and pay the
          closing costs. Finally, they should get insurance to protect their new home.

PARAGRAPH PRACTICE

Look back at your brainstorm and paragraph you wrote for the topic you
chose from Exercise 2. Compare what you wrote to the example
paragraph in Exercise 5 and your corrections to that paragraph. Then, ask
yourself these questions:

      Who is your audience?
      What point-of-view did you choose to write from (first, second, or third)?
      Does this point-of-view speak well to the audience? Why or why not?

ASSIGNMENT - Paragraph practice

INSTRUCTIONS: Rewrite the paragraph that you wrote in class at the beginning of this unit.
Write at least 8 sentences. Use the same formatting as before. Start each paragraph with a
clear topic sentence with a specific controlling idea. Then add meaningful supporting
sentences that explain the topic sentence. Finish your paragraph with a concluding sentence
that wraps it up. Use the same formatting as Unit 1. When you are finished, share your Google
Doc with your teacher.

This is how your teacher will evaluate your work (1 point each; total 8 points):
          The topic sentence has a clear topic and controlling idea.
          The supporting sentences add specific supporting details.
          The final sentence makes the paragraph feel complete and finished.
          The sentences are in a logical order, and the information flows well.
          Grammar errors are not distracting or confusing.
          Mechanical errors (spelling, punctuation, capitalization) are not distracting or
          confusing.
          Each paragraph follows the formatting from Unit 1 and has at least 8 sentences.
          The writer has a specific audience in mind and uses an appropriate point of view (first
          person, second person, or third person) accurately and consistently.

                                          How to Get a Driver's License
          If you are an immigrant to the United States and you want to get a driver's
license, you will need to follow certain steps. First, you need to make sure that you are
old enough to drive. The minimum age to get a driver's license in the U.S. is usually
around 16 years old. You also need to meet certain other requirements. For example,
you need to pass a vision test and you need to have a valid Social Security number or
other identification. If you have a driver's license from your home country, you may
be able to use it to get a learner's permit in the U.S. However, you probably still need
to pass a written test that covers the rules of the road and tra c signs. Once you have
a learner's permit, you can start practicing driving with a licensed driver. You need to
practice for a certain amount of time before you can get a full driver's license. The
rules depend on your state. When you are ready to get a full driver's license, you need
to take a driving test to demonstrate your skills. If you pass the test, you will be issued
a driver's license. It is important to remember to renew your driver's license before it
expires, usually every few years. By following these steps, you can get a driver's
license in the U.S. and start driving on your own.

VOCABULARY, GRAMMAR, AND MECHANICS

 SEQUENCE OF STEPS

Like writing a narrative, process analysis writing usually involves sequences. Instead of
sequencing events, however, you use this vocabulary to sequence the steps in a process.

 Transition words and phrases for expressing time

after/afterward  as soon as     at last                 before
currently        during         eventually              meanwhile
next             now            since                   soon
finally          later          still                   then
until            when/whenever  while                   first, second, third

 Useful phrases and adverb clauses to add sentence variety

Your writing can be repetitive if you only use sequence words like first, second, third, next, and
after that at the beginning of your sentence. Look at some additional examples below. Notice
how this writer uses adverb phrases and clauses. Sometimes they show how the previous
step connects to the next step.

      The first step in buying a house is to decide how much money they can afford.
                 Use the gerund (-ing form) after a preposition.

      The first step of a good presentation is to make a list of what you want to say.
                 Name the process.

      The next step is to heat some water until it is just below boiling
                 Use the infinitive form (to + base form of verb) after the be verb.

      Once the fibers are mixed with water, then the pulp is ready to pour onto a screen.
                 *Use the infinitive form after adjectives like ready and prepared

           EXERCISE 5

               INSTRUCTIONS: Make three changes to the following paragraph
               so that there is more variety of connections between the steps.

          Time management is about finding a way to organize my time that
works for me. First, I need to figure out what's most important to me. This will
help me decide how to use my time. Next, I should make goals for myself that
focus on taking care of my body and mind, and also on the things I need to do.
These goals might include getting enough sleep, taking breaks during work,
eating healthy food, exercising, drinking lots of water, and being positive. I also
need to know how I like to work and schedule my tasks in a way that works for
me. Finally, I should make a schedule and try to stick to it, unless something
really important comes up. By doing these things, I can make a plan for
managing my time that works for me and helps me to reach my goals.

 PASSIVE VOICE

Look at the following sentences:
      Sentence A: People eat sushi in many parts of the world.
      Sentence B: Sushi is eaten by people in many parts of the world.

Sentence A is active. The subject (people) is doing the action (eat)
Sentence B is passive. The subject (sushi) is receiving the action (eat) by an agent (people).

Notice how the object of the active verb (eat) in the first sentence has been moved to
become the subject of the passive verb (is eaten) in the second sentence. This means that
only verbs which have objects (transitive verbs) can be made passive.

 How is the passive formed?

Passive verbs have two parts: a be verb and a past participle. Don't be confused by the term
past participle! A past participle isn't past -- that's just the name of a verb form. You can use
a past participle in a past situation, a present situation, or even a future situation.

Passive voice is not a verb tense, but it can be used in all verb tenses. In the example above,
the verb is in the present tense. We form the passive by using the correct form of the verbs
"be" (is, am, are, be, been, was, or were).

Look at the examples of past and present passive voice sentences.
      Tomato seedlings are sold. (the passive voice in the present tense)
      Tomato seedlings were sold. (the passive voice in the past tense)

 EXERCISE 6

INSTRUCTIONS: Read this process paragraph. Underline all of the examples of passive voice.
                   Jigsaw puzzles are made by cutting a large picture into small pieces that

          fit together. Most puzzles are designed to have 500 and 1,000 pieces. First, the
          picture is printed on cardboard or thin wood. Then it is cut into pieces by a
          special machine. The pieces are carefully separated and put in a box or bag.
          Some puzzles also come with the picture to help players put the puzzle
          together. Jigsaw puzzles are fun to put together and can help develop
          problem-solving skills. They are popular with people of all ages.
NOTE: The "agent" is the doer of the action in a passive sentence. It always follows the word
"by" and almost always comes after the verb. There is one example of an agent in the
paragraph above. What is it?

 EXERCISE 7

INSTRUCTIONS: Change these active sentences to passive and decide whether or not to
include the "by" phrase to show an agent. Be careful of the verb tense.

     1. The bank approved the loan for your new home.

     2. The college's Transportation Office sells parking permits online.

     3. Nemo should paint the whole house.

     4. Did the storm damage the car?

     5. The other students will finish the group project tomorrow.

 Forming the passive in different tenses

Look at the example sentences that use the passive in other tenses.

          Tense           Passive verb                      Example sentence
present simple      is driven           The car is driven by its owner every day.
past simple         was painted         The picture was painted by the artist.
future simple       will be mowed       The lawn will be mowed by the landscaper.
present continuous  is being cooked     The meal is being cooked by the new chef.
present perfect     has been completed  The project has been completed by the team.
modal               may be given        The presentation may be given by the boss.

NOTE: If you need to form a negative passive, add "not" after the to be verb. Example: The car
is not driven by its owner every day. or The picture was not painted by the artist.

 EXERCISE 8

INSTRUCTIONS: Rewrite these active sentences as passive sentences.

     1. The teacher has graded the exams.

2. The pastry chef is baking a wedding cake.

3. The cat chases the mouse around the house.

4. The architect can make changes to the building until August.

5. The athlete from Kenya will win the gold medal

 Why use passive sentences?

Many people believe that active sentences are better than passive ones for clear writing.
However, passive sentences are very useful and quite common in many styles of writing,
including more formal and academic styles. Sometimes the writer does not know who did the
action (the agent), and sometimes it just isn't important. Other times, the writer wants to
focus the reader's attention on the recipient of the action, not the cause. Using passive voice
can also sound more distant. That means it can seem more objective or neutral. Another
reason to use the passive voice is simply to give variety to your writing.

Here are some examples:
      My keys were stolen! (I don't know who stole them.)
      My newspaper was delivered late. (It's not important to name the delivery person.)
      The error was made by the programmer. (The focus is on the error, not the person who
          made the error.)
      The experiment was conducted in the science lab. (The tone is very neutral and
          objective.)

 EXERCISE 9

INSTRUCTIONS: Choose the best form of the verb: active or passive.

                     Most companies (require / are required) an interview to get a job. If you
          (ask / are asked) to come in for an interview, it's a good idea to prepare for all
          the stages of the interview process. First, it (recommends /is recommended)
          that you arrive on time. A company might not even (consider / be considered)
          you for the job if you arrive late for the interview. Second, remember that
          sometimes interviews (conduct / are conducted) by several people, not just
          the boss. Be prepared to speak in front of more than one person. Finally, for
          some jobs, employers sometimes (require / are required) more than one
          interview. It can be very exhausting! But if it is the job you (want / be wanted),
          then it is worth the effort.

 USING COMMAS

The comma is a very common punctuation mark. It indicates a pause in a sentence or a
separation of things, such as in a list. Commas can be used in a variety of ways. Here are
some basic rules for using commas when writing a sentence:

      After introductory words, phrases, or clauses that come before the main subject
                 Example: Personally, I think the practice is helpful.
                 Example: In the summer, students usually find temporary jobs.

      In between all items in a list, including before a conjunction and in a list of three or
          more things
                 Example: The barn, the tool shed, and the back porch were destroyed by the
                     wind.

      Before conjunctions in compound sentences:
                 Example: The bedroom door was closed, so the children knew their mother
                     was asleep.

      Interrupting words, phrases, or clauses
                 Example: I knew where it was hidden, of course, but I wanted them to find it
                     themselves.
                 Example: The puzzle, which was very difficult, was not cheap.

      Dates, addresses, greetings, and letters
                 Example: The letter was postmarked on December 8, 1945.
                 Example: Dear Delpha Thomas,

 EXERCISE 10

INSTRUCTIONS: Add commas where they are needed. Some sentences may require more
than one comma.

     1. Monday Tuesday and Wednesday are all booked with meetings.
     2. I want to get a better job so I am taking courses at night.
     3. We were twenty minutes late. We came just in time however to catch the bus out of

          the city.
     4. The incident happened on June 5 2022.
     5. When I was a young boy I had a dog named Leroy.
     6. Every essay needs an introduction body and conclusion.
     7. On July 4 1776 the United States declared independence from Great Britain.
     8. Without any warning our computer network crashed.
     9. I traveled to Central Oregon but I didn't see you there.
     10. Knowing how to speak English which is a language people use around the world can

          help you get a job.

 DESCRIBING THE THINGS

An adjective clause (sometimes called a relative clause) is a clause that describes a noun.

          Example: Paper that comes from recycling is sold back to the paper mill.

Adjective clauses are actually formed by joining together two complete sentences. One
sentence remains an independent clause (a complete sentence), and the other becomes a
relative clause (not a complete sentence). In other words, two sentences become one
sentence.

Words like who, that, which, whose, and where are called relative pronouns. They are used to
introduce an adjective clause, and they often replace pronouns, adverbs, and prepositions
connected to the noun.

  Noun type        Relative pronoun                                Examples
A person
              who/that                        She was talking to a lady. I think the

A thing       that/which                      She was talking to a lady who I think
              (delete it, they, this, etc.)       was her mother.

A place       where                           My son is looking for his backpack. He
              (delete in, at, on + place)         lost the backpack yesterday.

INSTRUCTIONS: Join the two sentences together to make a complex sentence with an
adjective clause.

     1. Trucks transport the paper to a paper mill. The paper is prepared there.

     2. Paper goes from the paper mill to printers. They turn the paper into all kinds of
          products.

     3. Mills turn the paper into products. People use them.

     4. Look at the man. His newspaper is made out of recycled paper.

     5. Some paper comes from recycling. It is sold back to the paper mill.

 Types of adjective clauses

In the last exercise, you practiced making one kind of adjective clause. This is called a
defining adjective clause. Sometimes this is called a restrictive clause. This type of adjective
clause gives information that is necessary to understand the noun being described. Another
type of adjective clause is called non-defining, or non-restrictive. A non-defining clause is like
an interruption in a sentence. It gives extra information about the noun, but the noun and the
sentence would still be clear without this type of adjective clause.

                           Example                                     Comments

Non-defining:                                 The adjective clause "who works as a
My friend, who works as a doctor, told me     doctor" describes the noun "friend". It gives
about the latest medical advancements.        extra information about the friend, but it is
                                              not necessary to understand the message
Defining:                                     about what the friend did.
My friend is the only doctor at the hospital
that I trust.                                 The adjective clause "that I trust" describes
                                              the noun "doctor". It makes it clear how the
                                              writer's friend is different from other doctors
                                              at the hospital. Without this clause, the
                                              sentence would be incomplete and not
                                              make sense.

 EXERCISE 14

INSTRUCTIONS: Underline the adjective clauses in the sentences below. Label it as defining or
non-defining.

     1. A scientist who won the Nobel Prize developed a new theory about light.
     2. The research paper, which was published in a special magazine, received a great deal

          of attention from other scientists.
     3. A computer program that helps us analyze lots of data was a big tech improvement.
     4. The company, which has been around for a long time, makes really

          environmentally-friendly products.
     5. The chef who won a cooking competition made a really good dish.
     6. A recipe, which has been passed down for a long time, has become a special family

          tradition.
     7. Portland, where I live, actually gets more rain than Seattle.

INSTRUCTIONS Start with the process paragraph that you already wrote. Expand this
paragraph into a full process essay. Follow these guidelines:

      Organize your story with an introduction paragraph, at least one body paragraph for
          each major stage or phase of the process, and a conclusion paragraph. You should
          have between 4 and 6 paragraphs.
                 In your introduction, include an interesting hook, background information, and
                     a clear thesis statement that previews the process and gives the reader a
                     sense of purpose. Think about the purpose of the process.
                 Group steps together into appropriate stages. Each stage should be its own
                     paragraph. Start each body paragraph with a clear topic sentence. Add
                     supporting sentences to explain the topic sentence.
                 In the conclusion paragraph, remind your readers of your thesis and purpose.

                                                 Getting on the Road
          Have you recently immigrated to the United States and are looking to get a
driver's license? Obtaining a driver's license in the U.S. can be a confusing process,
especially if you are new to the country. However, with the right information and
guidance, you can successfully navigate the process and get your driver's license.
          The first step in getting a driver's license in the U.S. is making sure that you
are old enough to drive. The minimum age to get a driver's license in the U.S. is
usually around 16 years old. In addition to being of the right age, you will also need to
meet certain other requirements. For example, you need to pass a vision test and have
a valid Social Security number or other identification. If you do not meet these
requirements, you will not be able to get a driver's license in the U.S.
          If you already have a driver's license from your home country, you may be able
to use it to get a learner's permit in the U.S. A learner's permit is a special type of
license that allows you to practice driving under the supervision of a licensed driver.
To get a learner's permit, you will need to pass a written test that covers the rules of
the road and tra c signs. This test is typically administered at your local Department
of Motor Vehicles (DMV). You may be able to take the test in your native language,
depending on the state you are in.

Amalgamation - Unit 3: It's a Process                                                                                         29
                                                                                                                    Halsey 2

          Once you have a learner's permit, you can start practicing driving with a
licensed driver. You will need to practice for a certain amount of time before you can
get a full driver's license. The amount of time is di erent in each state. During this
time, you should focus on developing your driving skills and becoming comfortable
behind the wheel. You should also make sure to follow all tra c laws and regulations
while you are driving.

          When you are ready to get a full driver's license, you will need to take a driving
test to demonstrate your skills. The driving test typically consists of two parts: a
written test and a practical test. The written test will cover the rules of the road and
tra c signs. It will be similar to the test you took to get your learner's permit. The
practical test will involve you driving a car under the supervision of a DMV employee.
That person will evaluate your driving skills. If you pass both parts of the test, then
you will be given a driver's license.

          It is important to remember to renew your driver's license before it expires.
This usually happens every few years. To renew your driver's license, you will need to
visit your local DMV and provide certain documents, such as proof of identity and
proof of residence. You may also need to pass a vision test and pay a renewal fee. You
don't usually need to take another practical test.

          To change your driver's license from your home country to the U.S., you may
need to provide certain documents, such as your passport or other identification. You
may also need to pass a driving test to demonstrate your skills. The process for
changing your driver's license from your home country to the U.S. may vary

depending on the state you are in and the country your driver's license is from. You
will need to contact your local DMV to find out what specific steps you need to take.

          Obtaining a driver's license in the U.S. as an immigrant can be a process, but it
is worth it in the end to be able to drive on your own. By following the steps outlined
in this essay, you can successfully get a driver's license in the U.S. and start driving
legally on U.S. roads. It is important to remember to follow all tra c laws and
regulations, and to renew your driver's license before it expires. With a valid driver's
license, you will have the freedom and independence to drive yourself wherever you
need to go.

PRE-WRITING

In comparison paragraphs and essays, the similarities between two subjects are discussed,
while contrast writing discusses differences. A compare-and-contrast essay evaluates two
subjects by comparing them, contrasting them, or both. Here are some of the most basic
vocabulary words for this task.

 VOCABULARY OF COMPARE/CONTRAST ESSAYS

 EXERCISE 1

INSTRUCTIONS: Some adjectives always use a specific preposition. Match the adjective with
its dependent preposition.

1. _____ similar               A. to
2. _____ different             B. as
3. _____ the same              C. than
4. _____ the opposite          D. from
5. _____ darker/lighter        E. in
6. _____ alike/unlike          F. of

 EXERCISE 2

INSTRUCTIONS: Use a dictionary to find the noun and adverb forms of these adjectives.

Adjective                Noun                                  Adverb
  similar
 different

 EXERCISE 3

INSTRUCTIONS: Look at these images. Then answer the questions that follow.

  How are these images similar?
  How are these images different?
  How does seeing these images

      together affect how you see each
      of them individually?
  Write a short paragraph that
      explains how they are similar and
      how they are different. (Save this
      paragraph! We will use it again
      later in this unit.)

 BRAINSTORMING WITH A VENN DIAGRAM

One way that you can brainstorm a topic for comparison and contrast writing is to use a
Venn diagram (see circles below). In the place where the circles overlap, you list the
similarities. In the separate spaces, you write only things that are specific or unique to each
topic.

 EXERCISE 4

INSTRUCTIONS: Imagine that you are going to write a compare-and-contrast essay about
two types of transportation: a bike and a car. Use the Venn diagram below to list the
similarities and differences between them.

After you finish, study your completed diagram. How does this picture help you see the
structure of an essay about these two types of transportation? What might be the structure of
that essay?

 PREPARING A FORMAL OUTLINE

For essays and research papers, some college instructors require students to prepare a
formal outline before writing the first draft. An outline is basically a clear list. This helps your
instructor know that you are organized and on the right path. Let's start by outlining a
paragraph. Here's the basic structure of an outline for a paragraph:

                          Topic sentence (write a full sentence here)

                              I. Major point

                                          A. Minor detail
                                                     1. specific information
                                                     2. specific information

                                          B. Minor detail
                                                     1. specific information
                                                     2. specific information

                             II. Major point

                                          A. Minor detail
                                                     1. specific information
                                                     2. specific information

                                          B. Minor detail
                                                     1. specific information
                                                     2. specific information

                          Concluding sentence (write a full sentence here)

REMEMBER: You may have any number of major points, minor details, or specific information.
The important idea here is that each level explains the level above. So specific information
explains minor details. Minor details explain a major point. And the major points explain the
topic sentence.

 EXERCISE 5

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the paragraph below. Then use the list of phrases at the bottom of the
page to complete the outline that follows.

                     London and Washington D.C. have similarities and differences in living
          standards and cultural diversity. Both cities share a very expensive cost of
          living in terms of housing. A downtown one-bedroom apartment in DC can
          easily cost $1,800 per month, and a similar "flat" in London may be double that
          amount. These high costs create socioeconomic differences among the
          residents. Although both cities' residents are predominantly wealthy, both cities
          have a significantly large population of poor and homeless. Perhaps the most
          significant difference is the racial diversity. Washington, DC, is a
          "minority-majority" city, which means the majority of its citizens are races other
          than white. In 2009, according to the US Census, 55 percent of DC residents
          were classified as "Black or African American" and 35 percent of its residents
          were classified as "white." London, by contrast, has very few minorities. In 2006,
          70 percent of its population was "white," while only 10 percent was "Black."
          Though the cost of these cities is high, the racial differences between the cities
          are what make them feel different.

WHAT IS COMPARISON AND CONTRAST WRITING?

Comparing and contrasting is a way to think about two things and figure out how they are
the same or different. It can help you make good choices, like deciding which thing to buy. In
the workplace, people use comparing and contrasting to decide who gets a job, who gets a
raise, and who gets fired. It can also help you understand companies, departments, or people
better. It is a useful tool in many situations.

 TOPIC SENTENCES FOR COMPARISON AND CONTRAST PARAGRAPHS

A good topic sentence for a compare-and-contrast paragraph should clearly state the two
things being analyzed, the specific point by which they are being compared, and the main
idea. Fortunately, in compare-and-contrast style writing, the main idea is simple: In what
ways are the two items similar or different in regards to a particular point of comparison?

 EXERCISE 7

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the paragraph below and then answer the questions that follow.

                     ________________________________________________________________
          One way to measure the strength of a country's economy is to look at its gross
          domestic product (GDP), which is the value of finished goods and services
          produced within the nation. According to The World Factbook, which is a
          website published by the CIA, the US has a GDP of $54,800 per person annually,
          while Vietnam has a GDP of $6,000 per person annually. This means that the US
          makes much more money per person than Vietnam. The US also has the
          second-largest industrial output in the world, while Vietnam is in thirteenth
          place. This means that the US makes more things in factories than Vietnam.
          However, Vietnam still relies on agriculture for a significant portion of its GDP, at
          17.4%. These differences in economic conditions explain why Vietnam is
          considered a developing country, while the US is considered a developed
          country.

                1. What are the two topics being compared?
                2. What is the point of comparison?
                3. Are they the same or different?
                4. Write a topic sentence for this paragraph.

 CONCLUDING SENTENCES FOR COMPARISON AND CONTRAST PARAGRAPHS

Remember, the last sentence in a paragraph is the concluding sentence. Its job is to help the
reader feel that the writer has expressed a complete and finished idea. In a single paragraph,
the concluding sentence wraps everything up. In an essay with several paragraphs, a
concluding sentence can be a transition between two paragraphs.

 Use a concluding sentence to end a single paragraph

Here are some examples:
      give advice or make a suggestion about the topic to the reader
      make a prediction or offer hope for the future
      give the writer's feelings or opinion about the topic
      restate the main idea from the topic sentence

 EXERCISE 8

INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the concluding sentence from the paragraph we read about London
and Washington, D.C. What technique does this sentence use? (choose from the list above)

          Though the cost of these cities is high, the racial differences between the cities
          is what makes them feel different.

 Using a concluding sentence to transition between paragraphs

As you learn more about essay writing and move beyond simply writing paragraphs and
move into writing essays, the concluding sentence of a paragraph can also create a
transition between two paragraphs.

 EXERCISE 9

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the two paragraphs. The concluding sentence at the end of the first
paragraph is missing. Which sentence makes the best transition between the two
paragraphs?

                     There are some differences and similarities between the US and Bosnia
          in how their governments work. Bosnia is a younger country than the US. Bosnia
          became independent in 1992 and the US became independent in 1776. Both
          countries are independent and democratic. They both have elections to
          choose their president. In the US, there are two main political parties, the
          Democrats and the Republicans. In Bosnia, there are three main parties: the
          SDA, SDP, and HDZ. Both countries have a lot of parties, but only a few are
          popular enough to be chosen in the elections. Both countries have elections
          where the people vote to choose their new president.

                1. The new president runs the nation's government until the next election
                     when the people vote again.

                2. The new president runs the nation's government, with or without the
                     support of all of the country's parties.

                3. The new president runs the nation's government, which tends to
                     impact the economy positively or negatively.

                     Bosnia and the US have different economies. Bosnia is a developing
          country and the US is a developed country. Bosnia's economy is smaller than
          the US's economy. Bosnia mostly grows food while the US grows food and
          makes many other things. Both countries sell wheat, corn, vegetables, and
          animals. According to the CIA World Factbook, Bosnia's GDP is about $39 billion
          and the US's GDP is about $17 trillion. This affects the kinds of businesses people
          start and the job opportunities in each country.

 EXERCISE 10

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the short essay below. The concluding sentences at the end of the first
and second paragraphs are missing. What is the best transition between paragraphs? Write
the missing sentences in a way that leads the reader from one paragraph to the next.

                     Older people prefer Facebook; younger people use TikTok. Regardless of
          the platform, social media is a part of everyday life around the globe. However,
          not every country is the same. Social media in China and the U.S., for example,
          differ in terms of government control, freedom of expression, and features.

                     First, social media platforms in China are heavily censored and
          monitored by the government, while those in the U.S. are generally not subject
          to the same level of censorship and control. According to the Citizen Lab, which
          is a research group at the University of Toronto, over 50,000 Weibo posts were
          censored in just one week in 2013. In contrast, the First Amendment of the U.S.
          Constitution protects the freedom of expression of users on social media
          platforms in the U.S. __________________________________________________
          ____________________________________________________________________

                     Second, both Chinese and American social media users have access to
          a wide range of features, such as the ability to connect with friends and family,
          share photos and videos, and participate in online communities. However, the
          specific functions of social media platforms vary depending on the country. For
          example, social media platforms in China have more features related to
          e-commerce, while those in the U.S. focus on social networking and
          communication. _________________________________________________
          ____________________________________________________________________

                     Finally, social media in both China and the U.S. play important roles in
          the lives of millions of people around the world. According to DataPortal.com,,
          around 80% of adults in the U.S. use social media, making it a crucial part of
          modern communication and connection. Despite the differences between
          social media in China and the U.S., both offer a range of features and services
          that allow users to connect with others and share information.

 ORGANIZING THE INFORMATION: BLOCK OR POINT-BY-POINT

When organizing the supporting sentences of a compare-and-contrast paragraph, or
organizing the body paragraphs of a compare-and-contrast essay, it is important to
consider whether to use a block or point-by-point organization structure. You can group
information by similarities and differences (each has its own paragraph); by topic (each
topic has its own paragraph), or by the features (points) you are using to compare/contrast
(each point has its own paragraph). The choice depends on the type of data you have and
where you want your reader to focus their attention.

 EXERCISE 11

INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the texts in Exercise 9 and Exercise 10. Do they use block or
point-by-point organization?

Exercise 9:    Block   Point-by-point
Exercise 10:   Block   Point-by-point

PARAGRAPH PRACTICE

As you know, a good way to get ready to write an essay is to write a
paragraph first. You can both learn to write and write to learn!

ASSIGNMENT - Paragraph practice

INSTRUCTIONS: Choose an infographic provided by your teacher. Use the
information from the infographic to write a compare-and-contrast paragraph. Begin with a
clear topic sentence. Organize your supporting details in either block or point-by-point
method. End with a concluding sentence. Your paragraph should have 8-10 sentences. Use
the same formatting as Unit 1. When you are finished, share your Google Doc with your
teacher.

 REMEMBER: You can use facts and figures from the infographic, but you cannot copy whole
 phrases or sentences from the infographic. That's plagiarism. Instead, you must describe
 the information in the infographic using your own words.

This is how your teacher will evaluate your work (1 point each; total 8 points):
          The topic sentence has a clear topic and controlling idea.
          The supporting sentences add specific supporting details.
          The final sentence makes the paragraph feel complete and finished.
          The sentences are in a logical order, and the information flows well.
          Grammar errors are not distracting or confusing.
          Mechanical errors (spelling, punctuation, capitalization) are not distracting or
          confusing.
          Each paragraph follows the formatting from Unit 1 and has at least 8 sentences.
          The writer uses either block organization or point-by-point organization to compare
          and/or contrast two topics.

                                                   The Battle of the Video
                               Nowadays, video content has become the most important
                         part of social media. Users around the world want to share more
                         than text and pictures. Both YouTube and TikTok focus on video
                         content, but according to StupidBlogger.com, there are
                         important di erences. YouTube is a U.S. company that started i
                         2005, while TikTok is a Chinese company that began in 2017.
                         YouTube is the second largest social media platform in the
                         world with 2.3 billion users. TikTok, on the other hand, has only
                         6.89 million users. In terms of hours, however, TikTok users
                         spend about 50% more time on its platform. The average age of
                         a user is also much younger on TikTok.

VOCABULARY, GRAMMAR, AND MECHANICS

 TRANSITION WORDS FOR COMPARISON AND CONTRAST

Whichever way you decide to organize your sentences or paragraphs, you need to use many
transitions to help readers move between topics and points smoothly.

 Conjunctive adverbs

This kind of sentence connector is most often used to show how ideas between two separate
sentences or separate paragraphs are related to each other. They usually begin the
sentence, and they are usually followed by a comma, so it's a good idea to practice using
them this way first. However, as you advance in your writing skills, you might notice that like all
adverbs, these words can sometimes move into different places in a sentence or be used
with more complex punctuation, such as semicolons.

Showing difference  However,
Showing similarity  In contrast,
                    On the other hand,

                    Likewise,
                    Similarly,

 EXERCISE 12

INSTRUCTIONS: Read each pair of sentences. Decide whether the two sentences show
similarities or differences. Which transition words could you use in these examples?

     1. Teachers in China do not expect students to ask questions or to make comments in
          class. American teachers think that asking questions and making comments shows
          good participation.
          _____________________________________________________________________________

     2. Some people find it helpful to listen to music when they study. Others prefer silence.
          _____________________________________________________________________________

     3. English is spoken in America. It is spoken in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand.
          _____________________________________________________________________________

Amalgamation - Unit 4: Exactly the Same or Totally Different?  16
 Subordinating conjunctions

Subordinating conjunctions make complex sentences. They show how ideas in the two
clauses are related to each other. A subordinating conjunction cannot be used with a
coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) in the same sentence. Another interesting thing about
these sentence connectors is that they allow you to change the order of the clauses.. When
the dependent clause comes first, you use a comma between them.

              Showing difference  Although     While
                                  Even though  Whereas

 Correlative conjunctions

Compare-and-contrast writing also frequently uses a special kind of sentence connector
called correlative conjunctions. These are conjunctions that show how your two topics are
similar.

Both...and             Both X and Y are/have (plural form)
Neither...nor
                       Neither X nor Y is/has (singular form in the negative if X and Y are
Not only...but (also)  singular nouns, but use a plural form of the verb (have) if Y is plural).

                       Not only does X + verb, but it (also) verb
                       Not only is X + noun or adjective, but it (X) is also + noun or adjective.

 EXERCISE 14

INSTRUCTIONS: Read each pair of sentences. Combine the two sentences into one using a
correlative conjunction.

 FORMING COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE ADJECTIVES

Comparatives and superlatives are special forms of adjectives. They are used to compare
two or more things. Generally, comparatives are formed using the adjective with the suffix -er
or the word more, and superlatives are formed using the adjective with the suffix -est or the
wod most.

The forms depend on the number of syllables in the adjective. Each vowel sound in a word
equals one syllable. For instance, sing contains one syllable, but singing contains two -- sing
and -ing. Notice how each part of the word has a vowel sound.

Adjective form                Comparative form                 Superlative form

 EXERCISE 16

INSTRUCTIONS: Correct the mistakes with comparative and superlative forms in these
sentences.

     1. Sometimes flying to a city is more cheaper than driving there.
     2. The easyest way to buy cheap airlines tickets is on the Internet.
     3. Renting a car is more expensive to taking the bus.
     4. If you travel in winter, you can get best price on airplane tickets.
     5. This year I am planning to go somewhere more far away than last year.
     6. I went to same city as you last year.
     7. The speed of taking an Amtrak train to Canada is similar with driving there.
     8. Spanish that is spoken in Mexico is much different than the Spanish spoken in Spain.

Finally, as you saw in Exercise 1, a few important adjectives have their own unique
collocations, or word combinations, for comparison. They do not follow the regular
comparative or superlative structures. Here are some examples:

          different from ... Example: Canada is very different from other parts of Great Britain.
          similar to ... Example: Chile is similar to other countries in South America.
          the same as ... Example: Life in Oregon is not the same as life in Florida.
          the opposite of ... Example: The weather in California is the opposite of New York.
          alike/unlike in ... Example: Not all countries in Africa are alike in culture or language.

 FORMING COMPARATIVE AND SUPERLATIVE ADJECTIVES

A noun clause is a group of words (with a subject and verb, but no complete idea) that acts
like a noun in a sentence. That means it can function as the subject of the sentence, object of
the verb, object of a preposition, or a complement. You can use noun clauses to provide more
details, express an attitude or degree of certainty, or report someone else's words or opinions.

A noun clause begins with a relative pronoun or adverb, much like adjective clauses. Here are
some of the most common ones: who, whom, which, how, what, when, whether, where, why, if,
that and whoever, whomever, whichever, however, whatever, whenever.

Subject of the sentence:  Where I am going is none of your business.
Object of the verb:       I don't know what I am going to do.
Object of a preposition:  The textbook showed a model of how computers work.
Complement:               The true test of courage is how we act under pressure.

The relative pronoun or adjective is usually followed by the subject and verb of the clause. It
uses statement word order. Sometimes the words who, what, and which are both the relative
pronoun and the subject of the clause. For example: She asked me who would be at the party.

When a that clause is the subject of the sentence, the word that is necessary. In all other

cases, the word that is optional when it begins a noun clause. Formal academic writing

usually uses that whereas informal speaking often omits it. Here are some examples:

Formal:                   We know that sleep is important to success in school.

Informal:                 We know sleep is important to success in school.

 EXERCISE 18

INSTRUCTIONS: Look at the sentences below and underline the noun clauses.

     1. Though the cost of these cities is high, the racial differences between the cities is what
          makes them feel different.

     2. Write a short paragraph that explains how they are similar and how they are different.
     3. This helps your instructor to be sure that you are on the right path and are working in

          an organized way.
     4. Imagine that you are an expert in geography and you work for a non-governmental

          organization that studies how countries compare.
     5. It is important to consider whether to use a block or point-by-point organization

          structure.

 EXERCISE 19

INSTRUCTIONS: One way to practice making noun clauses is to think about putting a question
inside of a sentence. Practice combining these sentences by changing the question to a
clause and putting it into the sentence. Be careful of word order and auxiliary verbs!

     1. Scientists all over the world wonder ____________________________________________.
          (Question) How fast will the Earth's temperature rise if carbon emissions continue at
          their current rate?

     2. Many immigrants want to know ____________________________________________.
          (Question) What are the differences between the US and my home country?

     3. ____________________________________________ is one of the most important skills a
          person can learn in their lives.
          (Question) How can a person be promoted in their career?

     4. Experts in social sciences who study the effect of culture on daily decisions still don't
          understand ____________________________________________.
          (Question) Why do people have difficulty adapting to new cultures?

     5. Many people dream about____________________________________________.

WRITING ASSIGNMENT: ESSAY 4

In this assignment, you will not start with the paragraph you wrote earlier.
Instead, you have a new topic that requires some research. Follow the
instructions carefully step by step.

ASSIGNMENT - Compare/contrast essay

INSTRUCTIONS: Imagine that you are an expert in geography and you work for a
non-governmental organization that studies how countries compare. The organization asks
you to write a report for international students and recent immigrants. The report should
explain how your country is different from or similar to the U.S. Follow the steps below.

FINDING INFORMATION

Use the CIA World Factbook (https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/) to find data about
how the U.S. and your country compare in the areas of the economy, people and society,
geography, politics, energy, transportation, and other important issues. Then choose one
option for your essay:

      Option 1: Focus on just one area (for example, people and society) and write about
          three important differences or similarities in that area (one body paragraph for each).

      Option 2: Focus on three major areas of difference and write about the major data
          points that make the countries different or similar (again, one body paragraph each).

GETTING STARTED

     1. As you read about the two countries, collect information in a Venn diagram (two
          overlapping circles). Save this to give it to your teacher with the first draft of your
          essay.

     2. When you think you have enough data, organize the relevant information in an outline.
          Use the method of organization (block or point-by-point) that fits your data best. Use
          the outline as a map for writing your full essay. Save this to give to your teacher with
          the first draft of your essay.

AS YOU WRITE YOUR DRAFT

      Organize your essay with an introduction paragraph, block or point-by-point body
          paragraphs, and a conclusion paragraph.

      In your introduction paragraph, include an interesting hook, background information,
          and a clear thesis statement in your introduction that tells your readers exactly which
          topics and points you will be comparing or contrasting.

      Make sure each body paragraph has a clear topic sentence that states the point(s) of
          comparison and whether the paragraph focuses on similarities or differences. Use
          concluding sentences that lead the reader to the next topic.

Amalgamation - Unit 4: Exactly the Same or Totally Different?  24
      IMPORTANT: Be sure to tell your readers where you got your information. Include
          something like this: According to the CIA World Factbook, ...

      Use comparative adjectives and transition words to show comparison and contrast
          throughout your essay.

      In your conclusion paragraph, remind your readers of your thesis by summarizing the
          topics and points of comparison. Remind the reader why this information is important
          to them.

      Use at least one noun clause in your writing.
      Use appropriate verb tenses (past, present, future) and voice (active, passive).
      Choose a point of view appropriate for your story (first person, second person, third

          person).
      Use a variety of sentence types and vocabulary.
      Add a description with adverbs, adjectives, and adjective clauses. Be specific. Give

          details. Don't be vague or superficial.

Format

      Type your essay using Google Docs.
      Use Times New Roman 12 point font or something similar.
      Use a margin of one inch on all sides.
      Double-space the lines.
      Use page numbers in the upper right-hand corner.
      Add a header in the upper left-hand corner with your full name, class, assignment,

          and date.
      Add a title, centered at the top of the page.
      Indent each paragraph by using the TAB button on your keyboard (not the spacebar).
      Use your own words. Do not copy from another source. That is plagiarism and results

          in 0 points for this assignment. If you use information from an outside source,
          paraphrase (use your own words) or quote (use exact words inside "quotation
          marks"). Either way, you must say where you found the information.
      Proofread carefully for grammar, capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.

                                                      The Big and the Small:
                                         Comparing the United States and Spain
                 How alike - or di erent - are the countries of the United States and Spain?
      One might think that they share many characteristics since Spain was once a colonizer
      of many parts of North America that the United States now controls. While their
      histories were once closely connected, the two countries have taken di erent paths
      over time. By looking at key factors such as geography, population, and economy, one
      can get a better understanding of similarities and di erences between these two
      countries today.
                 One major di erence between the United States and Spain is sizes. The United
      States is the third-largest country in the world. This North American nation has a
      total area of 9.147 million square kilometers (according to the CIA World Factbook). In
      contrast, the older, European country of Spain is much smaller. It has a total area of
      505,990 square kilometers. This means that the United States is over 18 times larger
      than Spain. The geographic size of the country means there are likely many
      di erences in geography, such as climate and types of land.
                 Another significant di erence between the countries of the United States and
      Spain is population. As of 2021, the United States has a population of 331 million

Amalgamation - Unit 4: Exactly the Same or Totally Different?                                                                        27
                                                                                                                    Halsey 2

people (according to the CIA World Factbook), while Spain has a population of only 47
million people. That means there are about 36 people per square kilometer in the
United States, and about 93 people per square kilometer in Spain. The density of the
population might seem quite di erent, but it is important to note that in both
countries about 81% of the population live in urban areas.

          The economy is another way to compare the two countries. The United States
and Spain have both experienced significant economic growth in recent years. While
they both have grown, there is a noteworthy contrast in the sizes of the economies.
According to the CIA World Factbook, for example, the United States has the world's
largest economy. The country has a gross domestic product (GDP, which Cambridge
Learner's Dictionary says is the total value of goods and services that a country
produces in a year) of over $22 trillion. Spain's economy is also strong, with a GDP of
over $1.4 trillion. Both countries have quite diverse economies. That means they are
driven by a variety of industries, including manufacturing, agriculture, and service
sectors.

          While the United States and Spain have many di erences, including their size
and population, they also have some similarities, such as their strong economies and
the industries behind them. Understanding the di erences and similarities between
these two countries can give a greater appreciation of their unique cultures and
histories. Overall, the United States and Spain are both interesting and diverse
countries that have much to o er.

                                Comparing Economies: The United States and Spain
                 Have you ever stopped to think about the economic di erences and
      similarities between the United States and Spain? While these two countries may seem
      quite di erent on the surface, they actually have more in common than you might
      think when it comes to their economies. When you look at the key indicators such as
      their gross domestic product (GDP), their unemployment rate, and their major
      industries, you can get a better understanding of the economic landscape in both the
      United States and Spain. By exploring these factors, you can see how these countries
      compare and contrast when it comes to their individual economic strengths and
      challenges.
                 One key di erence between the United States and Spain is their gross domestic
      product (GDP, which Cambridge Learner's Dictionary says is the total value of goods
      and services that a country produces in a year). According to the CIA World Factbook,
      the United States has the world's largest economy, with a GDP of about $22 trillion. As
      you might imagine, Spain's GDP, in contrast, is much smaller, at about $1.4 trillion.
      This means that the United States has a significantly larger economy than Spain. This
      may not be surprising since it has more people and more land.

          Despite this di erence in GDP, both the United States and Spain have
experienced economic growth in recent years. In the United States, the GDP has grown
by an average of 2.5% per year over the past decade (according to the CIA World
Factbook). Similarly, Spain's GDP has grown by an almost identical average of 2.2%
per year over the same time period. This demonstrates that both countries have
robust and growing economies.

          In terms of major industries, both the United States and Spain have diverse
economies. That means that they have a significant mix of industries. In other words,
they do not rely on just one product, such as sugar or oil. In the United States, the
largest industries include manufacturing, services, and agriculture. Spain's economy
is also diverse, with major industries including tourism, manufacturing, and
agriculture. You might guess that this is probably one of the reasons why both
countries have experienced economic growth.

          When it comes to unemployment, both the United States and Spain have
experienced fluctuations, or rapid ups and downs, in their unemployment rates over
the past decade. As of 2021, the United States has an unemployment rate of 6.4%
(according to the CIA World Factbook). Spain has an unemployment rate of 14.5%.
While both countries have experienced periods of higher unemployment, they have
also seen decreases in their unemployment rates over time. As you can imagine, this is
probably another factor in both country's successful economies.

          As you can see, the United States and Spain have both experienced economic
growth and have diverse economies that are led by a mix of industries. While the
United States has a significantly larger GDP than Spain, both countries have
experienced fluctuations in their unemployment rates over time. Understanding the
economic landscape in both the United States and Spain can help you to better
understand the unique economic strengths and challenges faced by these countries.

THE EDITING AND PROOFREADING PROCESS

Editing and proofreading are important steps in the writing process. They allow you to
improve your essay and make it the best it can be. Many people think that once they've
finished their first draft, there's not much more to do. However, even experienced writers know
that they can always improve their work and benefit from the input of others. Just like athletes
and dancers get better with practice, writers can also make their writing better by revising
and editing. So don't be afraid to go back and make changes - it's all part of the journey to
creating the best work possible.

      When you edit your writing, you take a second look at your ideas. You might add, cut,
          move, or change information in order to make your ideas clearer, more accurate,
          more interesting, or more convincing. In this stage, you focus on the content.

      When you proofread your writing, you take a second look at how you expressed your
          ideas. You might use different vocabulary. You fix any problems in grammar and
          mechanics, such as spelling, capitalization, and punctuation. You also look carefully at
          the formatting. In this stage, you focus on the presentation.

FOCUS ON EDITING

 CREATING UNITY

Unity in an essay means that all the parts of the essay work together to support the main
idea. An essay with unity is focused and consistent. All the supporting details and examples fit
together nicely to make a complete whole. Everything is necessary; there are no extra pieces.

However, different cultures tell stories and share information in different ways. Each is
appropriate to its own situation. In English - especially English in the U.S. - writers are often
very direct and move from one point to the next without digression ("digression" is when you
start writing about something that is not related to your topic). This can be distracting, and it
can confuse your reader.

 EXERCISE 2

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the paragraph. Draw a line through sentences that are unnecessary.

                     Choosing a cell phone plan can be confusing. When you pick a phone
          plan, it's important to think about how much you use your phone. Too much
          time on a phone means you don't have enough time to do your homework. If
          you use a lot of data for things like music and videos, then you might need a
          plan with more data. It's also good to think about how many calls and texts you
          make. Text messages are usually quicker than phone calls. If you make a lot of
          international calls or texts, for example, then you might want a plan in which
          those things are free. There are also other things to think about, such as if the
          plan has any special deals or perks. For example, Samsung phones have good
          cameras. In the end, the best cell phone plan is the one that fits your needs
          and your budget.

 CREATING COHERENCE

Coherence in an essay is when all the parts of the essay
fit together and make sense. It's like when you put
together a puzzle: all the pieces need to fit together in
the right way to create a complete picture. In an essay,
coherence means that the ideas are connected and
flow smoothly from one to the next. It also means that
the essay has a clear structure, with an introduction,
body, and conclusion that all work together to support
the main idea or thesis of the essay. Coherence is
important because it helps the reader understand the
essay and follow the writer's train of thought.

You already studied many transitions that help to
connect ideas. Look at the chart on the next two pages
to see which ones you recognize and which ones are new to you.

Another part of coherence is making sure the order of information makes sense to your
reader. We have studied three types of essays that depend on the order of information:

      Narrative essays tell a story. Usually this is from the beginning. The action is
          chronological. Sometimes the story might have a flashback or even a "flash forward",
          but the pattern of organization is chronological. It's all about how events connect over
          time.

      Process essays tell how to do something or how something is done or made. This is
          similar to chronological, but it's more like instructions to the reader. We call this
          sequential. A person needs to do this before they do that. This must happen before
          that can happen.

      Compare and contrast essays have both block and point-by-point options. These
          patterns of organization help to show the relationship between things- same or
          different.

 INFORMAL AND FORMAL WRITING

There are two different types of writing: informal and formal. Informal writing is often used in
personal or casual situations, like writing an email to a friend, a post on social media, or a
self-reflection in class. Informal writing is personal and relaxed. Formal writing, on the other
hand, is often used in academic or professional settings. It is more serious and follows
specific rules. It uses a more careful language in order to be clear, precise, and often
objective or neutral. Formal writing also has a specific structure or format. It is important to
use the right type of writing for the right situation.

 EXERCISE 6

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the two paragraphs below. Which is formal? Which is informal? How do
you know?

Here are some other methods you can use when you need to write in a more formal style:
      Use standard grammar and mechanics. This includes spelling, punctuation,
          capitalization.
      Write in the third person. This is not only he/she/it/they but also words like students,
          workers, citizens, etc.
      Avoid slang. Find alternatives to bummer, cool, and awesome.
      Avoid language that is overly casual. Write about men and women rather than girls
          and guys unless you are trying to create a specific effect.
      Avoid contractions. Use do not in place of don't, I am in place of I'm, have not in place
          of haven't, and so on.
      Avoid clichés. Overused expressions such as think outside the box, face the music,
          better late than never, and similar expressions are empty of meaning and may be
          confusing.
      Be careful when you use words that sound alike but have different meanings. Some
          common examples are: affect/effect, accept/except, and principle/principal.
      Use specific words rather than overly general words. Find synonyms for things,
          humans, nice, good, bad, some, a lot, a little, big, small, interesting, and other vague
          words. Or use specific details to make your exact meaning clear.

 EXERCISE 7

INSTRUCTIONS: Read the informal paragraph below. Rewrite it in a more formal style.

                     Learning to play the piano can be a cool thing to do! It's not always a
          piece of cake at first, but with some elbow grease and a chill attitude, you'll get
          better and better. One of the best ways to learn is to take lessons from a
          teacher who knows their stuff. They can show you how to sit at the piano and
          how to read music. It might seem kinda tough at first, but the more you
          practice, the easier it gets. And when you're able to play your favorite songs, it
          will be a lot of fun! Just remember to take it easy on yourself and have a good
          time! As the old cliche goes, "Practice makes perfect!

 EXERCISE 8

INSTRUCTIONS: Edit this draft of a formal academic essay. What big changes would you
recommend to the writer? Remember: This is not proofreading; don't worry about grammar
or mechanics yet. Focus on content and structure/organization. Consider these questions:

      What information is not necessary? What should the author omit (delete)?
      What information is missing? What would be useful to add?
      Are the paragraphs in the best order? If not, what order would be better?
      Are the sentences in each paragraph in the best order? If not, what order would be

          better?
      Does the information flow well? What transition words or phrases would help?
      How can the essay have a more formal tone?

                                                      Are you curious about how tofu is made? Do you
                                               want to know how to make it at home? Tofu is a tasty
                                               and healthy protein source, and it's actually pretty
                                               easy to make. In this essay, we'll walk you through the
                                               steps of how to make tofu from scratch. By the end,
                                               you'll know all the steps to make your own tofu at
                                               home. So, let's get started!
                                               Basically, you use a blender or food processor to grind
          the soaked soybeans into a smooth paste. You bring a pot of water to a boil
          and add the soybean paste. Cook it for a while, stirring constantly.
                     First, though, you need to start with some soybeans. You'll also need
          some water and a coagulant, like nigari or gypsum. To begin, soak the
          soybeans in water for a while; this helps to soften them up.
                     You have cooked it a little, it's time to add the coagulant. To separate
          the curds from the rest of the mixture, use a cheesecloth or fine mesh strainer.
          Press the curds into a block or mold to remove excess liquid. Let the block of
          tofu cool, then cut it into the shape and size you want. The coagulant helps the
          mixture start to curdle; just stir it in until you see the curds forming.
                     Making tofu at home is not difficult and it can be a fun and rewarding
          experience. By following these simple steps, you can make your own tofu and
          enjoy it in a variety of dishes. Whether you're a vegan looking for protein
          sources or just want to try something new, making tofu is a great way to add
          variety to your meals. So why not give it a try and see how easy it is to make
          your own tofu at home?

FOCUS ON PROOFREADING

 FOUR MOST COMMON GRAMMAR ERRORS

Although there are many rules for English grammar, there are four very common errors in
ESOL writing. If you focus on learning to find and correct these four errors, your writing will
improve significantly. Practice them here, and then look for them in your essays.

 Subject-verb agreement errors

When you write in the simple present tense, the subject and the verb must agree in number.
In other words, a singular subject requires a singular verb form, and a plural subject requires
a plural verb form. Here are some examples:

Singular:  The car is red.    Beth likes cake.               He studies English.
Plural:    The cars are red.  Beth and Sheila like cake.     They study English.

 EXERCISE 9

INSTRUCTIONS: Proofread each sentence carefully. Correct the subject-verb agreement
errors. Be careful: Not all sentences contain errors.

     1. The group of students are going to the museum on Saturday.
     2. She and her friend was at the park yesterday.
     3. The cat and the dog chases the birds outside.
     4. Mavis rides her motorcycle to school when the weather is warm and dry.
     5. The team of scientists were studying the data for hours.
     6. Maria like to read books and write stories.
     7. Who are you going to invite to the party?
     8. A company in the United States must have a license to do business.
     9. Where is they going to go tomorrow?
     10. People in Oregon wants to be happy.

 Fragments

Fragments are pieces. They are not whole. A fragment in writing is a piece of a sentence. It is
not a complete sentence. This often happens when a writer does not connect a dependent
clause to an independent clause. Sometimes this happens when a writer does not add a
subject to the sentence. Sometimes even a verb can be missing. Without a subject, a verb,
and a complete idea, the sentence does not make sense. You can fix fragments by adding
more information to make a complete idea, or connecting it to the sentence before or after it
- often as a dependent clause. Here are some examples:

Missing subject:        There are many things at the store. Are expensive.
Missing verb:           There are many things at the store. They expensive.
Missing complete idea:  Many things at the store. They are expensive, too.
Correct:                There are many things at the store. They are expensive.

 EXERCISE 10

INSTRUCTIONS: Proofread each sentence carefully. Correct the fragment errors. Be careful:
Not all sentences contain errors.

     1. Because it was raining outside and the streets were flooded.
     2. Being hungry and craving a slice of pizza.
     3. My story is clear because I wrote it carefully.
     4. After the movie and we left the theater.
     5. While waiting for the bus, I watched the people passing by.
     6. Until the sun comes up and the sky turns pink and orange.
     7. His best effort to the broken toy.
     8. Until the work is finished and we can go home.
     9. The workers want to form a union in order to get a better salary.
     10. Always want to leave early.

 Run-on sentences and comma splices

A run-on sentence is when you use two independent clauses in one sentence without

conjunctions or enough punctuation. This makes it difficult for readers to know where the first

idea ends and the second one begins. For example:

Run-on:        I don't like that textbook it is not very helpful.

Comma splice:  I went to the store to buy some milk and bread, I forgot my wallet

               and had to go back home.

There are simple ways to fix both of these errors:
      add a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS: for, and nor, but, or, yet, so)
                 Example: I don't like that textbook, for it is not very helpful.
                 Example: I went to the store to buy some milk and bread, but I forgot my wallet
                     and had to go back home.
      use a semicolon
                 Example: I don't like that textbook; it is not very helpful.
                 Example: I went to the store to buy some milk and bread; I forgot my wallet and
                     had to go back home.
      use a period and start a new sentence
                 Example: I don't like that textbook. It is not very helpful.
                 Example: I went to the store to buy some milk and bread. I forgot my wallet and
                     had to go back home.
      change part of the sentence to a dependent clause
                 Example: I don't like that textbook because it is not very helpful.
                 Example: I went to the store to buy some milk and bread before I realized that I
                     forgot my wallet and had to go back home.

 EXERCISE 11

INSTRUCTIONS: Proofread each sentence carefully. Correct the run-on or comma splice
errors. Be careful: Not all sentences contain errors.

     1. I was running late for work, I forgot my keys.
     2. Mary asked about our job we work for Amazon.
     3. She finished her homework, she watched TV.
     4. The concert was amazing the music was so loud the lights were flashing and the

          crowd was dancing.
     5. The concert was amazing, the music was so loud.
     6. The boys played soccer in the park the girls threw the frisbee back and forth and

          climbed the jungle gym.
     7. The state of Oregon is one of the states on the West Coast of North America.
     8. Helena sings children's songs at the library she is an excellent musician.
     9. She finished her homework and studied for her test.

 CAPITALIZATION

Capitalization can be difficult if the rules in English are different from the rules in your first
language. Here are a few basic guidelines:

      Proper nouns: Proper nouns are specific names of people, places, and things, and
          they should always be capitalized. For example, "John," "New York," and "Portland" are
          all proper nouns and should be capitalized. This includes the names of months and
          days of the week.
                 Example: My teacher Tim is from Portland, and our class is on Tuesdays and
                     Thursdays from January through March.

      Common nouns: Common nouns are general names of people, places, and things,
          and they should not be capitalized. For example, "teacher," "city," and "week" are all
          common nouns and should not be capitalized.
                 Example: The city of Portland is in Oregon, which became a state in 1859.

      The word "I": In English, the word "I" should always be capitalized when it refers to
          oneself.
                 Example: I wonder what I will do when I grow up?

      The first word in a sentence: In English, the first word of a sentence should always be
          capitalized.
                 Example: This is a sentence. This is another sentence. Here is one more.

      The first word in a quotation: In English, the first word of a quotation should be
          capitalized, even if it is in the middle of a sentence. However, this is only if the
          quotation itself is a complete sentence. If it is just a fragment, then don't capitalize the
          first word.
                 Example: My mother always said, "Patience is a virtue." I changed it to say
                     patience is "virtual".

      Titles: For titles of essays, books, magazines, etc., always capitalize the first letter of
          each word in the title except for articles, conjunctions, and prepositions (unless they
          are the first word of the title; we always capitalize the first word of a title).
                 Example: The Joy of Baking and Other Things in the Kitchen

 EXERCISE 12

INSTRUCTIONS: Fix the capitalization of each item below.

     1. the title of my book is the time I spent working for the railroad in canada.

     2. taylor swift once said, "if you're lucky enough to be different, never change".

     3. portland community college is located in portland, oregon. it is the largest college or

          university in the state.

     4. i asked jason, "what is the title of your essay?" he replied, a bridge over the river.

     5. because i was sick, i didn't go to school in june, but i hope to return in september.

 SPELLING

There are dozens of spelling rules in English - and almost none of them are 100%. There are so
many exceptions! If your teacher allows you to use a spellchecker, then be sure it is turned on
and set to English. It will then highlight words it thinks are wrong, and it will suggest a
correction. But review these suggestions carefully because they are not always right, either!
More importantly, a spell checker doesn't catch everything; the wrong word might still be
spelled correctly. In addition to setting up your spell checker for English, here are some other
suggestions:

      Look at one line at a time; cover the rest of the paper with a sheet of paper or a ruler.
      Move a pencil or pen carefully under each line of text to focus on words one at a time.
      Be especially careful of words that have tricky letter combinations, such as ei/ie.
      Take special care of homonyms like your/you're, to/too/two, and there/their/they're,

          as your spell checker will not recognize these as errors.
      Think about when you make errors in pronunciation, too, and make sure to review

          those words carefully. For example, if you do not always pronounce the ends of words,
          such as -s and -ed, you might not write those letters either.

 EXERCISE 13

INSTRUCTIONS: Correct the spelling errors in the sentences below. There is one error in each
sentence.

     1. Doing research at a libary can be a helpful way to find information on a specific topic.
     2. You can use the library's online resourses, like databases and e-books, to search for

          information.
     3. It can also be helpful to ask a librarian for assistance in finding specifec sources or

          information.
     4. You can use the library's computers or your own device to ackcess research materials.
     5. It's important to properly cite any sources you use in your research to give credit to the

          original riders.
     6. The library may have physical copies of books or articles that you can check out and

          reed.
     7. You can also request materials from other libraries thrugh the interlibrary loan service.
     8. It can be helpful to take notes and organize your research as you go to keep track of

          your progres.
     9. Research can be done individually or in a group, depending on your preference and

          the project requirments.
     10. The library is a great place to find a variety of sources, including academic articles,

          books, websits, and more.

Amalgamation - Unit 5: Good Writing Is Rewriting  17
 PUNCTUATION

Punctuation is not usually a significant problem, but there are still frequent errors that can be
easily fixed. Most errors are about spaces or commas. Here are some common things to think
about:

      Always put a space after a period or question mark at the end of a sentence. Never
          leave a space before a period or question mark at the end of a sentence.

      Always put a space after a comma (except in a number, of course), colon, or
          semicolon. Never leave a space before a comma, colon, or semicolon.

      If an acronym or initials use periods, then don't forget the final one, such as U.S.
      Use commas after a dependent clause or phrase at the beginning of a sentence.

          Don't use commas before a dependent clause or phrase at the end of a sentence.
      Use commas before a coordinating conjunction (FANBOYS) in a compound sentence.
      Never leave a space after an opening parenthesis or quotation mark. Never leave a

          space before a closing parentheses or quotation mark.
      Use commas around non-restrictive (non-essential) adjective clauses.
      To show possession, use -'s for singular nouns and -s' for plural nouns.

 EXERCISE 14

INSTRUCTIONS: Correct the punctuation errors in the sentences below. There may be more
than one error in each sentence.

     1. Oregon is a state located on the west coast of the U.S
     2. Oregon was admitted as a state in 1859 , wasn't it ?
     3. Before it became a state, Oregon was explored by various

          European countries, including Spain Britain and Russia
     4. In the early 1800s American settlers began to migrate to

          Oregon along the Oregon Trail.
     5. Oregons economy has traditionally been based on

          agriculture, forestry, and fishing.
     6. The state is also home to a number of Native American tribes which are the Chinook,

          Klamath, and Nez Perce.
     7. The motto (saying ) of Oregon is " She flies with her own wings " .
     8. Portland Oregon's largest city is known for its vibrant arts and culture scene.
     9. The states history also includes a strong labor movement favoring unions.

 FORMATTING

The rules for formatting can be different in every class and
every teacher. So be sure to read and follow the instructions
carefully. It's helpful to look at a model or sample essay and
make yours look the same. Here are some things to think
about:

      Headers: Often they will include your last name, then
          a space, and then the automatic page number. They
          are usually at the top of every page in the right-hand
          corner.

      First page information: This will usually include your
          full name, class, assignment, and complete date in
          the upper left-hand corner of the first page (not in the
          header; below the header). The lines should be double-spaced.

      Titles: The essay title should be centered on the line after the first page information.
          Don't leave a blank line before or after the title. Don't bold the title. Use the "center"
          button to place the text automatically. Capitalize every word except conjunctions,
          prepositions, and articles (unless it is the first word; we always capitalize the first
          word). Most titles do not use a period, but if they are a question, then a question mark
          is added at the end. Quotation marks and italics are not necessary unless you include
          quoted words or titles of other sources, which is very rare.

      Margins: One-inch space is normal on all four sides of the paper.
      Double-space lines: Have the computer do this for you.
      Page numbers: See "Headers" above.
      Indented paragraphs: The first line of each paragraph should be indented. Use your

          computer's TAB key to do this (not the spacebar).
      Lines and spaces: Do not leave blank lines between paragraphs or multiple spaces

          between words or sentences.
      Sources: If your teacher requires you to list your sources of information, these usually

          start a new page at the end of the essay. Ask your teacher for specific requirements.
      Font: The style of letters is usually Times Roman or Arial, and the size is usually 10 or 12.

   "Plant-Based Power: A Vegan vs. Vegetarian Showdown"

    Are you considering switching to a plant-based diet but not sure which
   one is right for you? Vegan and vegetarian diets are both types of
   plant-based diets that do not include meat. There are some important
   di erences to consider before making a decision.
   Vegan diets exclude all animal products, including meat, dairy, and eggs.
   This means that vegans do not consume any animal-derived ingredients
   and do not use any animal-based products, such as leather or wool. Vegan
   diets can be healthy and provide all the necessary nutrients if they are
   properly planned.
   Vegetarian diets, on the other hand, do not include meat but may include
   other animal products like dairy and eggs. There are several types of
   vegetarian diets, including lacto-vegetarian (includes dairy but not eggs),
   ovo-vegetarian (includes eggs but not dairy), and lacto-ovo vegetarian
   (includes both dairy and eggs). Vegetarian diets can also be healthy if they
   are well-planned and include a variety of plant-based foods.
   In conclusion, both vegan and vegetarian diets are plant-based and do not
   include meat. However, vegan diets exclude all animal products, while
   vegetarian diets may include dairy and eggs. Both can be healthy choices if
   they are properly planned and include a variety of nutrients.

                 Oregon is a state located on the west coast of the United States. It's known for
      it's diverse landscape, which includes everything from mountains and forests to
      beaches and deserts. The state is also home to a number of national parks, including
      Crater Lake National Park and Mount Hood National Forest. Although the moon is
      made of cheese, this essay is about Oregon.
                 One of the biggest cities in Oregon is Portland, which is known for it's co ee
      culture, rainy weather, and progressive population. I like co ee better than tea, so
      that's good. There's many things to do in Portland. Visiting the Portland Art Museum,
      going to a Portland Trailblazers basketball game or Portland Timbers soccer game, or
      checking out the arts and crafst at the Portland Saturday Market. Portland is a great
      place to begin a visit to Oregon.
                 But the real beauty of Oregon is in it's natural wanders. The state is home to
      the Columbia River Gorge, which is a beautiful area with hiking trails and waterfalls.
      There are several mountains. Including Mount Hood. Eastern Oregon has desserts and
      farms. And the Oregon Coast is also a must-see, it has a rugged coastline and beautiful
      beaches.
                 The capital city of Oregon is Salem, which is located in the willamette valley.
      Salem is a smaller city compared to Portland, nor it's still a great place to visit.
      There's a lot of history in Salem, and there's also a large number of parks and outdoor
      recreation opportunities.
                 Overall, Oregon is a great state to visit or live in. There's a lot of variety in the
      landscape, and there's always something new to discover. Plus, the people in Oregon
      are generally very friendly and welcoming. A visit to Oregon will always delivery a
      good time.
