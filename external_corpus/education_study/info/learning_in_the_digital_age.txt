This book is a work in progress; and I hope it remains that way in
perpetuity. This book is a minor attempt to contribute to the vast
repository of Open Educational Resources. It is aimed to serve as a
textbook for classes exploring the nature of learning in the digital
age. The genesis of this book is a desire to use OERs in all my
teachings, coupled with the realization that the resources that I was
looking for were not available and as such I needed to contribute in
creating them.

   In August 2015 I began teaching a course called learning in the
digital age at Oklahoma state university. I inherited the course
which has been part of the educational technology program.
Broadly, the aim is to expose students to research, theory, and
practice to build a foundational understanding of digital learning.
The focus is specifically on how technology, influences, mitigate,
and support learning practices and processes.

   Over the years many themes have emerged. For example, one
of the assignment `my life without,' the students comment on a
technology they could not live without. A common theme that
emerges is the value we placed on mobile devices. Not surprisingly
most of us cannot imagine life without smartphones, tablets, etc.
Yet, in education we tend to deny our learners the very tool that
we find hard to live without. This brought up questions on If mobile
devices/social media are crucial, why then do we not make most of
them in our teaching and learning practices? Other questions that
inevitably follow are: what happens to those who cannot access the
tools necessary to learn in the digital age? Do we just leave them
behind? How about the adult learners who feel intimidated by the
tools?

   When discussing learning in the digital age, most focus on the
technology first. However, the emphasis made in this book and
the class is that it's about the learner not just the technology.
One of the things that is easy to lose track of when talking about
learning in the digital age is the learner. Technology is important
and it has significant impact but it is still about the person who is
LEARNING IN THE DIGITAL AGE                            3

using the technology. Many people conflate learning in the digital
age with technology in today's age. This important misconception
is common and results from our failure to examine our
understanding of what "learning" really is. Of course, Most of this
depends on a person's epistemology. There are numerous
definitions of what learning is and often they come to how a person
sees the world. Some argue that learning is about a change in
behavior due to experiences, others state simply that learning is
being able to do something new that you were not able to do
before. Regardless of what side you choose, to understand what
learning in the digital age is, one has to understand what learning
itself is.

   As I said at the beginning, this book is a work in progress; and
I hope it remains that way in perpetuity. This means that the
chapters in the book are not designed to be the final note on
any issues (not sure if any text is ever finite). The chapters in this
book are varied, covering topics from games, digital divide, finance,
proctoring and many others. The authors where given freedom to
interpret what learning in the digital age means to them and to
cover topics that they believe relate to the topic. The hope is that
the reader gets ideas from the text and contributes their voice in
terms of suggestions or their own chapters. This is only the first
version, with more chapters to come. I hope further editions will
continue to add to the repository of OERs and our understanding
of Learning in the digital Age.

   I am immensely thankful to the authors for sharing their ideas
freely and for the reviewers who volunteered their time to give
feedback.

OpenOKState Student Privacy
Guidelines

OpenOKState and the OSU Libraries Library Teaching and Learning
(T&L) Team* strive to enable engaging learning experiences for
students using a variety of digital resources**. When you--the
student--use these resources, you're likely to produce some data,
such as data about how you used the resources (e.g., what you
clicked on) or the content you produced while using the resources
(e.g., answering a question).

   In line with our values and our beliefs about student data privacy,
our T&L team has created and closely follows a set of guidelines,
made up of 5 core principles, for any type of student data we might
come in contact with.

   We aim to be exceedingly transparent with you about your
data. On this page, you can learn about our team's values and
beliefs regarding student data privacy as well as explore the 5 core
principles of our Student Data Privacy Guidelines.

   If you have any questions about these guidelines or about your
data privacy, please don't hesitate to contact the Director of Library
Teaching and Learning, Holly Reiter, at holly.reiter@okstate.edu.

   *The data and Guidelines referenced on this page are unique to
Library Teaching & Learning, and do not indicate guidelines for the
Library or the University as a whole.

   **For our purposes, digital learning objects include interactive

LEARNING IN THE DIGITAL AGE  7

        · Enable student data privacy literacy

CORE PRINCIPLES OF STUDENT DATA PRIVACY

RESPONSIBILITY

The Teaching and Learning team believes it's our ethical
responsibility to protect your data privacy. Specifically, we uphold
the responsibility to:

        · Ensure any collected data is handled carefully, used
            effectively, and used only for the stated purpose.

        · Prevent unauthorized disclosure, use, or collection of
            your data

        · Follow specific steps in data collection, use, storage, and
            destruction.

        · Carry a shared understanding of our role in your data
            privacy.

TRANSPARENCY

T&L believes you shouldn't have to wonder what's happening with
your data, so we strive to be as open and transparent with you
as possible. For each digital learning object we use, we'll share the
following:

        · What we are and are not collecting
        · Why we're collecting it
        · How it's being collected
        · How it's being used
        · Who has access to the data
8  TUTALENI I. ASINO

To keep you safe, we strive to store and process all data according
to best practices. We'll only collect the minimum amount of data
necessary to achieve our stated objectives.

PRIVACY AND CONSENT

T&L believes that privacy is your right. We strive to honor your
privacy by never releasing any personally identifiable information
unless it is to your instructor of record who is using the digital
learning object within their class.

   Occasionally, we may share aggregates of de-identified or
anonymized data internally (e.g., with Library administrators) or
externally (e.g., at Library or industry conferences). We do this to
continuously improve effectiveness, evaluate the effectiveness of
our teaching and learning program, or to help evolve and shape
the practices of our profession. Aggregating the data means that
the data is in summary form and no individual student can be
identified.

   Finally, we will never sell or otherwise commodify your data, and
will always prioritize the use of vendors and resources that do the
same.

CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY

T&L takes great strides to ensure that any and all data we collect is
kept confidential and secure.

   We use several vendors to help us create and host digital learning
objects and collect analytics. Sometimes, these vendors have
access to your personally identifiable information for operational
purposes, so we intentionally investigate and select vendors that
also prioritize confidentiality and security.
LEARNING IN THE DIGITAL AGE  9

ACCESS

Sometimes we do collect and store personally identifiable
information so we can do things like retain records for your
instructor of record or keep track of event registrations. In these
cases, T&L believes you have the right to know what that data is,
request corrections if you think it's incorrect, and request that it
be deleted. Please note, we'll always make every effort to honor
deletion requests, but sometimes we're required to retain records
for various reasons. If that's the case, we'll be open about why we
can't delete it now, and if and when it can be deleted.

CHAPTER 1

Board games and learning: Why
care in the digital age?

Board games and learning: Why care in the digital age?
REBECCA BAYECK, PHD, PENN STATE UNIVERSITY

The Pennsylvania State University

   Abstract. The renaissance of board games in the digital age is
sometimes attributed to the multiplication of board game channels on
Youtube (Muench, 2017), or to the need to socialize and interact in
person (Jolin, 2016). Today, board gameplay is not only livestreamed
on platforms such as Twitch.Tv, but sites such as boardgamegeek,
and gaming conventions such as Gen Con create a space for board
gamers to interact and keep up with the latest happening in the board
game community/industry. . Though board gameplay is breaking into
mainstream, studies on the different learning spaces in the digital era
are still dominated by environments enriched with digital tools such as
video games (Carter, Gibbs & Harrop, 2014a). Drawing on board game
literature, this chapter discusses board games and how the resurgence
of these games in the 21st century may provide an opportunity to
understand learning in the digital age.

                                                               13

INTRODUCTION.

The rising trend of board gameplay in recent years puzzles many
observers of the popular culture. In a technology-driven society,
and in a time when important interactions are preferably delegated
to technology (Turkle, 2012), the revival of board games (Graham,
2016) is intriguing as well as interesting. According to Euromonitor
International, a global market research firm, the global sales of
board games reached $9.6 billion in 2016, with board games such
as Settlers of Catan selling more than $80 million in the United
States (Graham, 2016). Board games are becoming for families,
children, and young adults, a way to socialize and a common
entertainment (Graham, 2016). Kay (2018) writes that U.S. sales of
board games increased by 28% between 2016 and 2017 and will
grow at a similar rate by 2020. The resurgence of board games in
this age certainly denotes a need to explore the revival of board
games in the United States in the era of video games. Paraphrasing
James Gee, in this chapter, I interrogate board gameplay in an
attempt to address the following question: what do board games
have to tell us about learning in the digital age?

   Oxford online dictionary defines board games as games that
include the movement of counters or other objects round a board.
These games are certainly different from video games because
they include moving pieces on a premarked physical board
(Berland & Lee, 2011). It should be noted that some board games
such as Mysterium, Songo, Oware, Through the Ages: A New Story of
Civilization, and Lords of Waterdeep have been digitized (Ekwè, 2005;
Marks & Thrower, 2018). Yet, the board game renaissance is driven
by children and adults (Jolin, 2016; Kay, 2018). Furthermore, the
development of games such as German-style board games1 (e.g.,
Settlers of Catan and Pandemic) that prioritize action and encourage
the optimization of limited resources (Kapp, 2018), also explain this
resurrection.

   Prior to discussing the relationship between board games and
BOARD GAMES AND LEARNING: WHY CARE IN THE DIGITAL 15
AGE?

learning in the digital age, it is critical to explain that the notion of
board game resurgence in this century is specific to the Western
world (e.g., United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany). In
Africa, and particularly in Cameroon, board gameplay has been a
popular activity for centuries, and as such, the notion of board
game resurgence in the digital age may not be applied to Africa,
and specifically to Cameroon. The digital age refers to the wide
use of digital technology in almost all aspects of human activities,
including economic, social, and political interactions (Adomi, 2008;
Wang & Torrisi-Steele, 2016). In other words, the digital age is
characterized by digital technology shaping the way people live and
interact (Ngelime, 2018). Though Africa has creatively embraced
the digital age and can no longer be viewed as out of digital age
world (Ngelime, 2018), board games have always been popular
in different communities or ethnic groups (Nxumalo & Mncube,
2018).

LEARNING AND BOARD GAMES IN THE DIGITAL
AGE

Despite the resurgence of board games, they are mostly
researched as artifacts or objects of art , and not as spaces for
learning (Bayeck, 2017; Wise, 2018). Nevertheless, some
researchers have started exploring board games as learning spaces
(Berland & Lee, 2012; Carter et al., 2014) to uncover their learning
potential (Bayeck, 2017; Carter, Harrop & Gibbs, 2014a). Such
research deviates from the long-standing tradition in game studies
that conceived board games as spaces to mine for the design of
digital games to enhance players' gaming experiences (Xu, Barba,
Radu, Gandy & MacIntyre, 2011; Zagal, Rick & Hsi, 2006). As Carter
et al. (2014b) explain:

   The limited number of studies which solely focus on the
attraction and experience of non-digital games presents the
16  TUTALENI I. ASINO

possibility that without a firm foundational understanding of the
[board game] game experience, and the role that the physicality
of this experience plays in the enjoyment of the game (highlighted
as being important), essential elements of the experience may be
overlooked or diminished in digital augmentation (p. 7).

   Consequently, without an examination of board gameplay, the
learning experiences board games offer to players are likely to be
overlooked. In the following paragraphs, I discuss few studies on
board games to highlight learning occurring in board gameplay,
and to point to board games as spaces for learning that is relevant
in the 21st century.

   In their study of Warhammer 40,0002 (W40K) board game, Carter
et al. (2014a) described players' multiple activities that evidenced
critical thinking, as well as strategic thinking. For instance, players
researched narratives behind each army prior to drafting their
army by using external resources such as books developed by the
developers of the game (Carter et al., 2014a). Players also studied
the characters prior to drafting their army by using fictional books
about the game, and simulated their readings during their
gameplay (Carter et al., 2014a). In addition, players developed their
own gameplay strategy based on their preconception of how the
game will unfold (Carter et al., 2014a). I argue that W40K practices
as described in Carter et al. (2014a) involved a learning process
that increased gameplay experience and motivation. For example,
in researching players and the different armies' narratives, players
acquired research skills, while gaining more information about the
characters and the armies. Playing also meant engaging in
decision-making (e.g., drafting the army), and in strategic thinking
as they created their own gameplay strategy (Carter et al., 2014a).
Though a pastime, W40K activities engage players in learning that
is pleasant and fun. Hence, the process of selecting characters,
building the army, and using external resources is an illustration of
players' engagement in contextualized meaning making practices,
or literacy practices. Indeed, from a sociocultural perspective,
BOARD GAMES AND LEARNING: WHY CARE IN THE DIGITAL 17
AGE?

participation in practices related to the gameplay as well as
interacting with others is learning (Lantolf, 2000; Nasir & Hand,
2006).

     Figure 1. Warhammer 40.000 adapted from Games Workshop
   Berland and Lee (2012) explored Pandemic3 (Figure 2), a
collaborative board game in which players team up to fight
diseases and keep the world safe. The authors show that players
engaged in complex computational thinking activities distributed
among participants (Berland & Lee, 2012). For instance, players
collaborated to understand their actions, and engaged in
significant crosstalk during gameplay (Berland & Lee, 2012).
Consequently, Pandemic created a space for players to participate
in learning activities that included computational thinking practices,
and collaboration. Board games are therefore useful spaces for
learning and practicing skills that are important for everyday life in
the digital age.
18  TUTALENI I. ASINO

             Figure 2. Pandemic adapted from Anderson (2016).
   With regards to learning, it is important to also consider non-
western board games. However, empirical studies of board games
and learning in non-western contexts such as Africa are still
extremely limited (Bayeck, 2017; Mkondiwa, 2019). Nevertheless, as
mentioned earlier, the notion of resurgence of board games in the
digital age cannot unquestionably be applied to Africa. Africa has
a long tradition of board gameplay. Board games such as Oware,
Songo, and Bao (Bayeck, 2017; BBC, 2016; Mawere, 2013) are
ancient African board games that require "high degree of
intelligence and vigilance when playing [them]" (Mawere, 2013,
p.11). According to Mawere (2013) board gameplay constituted one
of the educational strategies used in precolonial Africa. Though
empirical studies on African board gameplay are practically
nonexistent, description of strategic games such as Songo4 (Figure
3) evidences that the gameplay involves complex thinking and
strategies to outwit the adversary (Meka, 2008; Owona, 2004).
BOARD GAMES AND LEARNING: WHY CARE IN THE DIGITAL 19
AGE?

         Figure 3. Songo board game adapted from Owona (2004)
   Songo gameplay involves the use of proverbs as a means to
demonstrate players' level of expertise, fast and complex
calculations (Njock, 1985; Mbarg Owona, 2004). Building on
Owona's (2004) and Njock's (1985) descriptions of the gameplay, it
is clear that Songo gameplay involves practices that create learning
opportunities for players. For instance, counting seeds/pebbles,
strategizing to beat the opponent, and engaging in an exchange
of proverbs (implying communication as well as language learning)
are instances of learning and literacy practices embedded in this
ancient African game that are relevant in the digital age. Hence, as
competitiveness, strategy, and communication are critical in Songo
gameplay, so are these ideas important in the digital age. Reflecting
on another board game called Tsoro5 (Figure 4), Mawere (2013)
writes:
   In fact the players have to think quickly and clearly in order
to outwit the opponent. This means that the game is meant to
develop and sharpen the [player's] intellectual faculty such that s/
he [develops] the aptitude to manoeuvre different situations in real
life. (p.11).
20  TUTALENI I. ASINO

       Figure 4. Tsoro board game adapted from http://home.kpn.nl/
                            wasse257/tsoro/expl_gb.htm

   Drawing from the discussion above, there is no doubt that
exploring board gameplay is relevant for understanding learning
in the digital age. Indeed, non-digital environments such as board
games can allow for learning skills that have been strongly
associated with digital technology (e.g., computational thinking).
Moreover, board games tell us that learning in the digital age is
also about interactions, and community. Players value the social
component of board games that allows in-person interaction, and
reduces isolation (Graham, 2016; Jolin, 2016). Considering that
learning occurs in this space, I argue that learning is facilitated
in environments that allow, or are designed for interactions to
happen among learners, and for spaces that limit the isolation of
individuals in the learning process. While Peerutin (2017) views the
rise of board games as a counterpoint to the digital trend, a "desire
BOARD GAMES AND LEARNING: WHY CARE IN THE DIGITAL 21
AGE?

to switch off from the harsh and anxiety-producing reality of the
real world", I argue that the resurgence can shape learning in this
age. Quoting a player, Matson (2018) writes:

   While the internet is a great thing, sitting down and playing with
friends and family is becoming increasingly important. Having time
away from our phones and computers where we can talk, play and
enjoy time together is something board games let us do.

   A first glance at this statement seems to indicate that board
game players want to stay away from digital technologies.
However, a closer look at this statement also unravels a desire
to interact, to be in an environment that enhances togetherness.
This understanding is for instance supported by the livestreaming
of board gameplay on Twitch.Tv, which shows that staying away
from digital tools, is not the only and predominant attraction of
board games for players. The social component of board games
can inform the design of learning settings in the 21st century.

CONCLUSION

With the resurgence of board games, especially in the Western
world, in the era of social media, digital games, and other forms
of digitally-mediated human interactions, I discuss in this chapter
learning in the digital age through board games. I contend that
limiting the rise of board games to the need for players to interact
in person, away from digital tools, may prevent researchers,
designers, and educators from engaging with what that may mean
for learning in the era of digital technology. The revival of board
games gives us insights into learning and learners today; it tells
us about learning in the digital age. As much as digital games'
popularity has drawn the interest of educational researchers, the
rise of board games in the digital era calls for greater exploration
of learning in these spaces, and their potential to inform learning,
and the design of learning settings in this age.

WHAT IS BLENDED LEARNING?

According to Horn and Staker (2015), "Blended learning is any
formal education program in which a student learns at least in
part through online learning, with some element of student control
over time, place, path, and/or pace" (p. 34). Blended learning
environments are also commonly referred to as "hybrid" courses
or classes. Any mixture of online learning and face-to-face (or
traditional) settings can be classified as "blended learning." For the
purposes of this paper, the terms "blended" and "hybrid" will be
used synonymously.

   Learning in the digital age means learning can happen at anytime
from anywhere. Therefore, blended environments are becoming
more and more prevalent in the world of education. Such learning
environments are typically thought of as evolving in higher
education. In fact, The University of Potomac communicated that
6,700,000 students were enrolled in online courses in 2014 (2017).
Additionally, Lehman and Conceição (2014) reported, "Participation
in online courses has grown by 358% since 2003 (p. 4). The demand
for online learning opportunities is growing and will only continue
to grow as time goes on.

   However, these blended learning environments are making their
way down into the land of high school and elementary education.
Lips (2010) reported, "As many as 1 million children (roughly 2
percent of the K-12 student population) are participating in some
form of online learning" (para. 3). The learning settings include fully
online as well as blended learning programs. The potential benefits
of blended learning, in particular, are causing K-12 schools to take
notice and explore implementation of blended learning models.

WHY BLENDED LEARNING?

It is no secret that the education system of the United States is
28  TUTALENI I. ASINO

failing students. This is likely due to the fact that society is changing
and the world is evolving, but the education system is the same as
it was over two centuries ago. Back in the 19th century, the goal
of the school system was to prepare students for jobs in factories,
mills and other labor-driven employment. Hence, the development
of a "factory system" of education. Students were placed in groups
according to their age (without regard for learning needs or
abilities). All students were taught the same thing, at the same
time, in the same way as if they were on a conveyor belt. This
type of education worked then because the goal was different
than it is now. Now, 200 years later, the goal of the education
system has changed, but the model has not. As Horn and Staker
(2015) explained, "Today's factory model of education, in which we
batch students in classes and teach the same thing on the same
day, is an ineffective way for most children to learn" (p. 8). School
systems need to evolve into the digital age with the rest of the
world, otherwise a great disservice is being done to our students.
According to Lips (2010), "Online learning has the potential to
revolutionize American education" (para. 22).

   While the research is limited for elementary settings, the
flexibility and adaptability of blended learning, or hybrid, models
offers enhanced teaching and learning experiences. Prescott,
Bundschuh, Kazakoff and Macaruso (2016) explained, "Blended
learning can take various forms, thus allowing users to adapt a
program that best fits their pedagogical goals and physical setting"
(p. 1). In other words, blended learning provides teachers with
the ability to personalize learning for students. In a meta-analyses
of 45 studies, Means, Bakia and Murphy (2014) found that, "on
average, students in conditions that included significant amounts
of learning online performed better than students receiving face-
to-face instruction," and went on to state that, "the subset of the
studies employing blended learning approaches was entirely
responsible for the observed online advantage" (p. 20). Hence,
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 29
ENVIRONMENTS

blended learning is suggested to be more beneficial than fully
online or fully traditional settings.

   Means et al. (2014) suggested several reasons or purposes for
the implementation of blended learning in relation to K-12 schools
which include the following:

        · Accessibility of learning
        · Facilitation of small group instruction
        · Addressing diverse needs
        · Increase in productivity
        · Providing a variety of instructional methods and

            techniques
        · Enhancing engagement among students and teachers
        · Providing additional support for complicated, abstract

            content

As explained by Horn and Staker (2015), "Blended learning is the
engine that can power personalized and competency-based
learning" (p. 10). Furthermore, "It provides a simple way for
students to take different paths toward a common destination,"
and, "It can free up teachers to become learning designers,
mentors, facilitators, tutors, evaluators, and counselors to reach
each student in ways never before possible" (Horn & Staker, 2015,
p. 10-11).

BLENDED LEARNING MODELS

There are many ways in which blended learning has been
implemented. As more is learned about the effectiveness of hybrid
learning environments, one can postulate that more models will
be developed. For now, the following models will be discussed:
30  TUTALENI I. ASINO

rotation models, a flipped model, flex and "a la carte" models, an
enriched virtual model, and a mixture or blend of models.

ROTATION MODEL

The rotation model is the most common model of blended learning
used by elementary school teachers. In today's classrooms, many
teachers already use a rotation model in an effort to provide small
group instruction. Common in elementary schools is the use of
the Daily 5, which is a framework for structuring literacy time in
the classroom. It consists of various activities designed to teach
students independence while engaging in meaningful literacy tasks
(Boushey & Moser, 2014). Rotation models are not new to the K-5
setting but are less utilized (out of blended learning context) in
middle- and high-school.
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 31
ENVIRONMENTS

   Station Rotation. Specific to blended learning, station rotation
includes groups of students rotating through learning stations, at
least one of which would include an online learning component
(see Figure 1). Depending upon the content area and the teacher,
this may look different in every classroom or school. Typically,
students are grouped by need or ability. The group moves through
various stations together (the number of stations depends on the
way the teacher set up the class). Suggested stations may include
small group instruction with the teacher (the face-to-face
component), individual learning (self-paced and online) and
independent practice or application (may be an online task or
traditional task).
32  TUTALENI I. ASINO

   Lab Rotation. For schools which are not yet 1:1, meaning not
every student has his or her own device to use, a lab rotation
might be the only option (see Figure 2). The lab rotation is set
up similar to station rotation, but involves students moving to a
computer lab, facilitated by staff other than certified teachers (i.e.
aides, paraprofessionals, support personnel) somewhere else in
the school. A percentage of students' day is spent in the computer
lab focused on basic skills through the use of software or other
online materials deemed appropriate by the school district or
teacher.
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 33
ENVIRONMENTS

   Individual Rotation. In this model, algorithms are used to
design students' rotation schedule based on their assessment
scores. They may still encounter the similar educational
experiences, but the prescribed rotation schedule is based on their
personal needs (see Figure 3). Horn and Staker (2015) explained the
individual rotation as, "Each student has an individualized playlist to
guide him through the rotations. Paraprofessionals are on hand to
assist students with Edgenuity [online curriculum]. In the breakout
rooms, a face-to-face teacher expands on the material introduced
online and helps students apply it" (p. 45). The factor that sets
this model apart from the other rotation models is that students
transition individually rather than with a group of students.
34                 TUTALENI I. ASINO

FLIPPED CLASSROOM

   The flipped classroom model flips the setting of traditional
learning (see Figure 4). In this model, students do the "learning"
at home via online tools, such as instructional videos, recorded
lectures, and other content-related material. The teacher then uses
the traditional face-to-face time to help student apply what they
have learned through higher-level tasks, projects and assignments.
This model lends itself to the middle school and high school
settings where time is extremely valuable, and often limited.
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 35
ENVIRONMENTS

FLEX MODEL

   Originally designed to provide an opportunity for high school
dropouts to recover education credits, the flex model offers
students an opportunity to set their own schedules. In the flex
model of blended learning, online instruction and online delivery
of content is the main mode of student learning (see Figure 5).
Teachers, in this model of blended learning, design the course, but
then act as more of a facilitator and are used "as-needed." Learning
is student-driven and self-paced in this model which is much more
likely to be used in a high school or higher education setting.
36                TUTALENI I. ASINO

A LA CARTE MODEL

   The "A La Carte" model offers students a chance to take a fully
online course on top of their traditional course schedule (see Figure
6). This type of model is seen more often in high school and higher
education settings because if provides students with an
opportunity to move more quickly through their program. As more
colleges and universities are offering this option, the high schools
are doing the same to make sure their students are fully prepared
for higher education.
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 37
ENVIRONMENTS

ENRICHED VIRTUAL MODEL
As explained by Horn and Staker, "Many Enriched Virtual programs
began as full-time online schools and then, noticing that their
students needed more support, developed blended programs to
provide face-to-face enrichment and a safe, peaceful physical
setting" (p. 50). However, the traditional classes do not meet daily,
or even regularly. Often times, courses implementing an Enriched
Virtual model use the progress of the students to determine how
often they provide traditional face-to-face instruction or support.
That being said, this model lends itself to the higher education
setting and is not ideal for K-12 schools (see Figure 7).
38  TUTALENI I. ASINO

MIXTURE OF MODELS

While the models of blended learning described above are the
most common, it is not uncommon to see a blend of models
evolving in classrooms. For example, an elementary school teacher
might use a "station rotation" model, but "flip" his or her whole
group instruction to make efficient use of his or her time with
students. The bottom line is that as students continue to evolve and
the goal of education continues to evolve, so will best practices in
education.

DESIGNING A BLENDED EXPERIENCE

Designing an effective blended learning experience is not as easy
as just taking traditional content and making it available online.
Means et al., (2014) cautioned that the benefits of online learning,
"tended to result from a redesign of instruction to extend learning
time or promote greater engagement with content" (p. 23). In
addition, they explained that such positive outcomes were a result
of blended learning environments which, "were likely to involve
additional instructional resources and activities that encouraged
interactions among learners" (Means et al., 2014, p. 23).
Furthermore, Lehman and Conceição (2014) suggest the use of
"intentional design" which they explained as, "a method that
involves purposeful action and takes into consideration the online
learning environment, the teaching process, and learner
characteristics" (p. 19).

COMMUNITY & CULTURE

One of the most important factors to consider in designing a
blended learning experience for students is establishing a
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 39
ENVIRONMENTS

community and culture of learning and growing. Establishing a
sense of community in a traditional classroom is much easier to
do than in an online environment. BlendedLearning.org shed light
on this important factor by stating, "Culture is especially useful--or
toxic--in blended programs because blended learning goes hand
in hand with giving students more control and flexibility. If students
lack the processes and cultural norms to handle that agency, the
shift toward a personalized environment can backfire" (Clayton
Christensen Institute, 2018). Teachers must be very intentional with
their course design to include components of interaction and
collaboration amongst online students. In the field of blended
learning, a teacher should ensure that the culture he or she sets up
within the traditional setting is upheld in the online setting as well.

   Delgado, Wardlow, McKnight and O'Malley (2015) dittoed the
need for establishing a culture of learning. They suggested,
"Fostering a learning culture means shifting a traditional teacher-
centered model to a student-centered model," which allows the
students to drive their own learning while the teacher is available to
provide personalized direct instruction to a small group of students
or one-on-one (p. 403). Poirier (2010) provided the following
suggestions for instructional strategies which can help establish a
culture of collaboration and learning:

        · Encourage student leadership in online discussions
            through assignment of roles

        · Integrate ice breakers and scavenger hunts when
            introducing a new topic

        · Use team-based jigsaw presentations to review content

        · Ask students to submit photos with their introductions

        · Require students to create and maintain a digital portfolio
            and provide links for the rest of the students to view
40  TUTALENI I. ASINO

MOTIVATION & ENGAGEMENT

Francis (2012) pointed out that, "Simple class size and access to
technology can lead to students having a greater opportunity to be
off-task and disengaged in the classroom" (p. 147). This can happen
in blended learning environments as well, even with the teacher
in the same room. When building a blended learning experience
or hybrid course, engagement and motivation are crucial to the
success of students regardless of their age.

   Andrew Miller, an experienced online teacher of K-12 students,
has experienced the challenges of motivating and engaging his
students. Through his experiences, Miller (2012) found that, "If you
want students to be engaged...it [the activities] must be
meaningful" (para. 3). In order for learning activities to be
meaningful, they must have purpose.

   Whether in an online or a traditional classroom setting, purpose
is a driving force behind engagement and motivation. Boushey and
Moser (2014) explained, "Setting a purpose and creating a sense of
urgency establishes a culture in which every moment of learning
and practicing counts" (p. 37). When teachers clearly establish the
reason behind an activity, online or in-person, and the students
feel the sense of urgency and usefulness, teachers and students
will work together to succeed. Kelly (2012) further explained the
need for students to understand the relevance of the activities
or the content embedded in online learning. Teachers can ensure
students understanding by, "being explicit about how the skills and
knowledge students acquire in the course can be applied beyond
school" (para. 5).

   In addition to understanding the usefulness of coursework, Kelly
(2012) indicated that students need to feel empowered. "Students
feel empowered when they feel that they have some control over
some aspects of their learning" (para. 3). One way to provide
students with this sense of empowerment is through providing
choices. In fact, Boushey and Moser (2014) use this concept in the
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 41
ENVIRONMENTS

Daily 5 framework. Based on the work of Gambrell (as cited by
Boushey & Moser, 2014), "Choice has been identified as a powerful
force that allows students to take ownership and responsibility
for their learning. Studies indicate that motivation increases when
students have opportunities to make choices about what they learn
and when they believe they have some autonomy or control over
their own learning" (p. 25). In sum, purpose and choice equate to
motivation and engagement.

CONTENT & ORGANIZATION

One of the major benefits of digital learning is utilizing online
formats to access and use up-to-date, current content. In addition,
"[blended learning] enables bringing the affordances of technology
to bear in teaching conceptually challenging abstract and complex
content" (Means, Bakia & Murphy, 2014, p. 115). Supplemental
resources, including instructional videos and other interactive
media, are readily available online allowing instructors to vary the
way they present new and difficult concepts to their students.
Pearson Education (2016) pointed out, "Next generation
instructional systems that include print and digital options with
online adaptive skill building allow teachers and students to
personalize in new and exciting ways" (Pearson Education, Inc.,
2016).

   Finding ways to present curricular content to students is only
half the battle. Teachers also need to organize the content in a
manageable way. Many online learning platforms have
organizational tools available to instructors, such as timelines,
modules and units. Many instructors choose to set up the online
component of the class in a module format. Doing so breaks the
content down into more manageable chunks. Using a modular
format also allows students to plan their time and set goals.
Lehman and Conceição (2014) explained that using modular (or
42  TUTALENI I. ASINO

"chunking") techniques, "helped the students reduce cognitive
overload and allowed them to focus on the content without
becoming overwhelmed" (p. 24).

ASSESSMENT

With an online component embedded in traditional instruction,
digital tools to create assessments which provide immediate
feedback are more prevalent. Additionally, teachers are exploring
the many ways in which students can demonstrate their learning
beyond the multiple-choice assessments of the past. Access to
digital devices with internet access enables students to "show what
they know" in a multitude of ways which were impossible before,
including: recording an audio or video response using tools like
Recap or FlipGrid, making an interactive presentation using
Nearpod, collaborate on a project using Google Docs or Google
Slides, create a website or a blog, etc.

COMMUNICATION

Another key component in designing online learning environments
is communication. Clear communication of expectations and
learning intentions, success criteria and learning progressions are
essential for student success in online learning. Waack (n.d.)
summarized John Hattie's work regarding teacher clarity with the
following statement, "Clear learning intentions describe the skills,
knowledge, attitudes and values that the student needs to learn."
The criteria for success should also be clear and concise. Students
need to know what they need to do in order to be successful.
Sharing the progression of learning allows students to understand
how content builds throughout the course or class. Doing these
things provides students with a sense of organization and time
management allowing students to pace themselves, which will in
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 43
ENVIRONMENTS

turn keep them motivated and engaged. Lehman and Conceição
(2014) provided a few clear guidelines for this task:

        · Provide specific course outcomes
        · Include explicit directions for assignments and tasks
        · Share the goals of the course or class
        · Use deadlines or due dates (p. 25-26)

In addition to the above suggestions, it is also important to provide
consistent and specific feedback to students throughout the
blended experience. This might be done through chats, email, and/
or commenting tools. Lehman and Conceição (2014) reported,
"Consistent feedback made students feel self-confident and
provided them with a consistent pace" (p. 29). Lack of feedback can
often have negative effects on the learning environment, whether
online or in-person. In a meta-analysis of educational studies,
Hattie and Timperley (2007) found that, "Feedback is among the
most critical influences on student learning" (p. 102).

PERSONALIZED LEARNING

"The opportunity to help every student learn at the best pace and
path for them is the most important benefit of digital learning"
(Pearson Education, Inc., 2016). In order to do this, instructors must
start by getting to know their students and their students' interests.
This can be achieved through interest-surveys, informal chat
sessions, and icebreaker activities (all can be done online or face-
to-face). In addition to understanding students' interests, it is also
important to be proactive about students' needs. One of the
benefits to online courses or classes is that it reaches mores
students. However, with more students come more diverse needs.
It is important that instructors take into account their students'
learning needs and find ways to address the needs through the
44  TUTALENI I. ASINO

presentation of the content, the learning activities and the ways in
which students demonstrate their understanding.

UNIVERSAL DESIGN FOR LEARNING

According to Coy, Marino and Serianni (2014), the demand for
virtual learning environments is growing (p.64). With that growth
comes more students with more needs. It is the instructor's
responsibility to consider the needs of all students as he or she
designs an online learning environment. Many of the instructional
strategies discussed above can be addressed through using
Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles. Developed by Meyer
and Rose, "Universal design for learning (UDL) is a framework to
improve and optimize teaching and learning for all people based
on scientific insights into how humans learn" (Cast.org, 2014).
Typically, when one hears the term UDL, he or she automatically
thinks in terms of special education and assistive technology.
However, UDL is actually focused on meeting the needs of all
learners, using strong pedagogy (in online or traditional settings),
and using high-quality, research-based instructional practices.
"UDL guidelines offer a set of concrete suggestions that can be
applied to any discipline or domain to ensure that all learners
can access and participate in meaningful, challenging learning
opportunities," and these guidelines are ever-evolving as scientists
learn more about how people learn (Cast.org, 2014). The UDL
principles include providing multiple means of engagement,
representation and expression.

   Providing "multiple means of engagement" refers to the "why" of
learning. This includes using a variety of engagement techniques
which may include providing options for "recruiting interest,
sustaining effort and persistence, and self-regulation" (Cast.org,
2014). In an online environment, strategies might entail:

        · Collaborating with students to set a vision or goal and
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 45
ENVIRONMENTS

            purpose
        · Providing multiple paths to reach the same learning

            outcome
        · Creating self-reflection and self-assessment tools
        · Having students predict outcomes on assignments or tests

Regardless of the strategies used, the ultimate goal of providing
multiple means of engagement is to create a sense of purpose and
motivation for all students (Cast.org, 2014).

   The next principle of the UDL framework is to "provide multiple
means of representation" which refers to the "what" of learning.
This is about the presentation of the curricular content. It is
important to provide options for "perception, language and
symbols, and comprehension" (Cast.org, 2014). When designing
any online content, an instructor might think about:

        · Minimizing distractions on an educational video by using
            SafeShare.tv

        · Using closed-captioning on instructional videos
        · Paying attention to the use of distracting fonts and colors

            in presentations
        · Using infographics or other media in addition to text
        · Providing outlines of important ideas in complicated

            content

These strategies are important in the online learning setting, but
also in the traditional classroom as the goal of providing multiple
means of representation is to create "resourceful and
knowledgeable" students (Cast.org, 2014). The use of technology
makes this easier for teachers.

   Finally, the third principle of UDL is to provide "multiple means
of expression" which addresses the "how" of learning. This principle
46  TUTALENI I. ASINO

focuses on the responsibility of teachers to provide options for
"physical action, expression and communication, and executive
functions" (Cast.org, 2014). Strategies for addressing these
concepts may include:

        · Providing multiple ways to access content and material
            (interactive e-books)

        · Allowing students to respond in various ways (audio,
            video, drawing, etc.)

        · Using scaffolding techniques when reading and writing

        · Using interactive web tools (annotation software,
            storyboards, etc.)

Cast.org stressed, "It is important to provide alternative modalities
for expression, both to the level the playing field among learners
and to allow the learner to appropriately (or easily) express
knowledge, ideas and concepts in the learning environment"
(2014).

   UDL is an instructional framework which uses best pedagogical
practices, regardless of environment; however, the use of
technology makes using UDL techniques easier for teachers and
students. It requires a shift in pedagogy in an effort to reach all
learners despite their academic (or social) needs.

CONCLUSION

In conclusion, Lehman and Conceição (2014) explained that,
"content design needs to be developed differently depending on
the discipline and the desired outcomes of a specific course" (p.
20). Furthermore, "This process requires intention, anticipation,
prioritization, and envisioning" (Lehman & Conceição, 2014, p. 20).
Although the research is limited, "Blending online instruction with
teacher-led activities can enable better learning when it provides a
EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION IN BLENDED LEARNING 47
ENVIRONMENTS

unique, new capability that supports the processes of learning, and
when it increases the amount of time during which students are
actively engaged in learning" (Means et al., 2014, p. 120).

   As society continues to move away from the traditional factory
model of education and into learning in the digital age, blended
learning offers "the best of both worlds." Benefits of blended
learning models typically include: differentiated instruction, more
effective use of instructional time, use of multimedia to enhance
teaching and learning, personalized learning paths addressing
specific learner needs, targeted instruction opportunities,
increased motivation and engagement.

   However, to reap these benefits, schools must consider several
important pedagogical factors in their quest to set up an effective
blended learning environment; such components include building
a community and fostering a positive culture, using strategies to
establish and maintain motivation and engagement among
students (and teachers), practicing effective communication with
teacher clarity and effective feedback, personalize learning for
students and incorporate principles of UDL in an effort to reach
all learners. Delgado et al. (2015) reported that, "blended learning
could be better than traditional classrooms, when instructors'
involvement, interaction, content, student capabilities, and the
right amount of human to technology [are] combined" (p. 403).

QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER

Blended Learning

   ABSTRACT: With the emergence of technology from the late 20th
century into the early 21st century, many colleges and universities are
playing catchup with how modern students learn best. Administrations
and instructors are expected to integrate the best use of technologies
in their courses and remain vigilant to the ever-changing landscape of
educational technology, "Effective use of technology is not an optional
add-on or a skill that we simply can expect teachers to pick up once
they get into the classroom. Teachers need to know how to use
technology to realize each state's learning standards from day one"
(Department of Education, n.d.). Instructors are increasingly expected
to become experts in their specialty area as well as in new teaching
pedagogies that utilize changing technology. On top of motivating,
stimulating and evaluating students, the expectations of adding

                                                               52
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 53
BLENDED LEARNING

educational technology to lesson planning can be challenging. Mobile
technologies, such as podcasts and vodcasts offer educators a platform
to supplement their material. Students are more and more familiar
with these modes of learning and are able to adapt them not only to
their education but to their day to day lives.

MOTIVATION

In the simplest of terms motivation is the reason or reasons we do
anything and everything throughout our lives. We are motivated to
do things as simple as going to the grocery store so we have food to
eat, to more complex activities like going back to school to advance
one's career or taking courses to learn a new language. Motivation
is defined as, "the act or process of giving someone a reason for
doing something, a force or influence that causes someone to do
something" (Merriam-Webster, 2017). There are many factors that
play a role in motivation and many theories exist that explain how
and why humans are motivated. In terms of online learning, finding
new technologies and incorporating them into courses is a great
way to keep students motivated and attentive to course material.

   There are many accepted theories of motivation including:
Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Knowles' Andragogy and Alderfer's
ERG Theory. These theories focus on why we do what we do, how
we reach a certain goal and conceptualize the meaning behind
what we do.

   Perhaps the most widely known and accepted theory of
motivation is Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, which assumes that
all humans have the same basic needs and move along the same
spectrum when it comes to satisfying these needs. The five basic
needs that Maslow identified are: physiological (the most basic),
safety, love/belonging, esteem and self-actualization (the highest
level of satisfaction) (Maslow, 1943). Maslow believed that
everything we do follows these needs and once a need is fulfilled
54  TUTALENI I. ASINO

we move onto the next basic need, and then the next until we reach
our full satisfaction with that need. Maslow also pointed out that
needs are not individual, they often rely on each other and are
dependent on the prior satisfaction of a different need (Maslow,
1943). Human motivation does not only focus on reaching the self-
actualization need but also focuses on not being brought back
to the physiological need. For instance, I go to the store to buy
groceries to feel satiated (self-actualization) but also to not starve
(physiological), satisfying both ends of the spectrum (Maslow, 1943).
In relation to online and blended education, learning is a process
that can be broken down into a hierarchy. In terms of a hierarchy
of a course from the student perspective, they must be accepted
into the school first (the most basic need) and they need to have
support and self-actualization to succeed in the course (the highest
level of satisfaction). When these needs are met, most students
will be able to succeed, and integrating what many know best,
technology, will help them reach these levels of satisfaction.

   Another popular motivation theory is Knowles' Adult Learning
Theory, highlighting the idea of andragogy. Knowles believed that
adult learners should be studied differently than just pedagogically,
separate from adolescent learners. He hypothesized that adult
learners have five key characteristics: self-concept, experience,
readiness to learn, orientation to learning and motivation to learn.
These traits brought him to the conclusion that adult educators
must enforce why the content of their teaching is important and
show adult learners how the content they are learning will help
them reach their goals. Knowles' theory encompasses these ideas
by stating, "The adult learner brings into the continuing educational
arena a rich array of experiences that will affect the learning styles
and assimilation of knowledge. Adult learners need to be able to
apply the knowledge into their life situations" (June, 2010).
Essentially, adult learners are more likely to question educators
and educators need to be proactive in their facilitation of their
courses and have reasonable justification for why they are
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 55
BLENDED LEARNING

delivering their courses in the manner in which they choose to do
so.

   Being aware of these characteristics, Knowles also believed that
adult educators must assume particular implications in their
practice of teaching:

        · Set a cooperative climate for learning in the classroom

        · Assess the learner's specific needs and interests

        · Develop learning objectives based on the learner's needs,
            interests, and skill levels

        · Design sequential activities to achieve the objectives

        · Work collaboratively with the learner to select methods,
            materials and resources for instruction

        · Evaluate the quality of the learning experience and make
            adjustments, as needed, while assessing needs for further
            learning (TEAL Center Staff, 2011)

In other words, "Because adults learn by doing, effective instruction
focuses on tasks that adults can perform, rather than on
memorization of content" (TEAL Center Staff, 2011). A ten-year-old
and a thirty-year-old function much differently due to life
experience. When it comes to adult learners, many are motivated
to build upon knowledge they have already gained to further their
careers. A grade school, adolescent learner is learning brand new
information in many cases and is fresh to the concepts and ideas.
Everyone has to go to grade school in one way, shape or form,
while adult learners are often doing so by choice and personal
motivations.

   Knowles' theory is more focused on adult learners, opposed to
Maslow that studied humans in general. In a way, Knowles
expanded upon Maslow's basic ideas and applied andragogy
specifically to Maslow's Hierarchy levels of esteem and self-
actualization. The majority of adults who go back to school at a
56  TUTALENI I. ASINO

higher education level do so in order to gain prestige in the
workplace and feel a sense of accomplishment. It is no small feat
for adult learners to maintain a career, go to school and reach one's
full potential, outlined by Maslow and applied to Knowles Adult
Learning Theory.

   A third motivation theory that expanded on Maslow's Hierarchy
of Needs is ERG Theory by Clayton Alderfer. Alderfer surveyed 110
bank employees on 21 hypotheses based on what effects their
morale within the workplace. While not all the hypotheses were
supported by the data collected Alderfer concluded that workers
have three basic needs, existence (E), relatedness (R) and growth
(G). Alderfer did not treat these human characteristics as static,
rather he believed they were fluid and one did not need to be
met before moving onto the next factor. He did not treat them
in a hierarchy which differed from Maslow and did not treat the
factors independently. Some similarities between the two theories
are, Alderfer's existence needs encompass Maslow's physiological
and safety needs, the relatedness factor is equal to Maslow's social
and self-esteem and the growth component of ERG theory uses
Maslow's self-esteem and self-actualization features (Alderfer,
1969). A criticism of ERG theory is like that of Herzberg. Alderfer
only studied employees of a bank in New York. Translating this
to other fields is possible but a deficiency with the original study.
Regarding online education, the factors of existence, relatedness
and growth all relate to keeping students motivated. Maintaining
these characteristics will keep students focused and on track.
Working them together and relating the students and allowing
them to grow together will create a powerful learning environment.

   In terms of online versus face to face (F2F) education, from my
perspective of taking classes in both forms, the motivation of the
instructor and the instructor's ability to use technology can make
or break a course. Even in F2F learning, if an instructor is
uncomfortable with technology within the classroom, learners will
react accordingly and if online instructors simply use discussion
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 57
BLENDED LEARNING

boards in place of in-person discussion the course becomes a form
of a check list where students feel like they need to post a certain
number of times and move on. Adults learners specifically, do not
just go back to school for fun, they do so because they are
motivated to move to a point in their life that they cannot do so
without the education.

   In the article, "17 Tips to Motivate Adult Learners", written in
2013, Christopher Pappas makes a clear yet controversial
argument for approaching adult learnings in online courses
differently than others, "a lot of the learners are often forced to
take on your eLearning course to enhance their skills, keep their
job, get a job, or continue further with their career plans" (Pappas,
2013). While this theory does not have the most uplifting message,
the truth of the matter is, online adult learners are in school for
many different reasons than an 18-22 year-old straight out of high
school looking to find a career path. To recognize this idea, he gives
tips to combat the issue, many of which can be adapted to online
learning and podcasting. A few key tips are: Facilitate Exploration,
Build Community and Integrate Social Media, accommodate
individual interests and career goals, stimulate your learners, ask
for feedback and present the benefits of undertaking the course
(Pappas, 2013). All of these ideas can help to keep students
motivated, and knowing how they participate in classes is an
important factor in creating courses that will appeal to them, "it
is important to understand participation, to identify the different
participation patterns and learner types, and to offer them
appropriate support" (Nistor & Neubauer, 2010). If students are
aware that a project or class discussion can help them in their
job the next day, students are more likely to pay attention and
gain interest in the concepts being presented. Adult learners have
experience in the real world, so asking for their feedback does not
only help the instructor but it makes them feel like a part of the
course and like their opinions and experiences matter.

   The use of technology is a good way to reach a group of students
58  TUTALENI I. ASINO

who are in a course and can adapt well to the use of different
course deliveries as a learning material. Effective motivation in
education has many facets, including useful promotion of learning
and effective instructional techniques. Staying informed with how
students learn can be a challenge but universities that accept this
challenge will succeed in the long run and their students will benefit
greatly, "the intense focus on student success has generated
unprecedented pressure for improved retention and completion at
institutions across the country and around the globe. At the foundation
of an effective student success strategy is harnessing the right
technology resources to drive results and positive outcomes" (UB
Custom Publishing, 2015). Higher education needs avoid resisting or
pushing back on new technology since some students may know
more about technology than some instructors, however, they do
not know how to translate their knowledge into using it as a
successful motivator in a course. By educating the educators to
maximize outcomes and student's success, universities as a system
will succeed and be as useful as possible for the student.

ONLINE AND BLENDED LEARNING

Online and blended learning are described in many ways with
different names that often refer to the same thing. One university
describes online as, "Online learning provides meaningful learning
opportunities using a wide variety of teaching modalities. In today's
society, learning takes place anytime, anywhere" (University at
Buffalo, 2017). The authors of the book, Learning Online What
Research Tells us About Whether, When and How, define blended
learning as, "the use of online learning in conjunction with
traditional teacher-led forms of instruction" (Means, Bakia, &
Murphy, 2014). The anytime anywhere concept ties squarely to the
overarching reasoning for online and blended learning. Technology
is everywhere, it is hard to find someone without a smart phone,
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 59
BLENDED LEARNING

laptop, tablet or computer that does not have access to the internet
and education is smart to tag on to this trend and incorporate
meaningful ways for educators to reach a bigger audience than in
traditional face-to-face classrooms.

   There is some ambiguity surrounding the term online learning.
There are many terms related to online learning that may mean the
same thing but are used in different contexts. Some of these terms
are:

        · Online learning/online education/online programs
        · Distance learning/distance education
        · Hybrid learning/hybrid courses
        · Blended
        · E-Courses
        · E-learning
        · Web courses
        · Distributed course delivery
        · Independent learning (University at Buffalo, 2017)

All of these terms are used interchangeably to describe learning
that takes place outside of the traditional classroom. As this
university also describes, within online learning there are multiple
types of technology mediations and terms that incorporate not just
technology-based modes of learning but include face-to-face time
as well:

            course        but whose face-to-face schedule is not altered

(University at Buffalo, 2017)
   In all these mediations they describe, technology plays a key

role in the structure of the delivery of the course. These ideas
are constantly evolving and will continue to do so as technology
changes.

   The authors of the book, Learning Online What Research Tells us
About Whether, When and How, by Barbara Means, Marianne Bakia
and Robert Murphy, also state four key factors that have led to the
emergence of online learning and it's continual growth that does
not show any signs of slowing down:

       1. As technology capabilities have expanded and information
            technology has become more affordable and mobile,
            people live more of their lives online.

       2. The belief that it can address some of education's
            persistent and emerging challenges including achievement
            gap and the rate at which students - especially poor and
            non-Asian minority students - leave high schools and
            colleges without a diploma

       3. Economics - costs of online learning compared to face-to-
            face instruction consistently find savings associated with
            the online option, although variance in costs for both
            exists
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 61
BLENDED LEARNING

       4. Belief in its power to provide better learning experiences

(Means, Bakia, & Murphy, 2014)
   All of these factors have led to a large growth in online learning

at all levels of education, from K-12 to higher education. Once
universities recognize these reasons, they also need to realize the
purpose of blended and online learning to implement the
technology correctly and keep students motivated.

   A leading issue with online learning is dropout rates, which can
be directly tied to motivation. If students are not highly motivated
in online courses they are more likely to not stick it out and drop
out before completing their classes. Given that online learners tend
to be adult learners, special attention needs to be paid to this group
of students to prevent them from losing motivation and dropping
out of school, "online students were significantly more likely to
dropout than campus-based students. Age was found to have a
significant unique effect on dropout in both programs with older
students more likely to dropout" (Patterson & McFadden, 2009). A
key theory related to this concept is Knowles Adult Learning Theory
of Andragogy. His theory assumes that adult learners have five
key characteristics, including: self-concept, experience, readiness to
learn, orientation to learning and motivation to learn (June, 2010).
Knowing these characteristics can help instructors create courses
with adult learners in mind and keeping students motivated while
learning to their best ability should be the cornerstone of any
successful course.

   Online learning is very popular in the early 21st century, however,
it does not come without its controversies. Online universities are
popping up nationally and across the globe. U.S News and World
Report, one of the most noted publishers of university and college
rankings began ranking online degree programs in 2012 as a
separate list. Businesses and universities are doing everything they
can to stay relevant and beat out the competition. This has caused
some skeptics to note a large amount of debt students leave for-
62  TUTALENI I. ASINO

profit programs with and the intense recruiting practices some
schools implement (Means, Bakia, & Murphy, 2014). Unfortunately,
few things in life remain successful without someone trying to take
advantage of its popularity and potentially vulnerable users. Major
universities with the proper accreditations and history can create
online and blended degree programs and maintain their success by
keeping to their core values and doing everything they can for their
students and instructors.

PODCASTS

Podcasting is an emerging technology used to motivate students.
A podcast is defined as, "a program, as of music or talk, made
available in a digital format for automatic download over the
internet" (Merriam-Webster, 2017). The ease of use of podcasts is
what makes them so revolutionary:

       "when a user subscribes to a podcast, audio content is downloaded
       over the internet to a user's computer; when his or her portable
       media player is attached to that computer, the new audio content is
       automatically placed on the portable device. As new editions of the
       podcast become available, the content (usually in the form of an
       audio MP3 file) is automatically downloaded to the user's computer
       and, subsequently, his or her portable device: the subscriber being
       required to do no more than obtain the initial subscription. It is
       this simplicity that leads to the true power of the concept behind
       podcasting, which can be thought of as a series of time- shifted
       radio shows to be heard whenever and wherever it is most
       convenient for the user" (Savel, Goldstein, Perencevich, & Angood,
       2007).

Unlike many other forms of subscription based platforms, the only
action the user has to take with Podcasts is to subscribe and the
content is automatically downloaded. This allows the user to
subscribe initially and not have to worry about whether or not they
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 63
BLENDED LEARNING

are getting the most up to date information or the latest rendition
of a podcast.

   Another adaptation of podcasts is the changing landscape of
higher education student populations, "contemporary higher
education reflects increasing diversity from this traditional student
profile. As a major grouping, adult students now comprise more
than 45% of the current post-secondary population in America"
(Knapp, Kelly-Reid, & Ginder, 2010)

   It is also important to note that an Apple product is not required
to listen to podcasts, they can be played on any portable device
or computer that plays MP3 files (Savel et al., 2007). With the wide
array of cell phones in the market, the applicability of podcasts
to multiple products makes them desirable in education. Every
student now has some access to a phone or computer that can play
audio, making podcasts omnipresent.

   Knowing how students are adapting to the technology and if
it remains a relevant form of instruction is vital to a successful
pedagogy:

       "Similar to many other educational technologies in the past, the
       ultimate use of podcasting and its influence on the traditional
       lecture may not be determined by the potential of the technology,
       but rather by the way in which it is perceived within the institution,
       by both teachers and students. Its use will be strongly influenced
       by the dominant pedagogies employed in these contexts" (McGarr,
       2009).

When podcasts were first introduced to education, many students
did not know how to use them. They were unsure how to utilize
what they were listening to since so many students are used to
taking notes or reading textbooks. Students slowly adapted to
using the podcasts, not as more information on top of lectures or
readings but learning that the podcasts allowed them to, "manage
the rest of the course materials in a more efficient manner.
Consequently, the course podcasts allowed for a decrease in the
feeling of information overload and an increase in the importance
64  TUTALENI I. ASINO

of the rest of the course materials" (Fernandez, Simo, & Sallan,
2009). Relating to online learning specifically, students often
undertake online or mobile learning due to family, job and time
restraints. Podcasts have been shown to be abundantly accessible,
"many students commented that they did not have a permanent
place to study, so they appreciated all kinds of materials that could
be used in different places, for example while using public
transport" (Fernandez et al., 2009). Online learners are constantly
on the move and their only focus in life is not their education. They
have many things going on and being able to study while waiting in
a doctor's office or on a subway without having to pull out paper
articles or a clunky textbook, leads to great student satisfaction
with podcasts and their accessibility.

   Having the ability to incorporate a form of technology that
students use for entertainment in their non-education lives, in a
course, is a great way to engage the learner and use something
that they are familiar with. A student is probably not going to use
a PowerPoint in their everyday life but they may listen to podcasts
on their commute to work or while they exercise. Podcasts can be a
crucial component of an online courses design and can help bring
different instructional pieces together. As a 2010 study, conducted
on teaching presence and adult learners in an online course, notes,
course design, facilitation and instruction are essential qualities
that create positive teaching presence in a course (Ke, 2010). The
overall design of the content, discussions, evaluations and interface
enhanced students' interactivity, stated clear expectations, and
gave the course purpose. All of these factors help motivate
students to succeed and feel connected to the course, "in order to
create a community of inquiry for adult students, we should first
generate an effective teaching presence with supportive features to
reinforce the emerging of cognitive and social presence in an online
learning environment" (Ke, 2010). Students can learn the material
from different sources, therefore they and the instructor can offer
a range of different perspectives.
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 65
BLENDED LEARNING

   A majority of the literature points to podcasts as supplemental
learning materials. As Fernandez, Simo and Sallan suggest,
"podcasting is a powerful tool as a complement to the traditional
resources on a course, but not a substitute for them" (Fernandez
et al., 2009). Instructors should not simply create a podcast instead
of a normal lecture or give students an article to read. The podcast
needs to be used to enhance the information relayed in the typical
instructional formats and help students expand the knowledge
they are learning from simply listening in class or reviewing
textbooks. McGarr writes, "if used exclusively as a substitute for
traditional lectures such use may further reinforce students as
passive recipients of information" (McGarr, 2009). To motivate
students, instructors do not want them to be passive learners in
their education, or simply using a podcast because it is the only
means by which the material has been given to them. Instead,
educators should want their students to engage in deep thinking
and higher levels of cognitive learning to trigger their learning into
eventual skill mastery. McGarr describes the use of podcasts as
supplemental materials as,

       "providing revision and summary material, supplementary material
       can also be in the form of additional material which may broaden
       or deepen the student's understanding. This type of use can
       facilitate higher cognitive learning outcomes since the provision
       of supplementary material can provide students with alternative
       perspectives on content previously delivered or enable further and
       deeper exploration of topics" (McGarr, 2009).

Instructors can answer questions asked by previous students and
incorporate these concepts into the podcasts to make students
think outside the box.

   By combining these materials, students learning has been shown
to improve. A notable immersive study by Popova, Kirschner and
Joiner looked at the use of podcasts as primers for lectures, in other
words, the podcasts were given to students before they attended
the lecture to help them scaffold their learning to which they could
66  TUTALENI I. ASINO

"hang" new information. This is another form of using podcasts as
supplemental information rather than simply using it as the sole
means of conveying the content. The podcasts were approximately
five minutes in length and consisted of an introduction, summary
definitions of core concepts and examples, and ended with
epistemic questions that were either, exploratory, predictive or
argumentative. They delivered a Likert based questionnaire to the
students during the last lecture to ascertain their perceptions of
the process and use of podcasts. They wanted to study how novel
the podcasts were to the ways in which students made used of
the podcast materials and why they made use of them. Over half,
(55%) of the respondents reported that they listened to podcasts
for personal use outside of class related to the topics of,
entertainment, news and education. For the podcasts associated
with the course, students noted that they listened to the podcasts
more than once, and the majority did not partake in other activities
while listening. The students also noted that they felt more involved
with their education due to the questions posed at the end of
the podcasts and that these questions forced them to think more
about the content and question their own knowledge in a cognitive
learning manner (Popova, Kirschner, & Joiner, 2014).
Students were motivated because the podcast was given by their
instructor, helped them become familiar and feel connected with
the instructor and the material. This study gives:

       "insight on students' motivation to use such additional resources to
       gain more from lectures. The evaluation provided by the students
       essentially confirmed the hypothesis that audio-only primer
       podcasts were experienced as stimulating for students to (1)
       engage more deeply with the lecture and understand the content
       better and (2) reflect on the topics and on what they know about
       them" (Popova et al., 2014).

Students do not typically conduct self-reflection on a lecture or
podcasts. However, by adding in the epistemic questions the
instructor forced the student to think holistically about the topic
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 67
BLENDED LEARNING

and bring questions to class that was sparked by the scaffolding
podcasts.

   Podcasts allow students to connect with instructors anytime and
anywhere. The ease in which students in the 21st century can
connect to a podcast is unmatched in most forms of technology,
"Although podcasts are composed of MP3 files, it is the automatic
distribution method combined with the potential for portability
that makes podcasts what they are" (Bryans Bongey, Cizadlo, &
Kalnbach, 2006). The majority of students, high school or adult
learners, have access to a smart phone that can play podcasts and
MP3 files. They can play them anywhere they want, as opposed to
a video recorded lecture that has to be played on a computer and
must have the visual attention of the learner to be effective. One
author states this simplicity as, "What is novel with podcasting is
the way that - a simple change in file format and delivery method
- can meet students' mobile and lifestyle needs by transporting a
professor's teachings away from the confinements of the lecture
hall or computer/audio carrel and into any environment of the
listener's choosing" (Bryans Bongey et al., 2006). If a student
attends a traditional class in person or reviews a PowerPoint and
reading materials online or an online or blended course they are
still able to enhance their knowledge or supplement the materials
with podcasts on their own time. Podcasts can also be used to
review material before an exam or to catch up on a missed lecture
(Bryans Bongey et al., 2006). The reach of podcasts is limitless
and not constrained by a particular topic. They have the ability to
break through the constraints of traditional classroom learning and
time with its on-demand features and accessibility (Bryans Bongey
et al., 2006). Finding new ways to relay information and adapting
these techniques continually helps students stay motivated and
connected to the course.

   This concept of anytime, anywhere use of podcasts, relates to
medical students as they must cultivate independent teaching skills
and are in a profession where you never stop learning, medicine.
68  TUTALENI I. ASINO

In the profession of medicine, doctors must complete board exams
to recertify their credentials. The knowledge base for medicine is
constantly evolving with new guidelines from different groups and
boards based on the latest accepted treatments. The nature of
residency is very similar to that of blended learning. In most cases,
residents will have weekly lectures referred to as grand rounds
where they present cases and discuss different treatment plans.
They stay attuned to new research, practices, regulations and
treatment options to supplement this learning with their own
dedicated time to study the latest literature to keep themselves
up to date and to contribute in grand round settings. A recent
study conducted on emergency medicine residents and their use
of podcasts suggested, "that residents spend a greater percentage
of their time listening to podcasts than they do using other
educational materials, including textbooks and journals" (Riddell et
al., 2017). This group of students was motivated to use podcasts
over traditional forms of educational resources for many reasons,
including: portability, ease of use, ability to listen while doing
something else, to "keep up with current literature" and to "learn
EM core content" (Riddell et al., 2017). The students also noted
that they were able to translate the knowledge learned from the
podcasts into their own clinical practices (Riddell et al., 2017). While
doctors are in the elevator or on lunch or driving to and from
work, they are able to continue expanding their knowledge with
podcasts. They can also choose podcasts based on topics they are
interested in to keep their attention.

   As the authors of a study on the use of podcasts by emergency
medicine residents state, "As we adopt new technologies, we must
also understand how and why they are being embraced by our
learners in order to employ them more effectively" (Riddell et al.,
2017). Another result of the study conducted by Riddell et al, was
the fact that residents on average, preferred podcasts that were
thirty minutes or less in length. They also, noted that the topics the
residents preferred to listen to were based on themes that were
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 69
BLENDED LEARNING

more controversial new topics and related to cutting-edge analysis
as opposed to emergency medicine core content. While this may
not be problematic, knowing how and why students are choosing
the content that they are listening to can help those creating the
podcasts incorporate what they feel is necessary into cover into
ideas that may spark listeners interest.

   While modernizing education must be on the radar of all
institutions and instructors, maintaining effective learning must
remain a goal in the efforts of adopting new technologies. Knowing
the potentials of podcasting and vodcasting can help instructors
implement it properly and assist the students along the way that
will find it advantageous. Knowing the rationale behind podcasting
is crucial for instructors to be comfortable with the technology and
eliciting proper student response and use of it (Heilesen, 2010).
A way to address this issue is to evaluate the use of podcasts in
multiple courses over a long period of time. Studies have shown
that having students engage in the podcast and actively engage
in the content learned in the podcast can assist in retaining
knowledge and creating a better academic atmosphere, "When it
comes to actively engaging the students in the creation of course
podcasts, it is a well-known fact that having to transform and
communicate information increases retention rates dramatically"
(Heilesen, 2010). By helping students accept the use of podcasts
the instructor can improve the academic environment and get
recognition from those most affected by new technologies,
students.

   As noted earlier on the general concepts of online and blended
learning and potential consequences of implementing it, there has
also been concern with the adaptation of podcasts that attendance
in class or in online and blended learning requirements would
be affected in a negative manner. "several studies conclude that
all fears of students skipping classes when lecture podcasts are
available so far seem unjustified" (Heilesen, 2010). While this is an
issue to be aware of, it should not deter universities or professors
70  TUTALENI I. ASINO

from using podcasts in their course materials. If it helps some
students to supplement the other materials and allows them to
expand their knowledge, they will be able to reach these students
and teach them in a way they may not have been able to without
the podcasts. Offering options in a course design for students will
help them feel motivated to try new things and they may learn
more about their own ways of learning that they did not know
before and be able to relate their personal use of podcasting that
they are already familiar with to their education.

VODCASTING

Podcasting has also evolved into video podcasting or vodcasting
since its inception. A vodcast is simply formatting video into a
podcast, a video podcast (Merriam-Webster, 2017). Similar to regular
podcasting, vodcasting allows students to review material for
missed classes, control their own learning and improve their
learning on content that may have been presented in a different
manner. Kay describes, "Receptive viewing of podcasts assumes
that learning material in whatever format is to be viewed by a
student in a relatively passive manner. Students may search for
desired segments or pause and review noteworthy concepts or
facts, but the main pedagogical strategy is the delivery of
information" (Kay, 2012). Students can rewind a vodcast or podcast
and review material that they may question, and skip over the
material they feel they have mastered.

   Vodcasts can also assist in motivating students in many learning
formats. Notably, students are motivated by video podcasting
because the format helps them sustain attention, they are
intellectually stimulating, they were relevant and the format
allowed the students to connect with the instructor and build a
relationship they might not have been able to in a large classroom
or by simply reading a textbook or article (Fernandez et al., 2009).
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 71
BLENDED LEARNING

Podcasting has been noted to have the same effect on creating a
sense of community and proximity to the instructor. Hearing the
actual instructors' voice rather than reading printed documents,
the non-pre-established nature of podcasts material based on
comments and suggestions from students and the ability of all
students, no matter their skill set or learning methods allowed
students to feel like they had a permanent connection to the
instructor. Students were also able to manage their time better
and study with more purpose which, as one study noted, "have a
common consequence: an increase in student motivation, which
constitutes one of the main principles of good practice in higher
education" (Fernandez et al., 2009). Giving students the freedom to
manage their own time and learn their best skills when it pertains
to studying can give them independence. However, too much
independence, and disconnection from the course can be a
disadvantage, podcasting has allowed instructors to circumvent
this issue with the students being able to hear their professors
voice and personalized messages.

   Knowing the ways in which the majority of students utilize
vodcasts to their best ability is crucial for the teacher the use best
practice. Students benefit from video podcasts because they can
learn at their own pace, they find the technology useful, helpful,
effective and stimulating and they have allowed students to study
in a different manner that has helped them succeed in earning
higher test scores and increased performance of skills (Kay, 2012).
A specific way for instructors to be sure that they are reaching
both to auditory and visual learner alike is by creating vodcasts
that run parallel to podcasts, a traditional podcast that is audio
only and a second that contains PowerPoint slides in an enhanced
format. While podcasts are readily available and cover a plethora
of topics, some students will still not be familiar with them, so
easing them into the process and adding in visual aspect can be
helpful to many learners (Fernandez et al., 2009). This idea helps
72  TUTALENI I. ASINO

the instructor reach all learning types of students and helps the
student feel connected and included in the class.

ITUNES U

Given the overall success of Podcasts and the ability of the
technology to adapt to most topics, professors should be aware
of the effects of them compared to in-person lectures. As stated
previously, podcasts can be used as a supplemental mode to
traditional PowerPoint slides or face-to-face lectures or they can
be used to assist students who miss class or want to refresh their
memories on a particular lecture. With this idea, came the
emergence of iTunes U which began as a storage space for
classrooms to keep their podcasts and has evolved in 2017 to
include, "homework hand-in, an integrated grade book, and private
discussions, it is a seamless way to organize your classroom. See
how simple it is to deliver lessons, grade assignments, and stay
connected -- all from your iPad" (Apple, 2017). McKinney describes
the usefulness of iTunes U, "Apple points out that the benefits
of iTUNES U include that it is easily accessible 24 hours per day,
students can listen to the podcasts whenever and wherever they
choose, and it helps to keep the students motivated because it
engages them in a way that is very familiar to them (iTunes U is a
link on the iTunes website)" (McKinney, Dyck, & Luber, 2009). While
this technology is Apple based, it can be accessed on non-Apple
products. iTunes U is a new and innovative way to not only used
podcasts in a traditional online learning platform, such as WebCT or
BlackBoard, but in this manner, the instructor can have their entire
course, including grading in one place.

   A unique aspect of iTunes U is the free access anyone that wants
to access it can use. Any course that wants to put content onto the
platform can do so, and any students or person with interest in the
content can access it. Matt Breed states this as an advantage of the
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 73
BLENDED LEARNING

software advantages of iTunes U along with being supplemental
to other courses. He identifies that podcasts on iTunes U come
from many universities, including recognizable names like Harvard,
Yale and MIT. While a lot of people may not think they can get
into schools like these or have the money to pay for them, iTunes
U allows the user access to a great deal of the information their
students are learning in the classroom. He also notes that if a
student is not excelling or working well with a certain professor or
course, they can look up a similar course on iTunes U and study
the material that way. While it is not identical to what their own
professor may be learning, the supplemental qualities of podcasts
can be taken advantage of in many ways (Breed, n.d.).

   In a 2009 study comparing the use of podcast lectures versus
in-class lectures by McKinney, Dyck, and Luber, 32 students
participated in the in-class condition and 34 students completed
the podcast condition. Since the podcast group was based on
students having an mp3 player, students self-selected into which
group they wanted to participate in. In both conditions, students
were given the PowerPoint slides for note taking to utilize while
listening or taking part in the in-person lecture. They were also
instructed to log their study time and activities used in preparing
for the exam that both groups would be given at the end of the
process. Of the students in the podcast group, the majority
appreciated viewing the slides while listening to the podcast. They
found it easy to go back and review material based on the chapter
markers that were integrated into each PowerPoint slide and found
this helpful for studying purposes (McKinney et al., 2009).

   Based on the exam administered at the end of the study, the
students in the podcast group as a whole scored, on average, 8.77
points higher than the in-class lecture group. The authors also
found that the 22 out of 34 students who were in the podcast
group, who took notes while listening to the podcast, scored
significantly higher than those who did not. Interestingly, the
students who listened to the podcast without taking additional
74  TUTALENI I. ASINO

notes scored similarly to those in the in-class lecture group
(McKinney et al., 2009). The authors assess that universities,
instructors and students cannot yet jump to any conclusions about
using podcasts as replacements for current content delivery
systems, whether they be in-person or technological. However,
knowing how students utilize podcasts is key to knowing how an
instructor can deliver a constructive message in their courses on
their use. Knowing what else students are doing while listening to
podcasts and how this is similar or different from what they are
doing in in-class lectures can be beneficial to study and lead to
greater understanding of the changing world of course delivery.

   As with any new concept there are trends and unforeseen
consequences that cannot be planned for but being able to deal
with them swiftly and in a positive manner is key. Means, Bakia
and Murphy state four major trends in online learning in higher
education"

       1. Self-paced, adaptive instruction and competency-based
            learning

       2. Blended learning

       3. Learning analytics

       4. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)

(Means, Bakia, & Murphy, 2014)
   The last trend, Massive Open Online Courses is a noted

unintended consequence related to online learning and podcasting
specifically. MOOCs began when instructors in Canada wanted to
offer their normal 25 student enrollment online theory course to
anyone that wanted to take it and not pay tuition. Users had access
to all readings, newsletters, discussions and all course material.
Over 2,300 people signed up for access which began a new trend of
offering courses to non-tuition paying students. The intent was to
give access to information to people with simple curiosity or those
that could not afford tuition. Other instructors and universities
PODCASTING AS A MODE OF MOTIVATION IN ONLINE AND 75
BLENDED LEARNING

caught on to this success and began to offer their courses in this
manner as well.

   A very successful case of offering a normal online university
course as a MOOC was in 2011 when two professors, Sebastian
Thrun and Peter Norvig, offered their Introduction to Artificial
Intelligence course to anyone outside of the 200 Stanford
University students who were already enrolled. An astounding
160,000 people from 190 countries signed up to take the course.
The university had to enlist 2,000 volunteer translators to translate
the course materials into 44 different languages. After three weeks
of the course, the actual number of people participating online was
45,000, still more students than the entire Stanford Universities
enrollment. The main piece of their course design was one to five-
minute videos to explain key concepts, very similar to podcasting.
Also, at the end of the course, students who were non-tuition
paying enrollees that completed all course assignments received a
"letter of accomplishment", to note their successful completion of
the course (Means, Bakia, & Murphy, 2014).

   Another case of the MOOC concept that portrayed the "viral"
nature of podcasting took place in a 2005 study on Podcasting. The
authors of this study aimed to, "explore the benefits, challenges
and impact of podcasting on higher education" (Bryans Bongey
et al., 2006). They describe the unintended success of the
implementation of the podcasts in a traditional biology course:

       "However, with a small amount of time and experience, we began
       to appreciate what has been referred to as the viral nature of
       podcasts, in which knowledge and use of the new podcasts spread
       rapidly and uncontrollably from one listener to the other. The
       distribution of the podcasts extended beyond the parameters of
       campus or students. Soon, Dr Cizadlo started receiving e-mail
       messages from out-of-state and non-US listeners. As one listener
       stated in an e-mail message, "I have directed friends (and yes,
       even my current Human Physiology Professor) to the podcasts"
       (personal communication, March 2, 2006)"
76  TUTALENI I. ASINO

(Bryans Bongey, Cizadlo, & Kalnbach, 2006).
   With the popularity where it was, the school and professor made

some minor changes to their podcasts. They registered all of their
podcasts to a directory, they were all made to be iTunes compliant,
and all included an introductory statement and included a logo
of the college's crest. One user commented on the addition of
these elements to the podcasts that kept the students motivated
and wanting to come back for more. The academic experience
created by the podcasts and the attention to detail the university
and professor paid to the student feedback motivated the students
and felt them feel like they were part of their education. They
were intrigued by a new way of learning and the university was
smart to grab ahold of the situation and work hand and hand with
the students and those outside of the university to deliver online
learning in the best possible way.

CONCLUSION

The integration of podcasts into online learning has been shown
to successfully reach a new kind of student cognition and blends
well into online and blended learning. The accessibility and
comprehensive nature of podcasts lends itself to learners who
need another mode of learning other than traditional face-to-face
interaction and allows students to learn anytime and anywhere
they choose to. Podcasts are also easy for the professor to learn
how to use and allow for adaptation along the way. Allowing
students to be integrated into their education, and have their
voices heard will help them remain motivated. The scaffolding and
supplemental use of podcasts adds another layer to learning that
can help professors and educators reach the greatest number of
students and educating those around the world.

CHAPTER 4

Virtual Proctoring and Academic
Integrity

DR. TAMMI KOLSKI, CENTRAL MICHIGAN UNIVERSITY

Central Michigan University

   Abstract. From elementary school through higher education,
students have taken examinations to evaluate their knowledge, abilities
and accomplishments. With increased pressures to have superior
performances for future occupational or academic consideration,
students may consider cheating to achieve higher exam scores. The
evolution of new technology enables students in all learning
environments to have unlimited access to digital content. Therefore,
some form of exam proctoring is needed in a digital environment to
ensure a quality, educational experience is maintained. The issue of
academic integrity regarding cheating is particularly important when
considering how online students are completing their course exams.
Holding students accountable for their actions of violating university
policies on academic integrity is demonstrating a greater societal value
of personal integrity. It also accentuates the expectation that students
will perform ethically in a digital society.

   Institutions concerned with the academic integrity in their online

                                                               80
VIRTUAL PROCTORING AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  81

courses are considering the use of virtual proctoring software designed
to protect against academic dishonesty behaviors in their students.
Virtual proctoring takes place with a student being on their own
computer, initiating a secured testing session via a dedicated web
browser (or having accessed an instructor designated website) that is
subsequently recording the student's behavior. Remotely the student
is using technological means, a functional webcam and microphone,
while they take their exam. To ensure the integrity of the exam-taking
process in online learning, exams monitored through a virtual proctor
are being found to be as secure as those completed in the presence of
the instructor or another human proctor.

INTRODUCTION.

Since the latter part of the 20th century, advances in technology
have dramatically changed the way education is delivered in
colleges and universities. Online learning (also referred to in
literature as eLearning or web-based distance education) has
become an accepted means of delivering quality, accessible
education to students in many different disciplines (Li & Irby, 2008).
In the 2015 Survey of Online Learning (Allen & Seaman, 2016), for
the thirteenth consecutive year, the number of higher education
students taking at least one online learning course was up 3.9%
over the previous year. With the increase in online learning
opportunities, educators question how to maintain academic rigor
while holding both on-campus and online students to the same
standards, expectations, and academic integrity principles,
particularly when considering methods of completing online course
exams. Online learning fosters the perception, perhaps unfairly,
that because students are separated by distance, it is difficult to
monitor assessments and cheating - or academic dishonesty - may
therefore occur (Poutre, Hedlund, & Nau, 2015; Watson & Sottille,
2010).
82  TUTALENI I. ASINO

   Despite efforts to prevent it, cheating remains widespread in
academic institutions (Fass-Holmes, 2017; Kyzer, 2010; Lajoie &
Bolichowski, 2010; McCabe, 2005; Rose, 2009). Placing an increased
emphasis on grades, students in all learning environments may
opt to cheat to achieve higher exam scores (McCabe, Trevino, &
Butterfield, 2001). Higher education institutions must help students
understand that embracing academic integrity is a necessary part
of achieving success. As a means of contributing to a greater ethical
society, universities should be taking steps to reduce instances
of academic dishonesty by instilling a prominent level of ethical
behavior and promoting digital citizenship in their students. As
a part of the course design, instructors could incorporate how
students would demonstrate digital citizenship in the exam
completion process. Robb and Shellenbarger (2013) identified a
way to promote digital citizenship and academic integrity in the
classroom by addressing prevention, awareness, and role
modeling. Prevention begins "with a clearly defined academic
integrity policy that guides students in appropriate digital etiquette
and helps them become responsible digital citizens. These
statements, consistent with institutional academic integrity
policies, should be included in the syllabus" (para 4). Offering
activities within a course that demonstrate digital etiquette not
only increases student awareness but serves as a good example
of the instructor upholding academic integrity standards. "Perhaps
most important in being a good role model are faculty addressing
academic dishonesty when it occurs. Academic dishonesty has
consequences and student offenders should experience them"
(para 7). Mullins (2000) adds that "failure to address student
academic dishonesty conveys the message that a core value of
academic life, honesty, is not worth any significant effort to
enforce" (p. 26). By allowing a student's violation to go unhandled,
or not be addressed even informally, faculty are not best preparing
students for the professional world that awaits them (Amua-Sekyi
& Mensah, 2016). According to Kiviniemi (2015), the "consequences
VIRTUAL PROCTORING AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  83

should be serious, should cause students some psychological pain,
and should require effort on the part of the student to overcome.
Anything less is a disservice to our students as we prepare them to
engage in their professional worlds" (p. 38).

   The continual and rapid evolution of new technology enables
students in all learning environments to have unlimited access
to digital content, resources, and databases. While the focus of
this chapter is regarding examinations, instructors who use other
methods to show content mastery (e.g. presentations or portfolios)
need to also consider technology resources (e.g. software
plagiarism detectors) to ensure academic integrity is maintained.
However, to ensure the integrity of the exam-taking process, there
are creative solutions that instructors can implement. This chapter
will first review how an online instructor could use Learning
Management System (LMS) control procedures to achieve
reasonable assurance that academic integrity has been maintained
and that significant cheating has not occurred during online exams.
Next, human and virtual proctoring options will be discussed
followed by use of virtual proctoring software or websites in more
detail, including this authors' pedagogical experiences using a
virtual proctor. Virtual proctoring is defined as a student being
on their own computer, having initiated a secured browser and
webcam or instructor designated website, that is subsequently
recording the student's behaviors remotely using technological
means while they take their exam.

LMS CONTROL PROCEDURES.

With higher education institutions utilizing virtual proctoring tools
in their online courses, the responsibility remains with the
instructor to ensure that the correct tools for assessing student
learning are in place. In addition to the proctoring of exam
sessions, instructors who continue to offer traditional exams (e.g.
84  TUTALENI I. ASINO

multiple-choice questions) in their online learning environments
can utilize LMS features (e.g. group work, portfolio development,
restricted amount of time to take the exam, no going backwards
in answering questions, etc.) and not just rely on test banks solely
for the development of exams. The institution's LMS controls the
time, date, type, and length of the exam. Instructors can create
exams from publisher purchased test banks or create their own
multiple choice, fill in the blank, matching, or essay type exams; to
name just a few of the options available. In setting up the online
learning course exam, the instructor can adjust the length of time
the student has to take the exam so the timing is congruent with
the student's cognitive processing and reading abilities. An
instructor can choose how exam questions are displayed to the
student: all at once or one question at a time; to have the questions
randomized for each student; or if the instructor wants to allow -
or prohibit - the student from backtracking or prevent changing an
answer already submitted. Instructors can allow students just one
exam attempt or multiple exam attempts; where different exam
questions can be generated for each attempt allowed. Instead of
using the same exam each term (or semester), instructors can
generate exams from pre-established randomized question pools
that are stored within the course LMS making it easy to create new
exams for each course (Fang, 2012). Use of LMS control procedures
can provide instructors reasonable assurance that academic
integrity has been maintained and that significant cheating has not
occurred during online exams (Cluskey, Ehlen, & Raiborn, 2011).

HUMAN PROCTORING.

Traditionally, instructors within a classroom or lecture hall on
campus have proctored exams within the same physical space that
the student is taking their exam. Also, live or human proctoring
takes place in a university approved location. Students travel to this
VIRTUAL PROCTORING AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  85

site to take their exam so both the human proctor and the student
are in the same physical space. While offering a greater degree of
confidence that the actual student is present taking the exam, the
scheduling inconveniences, travel time, and other potential costs
affiliated with human proctoring services are contrary to the
reasons why students have chosen to take online learning courses.
Additional drawbacks to the use of human proctors are a single
person monitoring multiple students concurrently; poor training;
lack of motivation; becoming tired, distracted, or overwhelmed;
and being more subjective or biased towards the student they
are proctoring (Marcus, Raul, & Ramirez-Velarde, 2008; Rios & Liu,
2017). Additionally, the subjectivity and variability of human
proctoring also does not guarantee a cheating-free evaluation
(Rose, 2009).

VIRTUAL PROCTORING.

Virtual proctoring looks quite different. The "eye" of the webcam
focuses its attention on just that one student and acts in a more
objective and unbiased way than a human proctor can (Marcus et
al., 2008). Respondus Monitor, one virtual proctor option, requires
that student's complete exams in front of a computer-mounted or
manufacturer-installed webcam that provides the instructor with
live streaming images of the student and their environment while
taking the assessment ("Respondus", n.d.). The exam session is
recorded and stored for the instructor to review after the student
completes their exam. Concurrently, the use of software like
Respondus LockDown Browser ("Respondus", n.d.) prevents
students from searching for answers on the Web while taking
exams through the online course. While there are additional virtual
proctoring services beyond Respondus Monitor (B Virtual, Examity,
Honorlock, Kryterion's Online Proctoring service, ProctorCam,
ProctorU, and others), there is a lack of published research
86  TUTALENI I. ASINO

comparing the existing virtual proctoring systems (Foster &
Layman, 2013).

   With virtual proctoring, students secure an Internet connection,
download required software (or log on to an instructor designated
proctoring website) and complete steps for their authentication
prior to taking their exam. To ensure that the student who is
completing the exam is, in fact, the enrolled student, instructors
could rely on technological tools to authenticate the student's
identity. Capturing an image of a government issued photo
identification, or the university photo student ID, through their
computer camera is one way to verify the identity of the student
taking the exam. Students may also be asked to complete a
360-degree scan of their environment, including the specific area
adjacent to their computer, where the student is taking their exam.
This captures video and sound to provide a complete monitoring
solution and to ensure other electronic devices, people, or
supplemental external resources are not being used to assist the
student in answering exam questions. Asking the student to check
a box in the startup phase of their exam acknowledging they
understand their institutions academic integrity policy and what
is - or is not - allowed to be used when taking their exam can
act as a deterrent against their engaging in academic dishonesty.
Wilkinson's descriptive research (2008) found that students
engaged in cheating behaviors due to lack of knowledge of their
institution's academic integrity policy or lack of understanding what
constituted a cheating violation for a particular course. If this
information is presented to the online learner prior to them
starting their virtual exam session, a student would be imprudent
from using this as an excuse for their cheating actions.

   Requiring students to complete a risk-free assessment, such as
a two-question sample test, would allow students to exhibit their
mastery of downloading the virtual proctoring software and
completing the authentication steps required to successfully
proceed through the test startup sequence. Completion of the no-
VIRTUAL PROCTORING AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  87

risk sample test also models the navigation routine that will be the
staple of the course for the student's exam taking sessions in the
online learning course. The sample test can also be an easy yet
effective best practice for reducing online student anxiety (St. Clair,
2015). Instructors can then review the student's sample test and
address any problems before the first course exam. Knowing that
their instructor will be reviewing their recorded exam session can
affirm for the student the importance of academic integrity in this
digital society forum.

   Many institutions offering online learning courses and who are
concerned with the academic security of these digital learning
environments are implementing virtual proctoring software
designed to protect against academic dishonesty behaviors in their
students (Baron & Crooks, 2005). Utilizing virtual proctoring tools
while students take online exams can provide the instructor
reasonable assurance that academic integrity has been maintained
(Cluskey et al., 2011). Virtual proctoring seeks to dissuade the
perception that cheating on exams is easier and more common
among online learning students (Bartini, 2008). Research by
Bedford, Gregg, and Clinton (2009), on both faculty and students,
showed that virtual proctoring may be a valuable resource to
higher education online learning programs because of its
functionality, low cost, and help in deterring students from
engaging in acts of academic dishonesty by cheating. Furthermore,
the use of a virtual proctor is at least as trustworthy as a human
proctor (Marcus et al., 2008) while upholding exam integrity,
academic rigor and university standards of a quality education.

PEDAGOGICAL EXPERIENCES WITH CHEATING
VIOLATIONS.

When I first began teaching undergraduate courses in the online
learning environment, the university's psychology department
88  TUTALENI I. ASINO

required the online learning student to take their course exams in
the presence of a human proctor. In addition to the set of human
eyes watching for overt acts of academic dishonesty, the human
proctors could discretely capture screenshots if they saw or
suspected the student to be looking up information on the Internet.
It was during my third term of teaching that my first incident of
a student looking up exam content on the Internet while taking
her exam was detected by the human proctor. Over the course
of the next two years, six more students were caught looking up
exam content on the Internet while actively taking their exams and
being proctored by a human. This institution had a clear, detailed
academic integrity policy which outlined what constituted a
violation (in this case cheating) as well as the options for how
to process the suspected violation (options ranging from a stern
dialog with the student to recommending the student be expelled
from the university). While there was a scripted policy, there
remained a lack of any standard for how to proceed. For each of
the violations I processed, the students received a sanction of a
failing grade for the course. Aside from the administrative time
required to process these cases, the personal stress experienced in
addressing these violations was taxing, regardless if it was the first
or the seventh violation.

   Because of these cheating violations, when I heard that my
university was considering the use of virtual proctoring software,
I volunteered my course as a pilot for implementing this exam
monitoring technology. With training materials offered by the
software company, as well as my university's office of information
technology personnel, learning how to build virtual proctoring into
my course, with the right balance of constraints, was not
complicated. Prior to starting their webcam invigilated exam, the
online students needed to install the Respondus LockDown
Browser program to prevent them from accessing other websites
while taking their online course exam(s). The Respondus software
program allowed for me to review the recording of the students
VIRTUAL PROCTORING AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  89

taking their (submitted) exams within 24 hours of the exam-taking
session. There were options to view each student's exam session in
its entirety or to review randomly timed thumbnail images of the
student. I could also watch before or after times when the software
detected something unusual (e.g. student not in the picture,
student looking to the side, another person presents in the image,
etc.). Though several instances like these were documented by
the software, upon further investigation and review of the exam
recording, none showed a student to be cheating or otherwise
engaged in unethical behavior. It was in 2014 when my course
was piloted using virtual proctoring technology and I continue to
use Respondus LockDown Browser and Respondus Monitor for all
of my traditional online course exams - which now includes two
universities. To date, there remains no academic integrity violations
having been detected upon my review of each student's recorded
exam sessions.

DOES VIRTUAL PROCTORING DETER STUDENTS
FROM CHEATING?

Within the academic community, it is commonly believed that
cheating is more likely to occur in online classes than face-to-face
classes (Miller & Young-Jones, 2012). It is perceived that online
learning courses lend themselves to cheating by nature of the
classroom environment utilized (Poutre et al., 2015). Such
pervasive notions exist despite a lack of empirical evidence within
the literature to support this comparative idea. Baron and Crooks
(2005) conducted a meta-analysis relative to academic dishonesty
in online learning settings and concluded both faculty and students
believed it was easier to cheat in an online environment than in a
traditional classroom setting. Whereas, Watson and Sottile (2010)
utilized an academic dishonesty assessment tool with
undergraduate and graduate university students deducing there
90  TUTALENI I. ASINO

were no significant differences in the student's' admission of
cheating for live (face to face) and online courses. When querying
the benefit of a virtual proctor in preventing students from
cheating, Moten, Fitterer, Brazier, Leonard, and Brown (2013) found
that 43% of their student participants thought the use of a webcam
would prevent cheating. Karim, Kaminsky, and Behrend's (2014)
experimental study found that remote proctoring did not directly
affect test-taker reactions and performance, but it did decrease
instances of cheating. Thus, technology innovations such as virtual
proctoring are improving instructor confidence that online
summative assessments can be as secure as those completed in
the presence of a human proctor (James, 2016).

   Previous research about what propels students to engage in acts
of academic dishonesty support these conclusions. Lim and Coalter
(2006) reported that students are less likely to cheat if they perceive
faculty to hold matters of academic integrity in high regard, if
faculty respond appropriately to violations, and if faculty enforce
institutional policy regarding acts of dishonesty. Professors are
sometimes criticized for testing students on the memorization of
formulas and equations that they would have access to in the
working world electronically (Hodgkinson, Curtis, Macalister, &
Farrell, 2015). It has been suggested that students may feel
cheating is justified in retaliation for trick questions or being tested
on material not adequately covered in the course (Cizek, 1999 as
cited in Hodgkinson et al., 2015). Harding (2001) found that
students were less likely to cheat if the test was perceived as fair.
Wilkinson (2008) concluded the top eight common reasons for
students to cheat included:

       not understanding the rules of referencing, laziness or bad time
       management skills, easy access to material via the Internet, the
       student is not aware they are doing anything wrong, not feeling like
       they will get caught or penalties if they are caught are insignificant,
       wanting to get a better grade, and badly designed assessments. (p.
       102)
VIRTUAL PROCTORING AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY  91

The Internet has allowed for different methods of cheating that
were impossible before its widespread popularity, but it is unclear
whether students have dropped their old methods of cheating and
replaced them with techniques involving technology (Heneghan,
2012). Students should be increasingly aware that they leave digital
footprints in their work. For example, from my own experience
shared above - when students looked up information while taking
their exams, the technology utilized provided evidence through
the content captured in a screenshot. Using a virtual proctor, the
"eye" of the webcam documents the student's every move. If any
cheating was taking place, the exam recording would offer the
instructor evidence of an academic integrity violation that could
then be provided as indisputable evidence should that level of
inquisition be rendered.

CONCLUSIONS.

Academic dishonesty in the form of cheating on examinations
remains an issue in traditional (seated) classroom environments as
well as in the digital age of online learning environments. Within
the academic community, there is dissonance among researchers
regarding increased prevalence of cheating in online classes
compared to face-to-face classes (Baron & Crooks, 2005; Miller &
Young-Jones, 2012; Watson & Sottile, 2010). Students may try to
cheat, regardless of being proctored by a human or by a webcam,
because students who make the choice to cheat will find a method
for attempting such regardless of the learning environment. While
institutional efforts occur to reduce acts of academic dishonesty,
the pressure on students to succeed (or the belief that cheating
is an easier way out) remains a part of human nature for some
college students. Educators should not assume that students know
what constitutes academic integrity. They need models of good
practices and guidance on appropriate digital behavior; including
92  TUTALENI I. ASINO

needing new ways to monitor student behavior during their online
course exam sessions. By instilling in college students the
importance and value of ethical behavior, and using tools like
virtual proctoring to convey a message of importance regarding
academic integrity, institutions are then contributing to a greater
ethical society.

   We cannot teach behaviors of academic honesty if integrity is
not part of the university's culture (Fang, 2012). Holding students
accountable for their actions of violating university policies on
academic integrity is demonstrating a greater societal value of
personal integrity and expectation that students will perform
ethically in a digital society. Being consistent with student
accountability and following through with consequences has been
found to be one of the most useful ways to decrease instances of
academic dishonesty (Hulsart & McCarthy, 2008). Although various
techniques can serve to detect or minimize cheating, universities
have a greater responsibility to teach students about the ethical
implications of academic cheating (Fang 2012). In the online
learning environment, in particular, utilizing virtual proctoring tools
with students taking exams can provide the professor reasonable
assurance that academic integrity has been maintained (Cluskey
et al., 2011), thus upholding academic integrity standards. As the
virtual proctoring technology continues to improve, further
research specifically regarding its effectiveness in deterring
students from engaging in cheating behaviors while taking their
online course exams is encouraged. The use of virtual proctoring
technology to uphold academic integrity standards as a
cornerstone for a quality educational experience while not
compromising academic rigor, especially in the online learning
environment, should be considered by all university administrators
and instructors.

CHAPTER 5

Personal Learning Networks:
Defining and Building a PLN

CATHY L. GREEN, OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY

Oklahoma State University

   Abstract.This article answers questions about what a personal
learning network is, why you might want to build one, and how to
create one for yourself to experience the benefits it has to offer.

WHAT IS A PERSONAL LEARNING NETWORK?

One of the strengths of the digital environment is its highly
networked nature and this is particularly relevant for personal
learning networks where access to information and resources far
surpasses anything that has come before both in terms of variety
and volume. Further, in such an environment information changes
more rapidly than ever before, and individuals need to engage in
ongoing learning to keep pace, be it in a professional, personal
or civic capacity. At one time it was adequate to read a daily
newspaper, a magazine or two on special topics of interest and

                                                               98
PERSONAL LEARNING NETWORKS: DEFINING AND BUILDING A 99
PLN

perhaps belong to an organization of interest that had conferences
or meetings once or twice a year. In the past, an education typically
set one up for life in the work of their choice and while there were
changes in fields or topics of interest, they happened slowly, in
terms of years. In the digital world of the 21st century, however,
this is no longer the case and information can change in days,
weeks or months. An excellent tool for handling quickly expanding
and growing data is to create a Personal Learning Network (PLN)
(Delaney & Redman, 2014; Perez, 2012; Trust, 2012).

   PLN's consist of formal and informal networks of individuals with
similar goals and interests who interact using digital tools to share
information, learn from each other, problem solve and collaborate
(Ferguson, 2010; Nelson, 2012; Perez, 2012; Trust, 2012). They
provide a vehicle for lifelong learning for both personal and
professional development by enabling individuals to remain
relevant in a world of rapidly changing information. While PLN's can
encompass both digital and face to face connections (Perez, 2012)
the focus of this discussion will be on digital learning networks and
why they are significant to learning in a digital age.

   In addition, PLN's provide far greater resources and information
than one can muster alone or in a small group (Ross, Maninger,
LaPrairie, & Sullivan, 2013). Ferguson (2010, p. 13) emphasizes this
point when he says, "Before I built my professional learning
network, I did all my learning by myself. If I needed to understand
something for a new unit, I researched it on my own.... A PLN
is a community of individuals around the world who are learning
together." Even though Ferguson specifically mentions a
professional learning network, the mechanics of how the network
functions is much the same as in a personal learning network, just
with a different focus. The key point here is the idea of "learning
together". Within a networked environment there is less emphasis
on singular sources of expertise and instead, a focus on dialogue
and constructing knowledge as a group comes into play. This is
facilitated by the speed with which conversations take place in a
100  TUTALENI I. ASINO

digital environment where people can connect across the globe in
minutes and hours instead of weeks, months or years.

   While the characteristics of a PLN include fast access to massive
amounts of information, a successful PLN is also characterized by
participants who are highly self-motivated and curious. Without
people who have a passion for learning, a PLN would not be as
valuable. Further, the ability to build one's own network makes it
possible to develop a highly customized approach to learning. As
you will see, building a PLN gives one the freedom to develop tools,
skills and knowledge that specifically suit one's learning needs.

TOOLS FOR BUILDING A PLN.

A digital PLN can reflect a variety of tools and methods, depending
on individual preferences and goals. Most people will develop a
variety of tools for a well-rounded learning network that meets all
of their needs. An easy way to think about building a PLN is to
decide what functionality you need. For example, one requirement
of a PLN is to gather the information that helps one stay current
with developments in a particular field or interest area. Blogs, RSS
feeds, email lists, websites, news groups and podcasts can provide
a steady stream of up to date information. To take advantage
of the experience of a wider variety of people and practitioners,
another way to connect is through social networking tools. Some
are smaller and focused on a specific subject such as Edmodo,
Classroom 2.0 or the Educator's PLN while others are much bigger
and provide a single tool for tracking a variety of topics and
information such as Twitter, Linked-in and Pinterest. Websites such
as these provide an opportunity to both share and receive new
information as well as find support, collaborators and thoughtful
discussions.

   While informal networks and learning opportunities are a
hallmark of PLN's it is not uncommon to include formal learning
PERSONAL LEARNING NETWORKS: DEFINING AND BUILDING A 101
PLN

tools as well. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCS) are offered
by many colleges and universities. They are free and can offer
opportunities to fold new topics and information into one's existing
expertise. ITunes-U has a large selection of lectures from multiple
colleges and universities and there are also a number of websites
offering online classes on a variety of topics such as Udemy and
Khan Academy. Even YouTube is a good bet for finding instructional
information for specific skills and topics. In short, a PLN is what
each individual wants it to be and it reflects each individual's
personal passions, motivations and desire to know (Moreillon,
2016; Nelson, 2012).

     Figure 1. Categories of learning for a personal learning network
                                     (Green, 2017).

HOW TO BUILD A PLN.

Because there is such a wide variety of available tools and goals for
PLN's not everyone's PLN will look the same. In addition, the tools
102                                       TUTALENI I. ASINO

for inclusion are always changing and some have different features

and benefits. Given the variety of different tools available, it may

be intimidating to get started so this last section offers some advice

about how to start and build a successful PLN. The following can

suggest a typical path towards developing a PLN.

The best way to get started is to choose a specific tool and work

with it until it feels comfortable (Trust, 2012). Setting up sources

for current information is a good place to start and member

organizations' websites have a lot to offer. For example, if one has

an interest in world drumming and participating in drum circles,

one  might              start        the          web  site

http://www.worldmusicdrumming.com/. They have a resources list,

provide workshops, and they have a Facebook page. This is a great

start and it connects me with an organization that caters to my

personal interest and to a Facebook page where I will engage with

other people who share my passion for drumming. Once I begin

checking the Facebook page I find a really interesting post about

an African song. A few clicks later I have landed on

http://pancocojams.blogspot.com/ where I find a lengthy article

about traditional afro-Cuban music.

At this point I have an organizational website with information

that is updated maybe monthly, a Facebook page that appears to

be very active with posts every day and a related blog that is also

updated at least every couple of days. This is a really good start to

a PLN. At some point I may decide to take a drumming class, either

online or in person and that organization will likely have a web

presence that I can add to my PLN. I may also decide I need some

help with a specific instrument and seek out some YouTube videos

on how to play it and I can create a personal YouTube channel with

my favorite videos. The important things to remember are "don't

try to read everything" and spend consistent time cultivating your

sources (Perez, 2012).

A final step to consider in developing a PLN is to think about

contributing your own information. The one thing that makes a PLN
PERSONAL LEARNING NETWORKS: DEFINING AND BUILDING A 103
PLN

an excellent way to learn is to contribute your own information and
expertise. Without people who contribute, a PLN would stagnate
quickly. Nobody wants to hang out on a Facebook page where
the last post was three months ago. So, when developing a social
networking presence don't lurk, actively participate and separate
the professional from the private (Perez, 2012).

   Now that one has a PLN the last tip is to tend to it. Without
attention and care, the PLN will not be useful and interest will
wane. Think of it as a garden. Sometimes planting, sometimes
weeding, sometimes harvesting but always tending the garden so
that it grows and is productive. Occasionally a resource may stop
being useful so remove it. Other times a new, interesting resource
can be added. Whatever the decision, keep in mind that this is your
PLN and it is designed to serve your needs. There are no right and
wrong ways to go about it. So, as one network source grows and
matures expanding to another tool or community can help fill any
gaps in the first one.

CONCLUSION.

In setting up a PLN, variety is a key factor to success. Engaging
in different communities with different areas of focus will provide
a rich environment for learning. This is especially easy to do in
a digital environment where one literally has the entire world to
draw from as a source of inspiration. There is no need to settle for
sources that do not meet your needs. In the end, the important
thing is that each individual can select those tools and websites that
meet their learning needs. Those will not be the same for everyone
and they may change over time as well.

CHAPTER 6

Digital Learners in the
Workplace

TAMMY WISE, OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY

Oklahoma State University

   Abstract. Training is invaluable and often required in most
industries. To stay competitive, companies must be focused on keeping
their employees up-to-date on the latest industry standards and
compliant with new regulations. This writing discusses the types of
learning and learners, the benefits and concerns of digital learning, and
how these learners can embrace the digital platforms.

INTRODUCTION.

Training is invaluable and often required in most industries. To
stay competitive, leadership must be focused on keeping their
employees up-to-date on the latest industry standards and
compliant with new regulations. Companies know that it takes time
to train employees and time is money. However, many companies
do not invest enough time in allowing their employees to be strong

                                                              106
OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY  107

digital learners which leads to consequences in the workplace, such
as, uninformed workers causing costly workplace errors.

   The State of the Industry report released by the Association of
Talent Development for 2016 states that "Organizations spent an
average of $1,252 per employee on training and development
initiatives in 2015" (ATD Releases 2016 State of the Industry Report,
2016). With this cost, instructor-led training averaged about "49
percent of the learning hours" (ATD Releases 2016 State of the
Industry Report, 2016). The remaining 51 percent involves informal
learning which includes digital learning. This last percentage
represents employees taking control of their education and seeking
out learning opportunities through online sources.

   The benefits of digital learning for employers are vast, depending
on how they choose/allow the use of this type of education. It
is a cost-effective benefit as a one-time investment in a digital
training course, and can add training for their entire workforce
while supplying consistent information to all employees. For
example, by utilizing computer-based trainings or videos for newly
hired employees, companies can provide training with little effort,
consistent messages, and on-demand learning as needed, saving
the company money and time. The result is a well-prepared
workforce ready to do the job at hand with the latest industry
knowledge.

   The old-school way of training employees is to put them in a
classroom and show a slide presentation while droning on about
the material. Many companies still invest in this type of learning
as they feel it works for them. However, employees do not find it
interesting enough to pay attention and the instructors grow tired
of teaching the same material over and over. Another traditional
way of educating workers is on-the-job training (OJT). Although
this can be far more valuable than classroom training, OJT is not
often consistent. One mentor may teach how he would do the
job while another may show a completely different way. Digital
108  TUTALENI I. ASINO

learning addresses these issues of consistency and helps ensure a
systematic way of learning for new and existing employees.

   Software tools have made it easy to create fun, interactive
learning experiences. Images spin and turn, text flows with the
audio, and the user can click on buttons and icons to learn the
topic. These online courses ensure consistency in what is being
taught and how it is being presented while keeping the tactile
employee engaged. It eliminates the saying of "that's the way we've
always done it" and embraces the concept that learning does not
have to be "one-size-fits-all". The options that digital learning
provides are endless and always changing for the better.

TYPES OF LEARNING

   The advent of the internet has opened many doors for learners.
People no longer have to visit the library to learn something new.
With the click of a button or two, the information needed is readily
available. Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have provided
a realm for users to learn college-type courses for free at their
OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY  109

convenience. This has been beneficial for workers and the
workplace as employees can advance their knowledge on specific
topics in their free time. Most corporate environments have
embraced the digital tools available for their employees to learn
new techniques, maintain regulatory compliance, and build their
leadership skills.

   Some of the many digital platforms and tools through which
users can learn include YouTube, computer-based training, online
forums, and application communities. There are a multitude of
sites that offer online training, many of which are free or low cost.
EBooks or audiobooks are an ever-evolving way of learning the
most up-to-date material as these are easy to maintain with the
latest information. There are even applications where the user can
highlight and bookmark pages within the eBook making the virtual
textbook a good alternative to the hard copy textbook.

   For learners who do not have time to sit through a lecture, they
can now participate in one online at their leisure. These can be
pre-recorded or live. Podcasts make learning easy for users as
they drive to work, exercise, or are waiting at the doctor's office.
To take digital learning even further, training designers have the
capabilities to create simulations for learners to apply their
knowledge in a situation where mistakes are virtual and learning
experiences include operating rooms, science experiments, and car
repairs.

   The offerings of these tools are endless with topics suitable for
anyone's learning needs. Luckily, users can decide what they want
to learn and when. The tools available are vast and employees are
only constricted by their own schedules.

TYPES OF LEARNERS

When referring to learners in the corporate world, one must realize
there are several types of learners. There are those new and
110  TUTALENI I. ASINO

unskilled employees who require intensive training, those
employees who know the job but need a refresh of knowledge,
and existing and new leaders who need more coaching or want to
advance their positions. There are also varying industry learners.
For example, mechanics will need different training in comparison
to accountants. Many companies delegate their employees to
different levels and train them depending on their knowledge and
experience level. No matter what kind of learner, the digital tools
available can be applied to every type of learner.

   Generational differences are also a part of the different types
of learners. Employers appreciate employees with skills to develop
themselves inexpensively and conveniently (Will Online Learning
Replace the Classroom?, 2014). Baby Boomers and Gen Xers may
be more hesitant to learn digitally, but Millennials and GenEdgers
embrace it. Employers must recognize these generational
differences and provide outlets for all of these diverse learning
groups. This is often easier said than done. Developing programs
that can address the learning needs of various generations is a
daunting task. By taking the specific company's workforce
differences into account, employee specific training can be
identified and developed. This is the responsibility of the company
to recognize the company and employee needs and develop
appropriate learning opportunities.

   Among these types of learners, there are also differing levels
of engagement. When an employee is highly engaged, he or she
will actively seek learning opportunities. When companies do not
provide enough training, then these employees tend to go digital to
see what they can learn on their own. This new-found learning can
enhance these employees' existing departments or, unfortunately,
take them elsewhere. The opposite extreme is the actively
disengaged employee who does not want to learn much of
anything for their existing job as he or she has lost motivation for
the job. This employee may be using digital learning opportunities
to try and enter a different field of work altogether.
OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY  111

   Basically, there are a few types of informal learning that digital
learning falls into. These include career-driven, on-demand, and
social learning (Designing Learning for a 21st Century Workforce,
2012). Career-driven employees are those who want to advance in
their careers and will seek out training opportunities to help with
their goals. These employees often locate training sessions that
will increase their own knowledge and possibly grow them into
a leadership role. The on-demand learners want to learn when it
is convenient for them. It may be work related or not, but they
find a need to answer a question and want to search for ways to
learn about it. Then there is the social learner. This type of learner
will not only embrace learning from those around them, but also
learning within the group. This is often due to group peer pressure.
They find what they need and decide if they want to learn more.
Now, to look at the method of learning in terms of "on-demand
learner" or a "social learner". These would be ways a motivated
learner might learn. "On-demand" learner uses technology to
quickly find answers now. Whereas, a "social" learner will seek out
instruction from resources within the organization. This could be
to find out how this specific group does this or that. This type
of information, often referred to as "tribal knowledge" can't be
found through `on-demand' technology resources. The learner has
to talk to someone in the group that has the knowledge they seek.
However, the social learner can decide to go online to explore
similar content.

   The types of learners, whether generational or situational, are
going to find ways to learn what they need to maintain or grow
their positions and themselves. Companies would be smart to
embrace this desired learning and offer courses (along with time
to complete) to their employees. The benefits are not only for the
employee but also the company.

WHAT ARE THE GOOD THINGS ABOUT DIGITAL
112  TUTALENI I. ASINO

LEARNING?

Although the traditional classroom has benefits such as focused
learning time and one-on-one time with the instructor, digital
learning offers the workplace more flexibility and is more astute
to today's learning situations. MOOCs are readily available courses
where the user can decide what they want to learn and when.
Just-in-time learning provides the training these employees need
at their convenience. The learners may wish to learn a new skill,
enhance current knowledge, or even earn credits for a certification.

   Workers are busy and on tight schedules. They don't always have
time to spend in a classroom and sometimes these classes are
offered at inconvenient times. With video and computer-based
training courses available, they can learn when they have a few
minutes to spare while waiting on a meeting or at the end of the
day. Microlearning lends itself as useful for employees to educate
themselves conveniently. With shortened segments, focused on
specific topics, microlearning allows the employee to pick what
is most important to learn at the time or to complete a small
portion of a required training. The flexibility of remote learning is
invaluable for learners and companies while having a manageable
cost.

   With this just-in-time learning, users can pace themselves
according to their learning styles and abilities. Learners are in
control of their own education. Having the ability to pause, rewind,
and fast forward is a powerful tool for digital learners to
accommodate their own learning styles. This allows the users to
learn the way they prefer and when they want. For example, the
learner may not be an avid reader but can listen to a podcast
or audiobook with ease. Learning is relative to the situation and
today's tools make it ever so convenient.

   Another benefit of online learning is online forums or
communities within a similar industry which provides employees
with the experience and knowledge of every member. Users simply
OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY  113

have to submit a question, and within minutes, they will have the
answers they need to do their jobs better. The time it takes to
participate in these forums is well worth the return. There are some
drawbacks in that the user has to stay active in order to remain
up-to-date on the content being discussed. Once again, employers
need to embrace this knowledge base and allow time during the
day to participate.

   One of the best aspects of digital learning is that it is
customizable. An aerospace company can adjust a course on sales
tactics to fit their sales team. An oil and gas company can create
a training course that meets OSHA standards but also addresses
specific issues to the company. This flexibility provides valuable
training to employees rather than just completing a requirement.
Also, companies no longer require dedicated instructors when
working with digital material. This alleviates some of the training
costs and ensures consistent training content for their employees,
especially since the content can be taught to a large number of
employees all at once. Remember that training takes time and time
is money. There is no reason not to make it valuable for everyone.

WHAT COULD POSSIBLY GO WRONG WITH
DIGITAL LEARNING?

A company must make digital tools accessible to employees while
on the job, which has proven to be difficult in some industries.
Digital security is a huge issue that many companies must manage
in order to keep their information protected. While locking down
their systems, they are also blocking users from the valuable tools
only available online. Workplaces need to understand that if they
want additional training sources available to employees, then they
need to review their internet policies and find ways to secure
access for their workers. Employees should also have the ability to
114  TUTALENI I. ASINO

reach out to IT and ask for permission to various sites of learning
as necessary.

   One way around some of the digital security issues is for
employers to create their own internal digital training or purchase
it from a vendor to be loaded into the organization's learning
platform. When companies implement computer-based training
(CBT), they are offering just-in-time learning to their employees.
Unfortunately, not all CBT courses are well monitored for their
value and end up giving the employees a chance to simply check a
box and no learning takes place. This is where traditional learning
has leverage. Employees need to have time allotted to their
learning throughout the workday, and employers need to
recognize the importance of these learning opportunities while
ensuring the provided courses are value-added.

   Learners may not make as much effort while taking a course
when there is little monitoring and expectations of participation.
Without the human interaction, users can find it difficult to stay
engaged. The courses are created at the time of usage and cannot
be tailored to the user's needs. The dynamic between the learner
and facilitator is lost in cyberspace. It becomes prescriptive learning
that does not always work for everyone in the audience. Online
learning proposes a remedy for situations with few solutions
without giving the user options to apply within their own
organization or situation.

   Taking a CBT or webinar is convenient, but what if the learner
has a question? There is no way to instantly ask the instructor.
The learner can send an email and hope for a prompt answer, but
that is usually not the case. The user ends up having to search
for their own answers or just be satisfied with not knowing all the
information.

   Another situation is that digital learners must be aware that not
everything is true on the internet, so they must be aware of
reputable learning sites. Just because it is read on the interwebs,
does not mean that it is true. How does a digital learner distinguish
OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY  115

between what is real and fantasy? Lots of research! Don't ever
settle for one explanation on one website. The user must always be
looking for alternate solutions for all problems and situations.

   When companies invest time and money into digital learning,
they must remain vigilant to the effectiveness of the education
being received by their employees. This is not an easy task but
enhances the benefits of these digital learning opportunities.
Commitment to improving their workforce is the first step.

WHAT DOES THE LEARNER GET OUT OF IT?

Competition in today's workforce can be fierce. Employees must do
more than obtain a degree to stay competitive. Certifications help
maintain requirements, but don't always mean eligibility to do a
job. Increasing one's knowledge in relevant subjects is necessary
to ensure adequate employee placement. Unfortunately, not all
companies offer career advancement training opportunities.
Employees must take their education into their own hands and
seek out training courses that will help them grow.

   Building a personal learning network (PLN) can be invaluable to
these workers when trying to keep up with the latest trends in
their industry and trying to grow themselves personally or into
a leadership position. Sites like LinkedIn, Twitter, association
websites, and industry blogs are tools that all digital learners need
in their PLN. With so many websites devoted to specific topics,
enhancing one's PLN takes time and cannot be accomplished
overnight. However, this is an easy way to keep their knowledge
current and forward-looking.

   Since career growth is important to most employees, digital
learning offers a greater access to training opportunities for the
user. Utilizing digital learning options can help a worker grow into
a new role, officially or not. With all of the digital learning options,
116  TUTALENI I. ASINO

users can determine what material they prefer to learn and follow
it to more learning material suiting their styles.

   Ultimately, digital learners obtain the knowledge they want out of
the learning situations they are placed in. Experienced learners will
know how to obtain the information they are seeking and where to
apply this knowledge.

CLOSING.

Companies have a choice: they can choose to stay in the past and
only utilize classroom training while not embracing digital learning,
or they can welcome the new age of learning along with the
benefits that it affords. If they choose not to accept this renewed
way of learning, then they could end up with a disengaged
workforce who is not learning the necessary skills to stay current
in today's trades. Having employees who know what they want to
learn and how to achieve it is invaluable. Employers will be wise
to listen and observe what is happening in their workplace and
embrace the changes that are occurring.

CHAPTER 7

Digital literacies and the skills of
the digital age

CATHY L. GREEN, OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY

Oklahoma State University

   Abstract - This chapter is intended to provide a framework and
understanding of digital literacy, what it is and why it is important. The
following pages explore the roots of digital literacy, its relationship to
language literacy and its role in 21st century life.

INTRODUCTION

Unlike previous generations, learning in the digital age is marked
by the use of rapidly evolving technology, a deluge of information
and a highly networked global community (Dede, 2010). In such
a dynamic environment, learners need skills beyond the basic
cognitive ability to consume and process language. In other words:
To understand what the characteristics of the digital age, and of
digital learners, means for how people learn in this new and
changing landscape, one may turn to the evolving discussion of

                                                              118
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  119

literacy or, as one might say now, of digital literacy. The history
of literacy contextualizes digital literacy and illustrates changes in
literacy over time. By looking at literacy as a historical
phenomenon, the characteristics of which have evolved over time,
we can glean the fundamental characteristics of the digital age.
Those characteristics in turn illuminate the skills needed in order to
take advantage of digital environments. The following discussion is
an overview of digital literacy, its essential components and why it
is important for learning in a digital age.

MOVING FROM LITERACY TO DIGITAL LITERACY

Literacy refers to the ability of people to read and write (UNESCO,
2017). Reading and writing then, is about encoding and decoding
information between written symbols and sound (Resnick, 1983;
Tyner, 1998). More specifically, literacy is the ability to understand
the relationship between sounds and written words such that one
may read, say and understand them (UNESCO, 2004; Vlieghe, 2015).
Literacy is often considered a skill or competency and is often
referred to as such. Children and adults alike can spend years
developing the appropriate skills for encoding and decoding
information.

   Over the course of thousands of years, literacy has become much
more common and widespread with a global literacy rate ranging
from 81% to 90% depending on age and gender (UNESCO, 2016).
From a time when literacy was the domain of an elite few, it has
grown to include huge swaths of the global population. There are
a number of reasons for this, not the least of which are some of
the advantages the written word can provide. Kaestle, (1985) tells
us that "literacy makes it possible to preserve information as a
snapshot in time, allows for recording, tracking and remembering
information, and sharing information more easily across distances
among others" (p. 16). In short, literacy led "to the replacement
120  TUTALENI I. ASINO

of myth by history and the replacement of magic by skepticism
and science. Writing allowed bureaucracy, accounting, and legal
systems with universal rules and has replaced face-to-face
governance with depersonalized administration" (Kaestle, 1985, p.
16). This is not to place a value judgement on the characteristics
of literacy but rather to explain some of the many reasons why it
spread.

   There are, however, other reasons for the spread of literacy. In
England, throughout the middle ages literacy grew in part, because
people who acquired literacy skills were able to parlay those skills
into work with more pay and social advantages (Clanchy, 1983).
The great revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries also relied
on leaders who could write and compatriots who could read as
a way to spread new ideas beyond the street corners and public
gatherings of Paris, Berlin, and Vienna. Literacy was perceived as
necessary for spreading information to large numbers of people.
In the 1970's Paulo Freire insisted that literacy was vital for people
to participate in their own governance and civic life (Tyner, 1998).
His classic "Pedagogy of the Oppressed" begins from the premise
that bringing the traditional illiterate and uneducated into learning
situations as partners with their teachers awakens the critical
conscience necessary as a foundation for action to foment change
(Freire, 1973). UNESCO (2004) also acknowledges the role that
literacy plays in enabling populations to effect change and achieve
social justice aims. They speak even more broadly, moving beyond
the conditions necessary for revolution, contending that literacy is
a fundamental right of every human being, providing employment
opportunities, and the fundamental skills necessary to accrue
greater wealth and improve one's quality of life.

   Although the benefits of literacy were a driving force in its spread,
technological advances also enabled the spread of literacy to
greater and greater numbers of people. From stamped tokens,
tally sticks and clay tablets, to ancient scrolls, handwritten volumes,
the printing press, typewriters, and finally computers, technology
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  121

is largely responsible for driving the evolution of literacy into the
particular forms of encoding and decoding information associated
with the digital age. Technology has made it possible for literacy to
move from the hands of the few to the hands of the masses and to
morph into a digital environment with characteristics extending far
beyond anything that has been seen before.

   Not only did computers and electronic technology deliver literacy
into the hands of many but also created an environment that made
it possible to store vast amounts of information. Books and
libraries led the way to making information easily available to the
public, but within the age of computers and the internet the volume
of accessible information is larger than ever, more readily available
than ever, and changing more quickly than ever before. In the early
21st century, technology continues to develop more quickly than
at any time in the past creating an environment that is constantly
changing. These changes contribute to the need for different skills
beyond traditional literacy skills also called new media literacy
(Jenkins, 2018). For a short video on the reasons why digital literacy
is important visit "The New Media Literacies" located on
YouTube.com and created by the research team at Project New
Media Literacies.

LITERACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE

If literacy involves the skills of reading and writing, digital literacy
requires the ability to extend those skills in order to effectively take
advantage of the digital world (ALA, 2013). More general definitions
express digital literacy as the ability to read and understand
information from digital sources as well as to create information in
various digital formats (Bawden, 2008; Gilster, 1997; Tyner, 1998;
UNESCO, 2004). Developing digital skills allows digital learners to
manage a vast array of rapidly changing information and is key to
both learning and working in an evolving digital landscape (Dede,
122                   TUTALENI I. ASINO

2010; Koltay, 2011; Mohammadyari & Singh, 2015). As such, it is
important for people to develop certain competencies specifically
for handling digital content.

   People who adapt well to the digital world exhibit characteristics
enabling them to develop and maintain digital literacy skills.
Lifelong learning is a key characteristic necessary for handling rapid
changes in technology and information and thus, critical to digital
literacy. Successful digital learners have a high level of self-
motivation, a desire for active modes of learning and they exercise
the ability to learn how to learn. Maintaining and learning new
technical skills also benefits learners in the digital age and an
attitude of exploration and play will help learners stay engaged
and energized in a world where speed of change and volume of
information could otherwise become overwhelming (Dede, 2010;
Jenkins, 2018; Visser, 2012). A final characteristic of a digital learner
includes the ability to engage in a global network with a greater
awareness of one's place and audience in that network. Together,
these characteristics of the digital age guide us in understanding
what traits a learner will require to be successful in the digital
environment. The following section will help understand what lies
at the intersection of digital skills and traits of successful digital
learners by reviewing existing digital literacy frameworks.

REVIEWING EXISTING    FRAMEWORKS  FOR
DIGITAL LITERACY/IES

Digital literacy is alternately described as complicated, confusing,
too broad to be meaningful and always changing (Heitin, 2016;
Pangrazio, 2014; Tyner, 1998; Williams, 2006). Due to this
confusion, some feel it best to completely avoid the term digital
literacy altogether and instead opt for the terms such as digital
competencies (Buckingham, 2006), 21st century skills (Williamson,
2011) or digital skills (Heitin, 2016). Another way to sort out the
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  123

confusion is to look at digital literacy as multiple literacies
(Buckingham, 2006; Lankshear & Knobel, 2008; UNESCO, 2004)

   Here, I take the latter approach and look at digital literacy as
a collection of literacies each of which play a significant role in
learning in a digital world. Ng (2012), operationalizes digital literacy
as a framework of multiple, specific competencies which, when
combined, form a cohesive collection of skills. By taking this
approach, we link the characteristics of the digital environment
as well as those of the digital learner not to a single digital skill
but rather a set of digital literacy practices. In this way, we can
consider the various skills needed to navigate the digital world in
an organized and consistent manner.

   Ng (2012) proposes a three-part schema for discussing the
overlapping functional characteristics of a digitally competent
person: technical, cognitive, and social (see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Underlying foundation of digital literacy includes technical,
                    cognitive and social skills (Ng, 2012).
124  TUTALENI I. ASINO

   Technical literacy, also referred to as operational literacy, refers
to the mastery of technical skills and tasks required to access and
work with digital technology such as how to operate a computer;
use a mouse and keyboard; open software; cut, copy and paste
data and files, acquire an internet connection and so on (Lankshear
& Knobel, 2008). The cognitive area of digital literacy focuses on
activities such as critical thinking, problem solving and decision
making (Williamson, 2011) and includes the ability to "evaluate and
apply new knowledge gained from digital environments"(Jones-
Kavalier & Flannigan, 2006, p. 5). The third of Ng's three categories
- social literacies - covers a wide range of activities which together
constitute the ability to communicate in a digital environment both
socially and professionally, understand cyber security, follow
"netiquette" protocols, and navigate discussions with care so as
not to misrepresent or create misunderstandings (Ng, 2012). Of
particular note, Ng captures the essence of digital literacy by
showing how digital literacy exists at the intersection of the
technical, cognitive and social aspects of literacy which are referred
to as dimensions. Ng's framework is not, however, a digital literacy
framework itself. Instead it provides a vehicle for exploring the
various components of digital literacy at a conceptual level while
remaining clear that the individual skills are at all times connected
to and dependent upon each other.

   There are a number of organizations that publish their own
framework for digital literacies including the International Society
for Technology in Education ICT Skills (ISTE), the American
Association of College and Universities (AACU), the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the American
Library Association (ALA), and the Partnership for 21st Century
Skills among others (Dede, 2010). The digital frameworks exhibit
many similarities, and a few differences. There are some
differences in the terminology and organization of these
frameworks, but they all include similar skills. What follows is a
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  125

brief overview of the different digital frameworks. See Figure 2 for
a composite of these frameworks.

       Figure 2. Major Frameworks for 21st Century Skills (American
Library Association, 2013; Dede, 2010; SCONUL, 2016; Vockley & Lang,

                                          2008)
126  TUTALENI I. ASINO

   Each of the frameworks come from a slightly different angle
and will at times reflect the background from which they come.
The American Library Association (ALA) framework evolved out of
the information literacy tradition of libraries, while the American
Association of College and Universities (AACU) and the Society of
College and University Libraries (SOCNUL) evolved from higher
education perspective, the Partnership for 21st century learning
addresses K-12 education, and the ISTE is steeped in a more
technical tradition. Even with these different areas of focus the
components of each framework are strikingly similar although
some in more detail than others. Three of the six specifically
address the skills necessary for accessing, searching and finding
information in a digital environment while the other three have
broader categories in which one might expect to find these skills
including, research and information fluency, intellectual skills, and
ICT literacy. Cognitive skills required for digital literacy are also
covered by all of the frameworks in varying degrees of specificity.
Among them one will find references to evaluating, understanding,
creating, integrating, synthesizing, creativity and innovation. Finally,
four of the six digital frameworks pay homage to the necessity of
solid communication skills. They are in turn, referred to as life skills,
personal and social responsibility, communication, collaboration,
digital citizenship and collective intelligence.

   What seems oddly missing from this list of skills is the technical
component which only appears explicitly in the ISTE list of skills.
The partnership for 21st century learning uses ICT literacy as a
designation for the ability to use technology and the ALA, in
discussing its framework, makes it clear that technical proficiency
is a foundational requirement for digital literacy skills. Even with
these references to technical skills the digital literacy frameworks
are overwhelmingly partial to the cognitive and social focus of
digital skills and technical proficiency tends to be glossed over
compared to the other dimensions. Even though technical skills
receive relatively little attention by comparison we will assume for
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  127

this discussion, technical skills are a prerequisite to the other digital
skills, and we will look more carefully at each of them in the next
section.

   To fully understand the many digital literacies, we will use the
ALA framework as a point of reference for further discussion using
the other frameworks and other materials to further elucidate each
skill area. The ALA framework is laid out in terms of basic functions
with enough specificity to make it easy to understand and
remember but broad enough to cover a wide range of skills. The
ALA framework includes the following areas:

        · Finding,

        · Understanding,

        · Evaluating,

        · Creating, and

        · Communicating
            (American Library Association, 2013).

FINDING

Finding information in a digital environment represents a
significant departure from the way human beings have searched
for information for centuries. The learner must abandon older
linear or sequential approaches to finding information such as
reading a book, using a card catalog, index or table of contents
and instead use lateral approaches like natural language searches,
hypermedia text, keywords, search engines, online databases and
so on (Dede, 2010; Eshet, 2002). The shift from sequential to lateral
involves developing the ability to construct meaningful search
parameters (SCONUL, 2016) whereas before, finding the
information would have meant simply looking up page numbers
based on an index or sorting through a card catalog. Although
finding information may depend to some degree on the search
128  TUTALENI I. ASINO

tool being used (library, internet search engine, online database,
etc.) the search results also depend on how well a person is able
to generate appropriate keywords and construct useful Boolean
searches. Failure in these two areas could easily return too many
results to be helpful, vague or generic results, or potentially no
useful results at all (Hangen, 2015).

   Not immediately obvious, but part of the challenge of finding
information is the ability to manage the results. Because there is so
much data, changing so quickly, in so many different formats it can
be challenging to organize and store it in such a way as to be useful.
SCONUL (2016) talks about this as the ability to organize, store,
manage and cite digital resources while the Educational Testing
Service also specifically mentions the skills to access and manage
information. Some ways to accomplish these tasks is through the
use of social bookmarking tools such as Diigo, clipping and
organizing software such as Evernote and OneNote, and
bibliographic software. Many sites, such as YouTube allow
individuals with an account to bookmark videos as well as create
channels or collections of videos for specific topics or uses. Other
websites have similar features.

UNDERSTANDING

Understanding in the context of digital literacy perhaps most
closely resembles traditional literacy in so much as it too, is the
ability to read and interpret text (Jones-Kavalier & Flannigan, 2006).
In the digital age, however, the ability to read and understand
extends much further than text alone. For example, searches may
return results with any combination of text, video, sound, and
audio as well as still and moving pictures. As the internet has
evolved, there have evolved a whole host of visual languages such
as moving images, emoticons, icons, data visualizations, videos and
combinations of all of the above. Lankshear & Knoble, (2008) refer
to these modes of communication as "post typographic textual
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  129

practice". Understanding the variety of modes of digital material
may also be referred to as multimedia literacy (Jones-Kavalier &
Flannigan, 2006), visual literacy (Tyner, 1998), and digital literacy
(Buckingham, 2006).

EVALUATING

Evaluating digital media requires competencies ranging from
evaluating the importance of a piece of information to determine
its accuracy and its source. Evaluating information is not new to
the digital age, but the nature of digital information can make it
more difficult to understand who the source of information is and
whether it can be trusted (Jenkins, 2018). When there is abundant
and rapidly changing data across heavily populated networks,
anyone with access can generate information online, making
decisions about its authenticity, trustworthiness, relevance, and
significance daunting. Learning evaluative digital skills means
learning to ask questions about who is writing the information, why
they are writing it, and who the intended audience is (Buckingham,
2006). Developing critical thinking skills is part of the literacy of
evaluating and assessing the suitability for the use of a specific
piece of information (SCONUL, 2016).

   Looking for secondary sources of information can help confirm
the authenticity and accuracy of online data and researching the
credentials and affiliations of the author is another way to find
out more about whether an article is trustworthy or valid. One
may find other places the author has been published and verify
they are legitimate. Sometimes one may be able to review affiliated
organizations to attest to the expertise of the author such finding
out where an employee works if they are a member of a
professional organization or a leading researcher in a given field.
All of these provide essential clues for use in evaluating information
online.
130  TUTALENI I. ASINO

CREATING

Creating in the digital world makes explicit the production of
knowledge and ideas in digital formats. While writing is a critical
component of traditional literacy, it is not the only creative tool in
the digital toolbox. Other tools are available and include creative
activities such as podcasting, making audio-visual presentations,
building data visualizations, 3D printing, writing blogs and new
tools that haven't even been thought of yet. In short, all formats
in which digital information may be consumed, a digitally literate
individual will also want to be able to use in the creation of a
product. A key component of creating with digital tools is
understanding what constitutes fair use and what is considered
plagiarism. While this is not new to the digital age, it may be more
challenging to find the line between copying and extending
someone else's work.

   In part, the reason for the increased difficulty of finding the line
between plagiarism and new work is the "cut and paste culture" of
the internet referred to as "reproduction literacy" (Eshet 2002, p.4)
also referred to as appropriation in Jenkins' New Media Literacies
(Jenkins, 2018). The question is, what can one change and how
much can one change work without being considered copying? This
skill requires the ability to think critically, evaluate a work and make
appropriate decisions. There are tools and information to help
understand and find those answers such as the creative commons.
Learning about these resources and learning how to use them is
part of this digital literacy.

COMMUNICATING

Communicating is the final category of digital skills in the ALA digital
framework. The capacity to connect with individuals all over the
world creates unique opportunities for learning and sharing
information for which developing digital communication skills is
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  131

vital. Some of the skills required for communicating in a digital
environment include digital citizenship, collaboration, and cultural
awareness. This is not to say that one does not need to develop
communication skills outside of the digital environment but that
the skills required for digital communication go beyond what is
required in a non-digital environment. Most of us are adept at
personal, face to face communication but digital communication
needs the ability to engage in asynchronous environments such as
email, online forums, blogs and social media platforms where what
we say can't always be deleted but can be easily misinterpreted.
Add that to an environment where people number in the millions
and the opportunities for misunderstandings and cultural miscues
are much more likely.

   The communication category of digital literacies covers an
extensive array of skills above and beyond what one might need for
face to face interactions. It includes competencies around ethical
and moral behavior, responsible communication for engagement
in social and civic activities (Adam Becker et al., 2017), an awareness
of audience and an ability to evaluate the potential impact of one's
actions online. It also includes skills for handling privacy and
security in online environments. These activities fall into two main
categories of activity including digital citizenship and collaboration.

   Digital citizenship refers to one's ability to interact effectively in
the digital world. Part of this skill is good manners, often referred
to as "netiquette. There is a level of context which is often missing
in digital communication due to physical distance, lack of personal
familiarity with people online and the sheer volume of people who
may come in contact with our words. People who know us well
may understand exactly what we mean when we say something
sarcastic or ironic, but those and other vocal and facial cues are
missing in most digital communication making it more likely we will
be misunderstood. Also, we are also more likely to misunderstand
or be misunderstood if we remain unaware of cultural differences
amongst people online. So, digital citizenship includes an
132  TUTALENI I. ASINO

awareness of who we are, what we intend to say and how it might
be perceived by other people we do not know (Buckingham, 2006).
It is also a process of learning to communicate clearly and in ways
that help others understand what we mean.

   Another key digital skill is collaboration, and it is essential for
effective participation in digital projects via the internet. The
internet allows people to engage with others we may never see
in person and work towards common goals be they social, civic
or business oriented. Creating a community and working together
requires a degree of trust and familiarity that can be difficult to
build given the physical distance between participants. Greater
awareness must be paid to inclusive behavior, and more explicit
efforts need to be made to make up for perceived or actual
distance and disconnectedness. So, while the promise of digital
technology to connect people is impressive it is not necessarily an
automatic transition, and it requires new skills.

PARTING THOUGHTS.

It is clear from our previous discussion of digital literacy that
technology and technical skills underpin every other digital skill.
A failure to understand hardware, software, the nature of the
internet, cloud-based technologies and an inability to learn new
concepts and tools going forward handicaps one's ability to engage
with the cognitive and social literacies. While there are sometimes
tacit references to technical skills and ability, extant digital literacy
frameworks tend to focus more on the cognitive and social aspects
of digital environments. There is an implied sense that once
technical skills are learned, we the digitally literate person can
forget about them and move on to the other skills. Given the rapid
pace of technological change in the last 40 years, however, anyone
working in a digital environment would be well advised to keep
in mind that technical concepts and tools continue to develop. It
DIGITAL LITERACIES AND THE SKILLS OF THE DIGITAL AGE  133

does not seem likely that we will ever reach a point where people
can simply take technological skills for granted and to do so would
undermine our ability to address the other digital skills.

   Another way to think of this is to recognize that no matter what
the skill, none of them operate independently of one another.
Whether searching, creating, evaluating, understanding or
communicating, it is a combination of skills (or literacies) that allow
us to accomplish our goals. Thinking critically, and evaluating
information and sources leads to sound decision-making.
Understanding and synthesizing information is necessary for
creating and again the technical tools are necessary for completing
the product. Finding information is of little use if one is unable to
analyze its usefulness and creating a great video or podcast will
not mean much if one is unable to navigate social and professional
networks to communicate those works to others. If only
understood in isolation, digital literacies have little meaning and
can be of little use in approaching digital environments.

   Ng's (2012) conceptual framework reminds us that digital literacy
is that space where technical, cognitive and social literacies overlap.
A digital skill is not the same thing as digital literacy but the two are
fully intwined. Acquiring digital skills is only the beginning of a study
of digital literacies, however, and it would be a mistake to stop here.
Furthermore, digital literacies span multiple areas including both
the cognitive and the social. The real value of digital literacy lies
in understanding the synergistic effect of individual digital literacy
skills integrated with sets of competencies that enable one to work
effectively in the digital world.

LEARNING ACTIVITIES.

Literacy Narratives are stories about reading and composing in
any form or context. They often include poignant memories that
involve a personal experience with literacy. Digital literacy
134  TUTALENI I. ASINO

narratives can sometimes be categorized as narratives that focus
on how the writer came to understand the importance of
technology in his/her life or teaching pedagogy. More often, they
are simply narratives that use a medium beyond the print-based
essay to tell the story.

et-al

       1. Combining both aspects of the genre, write a piece based
            on your technological literacy, choosing a medium you feel
            best conveys the message you want to share with your
            audience.

       2. Find and read 2-4 literacy narratives online that emphasize
            the use of technology and write a short reflection that
            discusses the main digital literacies used, summarizes the
            main points made and describes the elements you felt
            were most important. Also, describe any digital literacy
            skills you utilized to complete the assignment.

       3. Create your literacy narrative that tells the story of a
            significant experience of your own with digital literacy. Use
            a multi-modal tool that includes audio and images or
            video. Share with your classmates and discuss the most
            important ideas you noticed in others' narratives.

       4. Compare two of the literacy frameworks in Figure 2. How
            are they alike? How are they different? Do you like one
            better than the other? Why or Why not?

KATHY ESSMILLER

Oklahoma State University
   Learning objectives
   Upon reading this chapter, students should be able to do the

following:
        · Provide a scholarly definition of play.
        · Distinguish between key elements of play and work.
        · Discuss how playful approaches might impact creativity.
        · Articulate challenges inherent in playful activities as
            incorporated into educational spaces.
        · Relate intentional play to personal learning experiences.
        · Explicate (develop) a playful process for exploration of a
            digital resource, identifying, in particular, the intentional
            incorporation of play cues.

INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS PLAY? AND WHY DO
WE CARE?

The difference between play and work has been defined, quite
simply, as intent (Harrison & West, 2014; Lotts, 2016; Schultz,
Geithner, Woelfel, & Kryzwinkski, 2015). Participation in work is
directed by external influences guiding the actor toward specific
objectives; work has a clearly defined goal with a measurable
outcome (Harrison & West, 2014; Lotts, 2016; Schultz, Geithner,
Woelfel, & Kryzwinkski, 2015). Play, in contrast, is identified as an
intrinsically motivated, "apparently purposeless" (Harrison & West,
2014, p. 72) practice through which humans "learn how to cope
with a complex environment" (Harrison & West, 2014; Lotts, 2016;
Schultz, Geithner, Woelfel, & Kryzwinkski, 2015, p. 236). An
approach to the construction of learning spaces guided by play
theory may improve creativity, innovation, and strategic thinking
(Harrison & West, 2014; Lotts, 2016; Schultz, Geithner, Woelfel, &
Kryzwinkski, 2015). Effective educators can leverage the strengths
of the digital age classroom to facilitate attitudes of play.

   Play with some of the digital resources found on this page. Create
a post, image, or story describing an activity from both a work and
play perspective. Stretch Activity: How did having a suggested end
goal impact your playful approach to the resources? Would your
experience have been different had you not been presented with
an end goal?
PLAYFUL APPROACHES TO LEARNING  143

ORGANIZATIONS AND EDUCATIONAL SYSTEMS
EMPLOY PLAY.

Through play, participants may consider and progress toward
objectives considered work related while employing techniques
considered applicable to play (Statler, Heracleous, & Jacobs, 2011).
144  TUTALENI I. ASINO

To ease anxiety possibly associated with the pressure to create
(Lotts, 2016), organizations and educational systems cultivate
attitudes of play by incorporating things and processes generally
found outside the adult workplace (Statler et al., 2011). Physical
space may include Lego bricks, corporate activities might include
physical movement involved in meaning construction (Statler et al.,
2011), and meetings might include snacks and toys (Harrison &
West, 2014). These "play cues" (Harrison & West, 2014, p. 71) may
trigger attitudes in participants empowering them to channel the
recursive, engaged, and fun elements of play (Harrison & West,
2014; Lotts, 2016; Statler et al., 2911). Work related objectives,
those considered serious, are accomplished through the
engagement of techniques more generally associated with play
(Statler et al., 2011).

WHY CULTIVATE AN ATTITUDE OF PLAY?

Play is considered a means through which technology can be
integrated into learning environments, strengthening student
proficiency in the development of media skills considered crucial
"in an age of information and innovation" (Randolph, Kangas,
Ruokamo, & Hyvonen, 2016, p. 418). Engaged through play,
participants may feel permission to "behave in new ways" (Harrison
& West, 2014, p. 75). Students may be more comfortable engaging
in novel behavior and courageous about opening themselves up
to variation (Statler et al., 2011). This combination of recursive
play process and goal-oriented work facilitates results achieved
in a "goal oriented but playful way" (Statler et al., 2011, p. 239).
Incorporation of play taps into intrinsic motivation (Harrison &
West, 2014), broadens opportunity for novel behavior, and releases
new ideas (Schulz et al. 2015).
PLAYFUL APPROACHES TO LEARNING  145

     Playful approaches support
  development of creative skills
  (Davies, Jindal-Snape, Collier,

    Digby, Hay, & Howe, 2013).

PLAY IN THE DIGITAL
AGE CLASSROOM

Christopher Ward (2009) used information and communications
technology (ICT) to incorporate playful approaches into a
secondary level music-making classroom to investigate the impact
of play on creativity. He found that the instant feedback inherent
in the digital resources enhanced students' intrinsic motivation and
allowed students to "capitalize on spontaneous and accidental
action" (Ward, 2009, p. 155). Guided by Miles Davis' admonition "Do
not fear mistakes, there are none" (Ward, 2009, p. 155), students
undertook playful explorations with the attitude that nothing
accomplished their discoveries and work would not be considered
wrong, but might rather be embraced as different. Over the course
of the project, Ward (2009) provided sheets offering guidance, but
noted they were rarely used by the students, as students playfully
preferred to "experiment until something happened that they
146  TUTALENI I. ASINO

liked" (p. 163). As students created pieces departing from
traditional tonality and re-coded traditional symbols for new use it
became apparent that both the playful approach and the use of ICT
served to free students' creativity and empower them as interactive
thinkers (Ward, 2009). Ward explained "The students became self-
motivating, and were captivated by their `play-art'" (2009, p. 154).

WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?

Creative skill development can be enhanced through classroom
incorporation of playful approaches (Davies et al, 2013). Play is
inherent in human nature; educators can incorporate a variety of
pedagogical strategies to capitalize on the strengths of this innate
approach (Broadhead & van der Aalsvoort, 2009), facilitating
playful, active, and participatory experiences and empowering
creative learning processes (Randolph et al, 2016). "In a world of
digital culture and new technology, novel ways of using information
and playful and creative thought have become of paramount
importance" (Randolph et al, 2016, p. 419). Technology and digital
media help establish the 21st century as an "age of wonder" (Tan,
2015, p. 161). Resources available in the digital age classroom
combined with attitudes of play can quicken the minds of students
as they experience their world.

   Identify a digital resource to present for your students' playful
exploration. What cues might you provide to facilitate their playful
approach? Will you suggest an end goal? Why or why not? What
challenges might a playful approach present in a necessarily
structured learning environment? How can those be addressed?

you might incorporate into your classroom.

CHAPTER 9

The Digital Divide

WILMON BROWN, PH.D.

Oklahoma State University

   Abstract: A digital divide is an economic and social inequality
regarding access to, use of, or impact of information and
communication technologies. However, economic or other resource
gaps, differences in cultural tastes and preferences of different social
classes are factors contributing to disparities in internet use. The digital
divide arguably reflects structural factors in advanced societies that
give rise to social inequalities in general. This chapter begins with an
introduction to the history of expanded internet access across the U.S.
and then covers who the digital divide consequentially affected by the
expended access. Finally, organizations and resources designed to aid
in the closing of the digital divide are presented.

INTRODUCTION

A digital divide is an economic and social inequality regarding
access to, use of, or impact of information and communication
technologies (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1995). Existing

                                                              149
150  TUTALENI I. ASINO

literature indicates that the digital divide at the individual level
springs from many different sources. Comparisons between
educational and occupational groups, income brackets, age groups,
and genders have revealed systematic variation in both internet
access and the frequency of its use (Hampton, 2010; Lehdonvirta
and Räsänen, 2011; Rice and Katz, 2003; van Deursen and van
Dijk, 2014). Economic or other resource gaps, differences in cultural
tastes and preferences of different social classes are factors
contributing to disparities in internet use (Emmison & Frow, 1998;
Hargittai & Hsieh, 2010).

   The digital divide encompasses differences in both access (first-
level digital divide) and usage (second-level digital divide) of
computers and the Internet between (1) industrialized and
developing countries (global divide), (2) various socioeconomic
groups within single nation-states (social divide), and (3) different
kinds of users with regard to their political engagement on the
Internet (democratic divide) (Schweitzer, 2015).

   The digital divide is characterized by two crucial problems:

       1. limited and costly infrastructure to support internet access

       2. limited digital literacy in low/middle-income communities
            to use resources

Low/middle-income communities have limited access to digital
technologies due to high costs and a general lack of infrastructure,
ranging from intermittent supply of electricity to limited availability
of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) facilities
(Chipeva et. al, 2018; Ziemba & Becker, 2019).

   The digital divide arguably reflects structural factors in advanced
societies that give rise to social inequalities in general.

HOW DID THE DIGITAL DIVIDE BEGIN?

   McNally, C. (2019). How Does Fiber-Optic Internet Work? - A
Simple Explanation. Retrieved from https://www.reviews.org/
internet-service/how-does-fiber-optic-internet-work/.

   The first great step in moving the United States to the digital age
was the passing of the High-Performance Computing Act of 1991
(Lindberg & Humphreys, 1995). The High-Performance Computing
Act (HPCA) has also been called the Gore Bill. This bill, created and
introduced by then-Senator Al Gore, led to the development of the
National Information Infrastructure and the funding of the National
Research and Education Network (NREN). The purpose of NREN
was to provide internet access to all K-12 students. Al Gore was
passionate about providing the same research and information
tools to students that were used by businesses and the
government. Teachers could use this access to share concepts,
ideas, and methodologies with other teachers. Students could use
it to communicate with other students and experts in various fields.

   The High-Performance Computing Act funded a high-speed fiber-
optic network that would eventually become the Internet (Cline &
Haynes, 2001). Fiber-optic cables work by light bouncing repeatedly
off the walls while traveling down the cables. Fiber-optic cables
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE  153

are now the primary method of transmitting information over long
distances because of three main advantages over old-style copper
cables (Ko & Qi, 2014):

        · Less attenuation: (signal loss) Information travels roughly
            10 times further before it needs amplifying--which makes
            fiber networks simpler and cheaper to operate and
            maintain.

        · No interference: Unlike with copper cables, there's no
            crosstalk (electromagnetic interference) between optical
            fibers, so they transmit information more reliably with
            better signal quality

        · Higher bandwidth: Fiber-optic cables can carry far more
            data than copper cables of the same diameter.

The Gore Bill led to the funding of the Mosaic browser, to which
many scholars attribute the beginning of the internet boom of the
'90s (Wiggins, 2010). The HPCA helped fund the National Center
for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois, where
the Mosaic browser was developed, as well as many other
technological initiatives that laid the foundation of today's modern
computer networks and the internet.

   Between 1991 and 1996, the number of personal computers in
the United States jumped from 300,000 to over ten million (Weiss,
2007). By the mid-1990s the development of internet browsers
like Mosaic and Netscape were leading more adventurous users
out into a new realm called cyberspace (Weiss, 2007). Email was
becoming an increasingly useful application, and officials in the
Clinton Administration were beginning to wonder if access to
information technology was being fairly distributed. In summer
1995, the new National Telecommunications & Information
Administration prepared a report called Falling Through the Net: A
Survey of the `Have Nots' in Rural and Urban America (Rapaport,
2009).
154  TUTALENI I. ASINO

   In January 1996, the New York Times took up the call, running
an article proclaiming, "A New Gulf in American Education, the
Digital Divide." The story compared the availability of computers
and internet access at two nearby California Schools. (Students at
the less affluent school had to make do with a six-year-old IBM
PC, while students at the other, more affluent school were able to
go home and work on their own Apple Macintosh computers.) In
October 1996, the New York Times reported a story from Georgia
titled, "A Nation Ponders Its Growing Digital Divide." This piece
reported that "only 9 percent of American classrooms have access
to the internet." Soon after, the Reverend Jesse Jackson referred to
the Digital Divide as "classic apartheid," while the NAACP's Kweisi
Mfume called it "technological segregation." Al Hammond and
others at the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration took the "Digital Divide" one step further, using the
term "electronic redlining" (Rapaport, 2009).

WHO DOES THE DIGITAL DIVIDE EFFECT?

The effect of the digital divide is a myth for many people. For
those lucky enough to be on the right side of the divide, this issue
may be novel. There has been a multitude of studies aimed at
understanding not only what the digital divide is, but whom it
affects. Many researchers have defined the evolving digital divide
in terms of levels (Dolan, 2016). They describe it as a continuum
influenced by overlapping factors, such as digital inequity (Dolan,
2016), as "a New Digital Divide" driven by the intersection of race
and gender (Jackson et al., 2008), and even as "Digital Divide 2.0"
(Vie, 2008).

   Researchers found that quantifying the digital divide was a more
difficult task because there are various contributors to the divide.
In its early stages, the negative effect of the digital divide had
disproportionately excluded men. With men being most of the
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE  155

online U.S. population, gender was a notable predictor of internet
access. In 2017, The International Telecommunications Union
reported that the proportion of women using the internet was 12%
lower than the proportion of men; this gender gap widens to 32.9%
in the least developed countries (Singh, 2017). And even when a
woman gets on a phone or is online, she might face additional
hostility. A Web Foundation report states that "women around the
world report being bombarded by a culture of misogyny online,
including aggressive, often sexualized hate speech, direct threats of
violence and harassment involving use of private information for
defamation (Web Foundation, 2015)."

   By 2001, women had surpassed men as most of the online U.S.
population. 2009 Census data suggests that potential disparities
in gendered connectivity have become nearly nonexistent; 73% of
female citizens three years and older compared to 74% of males
could access the internet from their home (Gorski, 2001). This was
a very encouraging discovery, as one factor that predicted a lack of
internet access has seemingly been resolved. While there is more
work to be done, the digital divide is beginning to close.

ECONOMIC DISPARITY.

The Pew Internet and American Life Project was a project that
started in 2000 and continues. It is a project that has spanned
more than a decade to understand the role of the internet in the
American lifestyle. The Pew Internet and American Life Project
produces reports exploring the impact of the internet on families,
communities, work, and home, daily life, education, health care,
and civic and political life (Pew, 2018). The project's reports are
based on nationwide random phone surveys, online surveys, and
qualitative research. This data collection is supplemented with
research from government agencies, technology firms, academia,
and other expert venues. The Project releases the data from 15-20
research projects each year, varying in size, scope, and objective.
156  TUTALENI I. ASINO

According to the Pew Report, "Digital Differences," only 62% of
people in households making less than $30,000 a year used the
internet, while in those making $50,000-74,999 that percentage
jumped to 90. Smartphones have helped bridge the divide, as they
provide internet access to populations previously at a digital
disadvantage. Pew reports that, among smartphone owners,
"young adults, minorities, those with no college experience, and
those with lower household income levels" are more likely to access
the internet primarily through their phones. There are still gaps
in high-speed internet access. Only 49% of African Americans and
51% of Hispanics have high-speed internet at home, as compared
with 66% of Caucasians. Internet speed has important effects on
media access, especially when it comes to streaming video, so this
gap is significant.

   In a Pew survey of teachers, teachers of low-income students
tended to report more obstacles to using educational technology
effectively than their peers in more affluent schools. Among
teachers in the highest income areas, 70% said their school gave
them good support for incorporating technology into their
teaching. Among teachers in the lowest income areas, that
numbers were just 50%. 56% percent of teachers in low-income
schools say that their students' inadequate access to technology
is a "major challenge" for using technology as a teaching aid. 54%
of all teachers said their students had adequate internet access at
school, but only 18% said their students had adequate access at
home. Interestingly, urban teachers are more likely to say students
have poor access to the internet at school, while rural teachers
are more likely to report that students have poor access at home
(Zickuhr, 2012).

ACCESS TO RESOURCES.

92% of individuals aged 12-17 years go online daily, while 97% of
them play computer, web, portal, or console games and 75% of
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE  157

them own a smartphone (Lenhart, 2015). However, not all students
have an equal opportunity to access and use computers at home
and in schools (Dolan, 2016). Historically, this access disparity has
been called the "digital divide," a definition that focuses on the
"haves" and "have-nots" regarding physical access to a computer
(Dolan, 2016).

   Roughly three-in-ten adults with household incomes below
$30,000 a year (29%) don't own a smartphone. More than four-
in-ten don't have home broadband services (44%) or a traditional
computer (46%). And many lower-income Americans are not tablet
owners. By comparison, each of these technologies is nearly
ubiquitous among adults in households earning $100,000 or more
a year.

   The disparity in online access is also apparent in what has been
called the "homework gap" - the gap between school-age children
who have access to high-speed internet at home and those who
don't. In 2015, 35% of lower-income households with school-age
children did not have a broadband internet connection at home,
according to a Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. Census Bureau
data.

   In 2017, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Ajit Pai
reiterated his commitment to bringing high-speed internet services
to lower-income communities (Pai, 2017). To review the Federal
Communications Commission's progress toward closing the digital
divide, please access the embedded map below.

BRIDGING THE DIVIDE.

Surveys indicate that in the United States, more than 80% of all
teachers believe that online learning improves education. While
many consider access to technology at home to be critically
important to the quality of a student's education, it is alarming
that one-third of all students in America, mostly from low-income
households, lack that access in their home settings. Having a
computer and internet service at home is no longer a luxury - it is a
necessity (Leander, Scharber & Lewis, 2017; Grigoryeva, Abukenova
& Gill, 2018). There are numerous initiatives that are designed to
address the digital divide, below are two examples.

Cox Communications.

Internet providers are working to provide affordable Internet and
devices to low-income students and their families through
programs such as the Connect2Compete program by Cox
Communications. Cox's program is open to families with K-12
children who qualify for free or reduced school lunches through
the National School Lunch Program (NSLP), Temporary Assistance
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE  159

for Needy Families (TANF) or the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance
Program (SNAP). Also, Cox has partnered with the U.S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to support its
ConnectHome initiative. Families with K-12 children who live in
Public Housing, as well as K-12 families who receive Tenant-Based
Vouchers, Project-Based Vouchers or Section 8 Project-Based
Rental Assistance (PBRA), are eligible for Cox's Connect2Compete
discounted internet service offer. Since 2012, nearly 200,000
people have been connected to the internet through Cox's
Connect2Compete program - most of them for the very first time.
This is one of the many programs that has been used to bridge the
digital divide. In a 2015 survey of parents enrolled in the program,
the grades of more than 50% of the students have improved and
nearly 50% say their children are more interested in school.

Close the Gap.

Access to information and communication technology (ICT) is
essential in the developing world because it is key to improving a
country's educational and economic prospects. However, the cost
of new equipment, limited infrastructure and the lack of
information technology (IT) knowledge and proficiency mean that
many people still have no access to IT. Today, information is seen
as one of the major drivers of economic and social development
and ICT makes access to information available on an
unprecedented scale. The digital divide is not only a divide between
people who have access to ICT and people who don't. It's also a
divide between people who know about ICT and those who don't,
between people who realize the opportunities presented by ICT
and those who don't. It consists of an infrastructure gap, a
knowledge gap, and a psychological gap.

   Close the Gap (http://close-the-gap.org/) is an international non-
profit organization that aims to bridge the digital divide by offering
high-quality, pre-owned computers donated by European
160  TUTALENI I. ASINO

companies to educational, medical and social projects in
developing and emerging countries. Close the Gap collects
decommissioned computers from companies and arranges for
other organizations to clean the hard disks and then check and
configure the hardware according to the requirements of its end-
users. The computers are then shipped to the destination country
by sea or air transport. Since 2003, Close the Gap has already
received more than 250,000 computers from companies all over
Europe.

   Close the Gap not only provides computers to developing
countries, but it also builds partnerships with organizations
worldwide to deliver comprehensive software and hardware
solutions to its recipients. Today, Close the Gap has supported
more than 2,500 projects all over the world. However diverse the
projects, they all have one common denominator: a focus on
advancing both the individual and the community within a spirit of
socio-economical education. By following this principle, Close the
Gap is participating in the United Nations Millennium Development
Goals.

CONCLUSION.

The digital divide started because of a very progressive effort. The
purpose of the National Research and Education Network was to
provide internet access to all K-12 students. This effort, while well-
founded, generated a divide in access to the internet. This
subsequent divide had many contributing factors, including income
and gender. Since the identification of the digital divide in 1996,
efforts have been made to remedy it. Programs such as Close the
Gap and Connect2Compete have been implemented to bridge the
digital divide. The authors of this chapter believe that knowledge
is power and that as individuals learn more about the prominence
of the digital divide, the call to action will increase. Understanding
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE  161

learning in the digital age means understanding the solutions and
problems that arise as the world becomes more digital. Many
opportunities to aid in bridging the digital divide exist.

CHAPTER 10

Ignored Conversations: Higher
education funding in the digital
age

JOSEPHINE SHIKONGO, OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY

Oklahoma State University

INTRODUCTION

Learning in the digital age is often positioned in a positive light.
After all, it often means having access to varied digital resources
that can be accessed by different computing devices including
mobile phones. Learning in the digital age also mean connecting
people across time and space to form a broader community of
learners. All of these are very positive things that cannot be
trivialized. However, in this sea of positivity, we must also own the
negativity that still remains. Such negative aspects are often related
to matter of access. Meaning that while learning in the digital age
can conjure up positive images of learning, not everyone can access

                                                              164
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS  165

or equally participate in this new real. Often this problem of access
is a result of financial constraints. This chapter addresses the issue
access to learning in the digital age. Specifically, I look at financial
constraints as a barrier to access, by exploring the #FeesMustFall
in southern Africa. The goal of the chapter is to remind that there
are many issues that while seen as tangential can directly influence
one's ability to learning in the digital age.

   On October 12, 2015, at the University of Witwatersrand in
Johannesburg South Africa, what started as a peaceful protest
against government's decision to allow universities to increase fees
for the 2016 academic year, and increase government budged to
higher education institution (Hodes, 2017), quickly turned into
violent riots which spread across the country. The protests quickly
spread beyond the borders to neighbouring Namibia.

   Namibia, which is a former South African colony, gaining its
independence in 1990, has been experiencing economic growth
since then; however, there is still a visible economic divide between
whites and black Namibians. As a result of previous discriminatory
and exclusion systems, many have called for the return of their
ancestral land and remedial policies. Although the government has
been trying to remedy the results of apartheid through policy, they
have only achieved little success due to power imbalances.

   Tuition fees have been at the centre of many debates around
higher education. In Southern Africa, and particularly South Africa
and Namibia where the apartheid history still has visible residue in
the socio-economic status of the citizens, tuition fees remain one
of the aspects continuing to challenge inequality in the countries
(Hopson, 2001; Langa et al., 2017). According to the South Africa
History Online (2016), historically black universities such as the
University of Fort Hare and Tswane University of Technology have
been protesting long before the fees must fall movement erupted,
however, they never received any media attention. The fees must
fall movement gained media momentum because it started at
166  TUTALENI I. ASINO

Witwatersrand, a historically white institution. Another indication of
the inequalities left by apartheid.

   This study will focus on the Fees Must Fall movement that
erupted in South Africa during October 2015 as a central focus
through which the paper will examine the impact of such a
movement on Namibia's higher education. The paper will further
look at what could be the best funding structure for Namibian
higher education institution, considering the history of the country
to guard against movements such as fees must fall in the future.
As small as the country is, and with only three higher education
institutions (Naris & Ukpere, 2010) serving the 2.5 million
population, like the rest of the world, there are still challenges in
higher education.

   The student debt challenge is not unique to Namibia and South
Africa alone. In the United States, this challenge is visible through
what is known as the student debt crisis, which has become such a
topical issue that it has been central to the democratic candidates
for the 2020 Presidential elections, with candidates competing on
who has the better solution in their campaign.

NAMIBIAN HISTORY

According to South African history website, in 1884, Germany
declared Namibia (then, South West Africa) as its colony. The
Germans took occupation of the country from 1888, taking over
Herero lands. The Herero and Nama people revolted in 1904 and
lasted until 1907. Many were killed in this war, which led to the
first genocide of the 20th century, with Germany setting up
concentration camps where medical experimentation and
executions took place. Over 90,000 Hereros and Namas, which is
more than half of their population, was wiped out completely. War
continued until Germany was eventually defeated.

   During the First World War, South Africa took occupation of
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS  167

Namibia from 1915. In 1920, the League of Nations granted South
Africa the mandate to govern Namibia and help it reach its
independence; however, South Africa defied the orders. Since then,
South Africa took occupation of Namibia as its colony until 1990
when Namibia finally gained its independence through a United
Nations resolution. Namibia developed an army which waged war
on South Africa in 1966, a war which lasted some 23 years. Many
Namibians were dying and going into exile to neighbouring
countries, including some leaders such as Andimba Toivo Ya Toivo,
who was imprisoned on Robben Island with Nelson Mandela.
Namibia was under the same apartheid rule as South Africa. When
Namibia gained independence, South Africa was still going through
war, and the apartheid government held back Walvis Bay, the
harbour town to remain a territory of South Africa. Upon being
released from prison and becoming the first President of a free
South Africa, Nelson Mandela returned Walvis Bay to Namibia.
Walvis Bay is home to the harbour and the fishing sector, which is
the third contributing economic sector to the country's GDP.

POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT

At independence, the liberation movement, South West Africa
People Organization (SWAPO) won the majority vote and became
the ruling party. SWAPO originated from OPO (Owamboland
People Organization) which was established in northern Namibia
by the Aawambo people, the majority of the Namibian population
to date. When it gained the country independence, it vowed to
become a national builder which has the interest of the country at
heart. The founding President, Dr Sam Nujoma was quoted saying
"A people united for a common cause will always emerge
victorious" as a binding statement to support the party's "One
Namibia, One Nation" campaign. The drive to keep the country
together and maintain peace, stability and prosperity has been one
of the country's highest-ranking advantages on multiple indices.
168  TUTALENI I. ASINO

   Although the constitution only allows five-year presidential terms
renewable once, the first President served three terms of 15 years
as the country was seen as vulnerable, fresh out war and was not
ready for a change of leadership. Thirty years later, Namibia has
had multiple peaceful elections, with three Presidents, all belonging
to SWAPO. Small opposition parties have been having trouble
gaining support as most people are still voting on emotions of
war and trusting their liberator SWAPO. In 2019, however, the
incumbent President lost 30% of his support from the previous
election, gaining only 56% of the votes from 87% in 2015. Most
of these votes were lost to an internal SWAPO candidate who ran
as an independent and promised people a new wave of economic
freedom. Thirty years after the war, the number of young people
has grown, including those who have never experienced war, and
only need the "prosperity" that SWAPO has been promising. The
independent candidate gained traction with the youth, especially
on issues such as inflated land prices, corruption, high education
costs and overall poverty that prevails within the country. As a
result, the President has started listening to the people.

ECONOMIC STATUS

Namibia's population at independence was 1.4 million, which grew
to 2.4 million as of 2018 (World Bank). The country covers an area
of approximately 312,000 square miles, making it the second least
densely populated country in the world after Mongolia (World
Atlas). The country's Gross Domestic Products (GDP) grew from
$2.79 in 1990 to $14.52 in 2018. With a GDP per capita of $5,931,
Namibia is ranked by the World Bank as an upper-middle-income
country and ranks much higher than many African countries. The
main contributors to the GDP are minerals, fishing, tourism and
agriculture (Humavindu and Stage, 2013). The country, however,
faces high unequal distribution of income and has one of the
highest Gini-coefficient in the world at 59.1%, second only to South
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS  169

Africa (World Bank) which is unsurprising considering their shared
brutal history. About 70% of Namibians depend on subsistence
farming for daily livelihood and survival. Although the country has a
vast land, most of it is arid, hence 70% of its imports, especially food
still comes from South Africa. As a result, and to ensure a smooth
exchange of trade between the two countries the Namibian
currency (the Namibian Dollar) is directly pegged to the South
African Rand and the Rand is a legal tender in Namibia. The
country's human development index is ranked at 130/189 countries
by the UNDP report.

   Although education has often enjoyed the largest share of the
country's annual budget, competing priorities of development have
been taking part of the pie, and allocation has reduced slightly with
3% in 2019, with higher education receiving only N$3.1 billion (PWC
Budget Report, 2019). The reduction places pressure on institutions
of higher education in allocating the resources effectively to ensure
effective execution of the education mandate placed on
institutions. Although the government has done a considerable
good job in reducing poverty from 22.6% in 2009 to 14.6% in 2018
(Du Plessis & Keyter, 2019), there are still significant economic
challenges facing the country. The country has been experiencing
low economic growth for four years since 2016, leading to high
unemployment which reached 33.4% in 2018 (Cirrus Capital).
Graduates from higher education institutions are struggling to find
jobs in a depressed economy; parents are struggling to pay fees as
some are laid off, and others cannot find employment. The value of
higher education is not far from being questioned.

NAMIBIA HIGHER EDUCATION

Before the establishment of the Academy for Tertiary Education
in 1980, higher education was a privilege enjoyed by the few who
could afford to study in South Africa, mainly white Namibians
170  TUTALENI I. ASINO

(Hangula et al., 2017). Black Namibians were historically subjected
to Bantu Education Act of 1953, a curriculum designed by the
apartheid government which was meant to keep black Namibians
and South Africans as subhuman and only gain lower-paying jobs
(Hopson, 2001).

   After independence, two public institutions of higher education
were established, the University of Namibia (UNAM) and the
Polytechnic of Namibia, now known as the Namibian University of
Science and Technology (NUST) to ensure social equity and access.
UNAM was established in 1992 while NUST was established two
years later in 1994, both by Acts of Parliament, 18 and 38
respectively (Nust Home). In 2018, UNAM had a total enrollment
of 28,217 students (UNAM Statistics Office, 2018) while NUST had
11,235 (Annual Report, 2018). UNAM is a larger institution
compared to NUST, which was only conferred a university status
recently and hence had a more significant number of enrolled
students, which also means they receive a larger share of funding
from the government.

   Sufficiently funding higher education could improve the socio-
economic status of the country. If the current public institutions
are not well funded, it means they cannot produce competent
graduates. A lack of skilled labour in the country can only worsen
the socio-economic status, increase poverty and unemployment,
and the circle continues (Du Plessis & Keyter, 2019). In developing
government policy of financing higher education; therefore, all
these factors should be considered. Well-funded institutions will
have great resources for students, and students would likely
reduce protest activities. In the 2019/20 government budget,
UNAM was set to receive N$912 million while NUST would receive
N$500 million, a ration somewhat aligned with their student
enrollment.

   Another body administers most of the student loans, the
Namibian Students Financial Assistance Fund (NSFAF), which was
established by the government. NSFAF has been marred by
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS  171

maladministration and board/executive infighting that its
effectiveness has been compromised. Many students graduate and
continue working without ever paying back the loans, leaving the
body short of cash to provide funding for others.

   Other means of funding higher education is student loans from
commercial banks. The country is home to four major commercial
banks, three (First National Bank, Standard Bank and Nedbank) of
which are of South African origin and one (Bank Windhoek) was
established in Namibia during apartheid. None of the banks is
owned by indigenous Namibians, which often proves challenging to
those from poor socio-economic backgrounds to access financing,
as their products are not tailored for the poor.

   Households further contribute to fees for those unable to secure
any other form of funding. According to the Bank of Namibia
Financial Stability Report of 2020, Namibian households spend over
70% of their disposable income servicing debt facilities, with a high
risk of increasing due to the current low economic performance.
This number excludes non-banking financial institutions such as
micro-lenders, which if included will bring that number to 90%.
This shows that households are highly indebted and have little
disposable income available. Nuugulu et al. (2019) also highlight
the high household debt in the country and further advocates for
financial education on households to avoid individuals from falling
deeper into debt. Most household, although they probably do not
have a choice as they need to pay for their children's education,
could also do better with financial literacy in how to handle their
limited income better. With the continuous drought, economic
recession, lower commodity prices, unemployment at other
shocks, households continue to remain under immense pressure
for disposable income, leading to some students staying out of
enrolling due to lack of funds. The poor continue to be excluded.

FEES MUST FALL NAMIBIA

Given the apartheid history that both South Africa and Namibia
suffered, leaving both countries at the top of most unequal nations
in the world, education is viewed as one of the economic
equalizers. Therefore these protests are efforts to decolonize
education.

   Following the Fees Must Fall protests in South Africa, Universities
in Namibia (UNAM) also started their protests calling for same. The
protests were led by the University of Namibia (UNAM) Student
Representative Council (SRC), who was said to have been fueled
by the Affirmative Repositioning (AR) movement leader and youth
activist Job Amupanda, who is also the head of a department at
the university. Students started protesting after university
management announced that students who owe more than 50%
would not be allowed to write exams (Student News Grid, 2016).
Both UNAM and NUST had to immediately reverse the decision
and allow students to register without paying registration fees,
in fear of the protests turning violent like in South Africa
(UniversityWorldNews, 2016).

   The universities, however, did not agree to write-off the fees,
as the high debt would cripple their financial standing, which is
already threatened by low government allocation. According to
The Namibian newspaper, many students expressed dissatisfaction
with the quality of education received at these institutions as
compared to the cost. A final-year student, Petrus Shoopala, said:

   Unam, as the leading university in Namibia, has done a lot to
improve the education levels in Namibia, yes. However, the
institution still lacks the adequate standards that you should
expect... We pay thousands of dollars every year, yet we still do not
deserve the standards we receive from Unam.

   Another student, Atu Shimbilinga, is equally opposed to the fees
hike and also took a jab at government, especially on corruption:

   I do not think that Unam should increase fees. They are saying
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS  173

they are doing so because the government reduced their subsidy.
What type of government is this that does not want to invest in
education? Yet we have millions going missing every day, [they are]
building new parliaments and paying for ministers' stay in hotels
but claim not to have enough money for education. Also, it is not
like the increasing tuition fees are going to improve the standard/
quality of teaching we receive. I understand that Unam has bills to
pay, etc but that does not justify the increase. Instead of putting the
burden on the students, they should go to the root of the problem,
which is government.

   Corruption is a social evil that has been long entrenched in the
political culture. Recently, two ministers and five of their friends
were arrested for changing the fishing law to suit themselves in
allocating fishing quotas to companies that benefit them amounts
equivalent to $15 million. Another corruption scandal of
development bank executive benefiting up to $12 million. When
students see such headlines, while universities claim they cannot
lower the unaffordable fees, they become enraged as they believe
such funds could be used for better.

   Although education has enjoyed the most significant budget
allocation, the introduction of the Namibia Students Financial
Assistance Fund (NSFAF) for grants, the availability of private
companies' scholarships to top performers as well as bank loans,
there are still many challenges facing funding education in
Namibia. Although there have been many suggested funding
structures through policy papers, the government has been
reluctant to implement, as education institutions do not agree on
one structure (Matengu et al. 2014).

   NSFAF is unable to fund everyone, and scholarships are minimal.
Bank loans require suretyship, which, with the majority poor black
population, many students are unable to provide. Namibians banks
also all have their roots in South Africa and are mainly controlled
by their South African counterparts (Boer & Sherbourne, 2003),
which begs the question of equity when it comes to black Namibia
174  TUTALENI I. ASINO

students seeking student loans, as South African banks have a
reputation of treating white and black borrowers differently. This
practice leaves students who are unable to be funded by NSFAF
without options.

DISCUSSION

The issue of fees must fall comes from lack of funding of the
entire higher education sector in the country, coupled with the
poor socio-economic status of most families and low culture of
philanthropy. Mawere (2017) indicates that both universities and
students are victims of this fight, with students being tired of ever-
rising fees which they cannot afford due to their backgrounds of
apartheid and economic exclusion. Universities, on the other hand,
are fighting the battle of a poorly resourced government with
competing priorities as it cleans up the legacy of apartheid. African
people should, therefore, be cautious not to continue fighting each
other on issues that were left by the apartheid legacy.

   A senior lecturer at the University of Namibia, Dr Lucy Edwards-
Jauch in an opinion piece published by The Namibian newspaper
highlighted that the Fees Must Fall movement is a result of neo-
liberalism that has changed education from being a right as per the
Namibian constitution, to become a privilege. Jauch (2015) further
argues that the reduced state funding into a critical sector such
as education further amplifies the apartheid regime practices of
poverty and inequalities. She argues against privatization of
education as most students will not be able to afford the fees and
will leave households heavily indebted. The government should
seriously consider some of the recommendations that were made
during the protests such as wealth tax, capital gains tax and end
to corruption to ensure there are enough funds to decolonize
education.

   Another lecturer at the Namibian University of Science and
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS  175

Technology (NUST), Dr Hugh Ellis also wrote an opinion piece in
The Namibian newspaper where he cautioned government to take
the fees must fall movement serious and take lessons from South
Africa to avoid further protests. Ellis (2015) warns UNAM and NUST
against increasing tuition because most students are already
unable to afford the current fees due to their socio-economic
backgrounds. He further encourages education institutions to
reduce their spending on unnecessary activities such as logos,
team-building retreats and instead use such funds to reduce tuition
cost to students.

   Namibia, as a country, does not have a culture of philanthropy
in education, which leads to education institutions relying entirely
on government funding for the operation. The country which has
only been independent for less than 30 years also has competing
priorities in terms of development, leading to a shrinking
government contribution to education (Ras & Pretorius, 2007) and
more pressure on already squeezed households.

   Unfunded education means poor black people will remain at the
bottom of the economic pillar, increasing poverty which affects life
expectancy. Some students interviewed by Nhemachena & Kangira
(2017) indicated that the university also needs to consider some
unnecessary charges to students. Some fees charged are for
services that are unavailable or dysfunctional. These fees include
services such as recreational facilities which are often out of order
and not available for use to students. Higher education
administrators, therefore, have a role to play in cost allocations
to ensure cost reduction to students without reducing university
revenue.

   As a result of limited funding, tensions have been breaking out
at educational institutions, mainly at Board and Ministerial level.
The Minister of Higher Education who was appointed in 2016 by
the new President has been a subject of controversy in the media
since appointment. Leadership at the two government-funded
institutions, especially the Namibia University of Science and
176  TUTALENI I. ASINO

Technology (NUST) had to be changed for the first time since its
establishment after independence in 1992.

   This change brought about clashes between the board and the
minister on who the replacement should be, leaving the institution
under and Acting Vice-Chancellor for more than a year. The search
continues, while the institution experiences financial challenges.
UNAM also went through a leadership change, although, since
independence, UNAM has always enjoyed government support and
funding more than NUST (Naris & Ukpere, 2010). The Vice-
Chancellor of UNAM was cited by Lela Mobile (2016) cautioning
students not to follow the South Africans in protesting and burning
down universities, saying Namibians should be able to reason
better. Prof Hangula mentioned that the government has plans to
make higher education free (Lela Mobile, 2016) which is not backed
by any policy and could be a dangerous statement to make inciting
further protests if unmet.

   The country has also in the process been experiencing its worst
drought in 60 years, and with over 70% of the population
depending on agriculture, this affects a lot of livelihoods and
household income. The economy has further been in recession
for three consecutive years, the first since independence, causing
further reduction in government revenue and placing further
pressure on allocation to government institutions, education, rail,
as well as the national airline, Air Namibia which has been
experiencing losses and dependent on government bailouts for
over ten years. The country also went through the most contested
elections in 2020, where the incumbent President over 30% of
his previous support to an independent candidate. Most of the
support is lost due to the most significant corruption case involving
$150 million that was discovered just before the elections, leading
to the resignation of two Ministers, Fisheries and Justice. They,
together with their co-accused, were arrested and await sentencing
end February. The people are seeing the once beacon of African
hope going the direction of many failed states and want change.
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS  177

Although Namibians are generally peaceful people, the youth are
revolting and social media is an essential tool in this fight for
economic freedom.

   Nhemachena & Kangira (2017) argue that African students access
to education challenges cannot be taken lightly and evaluated on
basic principles. African students challenges are a result of neo-
colonialism dispossession and exploitation. African governments
are designing policies for higher education in today's age;
therefore, they should place the issue into the context of
dispossession and exploitation as it relates to neo-colonialism.
Marketisation, where institutions of higher education run like
private institutions, should be highly discouraged in Africa (Moganji
et al., 2020). Unlike other continents, Africa has been robbed of its
resources. It is also the continent where education arrived late and
needs to be accelerated to meet the required economic demands.

CONCLUSION

In 2020, both UNAM and NUST students protested the registration
fees and both institutions granted a reduction or altogether
scrapped the fees, giving students a better chance to register. The
loan system process was also revised, resulting in some students
who never had access to the loan system before getting granted
loans (Nhemachena & Kangira, 2017). This, however, has not
become policy yet, and there is still a long way to go. As more and
more students take up higher education, the need for funding will
accelerate. NSFAF still does not have a substantive CEO, which is
affecting its effectiveness in granting student loans and collecting
outstanding debt.

   The current economic conditions have not improved, and many
households continue to drown further in debt. Education still
appears to be the only equalizer in the country as the apartheid
legacy of inequalities continues. Many students are hungry to
178  TUTALENI I. ASINO

further their education to become the beacon of hope in removing
their families out of poverty. Fees continue to rise as government
allocation continues to reduce due to competing priorities of
development.

   Counting all that is going on in the country in terms of protests,
that is mainly fueled by low-income families as a result of low
economic growth, drought, corruption, leadership challenges, lack
of education philanthropy, reduced government revenue and
youth involvement in politics seeking accountability, higher
education continues to suffer funding deficits. Finding a useful
funding model for Namibia's higher education is vital if the
government is to avoid further unrests. It has been proven through
literature that marketization of higher education cannot work in the
Namibian context; hence government and the institutions should
be creative, fully understand and appreciate the complexity of the
Namibian economic background before making these impactful
decisions.

IMPLICATION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

History dictates that the Namibian higher education issues are
deeply rooted in the inequalities brought about by the apartheid
system (Hopson, 2001). These inequalities are manifesting
themselves through student's inability to access higher education,
which further perpetuates the knowledge gap that exists in the
black community. When analyzing topics such as fees must fall,
researchers must be cautious to not only scratch the surface of
what appears to be symptoms of a broader structural history of
apartheid. Future research should consider digging deeper into the
current funding structures and identify how they can be adjusted to
account for the historical disadvantages that were committed and
left many outside the higher education system. There is a further
lack of data on the current knowledge structure across different
IGNORED CONVERSATIONS                                  179

ethnic groups. Such data, if provided, may fuel government efforts
in bridging existing inequalities. Although there are several studies
conducted on the fees must fall, Heffernan (2018) found that most
are either racially exclusive, such as Fees Must Fall: Student Revolt,
Decolonisation, and Governance in South Africa, a book by Susan
Booysen, as well as others such as As By Fire: The End of the South
African University, a book by Prof. Jonathan Jansen which focuses
mainly on university vice-chancellors' views and excludes student
voices. Owing to the new nature of the movement, most of the
current writing is premature and have not grasped the larger
picture to the fees must fall movement (Heffernan, 2018). As time
progresses, therefore, and more effects are becoming visible, it will
be crucial for researchers to view #FeesMustFall clearer.

INTRODUCTION

Literacy is an enigma. While it is easy to agree that everyone should
be literate, the conversation around what being literate looks like,
and what the term itself is even means depends much on who is
leading the conversation and who has a stake in the conversation.
The term itself has historically been defined as "possession of the
complementary mental technologies of reading and writing,
literacy is not only difficult to define in individuals and delimit
within societies, but it is also charged with emotional and political
meaning" (pg. 12). This perceived simplicity has at times led to
many including news reporters and various academic scholars to

                                                              183
184  TUTALENI I. ASINO

refer "to whole societies as "illiterate and uncivilized" as a single
referent, and "illiterate" is still a term which carries a negative
connotation" (Wagner (1991, pg. 12). Of course, such
characterization, although still rampant, they are at least being
questioned. At last literacy is being considered much more widely,
and being recognised as integral to a culture where it is embedded
with functions and meanings.

   Literacy can be challenging to define. When narrowly defined
crucial elements are left off and when stated too broadly it can be a
catch-all term. This chapter does not purport to present a definition
of literacy, for such a task has been undertaken and explained by
many (Buckingham 1993; Knobel & Healy, 1998; Burniske, 2000
Cope and Kalantzis, 2000; & Semali 2002) who are much better
versed in the subject. The goal in this chapter is to look at the
understanding of digital literacy and whether or not it is (it broad
enough to include the features of) inclusive enough to account for
the affordance of mobile devices. Affordance in this context, can
mean providing an opportunity that allows an individual to learn
or perform a specific action or ability by using a mobile device.
Features like portability and individuality are playing a significant
role in enhancing mobile digital literacies. These features give any
individual the flexibility to learn whenever they want and wherever
they want (Sunga et. al, 2015). Inclusiveness is used as a reference
to considering a wide range of diverse human factors, i.e., every
user is entitled to participation, content creation, and giving a
response, which extends beyond reading, writing or any barrier
(Kirisci et. al, 2012).

EVOLUTION OF LITERACY

The term literacy itself has undergone numerous evolutions. Figure
1 below illustrates the different components that made up the
LITERACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE: FROM TRADITIONAL TO 185
DIGITAL TO MOBILE DIGITAL LITERACIES

United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), definitions from 1958 - 2005.

                       Figure 1: UNESCO literacy keyword
   UNESCO works continuously to promote inclusive education
practices that eliminate the obstacles limiting the participation and
success of all learners, respect the needs of people from different
backgrounds and help to eliminate all kinds of discrimination in the
learning environment. To illustrate the transformation of literacy
Ahmed (2011), collected definitions that depict how UNESCO has
changed their understanding over time. As cited by Ahmed (2011),
over the decades, UNESCO has provided the following definition at
different times between 1958 and 2005:

       1. A person is literate who can, with understanding, both
            read and write a short simple statement on his or her
            everyday life (UNESCO 1958);

       2. A person is functionally literate who can engage in all
            those activities in which literacy is required for effective
            functioning of his or her group and community and also
            for enabling him or her to continue to use reading, writing
186  TUTALENI I. ASINO

            and calculation for his or her own and the community's
            development (UNESCO 1978);

       3. Literacy is the ability to identify, understand, interpret,
            create, communicate and compute using printed and
            written materials associated with varying contexts.
            Literacy involves a continuum of learning in enabling
            individuals to achieve his or her goals, develop his or her
            knowledge and potential, and participate fully in
            community and wider society (UNESCO 2005). (pg. 181)

The countries that have membership in UNESCO have also adopted
similar stances on defining literacy and as such have had to adjust
their definitions accordingly. The table below presents a random
sample of countries and their definition of literacy. UNESCO has the
information below available on their website from 1975 to 2010.
The data was combined in an excel file and each item given a
random ID which was used to create the table below. As evident,
the definition of literacy has changed over time, and in alignment
with the definitions provided by UNESCO.

The three definitions from UNESCO and the definitions by the

countries above, show that literacy has undergone various

transformations. They've ranged primarily from the reading and

writing paradigm to now the inclusion of electronic media and

communication. Smyth (2011) opined that literacy has evolved, it

has gone beyond the mastery of the ability to read and write a

language but now the comprehension and how to use technology

as a medium and not the mastery of technical language.

The move to include technology into the definition of literacy is

undoubtedly due to the integration of Information Communication

Technologies (ICTs) into everyday life. This integration and usage

has brought about the information age, which is characterized by

"the widespread proliferation of emerging information and
188  TUTALENI I. ASINO

communication technologies and the capabilities that those
technologies provide and will provide humankind to overcome the
barriers imposed on communications by time, distance, and
location and the limits and constraints inherent in human
capacities to process information and make decisions. Advocates
of the concept of the Information Age maintain that we have
embarked on a journey in which information and communications
will become the dominant forces in defining and shaping human
actions, interactions, activities, and institutions" (Alberts 7 Papp,
1997, pg. 2).

   The information age has brought with it a new literacy referred
to as digital literacy. In staying loyal to the trunk from which it
sprouts, the term digital literacy has proven to be as elusive in its
definition. Most definitions closely resemble that put forth by the
United States, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which
argues that ". . . digital literacy generally refers to a variety of
skills associated with using ICT (information and communication
technologies) to find, evaluate, create and communicate
information. It is the sum of the technical skills and cognitive skills
people employ to use computers to retrieve information, interpret
what they find and judge the quality of that information. It also
includes the ability to communicate and collaborate using the
Internet--through blogs, self-published documents and
presentations and collaborative social networking platforms" (as
cited by Clark & Visser, 2011, pg. 38).

   This definition although seemingly a catchall and somewhat
nebulous, still does not mention or reference the growth of mobile
devices and the role that they are playing in society. Mobile devices
evolved from what only the learned operated to a user-friendly
device; it is not surprising that its price is beginning to decrease in
emerging markets, pr items from being expensive luxuries (GMCA,
2017). The definition seems to also ignore the role mobile devices
have in globalization which is not to be underestimated especially
since such devices have grown beyond simple miniature computers
LITERACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE: FROM TRADITIONAL TO 189
DIGITAL TO MOBILE DIGITAL LITERACIES

that enable the transmission of the human voice to being content
creation, delivery and consumption systems (Collins, 2005).

   The definition of mobile digital literacy has grown over time due
to technological advancement. An individual has become more
reliant on mobile phones as compared to someone who was using
it ten years back. In 1973, when a mobile phone was introduced,
it was solely used for communication, mobile literacy meant being
able to use the feature limited to the capability of dialing phone
numbers to call someone. Today, that definition of mobile literacy
can be seen in a new light with the incessant upgrades in the
features. It can now be defined as the capability of using and
exercising the wide array of features and applications in a
personalized manner.

   The growth of mobile devices to seemingly ubiquitous levels is
affecting communities around the world, altering the ways we
communicate, educate, collaborate and engage with one another;
altering what we know or think we know about our identity and
the very sense we have of space and time (Traxler, 2008). This
development which in many ways is akin to Khuns's (1962)
paradigm shift theory of science necessitates an evaluation of the
current models of literacies and more specifically digital literacies
in which mobile devices seem to belong. As Clancy & Lowrie (2002),
argued for new approaches and models to understand literacies
brought about by the digital age, I am similarly arguing that the
digital age has evolved beyond what it was at the turn of the
century or even five years ago and as such the understanding of
digital literacies need to be updated to address the new mobile
digital era.

WHY THE UPDATE

There is an interaction between mobile devices & traditional
understanding of literacy. Whereas traditional literacy was more
190  TUTALENI I. ASINO

concerned with reading and writing, mobile devices afford even
those without the ability to read or write a chance to participate
in the conversation. Some do this by the voice features of the
technology others can do so by memorizing various patterns of the
device they own, which thereby allow them to conduct business
and communicate with others even though they cannot tell a
difference between a 6 and a 9, yet they are able to dial it without a
problem.

   Mobile devices are changing how people are learning. According
to Telecomlead, an online B2B publication dedicated to the telecom
industry, as of Feb 2019, 89 percent of India's population are active
mobile users. However, the literacy rate of India is often cited to
be at 71.20%. Even though more than 89 percent of the Indian
population has a mobile phone, it does not mean that the
percentage of mobile literate in India is limited to 89 percent who
own a smartphone. In fact, the number of mobile literacy rates
can be higher than the number of people who actually own a
device. To elaborate further, let's look at an experiment "Hole-in-
the-wall" conducted by Dr. Sugata Mitra in 1999 in India to check
the effectiveness of digital literacy. Dr. Mitra's team carved a "hole
in the wall to append the slum in Kalkaji, New Delhi to the NIIT
premises. A free accessible computer was set up as a learning
station for the people living in the slums, especially the children.
The children, who now had access to the device, self-taught
themselves the skill to operate the computer without prior
knowledge or experience. This experiment establishes the point
that one does not have to have only the ability to read or write
to be considered literate. Nor does one need to go to a formal
educational institution to be digitally literate, but to be able to
read and write one often needs to go through some sort of formal
schooling. Viewed in the context of this paper, similarly, one does
not need to only be able to read or write to be considered mobile
digital literate. In fact, a person without the ability to read or write
LITERACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE: FROM TRADITIONAL TO 191
DIGITAL TO MOBILE DIGITAL LITERACIES

can still use a mobile device to accomplish their tasks. a mobile
device in order to qualify for Mobile Digital Literacy.

                       Figure 1. Stages of mobile digital literacies
   Mobile Digital Literacies has four stages. These stages help to
determine how literate an individual is in terms of using a mobile
phone.
   Basic: The basic digital mobile literacies mean a person can use
their voice to communicate using mobile devices. For example, if
a person is able to make a phone call to another they can be
considered to have basic digital mobile literacy skills. One does not
need to know how to read and write in this context, because since
many mobile phones have the ability to store favourite numbers or
speed dial, an individual can simply press one number and be able
to communicate.
   Technical: Mobile devices come with many features such as
cameras and the ability to send multimedia messages. The ability to
use mobile features such as sending the text, camera, calendar and
calculator go beyond one's ability to simply read and write. Such
skills classify the user as a technical mobile digital literate.
   Online Digital Literacy: Most mobile devices have the ability to
connect to the internet. This connectivity aspect is what makes
192  TUTALENI I. ASINO

the devices so appealing to many. However, the presence of
connectivity does not necessarily mean someone knows how to use
the devices to complete tasks online. Hence, mobile online digital
literates are those who can easily browse and search for content
using different mobile applications and internet browsers.

   Advance Online Literate: Lastly, advanced mobile online literates
are capable enough to access, create, navigate and understand
online content on a range of digital devices (GSMA, 2015). They not
only have the abilities referenced in the previous stages but can
also make use of the information for advance decision making.

MOBILE DIGITAL LITERACIES

We propose moving to adopt a new term, Mobile Digital Literacies
(MDLS), which is concerned with the role mobile devices play in
the world of digital literacy. Mobile Digital Literacies (MDLS) can be
defined as an individual's ability to identify, understand, interpret,
create and communicate using the features and functionality of a
mobile phone. It also serves an opportunity to create an identity
and bring more people into the dialogue by allowing those often
left out of the conversation a chance to create, recreate and reclaim
their identities.

   This re-imagining of digital literacy is more important because
definitions, teachings and understandings of digital literacy have
framed the conversation primarily "as the investigation of ways of
dealing with the computer and the Internet" (Pietrass, 2007, pg. 8),
which does not include new technologies.

   This positioning of digital literacy or new literacies as something
that someone else does that students have to examine critically
does not go far enough to capture the effects of mobile devices
on society and limits our ability, therefore, fall short at providing
a framework to critically look at the phenomenon. The issue is no
LITERACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE: FROM TRADITIONAL TO 193
DIGITAL TO MOBILE DIGITAL LITERACIES

longer simply about the effect of available information but rather
the effect of the information one creates.

   Many people, especially those born in the 1990s to today have
most of their life digitally recorded. They saw the evolution of many
digital platforms firsthand, which includes mobile devices as well.
They can easily adapt to the options and in turn, help the new age
population to adapt to the options as well. In Born Digital, Palfrey &
Gasser (2008) discuss ways to understand those born in the digital
age and also cover the term Digital Dossier which they attribute
to Daniel J. Solove, a professor of law at the George Washington
University Law School (p. 301). The definition of digital dossiers is
that, today even before a person is born today, their digital identity
starts being constructed through things such as prenatal exams
that a mother goes to, and ultrasound images from doctor visits.
Even before a child is outside its mother's womb, his or her picture
has possibly already been on the Internet if the parents decided
to share the picture of the ultrasound. This life cycle continues
with doctor visits for various check-ups when a child is born, to
tweets, blogs, websites and social networking sites that a person
might engage in. Overtime the digital dossier accumulates a lot of
material so that it is possible when a person born in 2000 reaches
30yrs of age there is no longer a need to go visit the parents to
look at baby pictures, rather all that information would be available
and accessible through some form of network, because it has been
archived since before the person was born.

   An examination of one's digital dossier is not mentioned or
alluded to in the current definition of digital literacy or the
discussions of new literacies. Consequently, students in schools
are taught how to critically examine what others produce and to
question the validity of different perspectives presented in digital
forms (a case can be made that even this is not being done well),
however what is missing is a lesson on self-examination.

   In 2011, world governments and leaders were overthrown
because of injustices that they committed against their own people,
194  TUTALENI I. ASINO

which are brought to light by the use of mobile devices. The power
of mobile devices has extended the nature by which humans are
connected, a critical examination of the role the individual plays not
only in critically examining what they've read or seen, but rather
what they've created and posted is a necessary aspect of a new
digital literacy or a creation of a new literacy all together.

   Another motivation for the evaluation of the current
understanding of digital literacy is the nature by which mobile
devices have allowed those traditionally viewed as disenfranchised
and marginalized to enter the conversation.

   The argument against the investment in ICTs especially in Afrikan
schools has often revolved around whether such an investment is
worthy of consideration more so than other pressing needs such
as addressing, HIV/AIDS, malnutrition, malaria, etc. (Slay & Dalvit,
2008). This `can't chew and work/walk at the same time' or `the
one thing at a time approach' is no longer the only option. Mobile
devices have taken away the absence of communities in the
"developing world" from the global conversation while they address
"more pressing issues". Mobile devices and the effect they've had
have also allowed for different communities to be looked at from
their perspectives because of what they contribute to the overall
network. This has moved the conversation from the generic global
village to recognising that even as technology there are still
differences amongst cultures. This realisation has prompted Mills
(2010) therefore conclude that "while giving acknowledgment to
the significant advances in digital communication technologies,
there is not a single global village--rather, there are groups with
varied levels of participation in digital practices across local villages
around the world" (p. 262).

   As argued by Millis (2010), in her survey of the literature, new
literacies have often been concerned with the digital divide and
leave the impression that technology is leaving those in
marginalised and low income communities at a disadvantage.
Although there are constraints, those in marginalised communities
LITERACY IN THE DIGITAL AGE: FROM TRADITIONAL TO 195
DIGITAL TO MOBILE DIGITAL LITERACIES

are finding a way to enter into the dialogue and are not simply shut
out.

   Put simply, the conversation should no longer be solely about
how the marginalized are left out of the conversation but rather
how they are altering the conversation because they are taking
part. Whether the various gatekeepers and those in privilege
positions are recognising it, the fact remains that those that did not
participate before are not only part of the conversation, but they
are beginning their own conversations that have nothing to do with
what has been designated as the topic du jour. Like water they are
seeping through at all different crevices albeit slowly.

CONCLUSION

In this paper, we have argued that the current framing of digital
literacy does not go enough to include the changes and affordance
that are brought on by mobile devices. We are proposing for an
expanded definition of digital literacy which takes into account the
different "practices across multiple technologies, media, modes,
text formats, and social contexts" (Mills, 2010, p 262).

   In agreement with Kress (2010), we believe that the new
definition of digital literacies (even if it does not result in the name
we propose of Mobile Digital Literacy - MDL), it must have the
following three components:

       1. the rapid evolution of digital technologies;

       2. a new more pervasive emphasis on multimodality in digital
            communications;

       3. a new approach to communication and interaction that is
            best characterised by an emphasis on design rather than a
            highly separable distinction between `writing' and `reading'
            (p5).
196  TUTALENI I. ASINO

The choice is to either make room at the table by broadening the
definition of digital literacy or to create a new table introducing a
new category that includes mobile devices. The traditional way of
defining literacy & digital literacies is coming up short - we need to
include the different things that mobile devices contribute, and as
such we must continue to reconfigure what we traditionally know
as literacy.

The Digital Divide and the lack
Financial Literacy among First
Generation

JOSE "JAY" FULGENCIO, PH.D.

Oklahoma State University - Oklahoma City

   Imagine walking into a bank and seeing no bank tellers around
to take deposit money. A few years ago, that is what happened to
me. I walked into a private bank to deposit money into my mom's
account with no bank tellers' insight. I later realized that the bank
had done away with the bank tellers, including the drive-through
teller, and instead moved basic financial transactions online.
Imagine a young person with no knowledge of online banking and
no understanding of financial literacy terminology to figure out
online banking on their own. Now throw in that the young person
may also have no access to a computer and uses an old cell phone
where it only works with public WiFi.

   As a former assistant branch manager for a private bank and
Certified Financial Education Instructor with the National Financial
Educators Council, I know the frustration that people go through

                                                              199
200  TUTALENI I. ASINO

when they don't understand how online banking works and the
frustration of basic financial literacy terminology. The future of
banking going digital has me more worried about first-generation
college students, especially among minority groups, because I fall
into the two groups. Studies show how the digital divide and lack of
financial literacy education among first-generation college students
can be set back compared to non-first generation peers.

   As a first-generation college student myself, I had to learn
financial literacy on my own through life experiences, and I did not
have the latest computer technology growing up until I was in high
school. A first-generation college student is defined as an individual
whose family comes from a low or medium-income background
or high school education without attending college (College Board,
2016). When it comes to financial literacy, studies consistently show
that a large number of people lack the financial literacy skills
necessary to make critical financial decisions such as taking out
a mortgage or understanding the stock market (Mandell & Klein,
2009). First-generation college students are vulnerable to falling
into debt, ruining their credit score, or lacking the knowledge of
building a budget (Lusardi, Mitchell & Curto 2010). A recent study
by the TIAA-CREF Institute stated that 12% of college-educated
Hispanics demonstrated advanced financial knowledge, and only
32% displayed basic financial literacy (De Bassa, Lusardi, &
Yakoboski, 2015). This kind of experience makes it difficult for
Hispanics to be financial stable, comprehend financial literature,
and build wealth for the future. I don't see any easy solution to
solving financial literacy and the digital divide at the same time.

   The solution I have for financial literacy is that every university
across the United States requires its students to complete a three-
credit financial literacy course. Financial literacy education can play
a pivotal role in students' lives. Ineffective money management
can result in individuals making poor financial decisions that may
prevent them from reaching full financial relief and possibly living
paycheck to paycheck. I have yet to figure out how to solve the
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE AND THE LACK FINANCIAL LITERACY 201
AMONG FIRST GENERATION

digital divide among first-generation college students because of
their complexity. For example, the digital divide includes unreliable
internet access, older devices that don't work, inadequate cell
phone data places, and computers.

   To reach a larger audience for financial literacy education the
best way are free tools such as YouTube and social media like
Instagram. I can teach an individual the basic concepts of online
banking and the terminology associated by publishing online
courses on YouTube, which I have done. The tools that I use to
create financial literacy education in the digital age is Camtasia
to record the video and publish on YouTube and Vimeo for easy
access to anyone that is interested. Another digital tool I use to
teach financial literacy education is Instagram. I published short
videos on Instagram TV for individuals to learn about saving
money, creating a financial budget, and developing financial goals.

   No matter how many courses I publish on YouTube the individual
still needs to access the internet. I can't teach a person how to
obtain a computer or a smartphone capable of opening up a bank
account. How do you solve the digital divide and lack of financial
literacy among first-generation college students?

CHAPTER 13

Escape Rooms: An Alternative to
Traditional Forms of Assessment

SAMANTHA WILLIS, M.S.ED

Oklahoma State University
       Abstract. Most people think of escape rooms as a fun recreational
       activity one can do with friends. In the educational world, escape rooms
       have become a popular way for teachers to utilize game-based learning
       as an engaging classroom tool. This chapter aims to explain the history
       of escape rooms, how escape rooms can be educational, and how to
       design an escape room. Additionally, this chapter aims to provide a
       brief history and overview of types of assessment and works to explain
       how escape rooms can be used as assessment tools. Ultimately, the
       goal of this chapter is to show how escape rooms can provide an
       experience of playfulness that appeals to students' various learning
       styles, motivates students, provides teachers with a fun and productive
       way to assess, and provides a doorway for wonder and curiosity to
       enter a classroom.

INTRODUCTION

As time progresses, the world grows more technologically

                                                              203

advanced as innovations in technology are seemingly created each
day and new uses for old technology seem to be discovered by
the minute. Every day, innovators create new ways to communicate
and teach the world. Just as the field of technology never stops
inventing and becoming more advanced, so should the field of
education never stop advancing. Schools are the bases for teaching
the future generation who will be the creators of more advanced
technology, which means schools should not be left behind. Too
often local and national news sources show that schools across
the United States are using outdated technology, textbooks, and
techniques. Ringstaff and Kelley (2002) point out that what can be
"gleaned from most current research on the implementation of
computer-based technology in K-12 education is that technology is
a means, not an end; it is a tool for achieving instructional goals,
not a goal in itself" (p. 5) Teachers should be reaching modern
21st-century students with modern 21st-century methods with a
clear plan of how using technology can enhance their teaching
and assessing. As Ringstaff and Kelley (2002) suggest "technology is
most powerful when used as a tool for problem-solving, conceptual
development, and critical thinking" (p. 9).

ESCAPE ROOMS

Escape Rooms can be defined "as live-action team-based games
where players discover clues, solve puzzles, and accomplish tasks
in one or more rooms in order to accomplish a specific goal (usually
escaping from the room) within a limited amount of time"
(Nicholson, 2015 as cited in Vidergor, 2021, p. 2). The use of escape
rooms was first documented in 2007 when a single-room escape
room game called Real Escape Game Event for 5-6 players was open
to the public in Kyoto, Japan (Taraldsen et al., 2020). Taraldsen et
al. (2020) suggest that the origins of escape rooms can be traced
back to an array of genres such as "live-action role-playing, point-
ESCAPE ROOMS: AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL FORMS OF 205
ASSESSMENT

and-click adventure games, puzzle hunt, interactive theatre, and
haunted houses" (p. 1) Martens and Crawford (2019) adds
adventure game shows and Vidergor (2021) adds shows and
movies to the list of origins. As a rapidly growing phenomenon
between the years, 2012-2013, recreational escape rooms began to
reach a large part of the world outside of Japan (Vidergor, 2021).
Eventually, recreational escape rooms made their way to the
United States, though it is not entirely evident how that transition
happened or when it occurred. However, escape rooms soon were
seen as more than just a fun experience for adults as they came
to also be seen as an educational tool that teachers could utilize in
their classrooms.

EDUCATIONAL ESCAPE ROOMS

"Escape" means to "free oneself from confinement" (Martens &
Crawford, 2019, p. 74). As an educational tool, teachers can use
escape rooms to help free themselves and their students from the
confinement of outdated and boring lessons. Educational escape
rooms allow teachers an opportunity to be creative and to truly
customize and differentiate content to fit students' needs by using
a wide array of tools and resources within their escape rooms.
Marki et al. (2021) and Taraldsen et al. (2020) define educational
escape rooms as pedagogical activities that are time-constrained
and problem-based. Having such interactive activities in the
classroom encourages active learning from students through
discussions and cooperation.

   Escape Rooms as a recreational game can be used in different
ways and can use a smorgasbord of tools to present clues and
puzzles for those who wish to test their skills and see if they can
escape. In an educational setting, escape rooms can take multiple
formats. Teachers can use educational escape rooms as in-person
activities that include hiding clues, puzzles, and other activities for
206             TUTALENI I. ASINO

students to complete in teams throughout the physical classroom.
Additionally, escape rooms might use a blended format where
some technology is used to help present clues and to keep track
of students' progress through challenges that lead to escaping the
escape room. Sometimes escape rooms can be fully digital which
means teachers use websites such as Google forms and Google
Slides to present a scenario and students work through digital
activities to escape the game. Digital escape rooms help to
overcome the limitations of traditional classroom teaching by being
game-based and learner-centered, allowing students to practice
cooperation and problem-solving while using a variety of digital
materials within the escape room list of tasks to find clues, solve
puzzles, and ultimately escape the game (Huang et al., 2020).

HOW TO  CREATE  EDUCATIONAL  ESCAPE
ROOMS

Escape rooms might be fun and challenging to partake in, but
the act of creating educational escape rooms can also be fun and
challenging. To begin creating an escape room for classroom use
teachers should go through a few steps to ensure they cover
everything they wish to cover. The first step teachers should take is
to identify their audience, the length of time they have to conduct
the escape room, and the topic they wish to cover throughout the
escape room (Neumann et.al, 2020). Next, teachers should pick
several "takeaways" from their topic and then write a question for
each takeaway that will challenge students to show what they know
(Neumann et.al, 2020). One of the most exciting steps is to write a
scenario to get students engaged. A good scenario is an interesting
background story that sets up why students are trapped in the
escape room and why they need to find a way to escape the game.
For example, a scenario story might be that students went on a
field trip to a movie theater where they become trapped in the
ESCAPE ROOMS: AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL FORMS OF 207
ASSESSMENT

theater and have to find a way to escape! Neumann et. al (2020)
suggests that in the scenario story there should be hidden clues
that students can use to solve the first puzzle. Teachers then need
to decide what steps students are going to need to take to escape,
what puzzles they will need to solve, and how students are going
to unlock "keys" that eventually lead to their escape. According
to Neumann et. al (2020), teachers should create a digital form
where students can submit their answers to progress through the
escape room. Teachers should create a digital "room" (see figure 1)
that compiles the background story, the location, and a place for
students to submit the answers to the puzzles in one place.

   All of the steps above can be followed whether a teacher wants to
turn their classroom into an escape room, a blended escape room
(where parts of the escape room are in the classroom and other
parts are done with technology), or a digital escape room. When
creating in-person escape rooms, teachers can use old cash boxes,
locks, keys, shoe boxes (designed to fit the theme), and other items
that teachers can find that might fit the theme of the escape room.
For blended or digital escape rooms, teachers have a wealth of
resources through the internet. Resources such as Google suite
apps such as Google Sites, Google Docs, Google Forms, and Google
Drawings are free to use and can all be used together to create
an extensive escape room. Many YouTube videos are available to
assist teachers throughout the process of creating their rooms.
Other online resources include virtual jigsaw puzzles, virtual
newspaper builders, custom eye charts, and note generators.
Teachers can also use sites such as Canva (see figure 1) or Genially
to create templates or to create a virtual room such as a bitmoji
classroom where there are clues and links to different places of
how students solve all the tasks to eventually escape the room.
While it may take time to design an escape room, it can be a
fun and challenging endeavor for a teacher that will pay off in an
engaging, motivating, and collaborative activity for their students.

ASSESSMENT

Teaching with modern methods is important, as is assessing
students with methods that match the times. For schools in the
United States, it is common practice to teach to the test or in
other words for teachers to focus on test prep in order to achieve
high test scores from their students. Assessing students should not
have to follow traditional methods such as pen and paper tests.
Teachers should be allowed to move past the influences of more
significant economic and political trends to teach students with the
most appropriate researched-based methods.

   HISTORY AND TYPES OF ASSESSMENT
   Since the 19th-century, assessments and the United States
educational system as it is known in modern times, were created
out of a need to educate all citizens and were inspired by the
economic and instructivist ways that are still present today (Box,
ESCAPE ROOMS: AN ALTERNATIVE TO TRADITIONAL FORMS OF 209
ASSESSMENT

2019). In the United States, assessments are an important aspect
to determine students' learning abilities in specific contexts.
Assessments often take either a formative or summative form
though there are plenty of other forms of assessment. Formative
assessments are administered during instruction and summative
assessments are administered after instruction to ensure students
have learned the material (Dixson & Worrell, 2016).

   One of the main methods of using formative and summative
assessments is through portfolios and traditional pen-and-paper
tests such as quizzes and exams (Dixson & Worrell, 2016).
Unfortunately, more often than not, technology tools that teachers
might use to engage students in learning activities are not used to
assess students on the same topics. Current assessment practices
do not typically allow for collaboration amongst students as they
are expected to be tested individually and they do not encourage
unique uses of educational technology.

   Continuing with current assessment methods prevents students
from engaging in more modern learning techniques and does not
push teachers to try new teaching methods. New teaching methods
such as game-based learning or escape rooms can help students
retain more knowledge. When students retain more knowledge,
they are engaged and well-suited to practice collaboration amongst
classmates. One of the high-level goals of this chapter and why
escape rooms as assessment tools should be considered in schools
is echoed by the words of Brown (1992) when she said her high-
level goal was to restyle K-12 classrooms from a workplace where
students are thought of as vessels to be filled with knowledge from
their teachers "into communities of learning and interpretation,
where students are given significant opportunity to take charge of
their own learning" (p. 141).

   EDUCATIONAL ESCAPE ROOMS AS ASSESSMENT TOOLS
   Educational escape rooms are generally considered a way to
bring game-based learning into the classroom to engage students
and cover content in a different way. Typically escape rooms are
210  TUTALENI I. ASINO

not thought of as an assessment tool. An educational escape room
makes sense as an assessment tool for a variety of reasons. For
one, educational escape rooms already cover many of the same
skills that are expected from students when they complete
traditional assessments. As mentioned previously in this chapter,
one of the recommended steps when creating an escape room
is for the teacher to write a question for each takeaway. When
the questions are well-developed and thought-provoking they can
serve as a way for teachers to assess students in a formative way
while the students complete each challenge of the escape room.
How successful students are in escaping the room is a way for
teachers to assess students in a summative way. While designing
educational escape rooms teachers can include different
challenges and different ways to solve these puzzles, which creates
unique and discreet ways to assess their students. Teachers can
use any subject or a combination of subjects as a base for their
escape room since many puzzles could potentially require math
problems, scientific inquiries, riddles for English, or finding a
location for geography.

   Additionally, teachers can divide students into groups to work
together to figure out how to escape while also deciding how much
students can do together and if there are things they want students
to do individually. If students work together it can help teachers
assess social-emotional skills such as how collaborative and how
cooperative students are with each other. In other words, how
well students can work together to overcome mutual challenges.
Allowing students to work together can also be a way to group
assess students and discover which students need more help with
certain topics (as they seem to be the ones not as involved in
solving challenges) and which students are ready to move on to
more challenging tasks (they appear as the leaders).

ASSESSMENT

CONCLUSION

Over time, escape rooms have rapidly expanded from activities that
fulfill the population's desire for thrills and challenges to their now
being an extensive use of escape rooms in educational settings
as highlighted in studies by Huang et al. (2020), Taraldsen et al.
(2020), and Makri et al. (2021). In more recent times, escape rooms
have gained popularity in many academic disciplines showing that
escape rooms can be used for any subject at any grade or
educational level. As emphasized by Hill and Brunvand (2018), each
grade level has unique advantages and challenges when designing
and implementing escape rooms but implementing a gameful
approach in every classroom can be an effective way to unlock
different learning opportunities while promoting active
engagement and collaboration amongst students. Martens and
Crawford (2019) point out that escape room activities can help
kindle children's wonder and determination, which is crucial to
building a foundation for future innovators. Time will only tell how
the use of gamified education will change as teachers find new
ways to implement escape rooms in their classrooms as a way to
engage and assess their students.
