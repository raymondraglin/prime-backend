Solving a problem for which you know there's an answer is like climbing a mountain with a guide, along
a trail someone else has laid. In mathematics, the truth is somewhere out there in a place no one knows,
beyond all the beaten paths.
- Yoko Ogawa

                                                                                   1
Introduction

The Common Core State Standards for Mathematics (http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice) identify eight
"Mathematical Practices" -- the kinds of expertise that all teachers should try to foster in their students, but they
go far beyond any particular piece of mathematics content. They describe what mathematics is really about, and
why it is so valuable for students to master. The very first Mathematical Practice is:

              Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them. Mathematically proficient students start by explaining
              to themselves the meaning of a problem and looking for entry points to its solution. They analyze givens,
              constraints, relationships, and goals. They make conjectures about the form and meaning of the solution and
              plan a solution pathway rather than simply jumping into a solution attempt. They consider analogous problems,
              and try special cases and simpler forms of the original problem in order to gain insight into its solution. They
              monitor and evaluate their progress and change course if necessary.

This chapter will help you develop these very important mathematical skills, so that you will be better prepared to
help your future students develop them. Let's start with solving a problem!

                                                                  Problem 1 (ABC)

    Draw curves connecting A to A, B to B, and C to C. Your curves cannot cross or even touch each
    other,they cannot cross through any of the lettered boxes, and they cannot go outside the large box or even
    touch it's sides.

                                                                                         3

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    After you have worked on the problem on your own for a while, talk through your ideas with a partner
    (even if you have not solved it).

       · What did you try?
       · What makes this problem difficult?
       · Can you change the problem slightly so that it would be easier to solve?
Problem Solving Strategy 1 (Wishful Thinking). Do you wish something in the problem was different? Would it
then be easier to solve the problem?
For example, what if ABC problem had a picture like this:

Can you solve this case and use it to help you solve the original case? Think about moving the boxes around once
the lines are already drawn.
Here is one possible solution.
INTRODUCTION · 5
Problem or Exercise?

The main activity of mathematics is solving problems. However, what most people experience in most
mathematics classrooms is practice exercises. An exercise is different from a problem.

In a problem, you probably don't know at first how to approach solving it. You don't know what mathematical
ideas might be used in the solution. Part of solving a problem is understanding what is being asked, and knowing
what a solution should look like. Problems often involve false starts, making mistakes, and lots of scratch paper!

In an exercise, you are often practicing a skill. You may have seen a teacher demonstrate a technique, or you
may have read a worked example in the book. You then practice on very similar assignments, with the goal of
mastering that skill.

Note: What is a problem for some people may be an exercise for other people who have more background
knowledge! For a young student just learning addition, this might be a problem:

Fill in the blank to make a true statement:                                              .

But for you, that is an exercise!

Both problems and exercises are important in mathematics learning. But we should never forget that the ultimate
goal is to develop more and better skills (through exercises) so that we can solve harder and more interesting
problems.

Learning math is a bit like learning to play a sport. You can practice a lot of skills:

· hitting hundreds of forehands in tennis so that you can place them in a particular spot in the court,
· breaking down strokes into the component pieces in swimming so that each part of the stroke is more

   efficient,
· keeping control of the ball while making quick turns in soccer,
· shooting free throws in basketball,
· catching high fly balls in baseball,
· and so on.

But the point of the sport is to play the game. You practice the skills so that you are better at playing the game. In
mathematics, solving problems is playing the game!
On Your Own
For each question below, decide if it is a problem or an exercise. (You do not need to solve the problems! Just
decide which category it fits for you.) After you have labeled each one, compare your answers with a partner.
1. This clock has been broken into three pieces. If you add the numbers in each piece, the sums are consecutive
numbers.(Note: Consecutive numbers are whole numbers that appear one after the other, such as 1, 2, 3, 4 or 13,
14, 15. )

Can you break another clock into a different number of pieces so that the sums are consecutive numbers? Assume
that each piece has at least two numbers and that no number is damaged (e.g. 12 isn't split into two digits 1 and
2).
2. A soccer coach began the year with a $500 budget. By the end of December, the coach spent $450. How much
money in the budget was not spent?
3. What is the product of 4,500 and 27?
4. Arrange the digits 1-6 into a "difference triangle" where each number in the row below is the difference of the
two numbers above it.
5. Simplify the following expression:

6. What is the sum of and ?
8 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

7. You have eight coins and a balance scale. The coins look alike, but one of them is a counterfeit. The counterfeit
coin is lighter than the others. You may only use the balance scale two times. How can you find the counterfeit
coin?

8. How many squares, of any possible size, are on a standard 8 × 8 chess board?
9. What number is 3 more than half of 20?
10. Find the largest eight-digit number made up of the digits 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, and 4 such that the 1's are separated
by one digit, the 2's are separated by two digits, the 3's by three digits, and the 4's by four digits.
 Problem Solving Strategies

  Think back to the first problem in this chapter, the ABC Problem. What did you do to solve it? Even if you did
  not figure it out completely by yourself, you probably worked towards a solution and figured out some things that
  did not work.
  Unlike exercises, there is never a simple recipe for solving a problem. You can get better and better at solving
  problems, both by building up your background knowledge and by simply practicing. As you solve more problems
  (and learn how other people solved them), you learn strategies and techniques that can be useful. But no single
  strategy works every time.

 Pólya's How to Solve It

      George Pólya was a great champion in the field of teaching effective problem solving skills. He was born
      in Hungary in 1887, received his Ph.D. at the University of Budapest, and was a professor at Stanford
      University (among other universities). He wrote many mathematical papers along with three books, most
      famously, "How to Solve it." Pólya died at the age 98 in 1985.1

                                                                 George Pólya, circa 1973

   In 1945, Pólya published the short book How to Solve It, which gave a four-step method for solving mathematical
  problems:

10 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

   1. First, you have to understand the problem.
   2. After understanding, then make a plan.
   3. Carry out the plan.
   4. Look back on your work. How could it be better?

This is all well and good, but how do you actually do these steps?!?! Steps 1. and 2. are particularly mysterious!
How do you "make a plan?" That is where you need some tools in your toolbox, and some experience to draw
upon.

Much has been written since 1945 to explain these steps in more detail, but the truth is that they are more art than
science. This is where math becomes a creative endeavor (and where it becomes so much fun). We will articulate
some useful problem solving strategies, but no such list will ever be complete. This is really just a start to help
you on your way. The best way to become a skilled problem solver is to learn the background material well, and
then to solve a lot of problems!

We have already seen one problem solving strategy, which we call "Wishful Thinking." Do not be afraid to change
the problem! Ask yourself "what if" questions:

  · What if the picture was different?
  · What if the numbers were simpler?
  · What if I just made up some numbers?

You need to be sure to go back to the original problem at the end, but wishful thinking can be a powerful strategy
for getting started.

This brings us to the most important problem solving strategy of all:

Problem Solving Strategy 2 (Try Something!). If you are really trying to solve a problem, the whole point is
that you do not know what to do right out of the starting gate. You need to just try something! Put pencil to
paper (or stylus to screen or chalk to board or whatever!) and try something. This is often an important step in
understanding the problem; just mess around with it a bit to understand the situation and figure out what is going
on.

And equally important: If what you tried first does not work, try something else! Play around with the problem
until you have a feel for what is going on.

                                                                Problem 2 (Payback)

    Last week, Alex borrowed money from several of his friends. He finally got paid at work, so he brought
    cash to school to pay back his debts. First he saw Brianna, and he gave her 1/4 of the money he had brought
    to school. Then Alex saw Chris and gave him 1/3 of what he had left after paying Brianna. Finally, Alex
    saw David and gave him 1/2 of what he had remaining. Who got the most money from Alex?
                                                                                                                            PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES · 11

                                                                  Think/Pair/Share

    After you have worked on the problem on your own for a while, talk through your ideas with a partner
    (even if you have not solved it). What did you try? What did you figure out about the problem?
This problem lends itself to two particular strategies. Did you try either of these as you worked on the problem?
If not, read about the strategy and then try it out before watching the solution.
Problem Solving Strategy 3 (Draw a Picture). Some problems are obviously about a geometric situation, and it
is clear you want to draw a picture and mark down all of the given information before you try to solve it. But even
for a problem that is not geometric, like this one, thinking visually can help! Can you represent something in the
situation by a picture?
Draw a square to represent all of Alex's money. Then shade 1/4 of the square -- that's what he gave away to
Brianna. How can the picture help you finish the problem?
After you have worked on the problem yourself using this strategy (or if you are completely stuck), you can watch
someone else's solution.

Problem Solving Strategy 4 (Make Up Numbers). Part of what makes this problem difficult is that it is about
money, but there are no numbers given. That means the numbers must not be important. So just make them up!
12 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

You can work forwards: Assume Alex had some specific amount of money when he showed up at school, say
$100. Then figure out how much he gives to each person. Or you can work backwards: suppose he has some
specific amount left at the end, like $10. Since he gave Chris half of what he had left, that means he had $20
before running into Chris. Now, work backwards and figure out how much each person got.
Watch the solution only after you tried this strategy for yourself.

If you use the "Make Up Numbers" strategy, it is really important to remember what the original problem was
asking! You do not want to answer something like "Everyone got $10." That is not true in the original problem;
that is an artifact of the numbers you made up. So after you work everything out, be sure to re-read the problem
and answer what was asked!

                                                     Problem 3 (Squares on a Chess Board)

    How many squares, of any possible size, are on a 8 × 8 chess board? (The answer is not 64... It's a lot
    bigger!)
Remember Pólya's first step is to understand the problem. If you are not sure what is being asked, or why the
answer is not just 64, be sure to ask someone!
                                       PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES · 13

              Think / Pair / Share

     After you have worked on the problem on your own for a while, talk through your ideas with a partner
     (even if you have not solved it). What did you try? What did you figure out about the problem, even if you
     have not solved it completely?

It is clear that you want to draw a picture for this problem, but even with the picture it can be hard to know if
you have found the correct answer. The numbers get big, and it can be hard to keep track of your work. Your goal
at the end is to be absolutely positive that you found the right answer. You should never ask the teacher, "Is this
right?" Instead, you should declare, "Here's my answer, and here is why I know it is correct!"

Problem Solving Strategy 5 (Try a Simpler Problem). Pólya suggested this strategy: "If you can't solve a
problem, then there is an easier problem you can solve: find it." He also said: "If you cannot solve the proposed
problem, try to solve first some related problem. Could you imagine a more accessible related problem?" In this
case, an 8 × 8 chess board is pretty big. Can you solve the problem for smaller boards? Like 1 × 1? 2 × 2? 3 ×
3?

Of course the ultimate goal is to solve the original problem. But working with smaller boards might give you some
insight and help you devise your plan (that is Pólya's step (2)).

Problem Solving Strategy 6 (Work Systematically). If you are working on simpler problems, it is useful to keep
track of what you have figured out and what changes as the problem gets more complicated.

For example, in this problem you might keep track of how many 1 × 1 squares are on each board, how many 2 ×
2 squares on are each board, how many 3 × 3 squares are on each board, and so on. You could keep track of the
information in a table:

size of board # of 1 × 1 squares # of 2 × 2 squares # of 3 × 3 squares # of 4 × 4 squares ...

1 by 1  1  0  0                     0

2 by 2  4  1  0                     0

3 by 3  9  4  1                     0

...

Problem Solving Strategy 7 (Use Manipulatives to Help You Investigate). Sometimes even
drawing a picture may not be enough to help you investigate a problem. Having actual
materials that you move around can sometimes help a lot!

For example, in this problem it can be difficult to keep track of which squares you have already counted. You
might want to cut out 1 × 1 squares, 2 × 2 squares, 3 × 3 squares, and so on. You can actually move the smaller
squares across the chess board in a systematic way, making sure that you count everything once and do not count
anything twice.
14 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

Problem Solving Strategy 8 (Look for and Explain Patterns). Sometimes the numbers in a problem are so big,
there is no way you will actually count everything up by hand. For example, if the problem in this section were
about a 100 × 100 chess board, you would not want to go through counting all the squares by hand! It would be
much more appealing to find a pattern in the smaller boards and then extend that pattern to solve the problem for
a 100 × 100 chess board just with a calculation.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    If you have not done so already, extend the table above all the way to an 8 × 8 chess board, filling in all the
    rows and columns. Use your table to find the total number of squares in an 8 × 8 chess board. Then:

       · Describe all of the patterns you see in the table.
       · Can you explain and justify any of the patterns you see? How can you be sure they will continue?
       · What calculation would you do to find the total number of squares on a 100 × 100 chess board?
    (We will come back to this question soon. So if you are not sure right now how to explain and justify the
    patterns you found, that is OK.)
                          PROBLEM SOLVING STRATEGIES · 15

Problem 4 (Broken Clock)

This clock has been broken into three pieces. If you add the numbers in each piece, the sums are
consecutive numbers. (Consecutive numbers are whole numbers that appear one after the other, such as
1, 2, 3, 4 or 13, 14, 15.)

    Can you break another clock into a different number of pieces so that the sums are consecutive
    numbers? Assume that each piece has at least two numbers and that no number is damaged (e.g. 12 isn't
    split into two digits 1 and 2.)

Remember that your first step is to understand the problem. Work out what is going on here. What are the sums
of the numbers on each piece? Are they consecutive?

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    After you have worked on the problem on your own for a while, talk through your ideas with a partner
    (even if you have not solved it). What did you try? What progress have you made?

Problem Solving Strategy 9 (Find the Math, Remove the Context). Sometimes the problem has a lot of details
in it that are unimportant, or at least unimportant for getting started. The goal is to find the underlying math
problem, then come back to the original question and see if you can solve it using the math.
In this case, worrying about the clock and exactly how the pieces break is less important than worrying about
finding consecutive numbers that sum to the correct total. Ask yourself:

  · What is the sum of all the numbers on the clock's face?
  · Can I find two consecutive numbers that give the correct sum? Or four consecutive numbers? Or some
16 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

      other amount?
  · How do I know when I am done? When should I stop looking?
Of course, solving the question about consecutive numbers is not the same as solving the original problem. You
have to go back and see if the clock can actually break apart so that each piece gives you one of those consecutive
numbers. Maybe you can solve the math problem, but it does not translate into solving the clock problem.
Problem Solving Strategy 10 (Check Your Assumptions). When solving problems, it is easy to limit your thinking
by adding extra assumptions that are not in the problem. Be sure you ask yourself: Am I constraining my thinking
too much?
In the clock problem, because the first solution has the clock broken radially (all three pieces meet at the center,
so it looks like slicing a pie), many people assume that is how the clock must break. But the problem does not
require the clock to break radially. It might break into pieces like this:

Were you assuming the clock would break in a specific way? Try to solve the problem now, if you have not
already.
Beware of Patterns!

The "Look for Patterns" strategy can be particularly appealing, but you have to be careful! Do not forget the "and
Explain" part of the strategy. Not all patterns are obvious, and not all of them will continue.

                                                           Problem 5 (Dots on a Circle)

    Start with a circle.

    If I put two dots on the circle and connect them, the line divides the circle into two pieces.

                                                                                        17
18 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    If I put three dots on the circle and connect each pair of dots, the lines divides the circle into four pieces.

    Suppose you put one hundred dots on a circle and connect each pair of dots, meaning every dot is
    connected to 99 other dots. How many pieces will you get? Lines may cross each other, but assume the
    points are chosen so that three or more lines never meet at a single point.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    (even if you have not solved it). What strategies did you try? What did you figure out? What questions do
    you still have?

The natural way to work on this problem is to use smaller numbers of dots and look for a pattern, right? If you
have not already, try it. How many pieces when you have four dots? Five dots? How would you describe the
pattern?

Now try six dots. You will want to draw a big circle and space out the six dots to make your counting easier. Then
carefully count up how many pieces you get. It is probably a good idea to work with a partner so you can check
each other's work. Make sure you count every piece once and do not count any piece twice. How can you be sure
that you do that?

Were you surprised? For the first several steps, it seems to be the case that when you add a dot you double the
number of pieces. But that would mean that for six dots, you should get 32 pieces, and you only get 30 or 31,
depending on how the dots are arranged. No matter what you do, you cannot get 32 pieces. The pattern simply
does not hold up.

Mathematicians love looking for patterns and finding them. We get excited by patterns. But we are also very
skeptical of patterns! If we cannot explain why a pattern would occur, then we are not willing to just believe it.

For example, if my number pattern starts out: 2, 4, 8, ... I can find lots of ways to continue the pattern, each of
which makes sense in some contexts. Here are some possibilities:

  · 2, 4, 8, 2, 4, 8, 2, 4, 8, 2, 4, 8, ...

This is a a repeating pattern, cycling through the numbers 2, 4, 8 and then starting over with 2.

  · 2, 4, 8, 32, 256, 8192, ...

To get the next number, multiply the previous two numbers together.

  · 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, ...
  · 2, 4, 8, 14, 22, 32, 44, 58, 74 ...

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

       · For the last two patterns above, describe in words how the number sequence is being created.
       · Find at least two other ways to continue the sequence 2, 4, 8, . . . that looks different from all the

          ones you have seen so far. Write your rule in words, and write the next five terms of the number
          sequence.
20 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

So how can you be sure your pattern fits the problem? You have to tie them together! Remember the "Squares on
a Chess Board" problem? You might have noticed a pattern like this one:

If the chess board has 5 squares on a side, then there are

  · 5 × 5 = 25 squares of size 1 × 1.
  · 4 × 4 = 16 squares of size 2 × 2.
  · 3 × 3 = 9 squares of side 3 × 3.
  · 2 × 2 = 4 squares of size 4 × 4.
  · 1 × 1 = 1 squares of size 5 × 5.

So there are a total of

squares on a 5 × 5 chess board. You can probably guess how to continue the pattern to any size board, but how can
you be absolutely sure the pattern continues in this way? What if this is like "Dots on a Circle," and the obvious
pattern breaks down after a few steps? You have to tie the pattern to the problem, so that it is clear why the pattern
must continue in that way.

The first step in explaining a pattern is writing it down clearly. This brings us to another problem solving strategy.

Problem Solving Strategy 11 (Use a Variable!). One of the most powerful tools we have is the use of a variable.
If you find yourself doing calculations on things like "the number of squares," or "the number of dots," give those
quantities a name! They become much easier to work with.

                                                                  Think/Pair/Share

     For now, just work on describing the pattern with variables.
       · Stick with a 5 × 5 chess board for now, and consider a small square of size k × k. Describe the
          pattern: How many squares of size k × k fit on a chess board of size 5 × 5?
       · What if the chess board is bigger? Based on the pattern above, how many squares of size k × k
          should fit on a chess board of size 10 × 10?
       · What if you do not know how big the chess board is? Based on the pattern above, how many squares
          of size k × k should fit on a chess board of size n × n?

Now comes the tough part: explaining the pattern. Let us focus on an 8 × 8 board. Since it measures 8 squares on
each side, we can see that we get 8 × 8 = 64 squares of size 1 × 1. And since there is just a single board, we get
just one square of size 8 × 8. But what about all the sizes in-between?
                  BEWARE OF PATTERNS! · 21

Think/Pair/Share

Using the Chess Board video in the previous chapter as a model, work with a partner to carefully explain
why the number of 3 × 3 squares will be 6 · 6 = 36, and why the number of 4 × 4 squares will be 5 · 5 =
25.

There are many different explanations other than what is found in the video. Try to find your own
explanation.

Here is what a final justification might look like (watch the Chess Board video as a concrete example of this
solution):

    Solution (Chess Board Pattern). Let n be the side of the chess board and let k be the side of the square. If
    the square is going to fit on the chess board at all, it must be true that k  n. Otherwise, the square is too
    big.

    If I put the k × k square in the upper left corner of the chess board, it takes up k spaces across and there
    are (n - k) spaces to the right of it. So I can slide the k × k square to the right (n - k) times, until it hits the
    top right corner of the chess board. The square is in (n - k + 1) different positions, counting the starting
    position.

    If I move the k × k square back to the upper left corner, I can shift it down one row and repeat the whole
    process again. Since there are (n - k) rows below the square, I can shift it down (n - k) times until it hits
    the bottom row. This makes (n - k + 1) total rows that the square moves across, counting the top row.
    So, there are (n - k + 1) rows with (n - k + 1) squares in each row. That makes (n - k + 1)2 total squares.
    Thus, the solution is the sum of (n - k + 1)2 for all k  n. In symbols:

Once we are sure the pattern continues, we can use it to solve the problem. So go ahead!

  · How many squares on a 10 × 10 chess board?
  · What calculation would you do to solve that problem for a 100 × 100 chess board?

There is a number pattern that describes the number of pieces you get from the "Dots on a Circle" problem. If you
want to solve the problem, go for it! Think about all of your problem solving strategies. But be sure that when you
find a pattern, you can explain why it is the right pattern for this problem, and not just another pattern that seems
to work but might not continue.

Careful Use of Language in Mathematics

This section might seem like a bit of a sidetrack from the idea of problem solving, but in fact it is not. Mathematics
is a social endeavor. We do not just solve problems and then put them aside. Problem solving has (at least) three
components:

   1. Solving the problem. This involves a lot of scratch paper and careful thinking.
   2. Convincing yourself that your solution is complete and correct. This involves a lot of self-check and asking

      yourself questions.
   3. Convincing someone else that your solution is complete and correct. This usually involves writing the

      problem up carefully or explaining your work in a presentation.
If you are not able to do that last step, then you have not really solved the problem. We will talk more about how
to write up a solution soon. Before we do that, we have to think about how mathematicians use language (which
is, it turns out, a bit different from how language is used in the rest of life).

Mathematical Statements

                                                                      Definition

    A mathematical statement is a complete sentence that is either true or false, but not both at once.

So a "statement" in mathematics cannot be a question, a command, or a matter of opinion. It is a complete,
grammatically correct sentence (with a subject, verb, and usually an object). It is important that the statement is
either true or false, though you may not know which! (Part of the work of a mathematician is figuring out which
sentences are true and which are false.)

                                                                                        28

    For each English sentence below, decide if it is a mathematical statement or not. If it is, is the statement
    true or false (or are you unsure)? If it is not a mathematical statement, in what way does it fail?

       1. Blue is the prettiest color.
       2. 60 is an even number.
       3. Is your dog friendly?
       4. Honolulu is the capital of Hawaii.
       5. This sentence is false.
       6. All roses are red.
       7. UH Manoa is the best college in the world.
       8. 1/2 = 2/4.
       9. Go to bed.
       10. There are a total of 204 squares on an 8 × 8 chess board.
    Now write three mathematical statements and three English sentences that fail to be mathematical
    statements.

Notice that "1/2 = 2/4" is a perfectly good mathematical statement. It does not look like an English sentence, but
read it out loud. The subject is "1/2." The verb is "equals." And the object is "2/4." This is a very good test when
you write mathematics: try to read it out loud. Even the equations should read naturally, like English sentences.

Statement (5) is different from the others. It is called a paradox: a statement that is self-contradictory. If it is true,
then we conclude that it is false. (Why?) If it is false, then we conclude that it is true. (Why?) Paradoxes are no
good as mathematical statements, because it cannot be true and it cannot be false.

And / or

Consider this sentence:

              After work, I will go to the beach, or I will do my grocery shopping.

In everyday English, that probably means that if I go to the beach, I will not go shopping. I will do one or the
other, but not both activities. This is called an "exclusive or."

We can usually tell from context whether a speaker means "either one or the other or both," or whether he means
"either one or the other but not both." (Some people use the awkward phrase "and/or" to describe the first option.)
30 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

Remember that in mathematical communication, though, we have to be very precise. We cannot rely on context
or assumptions about what is implied or understood.

    What is the difference between the two sentences? How does that difference affect your method to decide
    if the statement is true or false?

Some mathematical statements have this form:
  · "Every time..."
  · "For all numbers. . . "
  · "For every choice. . . "
  · "It's always true that. . . "

These are universal statements. Such statements claim that something is always true, no matter what.
  · To prove a universal statement is false, you must find an example where it fails. This is called a
      counterexample to the statement.
  · To prove a universal statement is true, you must either check every single case, or you must find a logical
      reason why it would be true. (Sometimes the first option is impossible, because there might be infinitely
      many cases to check. You would never finish!)

Some mathematical statements have this form:
  · "Sometimes..."
  · "There is some number. . . "
  · "For some choice. . . "
  · "At least once..."
32 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

These are existential statements. Such statements claim there is some example where the statement is true, but it
may not always be true.

  · To prove an existential statement is true, you may just find the example where it works.
  · To prove an existential statement is false, you must either show it fails in every single case, or you must

      find a logical reason why it cannot be true. (Sometimes the first option is impossible!)

For each statement below, do the following:

· Decide if it is a universal statement or an existential statement. (This can be tricky because in some
   statements the quantifier is "hidden" in the meaning of the words.)

· Decide if the statement is true or false, and do your best to justify your decision.

2. Every prime number is odd.

3. For all positive numbers        .

4. There is some number such that              .

5. The points (1, 1), (2, 1), and (3, 0) all lie on the same line.

6. Addition (of real numbers) is commutative.

7. Division (of real numbers) is commutative.

Look back over your work. you will probably find that some of your arguments are sound and convincing while
others are less so. In some cases you may "know" the answer but be unable to justify it. That is okay for now!
Divide your answers into four categories:

   1. I am confident that the justification I gave is good.
   2. I am not confident in the justification I gave.
   3. I am confident that the justification I gave is not good, or I could not give a justification.
   4. I could not decide if the statement was true or false.

Conditional Statements

                                                         Problem 24 (Card Logic)

You have a deck of cards where each card has a letter on one side and a number on the other side. Your
friend claims: "If a card has a vowel on one side, then it has an even number on the other side."
These cards are on a table.

    Which cards must you flip over to be certain that your friend is telling the truth?

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    After you have thought about the problem on your own for a while, discuss your ideas with a partner. Do
    you agree on which cards you must check? Try to come to agreement on an answer you both believe.

Here is another very similar problem, yet people seem to have an easier time solving this one:

                                                            Problem 25 (IDs at a Party)

    You are in charge of a party where there are young people. Some are drinking alcohol, others soft drinks.
    Some are old enough to drink alcohol legally, others are under age. You are responsible for ensuring that
    the drinking laws are not broken, so you have asked each person to put his or her photo ID on the table. At
    one table, there are four young people:

       · One person has a can of beer, another has a bottle of Coke, but their IDs happen to be face down so
          you cannot see their ages.

       · You can, however, see the IDs of the other two people. One is under the drinking age, the other is
          above it. They both have fizzy clear drinks in glasses, and you are not sure if they are drinking soda
          water or gin and tonic.
34 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    Which IDs and/or drinks do you need to check to make sure that no one is breaking the law?

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    After you have thought about the problem on your own for a while, discuss your ideas with a partner. Do
    you agree on which cards you must check? Compare these two problems. Which question is easier and
    why?

                                                                      Definition

    A conditional statement can be written in the form
                                            If some statement then some statement.

    Where the first statement is the hypothesis and the second statement is the conclusion.

    These are each conditional statements, though they are not all stated in "if/then" form. Identify the
    hypothesis of each statement. (You may want to rewrite the sentence as an equivalent "if/then" statement.)

       1. If the tomatoes are red, then they are ready to eat.
          The tomatoes are red. / The tomatoes are ready to eat.

       2. An integer n is even if it is a multiple of 2.
          n is even. / n is a multiple of 2.

       3. If n is odd, then n is prime.
          n is odd. / n is prime.

       4. The team wins when JJ plays.
          The team wins. / JJ plays.

Remember that a mathematical statement must have a definite truth value. It is either true or false, with no gray
area (even though we may not be sure which is the case). How can you tell if a conditional statement is true or
                                                                                                     CAREFUL USE OF LANGUAGE IN MATHEMATICS · 35

false? Surely, it depends on whether the hypothesis and the conclusion are true or false. But how, exactly, can you
decide?

The key is to think of a conditional statement like a promise, and ask yourself: under what condition(s) will I have
broken my promise?

                                                                      Examples

    Example 1. Here is a conditional statement:

                   If I win the lottery, then I'll give each of my students $1,000.

    There are four things that can happen:

       · True hypothesis, true conclusion: I do win the lottery, and I do give everyone in class $1,000. I
          kept my promise, so the conditional statement is TRUE.

       · True hypothesis, false conclusion: I do win the lottery, but I decide not to give everyone in class
          $1,000. I broke my promise, so the conditional statement is FALSE.

       · False hypothesis, true conclusion: I do not win the lottery, but I am exceedingly generous, so I go
          ahead and give everyone in class $1,000. I did not break my promise! (Do you see why?) So the
          conditional statement is TRUE.

       · False hypothesis, false conclusion: I do not win the lottery, so I do not give everyone in class
          $1,000. I did not break my promise! (Do you see why?) So the conditional statement is TRUE.

    What can we conclude from this? A conditional statement is false only when the hypothesis is true
    and the conclusion is false. In every other instance, the promise (as it were) has not been broken. If a
    mathematical statement is not false, it must be true.

    Example 2. Here is another conditional statement:

                   If you live in Honolulu, then you live in Hawaii.

    Is this statement true or false? It seems like it should depend on who the pronoun "you" refers to, and
    whether that person lives in Honolulu or not. Let us think it through:

       · Sookim lives in Honolulu, so the hypothesis is true. Since Honolulu is in Hawaii, she does live in
          Hawaii. The statement is true about Sookim, since both the hypothesis and conclusion are true.

       · DeeDee lives in Los Angeles. The statement is true about DeeDee since the hypothesis is false.

    So in fact it does not matter! The statement is true either way. The right way to understand such a statement
    is as a universal statement: "Everyone who lives in Honolulu lives in Hawaii."
    This statement is true, and here is how you might justify it: "Pick a random person who lives in Honolulu.
    That person lives in Hawaii (since Honolulu is in Hawaii), so the statement is true for that person. I do not
36 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    need to consider people who do not live in Honolulu. The statement is automatically true for those people,
    because the hypothesis is false!"

    Example 3. How do we show a (universal) conditional statement is false?
    You need to give a specific instance where the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false. For example:

                   If you are a good swimmer, then you are a good surfer.

    Do you know someone for whom the hypothesis is true (that person is a good swimmer) but the conclusion
    is false (the person is not a good surfer)? Then the statement is false!

                Think / Pair / Share

For each conditional statement, decide if it is true or false. Justify your answer.

1. If  then  .

2. If  then  .

3. If  then all odd numbers are prime.

4. If  then all odd numbers are prime.

5. If a number has a 4 in the one's place, then the number is even.

6. If a number is even, then the number has a 4 in the one's place.

7. If the product of two numbers is 0, then one of the numbers is 0.

8. If the sum of two numbers is 0, then one of the numbers is 0.

                                               Think / Pair / Share (Two truths and a lie)

On your own, come up with two conditional statements that are true and one that is false. Share your three
statements with a partner, but do not say which are true and which is false. See if your partner can figure it
out!
Explaining Your Work

At its heart, mathematics is a social endeavor. Even if you work on problems all by yourself, you have not really
solved the problem until you have explained your work to someone else, and they sign off on it. Professional
mathematicians write journal articles, books, and grant proposals. Teachers explain mathematical ideas to their
students both in writing and orally. Explaining your work is really an essential part of the problem-solving process,
and probably should have been Pólya's step 5.

Writing in mathematics is different from writing poetry or an English paper. The goal of mathematical writing is
not florid description, but clarity. If your reader does not understand, then you have not done a good job. Here are
some tips for good mathematical writing.

Do Not Turn in Scratch Work: When you are solving problems and not exercises, you are going to have a lot
of false starts. You are going to try a lot of things that do not work. You are going to make a lot of mistakes. You
are going to use scratch paper. At some point (hopefully!) you will scribble down an idea that actually solves the
problem. Hooray! That paper is not what you want to turn in or share with the world. Take that idea, and write it
up carefully, neatly, and clearly. (The rest of these tips apply to that write-up.)

(Re)state the Problem: Do not assume your reader knows what problem you are solving. (Even if it is the teacher
who assigned the problem!) If the problem has a very long description, you can summarize it. You do not have
rewrite it word-for-word or give all of the details, but make sure the question is clear.

Clearly Give the Answer: It is not a bad idea to state the answer right up front, then show the work to justify your
answer. That way, the reader knows what you are trying to justify as they read. It makes their job much easier,
and making the reader's job easier should be one of your primary goals! In any case, the answer should be clearly
stated somewhere in the writeup, and it should be easy to find.

Be Correct: Of course, everyone makes mistakes as they are working on a problem. But we are talking about
after you have solved the problem, when you are writing up your solution to share with someone else. The best
writing in the world cannot save a wrong approach and a wrong answer. Check your work carefully. Ask someone
else to read your solution with a critical eye.

Justify Your Answer: You cannot simply give an answer and expect your reader to "take your word for it."
You have to explain how you know your answer is correct. This means "showing your work," explaining your
reasoning, and justifying what you say. You need to answer the question, "How do you know your answer is
right?"

                                                                                        37
38 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

Be Concise: There is no bonus prize for writing a lot in math class. Think clearly and write clearly. If you find
yourself going on and on, stop, think about what you really want to say, and start over.
Use Variables and Equations: An equation can be much easier to read and understand than a long paragraph of
text describing a calculation. Mathematical writing often has a lot fewer words (and a lot more equations) than
other kinds of writing.
Define your Variables: If you use variables in the solution of your problem, always say what a variable stands
for before you use it. If you use an equation, say where it comes from and why it applies to this situation. Do not
make your reader guess!
Use Pictures: If pictures helped you solve the problem, include nice versions of those pictures in your final
solution. Even if you did not draw a picture to solve the problem, it still might help your reader understand the
solution. And that is your goal!
Use Correct Spelling and Grammar: Proofread your work. A good test is to read your work aloud (this
includes reading the equations and calculations aloud). There should be complete, natural-sounding sentences.
Be especially careful with pronouns. Avoid using "it" and "they" for mathematical objects; use the names of the
objects (or variables) instead.
Format Clearly: Do not write one long paragraph. Separate your thoughts. Put complicated equations on a single
displayed line rather than in the middle of a paragraph. Do not write too small. Do not make your reader struggle
to read and understand your work.
Acknowledge Collaborators: If you worked with someone else on solving the problem, give them credit!

You have to have the 4 in the highest place and work down from there. However unable to follow the rules
the 2 and the 1 in the 10k and 100k place must switch.

Solution (Solution 3).
41312432
First, I had to start with the #4 because that is the largest digit I could start with to get the largest #. Then
I had to place the next 4 five spaces away because I knew there had to be four digits separating the two
4's. Next, I place 1 in the second digit spot because 2 or 3 would interfere with the rule of how many
digits could separate them, which allowed me to also place where the next 1 should be. I then placed the
3 because opening spaces showed me that I could fit three digits in between the two 3's. Lastly, I had to
input the final 2's, which worked out because there were two digits separating them.

    4 needs to be the first # to make it the biggest. Then check going down from next largest to smallest. Ex:
    4 3 __________
    4 2 __________
    4 1 __________

    Solution (Solution 6).
    41312432
    I put 4 at the 10,000,000 place because the largest # should be placed at the highest value. Numbers 2 & 3
    could not be placed in the 1,000,000 place because I wasn't able to separate the digits properly. So I ended
    up placing the #1 there. In the 100,000 place I put the #3 because it was the second highest number.

    Solution (Solution 7).
    41312432
    Since the problem asks you for the largest 8 digit #, I knew 4 had to be the first # since it's the greatest
    # of the set. To solve the rest of the problem, I used the guess and test method. I tried many different
    combinations. First using the #3 as the second digit in the sequence, but came to no answer. Then the #2,
    but no combination I found correctly finished the sequence.I then finished with the #1 in the second digit
    in the sequence and was able to successfully fill out the entire #.

    Solution (Solution 8).
    4 _ _ _ _ 4 _ _
    4 has to be the first digit, for the number to be the largest possible. That means the other 4 has to be the 6th
    digit in the number, because 4's have to be separated by four digits.
    4 _ 3 _ _ 4 3 _
    3 must be the third digit, in order for the number to be largest possible. 3 cannot be the second digit because
    the other 3 would have to be the 6th digit in the number, but 4 is already there.
    4 1 3 1 _ 4 3 _
    1's must be separated by one digit, so the 1's can only be the 2nd and 4th digit in the number.

4 1 3 1 2 4 3 2
This leaves the 2s to be the 5th and 8th digits.

Solution (Solution 9).

With the active rules, I tried putting the highest numbers as far left as possible. Through trying different
combinations, I figured out that no two consecutive numbers can be touching in the first two digits. So I
instead tried starting with the 4 then 1 then 3, since I'm going for the highest # possible.

The Last Step

A lot of people -- from Polya to the writers of the Common Core State Standards and a lot of people in between
-- talk about problem solving in mathematics. One fact is rarely acknowledged, except by many professional
mathematicians: Asking good questions is as valuable (and as difficult) as solving mathematical problems.

After solving a mathematical problem and explaining your solution to someone else, it is a very good
mathematical habit to ask yourself: What other questions can I ask?

                      Example: Squares on a Chess Board

Recall Problem 3, "Squares on a Chess Board":

              How many squares of any possible size are on a standard 8 × 8 chess board? (The answer is not 64! It's
              a lot bigger!)

We have already talked about some obvious follow-up questions like "What about a 10 × 10 chess board?

Or 100 × 100? Or  ?"

But there are a lot of interesting (and less obvious . . . and harder) questions you might ask:

· How many rectangles of any size and shape can you find on a standard 8 × 8 chess board? (This is a
   lot harder, because the rectangles come in all different sizes, like 1 × 2 and 5 × 3. How could you
   possibly count them all?)

· How many triangles of any size and shape can you find in this picture?

                      42

                                                          Example: Broken Clock

Recall Problem 4, "Broken Clock":

              This clock has been broken into three pieces. If you add the numbers in each piece, the sums are
              consecutive numbers. Can you break another clock into a different number of pieces so that the sums
              are consecutive numbers?

The original problem only asks if you can find one other way. The obvious follow-up question: "Find every
possibly way to break the clock into some number of pieces so that the sums of the numbers on each piece
are consecutive numbers. Justify that you have found every possibility."

Tanton, and is used with his permission. See his development of these and other ideas at http://gdaymath.com/.
Dots and Boxes

Here are some dots; in fact there are nine of them:

We're going to a play an "exploding dots" game. Here's the only rule for the game:

                                                                    The 21 Rule

    Whenever there are two dots in single box, they "explode," disappear, and become one dot in the box to
    the left.

    We start by placing nine dots in the rightmost box.

    Two dots in that box explode and become one dot in the box to the left.

    Once again, two dots in that box explode and become one dot in the box to the left.
    We do it again!

Numbers written in the 12 code are called binary numbers or base two numbers. (The prefix "bi"
means "two.")

From now on, when we want to indicate that a number is written in base two, we will write a subscript
"two" on the number.

So  means "the number of dots that has 12 code 1001," which we already saw was nine.

Important! When we read we say "one zero zero one base two." We don't say "one thousand and one," because
"thousand" is not a binary number.

 History

  You probably realize by now that a number is an abstract concept with many representations. The standard
  decimal representation of a number is only one of these. For computers, numbers are always represented in
  binary. The basic units are transistors which are either on (1) or off (0).

     Electronic circuit board from Samsung Galaxy S III.

  A transistor1 is said to store one bit of information. Eight bits make a byte and a typical home computer's central
  processing unit performs computations on registries that are each 8 bytes (64-bits).
  Using the 12 rule we can represent the numbers 0 through 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 with 64 bits.

                                          Definition

Recall that numbers written in the 12 system are called binary or base two numbers.
Numbers written in the 13 system are called base three numbers.
Numbers written in the 14 system are called base four numbers.
Numbers written in the 110 system are called base ten numbers.
In general, numbers written in the 1b system are called base b numbers.

In a base b number system, each place represents a power of b, which means           for some whole number n.

Remember this means b multiplied by itself n times:

· The right-most place is the units or ones place. (Why is this a power of b?)

· The second spot is the "b" place. (In base ten, it's the tens place.)

· The third spot is the " " place. (In base ten, that's the hundreds place. Note that   .)

· The fourth spot is the " " place. (In base ten, that's the thousands place, since     .)

· And so on.

                                          Notation

Whenever we're dealing with numbers written in different bases, we use a subscript to indicate the base so
that there can be no confusion. So:

·             is a base three number (read it as "one-zero-two base three"). This is the base three code

   for the number eleven.

·             is a base four number (read it as "two-two-two base four"). This is the base four code for

   the number forty-two.

·             is a base ten number. (It's ok to say "fifty-four thousand three hundred and twenty-one."
   Why?)

If the base is not written, we assume it's base ten.
Remember: when you see the subscript, you are seeing the code for some number of dots.

Base b to Base Ten

We're now going to describe some general methods for converting from base b to base ten, where b can represent
any whole number bigger than one.

If the base is b, that means we're in a 1b system. A dot in the right-most box is worth 1. A dot in the second
box is worth b. A dot in the third box is worth , and so on.

So, for example, the number     represents

because we imagine three dots in the right-most box (each worth one), two dots in the second box (each
representing b dots), one dot in the third box (representing dots), and so on. That means we can just do a

and "unexploding" the dots.

Base Ten to Base b

We're now going to describe some general methods for converting from base ten to base b, where b can represent
any whole number bigger than one.

There are two general methods for doing these conversions. For each method, we'll work out an example, and
then describe the general method. The first method we describe fills in the boxes from left to right.

                                Example: Method 1 (left-to-right)

To convert  to a base five number (without actually going through the tedious process of exploding

dots in groups of five).

Find the largest power of five that is smaller than 321. We'll just list powers of five:

So we know that the left-most box we'll use is the 125 box, because 625 is too big.
How many dots will be in the 125 box? That's the same as asking how many 125's are in 321. Since

we should put two dots in the 125 box. Three dots would be too much.

How many dots are left unaccounted for?   dots are left.

Now repeat the process: The largest power of five that's less than 71 is                  . If we put two in
the 25 box, that takes care of 50 dots. (Three dots would be 75, which is too much.)
                                                                                  OTHER BASES · 65

So far we have two dots in the box and two dots in the box, so that's a total of

We have     dots left to account for.

Repeat the process again: The biggest power of 5 that's less than 21 is 5. How many dots can go in the 5

box?     , so we can put four dots in the 5 box.

We have one dot left to account for. If we put one dot in the 1 box, we're done.

So       .

The general algorithm to convert from base ten to base :

1. Start with your base ten number n. Find the largest power of b that's less than n, say that power is .

2. Figure out how many dots can go in the  box without going over n. Say that number is a. Put the
   digit a in the box, and then subtract            to figure out how many dots are left.

3. If your number is now zero, you've accounted for all the dots. Put zeros in any boxes that remain, and you
   have the number. Otherwise, start over at step (1) with the number of dots you have left.

The method is a little tricky to describe in complete generality. It's probably better to try a few examples on your
own to get the hang of it.

Use the method above to convert       Think / Pair / Share

66 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

Here's another method to convert base ten numbers to another base, and this method fills in the digits from right
to left. Again, we'll start with an example and then describe the general method.

                                 Example: Method 2 (right-to-left)

To convert  to a base seven number, imagine there are 712 dots in the ones box. We'll write the

number, but imagine it as dots.

Find out how many groups of 7 you can make, and how many dots would be left over.
That means we have 101 groups of 7 dots, with 5 dots left over.
"Explode" the groups of 7 one box to the left, and leave the 5 dots behind.

Now repeat the process: How many groups of 7 can you make from the 101 dots?
"Explode" the groups of 7 one box to the left, and leave the 3 dots behind.

Repeat:
"Explode" the groups of 7 one box to the left, and leave 0 dots behind.

Since there are fewer than 7 dots in each box, we're done.
                                                                                                                                                 OTHER BASES · 67

Of course, we can (and should!) check our calculation by converting the answer back to base ten:

So here's a second general method for converting base ten numbers to an arbitrary base b:

   1. Divide the base ten number by b to get a quotient and a remainder.
   2. Put the remainder in the right-most space in the base b number.
   3. If the quotient is less than b, it goes in the space one spot to the left. Otherwise, go back to step (1) and

      repeat it with the quotient, filling in the remainders from right to left in the base number.

Again, the method probably makes more sense if you try it out a few times.

                                           Think / Pair / Share

Use the method described above to convert  to base three, four, five, and six.

Base ten numbers (the ones you have probably been using your whole life), and base b numbers (the ones you've
been learning about in this chapter) are both positional number systems.

                                                                      Definition

    A positional number system is one way of writing numbers. It has unique symbols for 1 through b - 1,
    where b is the base of the system. Modern positional number systems also include a symbol for 0.
    The positional value of each symbol depends on its position in the number:

       · The positional value of a symbol in the first position is just its face value.
       · The positional value of a symbol in the second position is b times its value.
       · The positional value of a symbol in the third position is times its value.
       · And so on.
    The value of a number is the sum of the positional values of its digits.

In an additive number system, the value of a written number is the sum of the face values of the symbols

So the number 2013 would be represented as MMXIII. This is read as 2,000 (two M's), one ten (one X), and three
ones (three I's).

For any additive number system very large numbers become impractical to write. To represent the number one
million in Roman numerals it would take one thousand M's!

However, the Roman numerals did have one efficiency advantage: The order of the symbols mattered. If a symbol
to the left was smaller than the symbol to the right, it would be subtracted instead of added. So for example nine
is represented as IX rather than VIIII.

  The earliest positional number systems are attributed to the Babylonians (base 60) and the Mayans (base 20).
  These positional systems were both developed before they had a symbol or a clear concept for zero. Instead of
  using 0, a blank space was used to indicate skipping a particular place value. This could lead to ambiguity.
  Suppose we didn't have a symbol for 0, and someone wrote the number
  It would be impossible to tell if they mean 23, 203, 2003, or maybe two separate numbers (two and three).

      Leonardo Pisano Bigollo, more commonly known as Fibonacci4, played a pivotal role in guiding Europe
      out of a long period in which the importance and development of math was in marked decline. He was
      born in Italy around 1170 CE to Guglielmo Bonacci, a successful merchant. Guglielmo brought his son
      with him to what is now Algeria, and Leonardo was educated in mathematics mathematics there.

      At the time, Roman Numerals dominated Europe, and the official means of calculations was the abacus.
      Muammad ibn Ms al-Khwrizm5 described the use of Hindu-Arabic system in his book On the
      Calculation with Hindu Numerals in 825 CE, but it was not well-known in Europe.

History: Hawaiian numbers

The Hindu-Arabic number system is now used nearly exclusively throughout the globe. But many cultures
had their own number systems before contact and trade with other countries spread the work of al-Khwrizm
throughout the world.
There is evidence that pre-contact Hawaiians actually used two different number systems. Depending on what
they were counting, they might use base 4 instead (or a mixed base-10 and base-4 system). One theory is that
certain objects (fish, taro, etc.) were often put in bundles of 4, so were more natural to count by 4's than by 10's.
The number four also had spiritual significance in Hawaiian culture.

In the mixed base system, instead of powers of 10, numbers are broken down into sums of numbers that look like
4 times a power of 10 (40, 400, 4000, etc.).

Even Numbers

How do we know if a number is even? What does it mean?

    Some number of dots is even if I can divide the dots into pairs, and every dot has a partner.
    Some number of dots is odd if, when I try to pair up the dots, I always have a single dot left over with no
    partner.

The number of dots is either even or odd. It's a property of the quantity and is doesn't change when you represent
that quantity in different bases.

                                                                     Problem 13

You know that you can tell if a base ten number is even just by looking at the ones place. But why is that true?
That's not the definition of an even number. There are a few key ideas behind this handy trick:

  · In base ten, every number looks like
                                              (some multiple of ten) + (ones digit)

  · Every multiple of ten is an even number, since

      and two times a whole number is always even.
  · Your whole number looks like this:

                                                 (some multiple of ten) + (ones digit)
                                                     (even number) + (ones digit),

  · Even plus even is even, and even plus odd is odd, so your whole number is even when the ones digit is
      even, and it's odd when the ones digit is odd.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

       · Make sure you understand the explanation above. Does each piece make sense to you?
       · In particular: Use the definition of even and odd above to explain the last step. Why is it true that

          even + even = even and even + odd = odd?
       · What about odd + odd? Is that odd or even? Justify what you say.

                                                                     Problem 14

true, you can often work it out using the model -- this might mean drawing pictures, using physical materials
(manipulatives), or just thinking about the model to help you reason out the answer.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    Write down your mental models for each of the four basic operations. What do they actually mean? How
    would you explain them to a second grader? What pictures could you draw for each operation? Think about
    each one separately, as well as how they relate to each other:

       · addition
       · subtraction
       · multiplication, and
       · division.
    After writing down you own ideas, share them with a partner. Do you and your partner have the same
    models for each of the operations or do you think about them differently?

Teachers should have lots of mental models -- lots of ways to explain the same concept. In this chapter, we'll
look at some different ways to understand the four basic arithmetic operations. First, let's define some terms:

                                                                      Definition

    Counting numbers are literally the numbers we use for counting: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... These are sometimes
    called the natural numbers by mathematicians, and they are represented by the symbol .
    Whole numbers are the counting numbers together with zero.
    Integers include the positive and negative whole numbers, and mathematicians represent these with the
    symbol . (This comes from German, where the word for "number" is "zählen.")

                                                                                        91
92 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

We already have a natural model for thinking about counting numbers: a number is a quantity of dots. Depending
on which number system you use -- Roman numerals, base ten, binary, etc. -- you might write down the number
in different ways. But the quantity of dots is a counting number, however you write it down.
Addition: Dots and Boxes

Addition as combining

For now, we'll focus on the base-10 system. Here's how we think about the number 273 in that system:

And here is the number 512:

                                                                 Example: 273+512

    We can add these in the natural way: just combine the piles of dots. Since they're already in place-value
    columns, we can combine dots from the two numbers that are in the same place-value box.

    We can count up the answer: there are 7 dots in the hundreds box, 8 dots in the tens box, and 5 dots in the
    ones box.

                                                                                        93
94 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    And saying out the long way we have:
       · Two hundreds plus five hundreds gives 7 hundreds.
       · Seven tens plus one ten gives 8 tens.
       · Three ones plus two ones gives 5 ones.

    This gives the answer: 785.

                                                                 Example: 163+489

    Let's do another one. Consider 163+489.
                                                                                                                           ADDITION: DOTS AND BOXES · 95

And this is absolutely correct:
  · One hundred plus four hundreds is 5 hundreds.
  · Six tens plus eight tens is 14 tens.
  · Three ones plus nine ones is 12 ones.

The answer is 5 | 14 | 12, which we might try to pronounce as "five hundred and fourteeny-tenty twelvety."
The trouble with this answer is that most of the rest of the world wouldn't understand what we are talking
about.
Since this is a base 10 system, we can do some explosions.

The answer is "six hundred fifty two." Okay, the world can understand this one!

Problem 1

Use the dots and boxes technique to solve these problems. Do not covert to base 10! Try to work directly
in the base given. It might help to actually draw the pictures.

The Standard Algorithm for Addition

Let's go back to the example 163+489. Some teachers don't like writing:

They prefer to teach their students to start with the 3 and 9 at the end and sum those to get 12. This is of course
correct -- we got 12 as well.

But they don't want students to write or think "twelvety," so they have their students write something like this:
98 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

This can seem completely mysterious. What's really going on? They are exploding ten dots, of course!

Now we carry on with the problem and add the tens. Students are taught to write:
But what this means is better shown in this next picture. Notice the "exploded" (or regrouped) dot at the very top,
which is added to the tens box in the answer.

And now we finish the problem by combining the dots in the hundreds boxes:
                                                                                                                                 ADDITION: DOTS AND BOXES · 99

In the standard algorithm, we work from right to left, doing the "explosions" as we go along. This means that
we start adding at the ones place and work towards the left-most place value, "carrying" digits that come from
the explosions. (This is really not carrying; a better term for it is regrouping. Ten ones become one ten. Ten tens
become one hundred. And so on.)
In the dots and boxes method, we add in any direction or order we like and then we do the explosions at the end.

  · Why do we like the standard algorithm? Because it is efficient.
  · Why do we like the dots and boxes method? Because it is easy to understand.
Subtraction: Dots and Boxes

Subtraction as Take-Away

To model addition, we started with two collections of dots (two numbers), and we combined them to form
one bigger collection. That's pretty much the definition of addition: combining two collections of objects. In
subtraction, we start with one collection of dots (one number), and we take some dots away.

                                                                Example: 376 - 125

    Suppose we want to find 376-125 in the dots and boxes model. We start with the representation of 376:

    Since we want to "take away" 125, that means:
       · We take away one dot from the hundreds box, leaving two dots.
       · We take away two dots from the tens box, leaving five dots.
       · And we take away five dots from the ones box, leaving one dot.

    So the answer is:

    And saying it out the long way we have:

                                                                                       100
                                                           SUBTRACTION: DOTS AND BOXES · 101

· Three hundreds take away one hundred leaves 2 hundreds.
· Seven tens take away two tens gives 5 tens.
· Six ones take away five ones gives 1 one.

                                                           Example: 921 - 551

Let's try a somewhat harder example: 921-551. We start with the representation of 921:

Since we want to "take away" 551, that means we take away five dots from the hundreds box, leaving four
dots.

Now we want to take away five dots from the tens box, but we can't do it! There are only two dots there.
What can we do? Well, we still have some hundreds, so we can "unexplode" a hundreds dot, and put ten
dots in the tens box instead. Then we'll be able to take five of them away, leaving seven.
102 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    (Notice that we also have one less dot in the hundreds box; there's only three dots there now.)
    Now we want to take one dot from the ones box, and that leaves no dots there.
    So the answer is:

Solve the following exercises by thinking about dots and boxes. (You can draw pictures, or just imagine

    Use the dots and boxes technique to solve these problems. Do not covert to base 10! Try to work directly
    in the base given. It might help to actually draw the pictures.

The Standard Algorithm for Subtraction

Just like in addition, the standard algorithm for subtraction requires you to work from right to left, and "borrow"
(this is really regrouping!) whenever necessary. Notice that in the dots and boxes approach, you don't need to go
in any particular order when you do the subtraction. You just "unexplode" the dots as necessary when computing.
Here's how the standard algorithm looks with the dots and boxes model for 921 - 551: Start with 921 dots.

Then take away one dot from the ones box.
104 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

Now we want to take away five dots from the tens box. But there aren't five dots there. So we "unexplode" one
of the hundreds dots to get more tens:

In the standard algorithm, we show the unxplosion as a regrouping, subtracting one from the hundreds place of
921 and adding ten to the tens place. So we are rewriting

Finally, we want to take away five from the eight dots left in the hundreds column.

Multiplication as Repeated Addition

Jenny was asked to compute                  Problem 3

1. What was Jenny thinking about? Is her answer correct?

2. Translate Jenny's answer into a number that the rest of the world can understand.

3. Use Jenny's method to find the answers to these multiplication exercises. Be sure to translate your
   answers into familiar base 10 numbers.

Can you adapt Jenny's method to solve these problems? Write your answers in base eight. Try to work
directly in base eight rather than converting to base 10 and back again!

Jenny might have been thinking about multiplication as repeated addition. If we have some number  and we
multiply that number by 4, what we mean is:

                                     106

If we take the number 243192 and add it to itself four times using the "combining method," we get
  · 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 ones,
  · 9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36 tens,
  · 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 hundreds,
  · and so on.

                                                                       Notation

    Notice that we have used both × and · to represent multiplication. It's a bit awkward to use × when you're
    also using variables. Is it the letter x? Or the multiplication symbol ×? It can be hard to tell! In this case,
    the symbol · is more clear.
    We can even simplify the notation further, writing 4N instead of 4 · N. But of course we only do that when
    we are multiplying variables by some quantity. (We wouldn't want 34 to mean 3 · 4, would we?)

                                                                      Problem 5

Quotative Model of Division

Suppose you are asked to compute 3906 ÷ 3. One way to interpret this question (there are others) is:
"How many groups of 3 fit into 3906?"

                                                                      Definition

    In the quotative model of division, you are given a dividend (here it is 3906), and you are asked to split
    it into equal-sized groups, where the size of the group is given by the divisor (here it is 3).
In our dots and boxes model, the dividend 3906 looks like this:

and three dots looks like this:
So we are really asking:

"How many groups of                   fit into the picture of 3906?"

                                 Example: 3906 ÷ 3

There is one group of 3 at the thousands level, and three at the hundreds level, none at the tens level, and
two at the ones level.

    Notice what we have in the picture:
    · One group of 3 in the thousands box.
    · Three groups of 3 in the hundreds box.
    · Zero groups of 3 in the tens box.
    · Two groups of 3 in the ones box.
    This shows that 3 goes into 3906 one thousand, three hundreds and two ones times. That is,
Let's try a harder one! Consider 402 ÷ 3. Here's the picture:

Let's turn up the difficulty a notch. Consider 156 ÷ 12. Here we are looking for groups of 12 in this picture:

What does 12 look like? It can be twelve dots in a single box:

But most often we would write 12 this way, as a ten and 2 ones:

We certainly see some of these in the picture. There is certainly one at the tens level:

Note: With an unexplosion this would be twelve dots in the tens box, so we mark one group of 12 above
the tens box.

We also see three groups of twelve ones:
112 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

So in the picture we have:
· One group of 12 dots in the tens box.
· Three groups of 12 dots in the ones box.
That means

114 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

At first glance this seems very mysterious, but it is really no different from the dots and boxes method. Here is
what the table means.
To compute 402 ÷ 3, we first make a big estimation as to how many groups of 3 there are in 402. Let's guess that
there are 100 groups of three.

How much is left over after taking away 100 groups of 3? We subtract to find that there is 102 left.

How many groups of 3 are in 102? Let's try 30:
                                                                            DIVISION: DOTS AND BOXES · 115

How many are left? There are 12 left and there are four groups of 3 in 12.

That accounts for entire number 402. And where do we find the final answer? Just add the total count of groups
of three that we tallied:

                                                  402 ÷ 3 = 100 + 30 + 4 = 134.

Division with Remainders

We saw that 402 is evenly divisible by 3: 402 ÷ 3 = 134. This means that 403, one more, shouldn't be divisible
by three. It should be one dot too big.

Yes we do! We have one dot left at the end that can't be divided. This is how it looks in the standard
algorithm.

But what does that really mean? It means that we have 134 groups of three with one dot left over. So

Number Line Model

Another way we often think about numbers is as abstract quantities that can be measured: length, area, and volume
are all examples.
In a measurement model, you have to pick a basic unit. The basic unit is a quantity -- length, area, or volume --
that you assign to the number one. You can then assign numbers to other quantities based on how many of your
basic unit fit inside.
For now, we'll focus on the quantity length, and we'll work with a number line where the basic unit is already
marked off.

Addition and Subtraction on the Number Line

Imagine a person -- we'll call him Zed -- who can stand on the number line. We'll say that the distance Zed
walks when he takes a step is exactly one unit.

When Zed wants to add or subtract with whole numbers on the number line, he always starts at 0 and faces the
positive direction (towards 1). Then what he does depends on the calculation.
If Zed wants to add two numbers, he walks forward (to the right of the number line) however many steps are
indicated by the first number (the first addend). Then he walks forward (to your right on the number line) the

                                                                                       120
                                                                                                                                         NUMBER LINE MODEL · 121

number of steps indicated by the second number (the second addend). Where he lands is the sum of the two
numbers.

                                                                   Example: 3 + 4

    If Zed wants to add 3 + 4, he starts at 0 and faces towards the positive numbers. He walks forward 3 steps,
    then he walks forward 4 more steps.
    Zed ends at the number 7, so the sum of 3 and 4 is 7. 3 + 4 = 7. (But you knew that of course! The point
    right now is to make sense of the number line model.)

When Zed wants to subtract two numbers, he he walks forward (to the right on the number line) however many
steps are indicated by the first number (the minuend). Then he walks backwards (to the left on the number line)
the number of steps indicated by the second number (the subtrahend). Where he lands is the difference of the two
numbers.

                                                                  Example: 11 - 3

    If Zed wants to subtract 11 - 3, he starts at 0 and faces the positive numbers (the right side of the number
    line). He walks forward 11 steps on the number line, then he walks backwards 3 steps.
    Zed ends at the number 8, so the difference of 11 and 3 is 8. 11 - 3 = 8. (But you knew that!)

Multiplication and Division on the Number Line

Since multiplication is really repeated addition, we can adapt our addition model to become a multiplication model
as well. Let's think about 3 × 4. This means to add four to itself three times (that's simply the definition of
multiplication!):

                                                          3 × 4 = 4 + 4 + 4.

So to multiply on the number line, we do the process for addition several times.
                                                                                                                                         NUMBER LINE MODEL · 123

To multiply two numbers, Zed starts at 0 as always, and he faces the positive direction. He walks forward the
number of steps given by the second number (the second factor). He repeats that process the number of times
given by the first number (the first factor). Where he lands is the product of the two numbers.

                                                                   Example: 3 × 4

    If Zed wants to multiply 3 × 4, he can think of it this way:

    Zed starts at 0, facing the positive direction. The he repeats this three times: take four steps forward.
    He ends at the number 12, so the product of 3 and 4 is 12. That is, 3 × 4 = 12.

Remember our quotative model of division: One way to interpret 15 ÷ 5 is:

              How many groups of 5 fit into 15?

Thinking on the number line, we can ask it this way:

              Zed takes 5 steps at a time. If Zed lands at the number 15, how many times did he take 5 steps?

To calculate a division problem on the number line, Zed starts at 0, facing the positive direction. He walks
forward the number of steps given by the second number (the divisor). He repeats that process until he lands
124 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

at the first number (the dividend). The number of times he repeated the process gives the quotient of the two
numbers.

                                                                  Example: 15 ÷ 5

    If Zed wants to compute 15 ÷ 5, he can think of it this way:
    He starts at 0, facing the positive direction.

       · Zed takes 5 steps forward. He is now at 5, not 15. So he needs to repeat the process.
       · Zed takes 5 steps forward again. He is now at 10, not 15. So he needs to repeat the process.
       · Zed takes 5 more steps forward. He is at 15, so he stops.
    Since he repeated the process three times, we see there are 3 groups of 5 in 15. So the quotient of 15 and
    5 is 3. That is, 15 ÷ 5 = 3.

Area Model for Multiplication

So far we have focused on a linear measurement model, using the number line. But there's another common way
to think about multiplication: using area.
For example, suppose our basic unit is one square:

We can picture 4 × 3 as 4 groups, with 3 squares in each group, all lined up:
But we can also picture them stacked up instead of lined up. We would have 4 rows, with 3 squares in each row,
like this:

                                                                                       126
                                                                                                                     AREA MODEL FOR MULTIPLICATION · 127

So we can think about 4 × 3 as a rectangle that has length 3 and width 4. The product, 12, is the total number of
squares in that rectangle. (That is also the area of the rectangle, since each square was one unit!)

Here's an unusual way to perform multiplication. To compute 22 × 13, for example, draw two sets of vertical
lines, the left set containing two lines and the right set two lines (for the digits in 22) and two sets of horizontal
lines, the upper set containing one line and the lower set three (for the digits in 13).

       4. Why does the method work in general?

Lattice Multiplication

In the 1500s in England, students were taught to compute multiplication using following galley method, now more
commonly known as the lattice method.
To multiply 43 and 218, for example, draw a 2 × 3 grid of squares. Write the digits of the first number along the
right side of the grid and the digits of the second number along the top.
Divide each cell of the grid diagonally and write in the product of the column digit and row digit of that cell,
separating the tens from the units across the diagonal of that cell. (If the product is a one digit answer, place a 0 in
the tens place.)
                                                                                                                     AREA MODEL FOR MULTIPLICATION · 131

To get the answer, add the entries in each diagonal, carrying tens digits over to the next diagonal if necessary. In
our example, we have

                                                                     Problem 10

Properties of Operations

So far, you have seen a couple of different models for the operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division. But we haven't talked much about the operations themselves -- how they relate to each other, what
properties they have that make computing easier, and how some special numbers behave. There's lots to think
about!

The goal in this section is to use the models to understand why the operations behave according to the rules you
learned back in elementary school. We're going to keep asking ourselves "Why does it work this way?"

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    Each of these models lends itself to thinking about the operation in a slightly different way. Before we
    really dig in to thinking about the operations, discuss with a partner:

       · Of the models we discussed so far, do you prefer one of them?
       · How well do the models we discussed match up with how you usually think about whole numbers

          and their operations?
       · Which models are useful for computing? Why?
       · Which models do you think will be useful for explaining how the operations work? Why?

Connections Between the Operations

We defined addition as combining two quantities and subtraction as "taking away." But in fact, these two
operations are intimately tied together. These two questions are exactly the same:

27 - 13 = ____                           27 = 13 + _____.

More generally, for any three whole numbers a, b, and c, these two equations express the same fact. (So either
both equations are true or both are false. Which is the case depends on the values you choose for a, b, and c!)

c - b = a                                c = a + b.

How does an addition table help you solve subtraction problems?

We defined multiplication as repeated addition and division as forming groups of equal size. But in fact, these

both equations are true or both are false. Which is the case depends on the values you choose for a, b, and c!)

Arithmetic Fact: a + b = c and c - b = a are the same mathematical fact.
Why is this not a good explanation?

      "I can check that this is true! For example, 2+3 = 5 and 5 - 3 = 2. And 3 + 7 = 10 and 10 - 7 = 3. It
      works for whatever numbers you try."

                                                Addition and Subtraction: Explanation 1

Arithmetic Fact:

a + b = c and c - b = a are the same mathematical fact.

Why It's True, Explanation 1:

First we'll use the definition of the operations.
Suppose we know c - b = a is true. Subtraction means "take away." So

                                                          c - b = a
means we start with quantity c and take away quantity b, and we end up with quantity a. Start with this
equation, and imagine adding quantity b to both sides.
On the left, that mans we started with quantity c, took away b things, and then put those b things right
back! Since we took away some quantity and then added back the exact same quantity, there's no overall
change. We're left with quantity c.
On the right, we would be combining (adding) quantity a with quantity b. So we end up with: c = a + b.

On the other hand, suppose we know the equation a + b = c is true. Imagine taking away (subtracting)
quantity b from both sides of this equation: a + b = c.
On the left, we started with a things and combined that with b things, but then we immediately take away
those b things. So we're left with just our original quantity of a.
On the right, we start with quantity c and take away b things. That's the very definition of c - b. So we
have the equation:

                                                          a = c - b.
136 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    Why It's True, Explanation 2:
    Let's use the measurement model to come up with another explanation.
    The equation a + b = c means Zed starts at 0, walks forward a steps, and then walks forward b steps, and
    he ends at c.
    If Zed wants to compute c - b, he starts at 0, walks forward c steps, and then walks backwards b steps. But
    we know that to walk forward c steps, he can first walk forward a steps and then walk forward b steps. So
    Zed can compute c - b this way:

       · Start at 0.
       · Walk forward a steps.
       · Walk forward b steps. (Now at c, since a + b = c.)

On the other hand, the equation c - b = a means that Zed starts at 0, walks forward c steps, then walks
backwards b steps, and he ends up at a.
If Zed wants to compute a + b, he starts at 0, walks forward a steps, and then walks forwards b additional
steps. But we know that to walk forward a steps, he can first walk forward c steps and then walk backwards
b steps. So Zed can compute a + b this way:

  · Start at 0.
  · Walk forward c steps.
  · Walk backwards b steps. (Now at a, since c - b = a.)
  · Walk forward b steps.
The last two sets of steps cancel each other out, so Zed lands back at c. That means a + b = c.

Properties of Addition and Subtraction

You probably know several properties of addition, but you may never have stopped to wonder: Why is that
true?! Now's your chance! In this section, you'll use the definition of the operations of addition and subtraction
and the models you've learned to explain why these properties are always true.
Here are the three properties you'll think about:

  · Addition of whole numbers is commutative.
  · Addition of whole numbers is associative.
  · The number 0 is an identity for addition of whole numbers.

For each of the properties, we don't want to confuse these three ideas:
  · what the property is called and what it means (the definition),
  · some examples that demonstrate the property, and
  · an explanation for why the property holds.

Notice that examples and explanations are not the same! It's also very important not to confuse the definition of a
property with the reason it is true!
These properties are all universal statements -- statements of the form "for all," "every time," "always," etc. That
means that to show they are true, you either have to check every case or find a reason why it must be so.
Since there are infinitely many whole numbers, it's impossible to check every case. You'd never finish! Our only
hope is to look for general explanations. We'll work out the explanation for the first of these facts, and you will
work on the others.
Addition is Commutative                                                                    PROPERTIES OF OPERATIONS · 139

                                    Example: Commutative Law

Property:
Addition of whole numbers is commutative.

What it Means (words):
When I add two whole numbers, the order I add them doesn't affect the sum.

What it Means (symbols):
For any two whole numbers a and b,

                                           a + b = b + a.
140 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    Now we need a justification. Why is addition of whole numbers commutative?
    Why It's True, Explanation 1:
    Let's think about addition as combining two quantities of dots.

       · To add a + b, we take a dots and b dots, and we combine them in a box. To keep things straight, lets
          imagine the a dots are colored red and the b dots are colored blue. So in the box we have a red dots,
                                                                                                                              PROPERTIES OF OPERATIONS · 141

          b blue dots and a + b total dots.
       · To add b + a, let's take b blue dots and a red dots, and put them all together in a box. We have b blue

          dots, a red dots and b + a total dots.
       · But the total number of dots are the same in the two boxes! How do we know that? Well, there are a

          red dots in each box, so we can match them up. There are b blue dots in each box, so we can match
          them up. That's it! If we can match up the dots one-for-one, there must be the same number of them!
    · That means a + b = b + a.

    Why It's True, Explanation 2:
    We can also use the measurement model to explain why a + b = b + a no matter what numbers we choose
    for a and b. Imagine taking a segment of length a and combining it linearly with a segment of length b.
    That's how we get a length of a + b.

    But if we just rotate that segment so it's upside down, we see that we have a segment of length b combined
    with a segment of length a, which makes a length of b + a.

    But of course it's the same segment! We just turned it upside down! So the lengths must be the same. That
    is, a + b = b + a.

Addition is Associative

Your turn! You'll answer the question, "Why is addition of whole numbers associative?"
Property: Addition of whole numbers is associative.
What it Means (words): When I add three whole numbers in a given order, the way I group them (to add two at
a time) doesn't affect the sum.
What it Means (symbols): For any three whole numbers a, b, and c,

                                                     (a + b) + c = a + (b + c).

                                                                     Problem 14

       1. Come up with at least three examples to demonstrate associativity of addition.
       2. Use our models of addition to come up with an explanation. Why does associativity hold in every
142 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

          case? Note: your explanation should not use specific numbers. It is not an example!

0 is an Identity for Addition
Property: The number 0 is an identity for addition of whole numbers.

What it Means (words): When I add any whole number to 0 (in either order), the sum is the very same whole
number I added to 0.
What it Means (symbols): For any whole numbers n,

                                                  n + 0 = n and 0 + n = n.

                                                                     Problem 15

       1. Come up with at least three examples to demonstrate that 0 is an identity for addition.
       2. Use our models of addition to come up with an explanation. Why does this property of 0 hold in

          every possible case?

Properties of Subtraction

Since addition and subtraction are so closely linked, it's natural to wonder if subtraction has some of the same
properties as addition, like commutativity and associativity.

                                                     Example: Is subtraction commutative?

    Justin asked if the operation of subtraction is commutative. That would mean that the difference of two
    whole numbers doesn't depend on the order in which you subtract them.
    In symbols: for every choice of whole numbers a and b we would have a - b = b - a.

    Jared says that subtraction is not commutative since 4 - 3 = 1, but 3 - 4  1. (In fact, 3 - 4 = -1.)

    Since the statement "subtraction is commutative" is a universal statement, one counterexample is enough
    to show it's not true. So Jared's counterexample lets us say with confidence:
    Subtraction is not commutative.
                                                                                                                              PROPERTIES OF OPERATIONS · 143

Properties of Multiplication and Division

Now we're going to turn our attention to familiar properties of multiplication and division, with the focus still on
explaining why these properties are always true.
Here are the four properties you'll think about:

  · Multiplication of whole numbers is commutative.
  · Multiplication of whole numbers is associative.
  · Multiplication of whole numbers distributes over addition
  · The number 1 is an identity for multiplication of whole numbers
144 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

For each of the properties, remember to keep straight:
  · what the property is called and what it means (the definition),
  · some examples that demonstrate the property, and
  · an explanation for why the property holds.

Once again, it's important to distinguish between examples and explanations. They are not the same! Since there
are infinitely many whole numbers, it's impossible to check every case, so examples will never be enough to
explain why these properties hold. You have to figure out reasons for these properties to hold, based on what you
know about the operations.

1 is an Identity for Multiplication

We'll work out the explanation for the last of these facts, and you will work on the others.

                                                   Example: 1 is an Identity for multiplication

Property:
The number 1 is an identity for multiplication of whole numbers.

What it Means (words):
When I multiply a number by 1 (in either order), the product is that number.

What it Means (symbols):
For any whole number m,

                          m × 1 = m and 1 × m = m.

Examples:

                          1 × 5 = 5,  19 × 1 = 19,  and 1 × 1 = 1.

Why does the number 1 act this way with multiplication?

Why It's True, Explanation 1:
Let's think first about the definition of multiplication as repeated addition:

  · m × 1 means to add the number one to itself m times:
                                                                                                                        PROPERTIES OF OPERATIONS · 145

      So we see that m × 1 = m for any whole number m.
  · On the other hand, 1 × m means to add the number m to itself just one time. So 1 × m = m also.
Why It's True, Explanation 2:
We can also use the number line model to create a justification. If Zed calculates 1×m, he will start at 0 and
face the positive direction. He will then take m steps forward, and he will do it just one time. So he lands
at m, which means 1 × m = m.
If Zed calculates m × 1, he starts at 0 and faces the positive direction. Then he takes one step forward, and
he repeats that m times. So he lands at m. We see that m × 1 = m.
Why It's True, Explanation 3:
In the area model, m × 1 represents m rows with one square in each row. That makes a total of m squares.
So m × 1 = m.

Similarly, 1 × m represents one row of m squares. That's also a total of m squares. So 1 × m = m.

    The example presented several different explanations. Do you think one is more convincing than the
    others? Or more clear and easier to understand?

Multiplication is Commutative
Property: Multiplication whole numbers is commutative.

What it Means (words): When I multiply two whole numbers, switching the order in which I multiply them
does not affect the product.
What it Means (symbols): For any two whole numbers a and b,

                                                             a · b = b · a.

                                                                     Problem 18

          every case? Note: Your explanation should not use particular numbers. It is not an example!

Multiplication is Associative
Property: Multiplication of whole numbers is associative.

What it Means (words): When I multiply three whole numbers in a given order, the way I group them (to
multiply two at a time) doesn't affect the product.

every case?

Multiplication Distributes over Addition

Property: Multiplication distributes over addition.

What it means: The distributive law for multiplication over addition is a little hard to state in words, so we'll
jump straight to the symbols. For any three whole numbers x, y, and z:

                                                      x · (y + z) = x · y + x · z.

Examples: We actually did calculations very much like the examples above, when we looked at the area model
for multiplication.

8 · (23) = 8 · (20 + 3) = 8 · 20 + 8 · 3 = 160 + 24 = 184

5 · (108) = 5 · (100 + 8) = 5 · 100 + 5 · 8 = 500 + 40 = 540

Properties of Division

It's natural to wonder which, if any, of these properties also hold for division (since you know that the operations
of multiplication and division are connected).

                                                        Example: Is Division Associative?

    If division were associative, then for any choice of three whole numbers a, b, and c, we would have
                                                     a ÷ (b ÷ c) = (a ÷ b) ÷ c.

    Remember, the parentheses tell you which two numbers to divide first.
    Let's try the example a = 9, b = 3, and c = 1. Then we have:

                                                       9 ÷ (3 ÷ 1) = 9 ÷ 3 = 3
                                                                  and

                                                       (9 ÷ 3) ÷ 1 = 3 ÷ 1 = 3.
    So is it true? Is division associative? Well, we can't be sure. This is just one example. But "division is
    associative" is a universal statement. If it's true, it has to work for every possible example. Maybe we just
    stumbled on a good choice of numbers, but it won't always work.

    Let's keep looking. Try a = 16, b = 4, and c = 2.
                                                     16 ÷ (4 ÷ 2) = 16 ÷ 2 = 8
                                                                  and
                                                     (16 ÷ 4) ÷ 2 = 4 ÷ 2 = 2.

    That's all we need! A single counterexample lets us conclude:
    Division is not associative.

What about the other properties? It's your turn to decide!

Going Deeper with Division

So far we've been thinking about division in what's called the quotative model. In the quotative model, we want
to make groups of equal size. We know the size of the group, and we ask how many groups. For example, we
think of 20 ÷ 4 as:

How many groups of 4 are there in a group of 20?

Thinking about four fact families, however, we realize we can turn the question around a bit. We could think about
the partitive model of division. In the partitive model, we want to make an equal number of groups. We know
how many groups, and we ask the size of the group. In the partitive model, we think of 20 ÷ 4 as:

20 is 4 groups of what size?
                                                                                                                              PROPERTIES OF OPERATIONS · 155

When we know the original amount and the number of parts, we use partitive division to find the size of each part.
When we know the original amount and the size of each part, we use quotative division to find the number of
parts.

    Write your own word problems: Write one partitive division problem and one quotative division problem.
    Choose your numbers carefully so that the answer works out nicely. Be sure to solve your problems!

Why think about these two models for division? You won't be teaching the words partitive and quotative to your
students. But recognizing the two kinds of division problems (and being able to come up with examples of each)
will make you a better teacher.
It's important that your students are exposed to both ways of thinking about division, and to problems of both
types. Otherwise, they may think about division too narrowly and not really understand what's going on. If you
understand the two kinds of problems, you can more easily diagnose and remedy students' difficulties.
Most of the division problems we've looked at so far have come out evenly, with no remainder. But of course, that
doesn't always happen! Sometimes, a whole number answer makes sense, and the context of the problem should
tell you which whole number is the right one to choose.

                                                                     Problem 27

       1. Write a problem that uses the computation 43 ÷ 4 and gives 10 as the correct answer.

       3. Write a problem that uses the computation 43÷4 and gives 10.75 as the correct answer.

We can think about division with remainder in terms of some of our models for operations. For example, we can
calculate that 23 ÷ 4 = 5 R3. We can picture it this way:
                                                                PROPERTIES OF OPERATIONS · 157

· Explain the connection between these two equations.

23 ÷ 4 = 5 R3 and 23 = 5 · 4 + 3.

· How could you use the number line model to show the calculation 23 = 5 · 4 + 3? What does a

Anu refuses to tell anyone if she is working in a 110 system, or a 15 system, or any other system. She makes
everyone call it a 1  x system but won't tell anyone what x stands for.
We know that boxes in a 110 have values that are powers of ten: 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000...
And boxes in a 15 system are powers of five: 1, 5, 25, 125, 625...
So Anu's system, whatever it is, must be powers of x:

Introduction

Fractions are one of the hardest topics to teach (and learn!) in elementary school. What is the reason for this?
In this part of the book, will try to provide you with some insight about this (as well as some better ways for
understanding, teaching, and learning about fractions). But for now, think about what makes this topic so hard.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    You may have struggled learning about fractions in elementary school. Maybe you still find them
    confusing. Even if you were one of the lucky ones who did not struggle when learning about fractions, you
    probably had friends who did struggle.
    With a partner, talk about why this is. What is so difficult about understanding fractions? Why is the topic
    harder than other ones we tackle in elementary schools?
Remember that teachers should have lots of mental models -- lots of ways to explain the same concept. In this
chapter, we will look at some different ways to understand the idea of fractions as well as basic operations on
them.

                                                                                       173
What is a Fraction?

One of the things that makes fractions such a difficult concept to teach and to learn is that you have to think about
them in a lot of different ways, depending on the problem at hand. For now, we are going to think of a fraction as
the answer to a division problem.

                                                              Example: Pies per child

    Suppose 6 pies are to be shared equally among 3 children. This yields 2 pies per kid. We write

The fraction is equivalent to the division problem              . It represents the number of pies one
whole child receives when three kids share six pies equally.

In the same way ...

· Sharing 10 pies among 2 kids yields       pies per kid.
· Sharing 8 pies among 2 children yields       pies per child.
· Sharing 5 pies among 5 kids yields

· Sharing 1 pie among 2 children yields , which we call "one-half."

This final example is actually saying something! It also represents how fractions are usually taught to students:

If one pie is shared equally between two kids, then each child receives a portion of a pie which we choose to call
"half."

In the same way, the picture     is said to represent "one-third," that is, . (And this is indeed the amount of

pie an individual child would receive if one pie is shared among three.)

    For a fraction , the top number (which, for us, is the number of pies) is called the numerator of the
    fraction, and the bottom number (the number of kids), is called the denominator of the fraction.
Most people insist that the numerator and denominator each be whole numbers, but they do not have to be.

Jargon: Improper fractions

A fraction with a numerator smaller than its denominator is called (in school math jargon) a proper fraction. For
example, is "proper."
A fraction with numerator larger than its denominator is called (in school math jargon) an improper fraction. For
example, is "improper." (In the 1800's, these fractions were called vulgar fractions.)
For some reason, improper fractions are considered, well, improper by some teachers. So students are often
asked to write improper fractions as a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction (often called "mixed
numbers"). Despite their name and these prejudices, improper fractions are useful nonetheless!
With a mixed number, you have a good sense of the overall size of the number: "a little more than five," or "a bit
less than 17." But it is often easier to do calculations with improper fractions (why do you think that is?).

The Key Fraction Rule

We know that is the answer to a division problem:
represents the amount of pie an individual child receives when pies are shared equally by children.
What happens if we double the number of pie and double the number of kids? Nothing! The amount of pie per
child is still the same:
For example, as the picture shows, and both give two pies for each child.

                                                                                       185
186 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

And tripling the number of pies and the number of children also does not change the final amount of pies per
child, nor does quadrupling each number, or one trillion-billion-tupling the numbers!

This leads us to want to believe:

                                   Key Fraction Rule

(at least for positive whole numbers ).
We say that the fractions and are equivalent.

is the same problem as:

Most people say we have cancelled or taken a common factor 4 from the numerator and denominator.
Mathematicians call this process reducing the fraction to lowest terms. (We have made the numerator and
denominator smaller, in fact as small as we can make them!)
Teachers tend to say that we are simplifying the fraction. (You have to admit that does look simpler than

  .)

    As another example, can certainly be simplified by noticing that there is a common factor of 10 in both
    the numerator and the denominator:

    We can go further as 28 and 35 are both multiples of 7:

    Thus, sharing 280 pies among 350 children gives the same result as sharing 4 pies among 5 children!

    Since 4 and 5 share no common factors, this is as far as we can go with this example (while staying with
    whole numbers).

Here are two very similar fractions: and . What might it mean to add them? It might seem reasonable to say:

So maybe  represents 5 pies among 14 kids, giving the answer         . It is very tempting to say that "adding

fractions" means "adding pies and adding kids."

The trouble is that a fraction is not a pie, and a fraction is not a child. So adding pies and adding children is
not actually adding fractions. A fraction is something different. It is related to pies and kids, but something more
subtle. A fraction is an amount of pie per child.

One cannot add pies, one cannot add children. One must add instead the amounts individual kids receive.

                                                 Example: 2/7 + 3/7

Let us take it slowly. Consider the fraction . Here is a picture of the amount an individual child receives

Remember that means "the amount of pie that one child gets when five pies are shared by seven
children." Carefully explain why that is the same as the picture given by the sum above:

    Your explanation should use both words and pictures!

Most people read this as "two sevenths plus three sevenths gives five sevenths" and think that the problem is just
as easy as saying "two apples plus three apples gives five apples." And, in the end, they are right!
192 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

This is how the addition of fractions is first taught to students: Adding fractions with the same denominator seems
just as easy as adding apples:

4 tenths + 3 tenths + 8 tenths = 15 tenths.

(And, if you like,  .)

82 sixty-fifths + 91 sixty-fifths = 173 sixty-fifths:

We are really adding amounts per child not amounts, but the answers match the same way.
We can use the "Pies Per Child Model" to explain why adding fractions with like denominators works in this way.

                                     Example: 2/7 + 3/7

Think about the addition problem  :

Since in both cases we have 7 kids sharing the pies, we can imagine that it is the same 7 kids in both
cases. First, they share 2 pies. Then they share 3 more pies. The total each child gets by the time all the
pie-sharing is done is the same as if the 7 kids had just shared 5 pies to begin with. That is:

Now let us think about the general case. Our claim is that

Translating into our model, we have kids. First, they share pies between them, and represents the amount

each child gets. Then they share more pies, so the additional amount of pie each child gets is . The total each

kid gets is  .

But it does not really matter that the kids first share pies and then share pies. The amount each child gets is

the same as if they had started with all of the pies -- all  of them -- and shared them equally. That amount

of pie is represented by .

2. What might be the best approach to answering the problem?

One way to think about answering this addition question is to write in a series of alternative forms using our key
fraction rule (that is, multiply the numerator and denominator each by 2, and then each by 3, and then each by 4,
and so on) and to do the same for :

We see that the problem  is actually the same as                 . So we can find the answer using the same-

denominator. If you can see a denominator right away (or think of a faster method that always works), go for it!

However, there is no way to use this model to make sense of multiplying fractions! What would this mean?

So what are fractions, if we are asked to multiply them? We are forced to switch models and think about fractions
in a new way.
This switch is fundamentally perturbing. Think about students learning this for the first time. We keep switching
concepts and models, and speak of fractions in each case as though all is naturally linked and obvious. None of
this is obvious, it is all absolutely confusing. This is just one of the reasons that fractions can be such a difficult

Units and unitizing

In thinking about fractions, it is important to remember that there are always units attached to a fraction, even if
the units are hidden. If you see the number in a problem, you should ask yourself "half of what?" The answer to
that question is your unit, the amount that equals 1.
So far, our units have been consistent: the "whole" (or unit) was a whole pie, and fractions were represented by
200 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

pies cut into equal-sized pieces. But this is just a model, and we can take anything, cut it into equal-sized pieces,
and talk about fractions of that whole.
One thing that can make fraction problems so difficult is that the fractions in the problem may be given in different
units (they may be "parts" of different "wholes").

Ordering Fractions

If we think about fractions as "portions of a segment," then we can talk about their locations on a number line. We
can start to treat fractions like numbers. In the back of our minds, we should remember that fractions are always
relative to some unit. But on a number line, the unit is clear: it is the distance between 0 and 1.

This measurement model makes it much easier to tackle questions about the relative size of fractions based on

where they appear on the number line. We can mark off different fractions as parts of the unit segment. Just as
with whole numbers, fractions that appear farther to the right are larger.

         3/5 and 5/8 are very close, but 5/8 is just a bit bigger.

Fraction Intuition

Greater than 1: A fraction is greater than 1 if its numerator is greater than its denominator. How can
we see this? Well, the denominator represents how many pieces in one whole (one unit). The numerator
represents how many pieces in your portion. So if the numerator is bigger, that means you have more than
the number of pieces needed to make one whole.

Greater than : A fraction is greater than if the numerator is more than half the denominator. Another

way to check (which might be an easier calculation): a fraction is greater than if twice the numerator is
bigger than the denominator.

Why? Well, if we double the fraction and get something bigger than 1, then the original fraction must be
bigger than .

Same denominators: If two fractions have the same denominator, just compare the numerators. The

fractions will be in the same order as the numerators. For example,  . Why? Well, the pieces are the

same size since the denominators are the same. If you have more pieces of the same size, you have a bigger

number.

Same numerators: If the numerators of two fractions are the same, just compare the denominators. The

fractions should be in the reverse order of the denominators. For example,  . The justification for

this one is a little trickier: The denominator tells you how many pieces make up one whole. If there are

more pieces in a whole (if the denominator is bigger), then the pieces must be smaller. And if you take the

same number of pieces (same numerator), then the bigger piece wins.
204 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

Numerator = denominator : You can easily compare two fractions whose numerators are both one

less than their denominators. The fractions will be in the same order as the denominators. Think of each

fraction as a pie with one piece missing. The greater the denominator, the smaller the missing piece, so the

greater the amount remaining. For example,  , since      and  .

Numerator = denominator - constant: You can extend the test above to fractions whose numerators are

both the same amount less than their denominators. The fractions will again be in the same order as the

denominators, for exactly the same reason. For example,  , because both are four "pieces" less than

one whole, and the pieces are smaller than the pieces.

Equivalent fractions: Find equivalent fractions that lets you compare numerators or denominators, and
then use one of the above rules.

One of our models for multiplying whole numbers was an area model. For example, the product
area (number of 1 × 1 squares) of a 23-by-37 rectangle:

So the product of two fractions, say,  should also correspond to an area problem.

                                       Example (4/7 × 2/3)

Let us start with a segment of some length that we call 1 unit:
Now, build a square that has one unit on each side:

                                       208

The area of the square, of course, is  square unit.

Now, let us divide the segment on top into three equal-sized pieces. (So each piece is  .) And we will
divide the segment on the side into seven equal-sized pieces. (So each piece is .)

We can use those marks to divide the whole square into small, equal-sized rectangles. (Each rectangle has
one side that measures and another side that measures .)
210 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    We can now mark off four sevenths on one side and two thirds on the other side.

Remember, the whole square was one unit. That one-unit square is divided into 21 equal-sized pieces, and
our rectangle (the one with sides and ) contains eight of those rectangles. Since the shaded area is the

It is important to read carefully and understand what a problem is asking, not memorize rules about "translating"
word problems.

Explaining the Rule

You probably simplified your work in the exercises above by using a multiplication rule like the following.

                                                               Multiplying Fractions

Of course, you may then choose to simplify the final answer, but the answer is always equivalent to this one.
Why? The area model can help us explain what is going on.
First, let us clearly write out how the area model says to multiply . We want to build a rectangle where one
side has length and the other side has length . We start with a square, one unit on each side.

  · Divide the top segment into equal-sized pieces. Shade of those pieces. (This will be the side of the
      rectangle with length .)

  · Divide the left segment into equal-sized pieces. Shade of those pieces. (This will be the side of the
      rectangle with length .)

  · Divide the whole rectangle according to the tick marks on the sides, making equal-sized rectangles.
  · Shade the rectangle bounded by the shaded segments.
214 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

If the answer is , that means there are     total equal-sized pieces in the square, and  of them are shaded.

We can see from the model why this is the case:

· The top segment was divided into equal-sized pieces. So there are columns in the rectangle.

· The side segment was divided into equal-sized pieces. So there are rows in the rectangle.

· A rectangle with columns and rows has          pieces. (The area model for whole-number
   multiplication!)

               Example: Multiply Fractions

For example, to multiply , we think of "2" as , and compute this way

We can also think in terms of our original "Pies Per Child" model to answer questions like this.

               Example: Pies per Child

We know that means the amount of pie each child gets when 7 children evenly share 3 pies.

If we compute  that means we double the amount of pie each kid gets. We can do this by doubling the

number of pies. So the answer is the same as : the amount of pie each child gets when 7 children evenly

share 6 pies.

Finally, we can think in terms of units and unitizing.

               Example: Units

The fraction means that I have 7 equal pieces (of something), and I take 3 of them.

So  means do that twice. If I take 3 pieces and then 3 pieces again, I get a total of 6 pieces. There are

still 7 equal pieces in the whole, so the answer is .

Dividing Fractions: Meaning

Dividing fractions is one of the hardest ideas in elementary school mathematics. By now, you are used to the rule:
to divide by a fraction, multiply by its reciprocal. ("invert and multiply"). But ask yourself: Why does this rule
work? Does it really make sense to you? Can you explain why it makes sense to a third grader?

We are going to build up to the "invert and multiply" rule, but along the way, we'll find some more meaningful
ways to understand division of fractions. So please play along: pretend that you don't already know the "invert
and multiply" rule, and solve the problems in this chapter with other methods.

Groups of Equal Size                                  means:

Remember the quotative model for division:

              How many groups of 3 can I find in 18?

We start with 18 dots (or candy bars or molecules), and we make groups of 3 dots (or 3 whatevers). We ask: how
many groups can we make?

Let's draw a picture of 6 pies, and see how many groups of we can find:

We found nine equal groups of size , so we conclude that

Unfortunately, it's not always quite so straightforward to find the equal groups. For example,  asks the

The first pictures shows of a pie. The second picture shows two equal groups of inside of , but there's
a little bit left over. We conclude

But how much more? Can we figure it out exactly?

Here's a method that will let you do the computation exactly. We'll use rectangular pies, and divide them up into
rows and columns based on the denominators of the numbers we're dividing.

Example: 3/4 ÷ 1/3

Start by drawing two identical rectangles, each with 4 rows (from the denominator of  and 3 columns
(from the denominator of ).

Shade of the first rectangle (this is exactly three rows), and shade of the second rectangle (so that's one
column).

groups equal to that:

    Is there a way to make this look friendlier? Well, if we change those mixed numbers to "improper"
    fractions, it helps a little:

    That's a bit better, but it's still not clear how much pie each kid gets. Let's use the key fraction rule to
    make the fraction even friendlier. Let's multiply the numerator and denominator each by 3. (Why three?)

    change its value.

    Now multiply numerator and denominator each by 4. (Why four?)

Summary

We now have several methods for solving problems that require dividing fractions:

    Dividing fractions:
       · Draw a picture using the rectangle method, and use that to solve the division problem.
       · Find a common denominator and divide the numerators.
       · Rewrite the division as a missing factor multiplication problem, and solve that problem.
       · Simplify an ugly fraction.
       · Invert the second fraction (the dividend) and then multiply.

Dividing Fractions: Problems

We've spent the last couple of chapters talking about dividing fractions: how to make sense of the operation, how
to picture what's going on, and how to do the computations. But all of this kind of begs the question: When would
you ever want to divide fractions, anyway? How does that even come up?

It's important that teachers are able to come up with situations and problems that model particular operations,
which means you have to really understand what the operations mean and when they are used.

                                   Think / Pair / Share

· Use one of our methods (draw a picture, rectangles, common denominator, missing factor) to

compute  .

· Come up with a situation where you would want to compute         . (That is, write a word problem
   that would require you to do this computation to solve it.)

When to Multiply, When to Divide?

A common answer to

Come up with a situation where you would want to compute        .

Is something like this:

              My recipe calls for cups of flour, but I only want to make half a recipe. How much flour should I use?

But that problem doesn't ask you to divide fractions. It asks you to cut your recipe in half, which means dividing
by 2 or multiplying by .

                                                                                       230

Why is it so hard to come up with division problems that use fractions? Maybe it's because fractions are already
the answer to a division problem, so you're dividing and then dividing some more. Maybe it's because they just
make it look so complicated. In any case, it's worth spending some time thinking about division problems that
involve fractions and how to recognize and solve them.

One handy trick: Write a problem that involves division of whole numbers, and then see if you can change the
numbers to fractions in a sensible way.

                                                                      Examples

    Here are some division problems involving whole numbers:

       · I have 10 feet of ribbon. How many 2-inch pieces can I cut from it?
       · I have a fancy old clock that rings once every 15 minutes. How many times will it ring over the

          course of 2 hours (120 minutes)?
       · My fish tank needs 6 gallons of water, and my bucket holds 3 gallons. How many times will I need

          to fill my bucket in order to fill the tank?
       · A recipe calls for 6 cups of flour, and my largest scoop measures exactly 2 cups. How many times

          should I use it?
       · I ran 12 miles and went around the the same route 3 times. How long was the route?

    Here are some very similar problems, rewritten to use fractions instead:

       · I have feet of ribbon. How many 6-inch (that's a foot) pieces can I cut from it?
       · My watch alarm goes off every half hour, and I don't know how to shut it off. How many times will

          it go off during the hour movie?
       · My fish tank needs gallons of water, and my bucket holds gallon. How many times will I need

          to fill my bucket in order to fill the tank?
       · I want to measure cups of flour for a recipe, but I only have a cup measuring cup. How many

          times should I fill it?
       · I ran miles before I twisted my ankle. I only finished half the race. How long was the race

          course?

For each one of the fraction division questions, we can understand why it's a division problem:

  · I have feet of ribbon. How many 6-inch (that's a foot) pieces can I cut from it? This means making
      equal groups of foot each and asking how many groups. That's quotative division.

  · My watch alarm goes off every half hour, and I don't know how to shut it off. How many times will it go
      off during the hour movie? Again, we're making equal groups of hour each, and asking how many
      groups. Quotative division.

  · My fish tank needs gallons of water, and my bucket holds gallon. How many times will I need to fill
232 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

      my bucket in order to fill the tank? Once again: we're making equal groups of gallon each, and asking
      how many groups (buckets).

  · I want to measure cups of flour for a recipe, but I only have a cup measuring cup. How many times
      should I fill it? This is making equal groups of cup and asking how many groups.

  · I ran miles before I twisted my ankle. I only finished half the race. How long was the race course? This
      one is a little different. This one is a little different. It's the fraction version of partitive division.

Recall what partitive division asks: For  , we ask 20 is 4 groups of what size?

So for  , we ask: is half a group of what size?

                                                            Think / Pair / Share

You try it.

  · First write five different division word problems that use whole numbers. (Try to write at least a
      couple each of partitive and quotative division problems.)

  · Then change the problems so that they are fraction division problems instead. You might need to
      rewrite the problem a bit so that it makes sense.

· Write a "pies per child" story for the fraction  . Does it make sense? How much pie does each

· Think of as the answer to a division problem. What is that division problem? Can you solve it?

It seems pretty clear that zero pies among eleven kids gives zero pies per child:

The same reasoning would lead us to say:

The "Pies Per Child Model" offers one explanation: If there are no pies for us to share, no one gets any pie. It does
not matter how many children there are. No pie is no pie is no pie.

We can also justify this claim by thinking about a missing factor multiplication problem:

The only way to fill that in and make a true statement is with 0, so  .

       · Think of as the answer to a division problem. What is that division problem? Can you solve it?

Students often learn in school that "dividing by 0 is undefined." But they learn this as a
rule, rather than thinking about why it makes sense or how it connects to other ideas in
mathematics. In this case, the most natural connection is to a multiplication fact, the zero
property for multiplication:

That says we can never find solutions to problems like

Using the connection between fractions and division, and the connection between division and multiplication, that
means there is no number . There is no number . And there is no number . They are all "undefined" because
they are not equal to any number at all.

· Wonhi says that         since                            .

Who is right? Can they all be correct? What do you think?

Cyril says that    , and he believes he is correct because it passes the check:  .

But 17 also passes the check, and so does 887231243. In fact, I can choose any number for , and
will pass the check!

The trouble with the expression (with not zero) is that there is no meaningful value to assign to it. The trouble
with is different: There are too many possible values to give it!

Dividing by zero is simply too problematic to be done! It is best to avoid doing so and never will we allow zero
as the denominator of a fraction. (But all is fine with 0 as a numerator.)

    Consider the problem: Share 7 pies equally among 12 kids. Of course, given our model for fractions, each
    child is to receive the quantity " " But this answer has little intuitive feel.
    Suppose we took this task as a very practical problem. Here are the seven pies:

Is it possible to give each of the kids a whole pie? No.

How about the next best thing -- can each child get half a pie? Yes! There are certainly 12 half pies to dole
out. There is also one pie left over yet to be shared among the 12 kids. Divide this into twelfths and hand
each kid an extra piece.

So each child gets  of a pie, and it is indeed true that

(Check that calculation. . . don't just believe it!)

                                                                                 247

This seems quite reasonable. Instead of seven pieces each of size
that is . It's a lot less cutting, and a lot less messy!

Problem 32

1. Suppose you want to share five pies among six children, but you want each child to get a small number
of (relatively) large pieces rather than five pieces of size . Following the example above, how could you
do it?

      2. Using similar ideas, how could you share 4 pies among 7 kids?

 History: Rhind Papyrus

  The Egyptians (probably) were not particularly concerned with splitting up pies. But in fact, they did have a very
  strange (to us) way of expressing fractions. We know this by examining the Rhind Papyrus. This ancient document
  indicates that fractions were in use as many as four thousand years ago in Egypt, but the Egyptians seem to have
  worked primarily with unit fractions. They insisted on writing all of their fractions as sums of fractions with
  numerators equal to 1, and they insisted that the denominators of the fractions were all different.

                      Accurate reckoning for inquiring into things, and the knowledge of all things, mysteries...all secrets.

      The Rhind Papyrus is an ancient account of Egyptian mathematics named after Alexander Henry Rhind.
      Rhind was a Scotsman who acquired the ancient papyrus in 1858 in Luxor, Egypt.
      The papyrus dates back to around 1650 B.C. It was copied by a scribe named Ahmes (the earliest known
      contributor to the field of mathematics!) from a lost text written during the reign of king Amenehat III.
      The opening quote is taken from Ahmes introduction to the Rhind Papyrus1. The papyrus covers topics
      relating to fractions, volume, area, pyramids, and more.

To write a fraction as an Egyptian fraction, you must rewrite the fraction as:
  · a sum of unit fractions (that means the numerator is 1), and
  · the denominators must all be different.

Algebra Connections

In an advanced algebra course students are often asked to work with complicated expressions like:

We can make it look friendlier by using the key fraction rule, exactly the same technique we used in the chapter on
"Dividing Fractions: Invert and Multiply." In this example, let us multiply the numerator and denominator each
by . (Do you see why this is a good choice?) We obtain:

and is much less scary.
Notic that expressions like

cannot be rewritten as a decimal. Expressions like this arise in numerous applications, so it is important for math
and science students to be able to work with fractions in fraction form, without always resorting to converting to
decimals.

                                                                       Example

What is a Fraction? Part 3

So far, we have no single model that makes sense of fractions in all contexts. Sometimes a fraction is an action
("Cut this in half.") Sometimes it is a quantity ("We each get 2/3 of a pie!") And sometimes we want to treat
fractions like numbers, like ticks on the number line in-between whole numbers.

We could say that a fraction is just a pair of numbers and , where we require that         . We just happen to
write the pair as .

But again this is not quite right, since a whole infinite collection of pairs of numbers represent the same fraction!
For example:

So a single fraction is actually a whole infinite class of pairs of numbers that we consider "equivalent."

How do mathematicians think about fractions? Well, in exactly this way. They think of pairs of numbers written
as , where we remember two important facts:

·  , and

· is really shorthand for a whole infinite class of pairs that look like for all        .

This is a hefty shift of thinking: The notion of a "number" has changed from being a specific combination of
symbols to a whole class of combinations of symbols that are deemed equivalent.

Mathematicians then define the addition of fractions to be given by the daunting rule:

This is obviously motivated by something like the "Pies Per Child Model." But if we just define things this way,
we must worry about proving that choosing different representations for and lead to the same final answer.
For example, it is not immediately obvious that

                                                                                       253
254 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

give answers that are equivalent. (Check that they do!)
They also define the product of fractions as:

Again, if we start from here, we have to prove that you get equivalent answers for different choices of fractions
equivalent to and .
Then mathematicians establish that the axioms of an arithmetic system hold with these definitions and carry on
from there! (That is, they check that addition and multiplication are both commutative and associative, that the
distributive law holds, that all representations of 0 act like an additive identity, and so on.)
This is abstract, dry, and not at all the best first encounter to offer students on the topic of fractions. And, moreover,
this approach completely avoids the question as to what a fraction really means in the "real world." But it is the
best one can do if one is to be completely honest.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    So... what is a fraction, really? How do you think about them? And what is the best way to talk about them
    with elementary school students?

Introduction

Algebra skills are essential for your future students. Why? Here are just a few reasons:
  · Mathematics, and especially algebra, is the language of science and modern technology. Thinking
      algebraically helps you to make sense of the world, to understand and interact with technology more
      productively, and to succeed in other fields.
  · Algebra is a tool for solving problems. This may not be your experience so far, but it is true. If you are able
      to "algebratize" a problem, that often helps lead you to a solution.
  · Algebra helps you to think abstractly. It is a tool for thinking about operations like addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, and division separate from doing calculations on particular numbers. Algebra helps you to
      understand and explain why the operations work the way they do, to describe their properties clearly, and to
      manipulate expressions to see the bigger picture.

You might wonder why future elementary teachers should master algebra, a topic usually studied (by that name,
anyway) in 8th grade and beyond. But the Common Core Standards for School Mathematics has standards in
"Operations and Algebraic Thinking" beginning in kindergarten!
Everyone who shows up to school has already learned a lot about abstraction and generalization -- the
fundamental ideas in algebra. They are all capable of learning to formalize these ideas. Your job as an elementary
school teacher will be to provide your students with even more experiences in abstraction and generalization in a
mathematical context, so that these ideas will seem quite natural when they get to a class with the name "Algebra."
Let's start with a problem:

                                                                      Problem 1

    I can use four 4's to make 0:

    I can also use four 4's to make the number 10:

                                                                                       259
260 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    Your challenge: Use four 4's to make all of the numbers between 0 and 20. (Try to find different solutions
    for 0 and 10 than the ones provided.) You can use any mathematical operations, but you can't use any
    digits other than the four 4's.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

       · What does "algebra" mean to you?
       · What does Problem 1 have to do with "algebra"?
       · What do you imagine when you think about using algebra to solve problems in school?
       · Have you ever used algebra to solve problems outside of school?

Borders on a Square

Here's another problem:

                                                                      Problem 2

    Here is a large square made up of 100 smaller unit squares. The unit squares along the border of the large
    square are colored red. Without counting one-by-one, can you figure out how many red squares there are
    in the picture?

Clearly describe how you figured out the number of red squares, and how you know your answer is correct.

Justin calculated the number of squares as       . He justified his answer this way:

Since the dimensions of the big square are       , there are 10 squares along each of the four sides. So that

gives me 40 red squares. But then each corner is part of two different sides. I've counted each of the corners

twice. So I need to make up for that by subtracting 4 at the end.

                                            261

· What do you think about Justin's solution? Are you convinced? Could he have explained it more
   clearly?

· Was Justin's solution different from your solution or the same?

There are lots of different ways to calculate the number of colored squares along the border of a
square. Below are the calculations several other students did. For each calculation, write a justification

Now suppose that you have a large  square with the unit squares along the border colored red.

For each technique you used, write an explanation and include a picture. Think about how to use colors or
other methods to make your picture and explanation more clear.

Now suppose that you have a large  square with the unit squares along the border colored red.

Adapt two of the techniques above to calculate the number of red unit squares.

For each technique you used, write an explanation and include a picture. Think about how to use colors or

1. Suppose that you have 64 red squares. Can you use all of those squares to make the border of a
   larger square in a picture like the one above? If yes, what are the dimensions of the larger square? If
   no, why not?

2. What if you have 30 red squares? Same questions.

Careful Use of Language in Mathematics: =

The notion of equality is fundamental in mathematics, and especially in algebra and algebraic thinking. The
symbol "="' expresses a relationship. It is not an operation in the way that + and are × operations. It should not
be read left-to-right, and it definitely does not mean "... and the answer is ...".
For your work to be clear and easily understood by others, it is essential that you use the symbol = appropriately.
And for your future students to understand the meaning of the = symbol and use it correctly, it is essential that you
are clear and precise in your use of it.
Let's start by working on some problems.

                                                                      Problem 7

Descriptions in Words

1. Count horizontal and vertical toothpicks separately. Horizontal: there are two rows of n toothpicks where n
   is the figure number. There are n-1 more of them on the vertical arm. The vertical toothpicks are just the
   same. There are two columns of n along the vertical arm, and then n-1 more of them on the horizontal arm.

2. To get a figure from the previous one, you add three toothpicks in a "C"' shape on the left side of the
   figure. The total number of toothpicks is three times the figure number, plus one extra to close off the
   square on the far right.

3. There are five spikes radiating out from the center. Each spike has the same number of toothpicks as the
   figure number. Each spike is capped off by one additional toothpick.

4. Each arm of the "L" shape has the same number of tiles as the figure number. But then we've counted the
   corner of the "L" twice, so we have to subtract one to get the total number of tiles needed.

5. The stars are in two equal rows, and each row has the same number of stars as the figure number.

6. To make the next figure, you always add five more toothpicks. Each arm has one more than the figure
   number of toothpicks, and there are five arms.

7. The stars are in a square, and the sides of the square have the same number of stars as the figure number.

8. Each arm of the "V" shape has the same number of stars as the figure number. Then we need to add one
   more star for the corner.

9. There are the same number of squares as the figure number, and each square uses four toothpicks. But then
   I've double-counted the toothpicks where the squares touch, so we have to subtract those out. There are
   one less of those than the figure number.

10. I can picture a square of tiles filled in. The side length of that square is the same as the figure number, so

that's . But then the square isn't really filled in. It's like I took away a square one size smaller from the

top right, leaving just the border. What I took away was a square one size smaller,  .

11. Each time I go from one shape to the next, I add six new toothpicks. Three are added to the left in a "C"
   shape and three are added to the top in a rotated "C"' shape. So the total number will be six times the figure
   number plus or minus something. I can check to see that the right correction is to subtract 2.
Structural and Procedural Algebra

When most people think about algebra from school, they think about "solving for ." They imagine lots of
equations with varying levels of complexity, but the goal is always the same: find the unknown quantity. This is
a procedural view of algebra.

Even elementary students can be exposed to ideas in procedural algebra. This happens any time they think about
unknown quantities and try to solve for them. For example, when first grade students learn to add and subtract
numbers "within 10,'" they should frequently tackle problems like these:

·  .

· Find several pairs of numbers that add up to 10.

Although procedural algebra is important, it's not the most important skill, and it's certainly not the whole story.

You also need to foster thinking about structural algebra in your students: using symbols to express meaning in
a situation. If there is an x on your page, you should be able to answer, "what does the x mean? What does it
represent?"

Most of what you've done so far in this chapter is structural algebra. You've used letters and symbols not to
represent a single unknown quantity, but a varying quantity. For example, in Section 4 you used letters to represent
the "figure number'" or "case number" in a growing pattern. The letters could take on different values, and the
expressions gave you information: how many tiles or toothpicks or stars you needed to build that particular figure
in that particular pattern.

Variables and Equations

You have seen that in algebra, letters and symbols can have different meanings depending on the context.

· A symbol could stand for some unknown quantity.
· A symbol could stand for some quantity that varies. (Hence the term "variable" to describe these symbols.)

In much the same way, equations can represent different things.

· They can represent a problem to be solved. This is the traditional procedural algebra type of question.

· They can represent a relationship between two or more quantities. For example,  represents the
   relationship between the area of a square and its side length.

· They can represent identities: mathematical truths. For example,

is always true, for every value of . There is nothing to solve for, and no relationship between varying

quantities. (If you do try to "solve for ," you will get the equation       , much like you saw in Problem

Review of Dots & Boxes Model

Let's start with a quick review of place value, different bases, and our "Dots & Boxes" model for thinking about
these ideas.

                                                                    The 12 Rule

    Whenever there are two dots in single box, they "explode," disappear, and become one dot in the box to
    the left.

                                                     Example: Nine dots 12 in the system

    We start by placing nine dots in the rightmost box.

    Two dots in that box explode and become one dot in the box to the left.

                                                                                       299

    Hey, now we have more than two dots in the second box, so those can explode and move!

    And the rightmost box still has more than two dots.

                           Definition

Recall that numbers written in the 12 system are called binary or base two numbers.
Numbers written in the 13 system are called base three numbers.
Numbers written in the 14 system are called base four numbers.
Numbers written in the 110 system are called base ten numbers.
In general, numbers written in the 1b system are called base b numbers.

In a base b number system, each place represents a power of b, which means           for some whole number n.

Remember this means b multiplied by itself n times:

· The right-most place is the units or ones place. (Why is this a power of b?)

· The second spot is the "b" place. (In base ten, it's the tens place.)

· The third spot is the " " place. (In base ten, that's the hundreds place. Note that   .)

· The fourth spot is the " " place. (In base ten, that's the thousands place, since     .)

· And so on.

                           Notation

Whenever we're dealing with numbers written in different bases, we use a subscript to indicate the base so
that there can be no confusion. So:

·             is a base three number (read it as "one-zero-two base three"). This is the base three code

   for the number eleven.

·             is a base four number (read it as "two-two-two base four"). This is the base four code for

   the number forty-two.

·             is a base ten number. (It's ok to say "fifty-four thousand three hundred and twenty-one."
   Why?)

If the base is not written, we assume it's base ten.
Remember: when you see the subscript, you are seeing the code for some number of dots.

Work through the two examples above carefully to be sure you remember and understand how the "Dots

· When we write 9 in base 2, why do we write                    instead of just                        ?

· When we write 15 in base 3, why do we write                                         instead of just     ?

Decimals

Up to now our "Dots & Boxes" model has consisted of a row of boxes extending infinitely far to the left. Why not
have boxes extending to the right as well?
Let's work specifically with a 110 rule and see what boxes to the right could mean.

                                                                       Notation

    It has become convention to separate boxes to the right of the ones place with a decimal point. (At least,
    this is what the point is called in the base ten world... "dec" means "ten" after all!)
What is the value of the first box to the right of the decimal point? If we denote its value as , we have that ten
's is equivalent to 1. (Remember, we are using a 1  10 rule.)

                                                                                       306
                                                                             DECIMALS · 307

From  we get that     .

Call the value of the next box to the right .

From  we get       .

If we keep doing this, we see that the boxes to the right of the decimal point represent the reciprocals of the powers
of ten.

                                                               Example: 0.3

             is represented by the picture:

    It represents seven groups of .
Of course, some decimals represent fractions that can simplify further. For example:

Similarly, if a fraction can be rewritten to have a denominator that is a power of ten, then it is easy to convert it to
a decimal. For example, is equivalent to , and so we have:
                                                                             DECIMALS · 309

                                   Example: 12 3/4

Can you write as a decimal? Well,

We can write the denominator as a power of ten using the key fraction rule:

So we see that:

Division and Decimals

When you studied fractions, you had lots of different ways to think about them. But the first way, and the one we
keep coming back to, is to think of a fraction as the answer to a division problem.

                                                                       Example

    Suppose 6 pies are to be shared equally among 3 children. This yields 2 pies per child. We write:

The fraction is equivalent to the answer to the division problem  . It represents the number of
pies one whole child receives.

In the same way...                           pies per kid,
      sharing 10 pies among 2 kids yields  pies per kid,
      sharing 8 pies among 2 kids yields   pies per kid, and
      sharing 5 pies among 5 kids yields
                                                      318
                                                                                                                            DIVISION AND DECIMALS · 319

the answer to sharing 1 pies among 2 children is , which we call "one-half."

We associate the number " " to the picture    .

In the same way, the picture  represents "one third," that is, .

(This is the amount of pie an individual child would receive if one pie is shared among three children.)

The picture      is called "one fifth" and is indeed , the amount of pie an individual child receives when one

pie is shared by five kids.

And the picture           is called "three fifths" to represent , the amount of pie an individual receives if three pies

are shared by five kids.

We know how to do division in our "Dots & Boxes" model.

                                              Example: 3906 ÷ 3

Suppose you are asked to compute              . One way to interpret this question (there are others) is:

                              "How many groups of 3 fit into 3906?"

In our "Dots & Boxes" model, the dividend 3906 looks like this:

and three dots looks like this:                          fit into the picture of 3906?"
So we are really asking:

                         "How many groups of
320 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

Notice what we have in the picture:

  · One group of 3 in the thousands box.
  · Three groups of 3 in the hundreds box.
  · Zero groups of 3 in the tens box.
  · Two groups of 3 in the ones box.

This shows that 3 goes into 3906 one thousand, three hundreds and two ones times. That is,

Of course, not every division problem works out evenly! Here's a different example.

                                           Example: 1024 ÷ 3

Suppose you are asked to compute           . One way to interpret this question is:

"How many groups of 3 fit into 1024?"

So we're looking for groups of three dots in this picture:

One group of three is easy to spot:
                                                                       DIVISION AND DECIMALS · 321

To find more groups of three dots, we must "unexplode" a dot:

We need to unexplode again:

This leaves one stubborn dot remaining in the ones box and no more group of three. So we conclude:
In words: 1024 gives 341 groups of 3, plus one extra dot.

We can put these two ideas together -- fractions as the answer to a division problem and what we know about
division in the "Dots & Boxes" model -- to help us think more about the connection between fractions and
decimals.

                             Example: 1/8

The fraction is the result of dividing 1 by 8. Let's actually compute  in a "Dots & Boxes" model,

making use of decimals. We want to find groups of eight in the following picture:

Clearly none are to be found, so let's unexplode:
322 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    (We're being lazy and not drawing all the dots. As you follow along, you might want to draw the dots
    rather than the number of dots, if it helps you keep track.)
    Now there is one group of 8, leaving two behind. We write a tick-mark on top, to keep track of the number
    of groups of 8, and leave two dots behind in the box.

    We can unexplode the two dots in the box:

    This gives two groups of 8 leaving four behind. Remember: the two tick marks represent two groups of
    8. And there are four dots left in the box.
                                                   DIVISION AND DECIMALS · 323

Unexploding those four remaining dots:

Now we have five groups of 8 and no remainder.

Remember: the tick marks kept track of how many groups of eight there were in each box. We have

· One group of 8 dots in the    box
· Two groups of 8 dots in the     box.
· Five groups of 8 dots in the      box.

So we conclude that:

Of course, it's a good habit to check our answer:

Many people make use of a vinculum (horizontal bar) to represent infinitely long repeating decimals. For
example, means "repeat the 3 forever":

and  means "repeat the 412 forever":

Terminating or Repeating?

You've seen that when you write a fraction as a decimal, sometimes the decimal terminates, like:

However, some fractions have decimal representations that go on forever in a repeating pattern, like:

It's not totally obvious, but it is true: Those are the only two things that can happen when you write a fraction as
a decimal.
Of course, you can imagine (but never write down) a decimal that goes on forever but doesn't repeat itself, for
example:
But these numbers can never be written as a nice fraction where and are whole numbers. They are called
irrational numbers. The reason for this name: Fractions like are also called ratios. Irrational numbers cannot
be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers.
For now, we'll think about the question: Which fractions have decimal representations that terminate, and which
fractions have decimal representations that repeat forever? We'll focus just on unit fractions.

                                                                      Definition

Fraction  Denominator  Decimal

Marcus noticed a pattern in the table from Problem 7, but was having trouble explaining exactly what he noticed.
Here's what he said to his group:

              I remembered that when we wrote fractions as decimals before, we tried to make the denominator into a
              power of ten. So we can do this:

              When we only have 2's, we can always turn them into 10's by adding enough 5's.
                                                                       TERMINATING OR REPEATING? · 337

· Write out several more examples of what Marcus discovered.

· If Marcus had the unit fraction , what would be his first step to turn it into a decimal? What would
   the decimal expansion look like and why?

· Now think about unit fractions with powers of 5 in the denominator. If Marcus had the unit fraction
      , what would be his first step to turn it into a decimal? What would the decimal expansion look

   like and why?

Marcus had a really good insight, but he didn't explain it very well. He doesn't really mean that we "turn 2's into
10's." And he's not doing any addition, so talking about "adding enough 5's" is pretty confusing.

                                                                      Problem 9

    Each of the fractions listed below has a terminating decimal representation. Explain how you could know
    this for sure, without actually calculating the decimal representation.

The Period of a Repeating Decimal

If the denominator of a fraction can be factored into just 2's and 5's, you can always form an equivalent fraction
where the denominator is a power of ten.
For example, if we start with the fraction

we can form an equivalent fraction

The denominator of this fraction is a power of ten, so the decimal expansion is finite with (at most)  places.

What about fractions where the denominator has other prime factors besides 2's and 5's? Certainly we can't turn
the denominator into a power of 10, because powers of 10 have just 2's and 5's as their prime factors. So in this
case the decimal expansion will go on forever. But why will it have a repeating pattern? And is there anything
else interesting we can say in this case?

                                                                 Definition

The period of a repeating decimal is the smallest number of digits that repeat.

For example, we saw that

The repeating part is just the single digit 3, so the period of this repeating decimal is one.
                                                                        TERMINATING OR REPEATING? · 339

Similarly, we know that

The smallest repeating part is the digits           , so the period of this repeating decimal is 6.

You can think of it this way: the period is the length of the string of digits under the vinculum (the horizontal bar
that indicates the repeating digits).

fraction when has prime factors besides 2 and 5?

Imagine you are doing the "Dots & Boxes" division to compute the decimal representation of a unit fraction like
 . You start with a single dot in the ones box:
340 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

To find the decimal expansion, you "unexplode" dots, form groups of six, see how many dots are left, and repeat.

Draw your own pictures to follow along this explanation:

Picture 1: When you unexplode the first dot, you get 10 dots in the        box, which gives one group of six with
remainder of 4.

Picture 2: When you unexplode those four dots, you get 40 dots in the      box, which gives six group of six with
remainder of 4.

Picture 3: Unexplode those 4 dots to get 40 in the next box to the right.

Picture 4: Make six groups of 6 dots with remainder 4.

Since the remainder repeated (we got a remainder of 4 again), we can see that the process will now repeat forever:

· unexplode 4 dots to get 40 in the next box to the right,
· make six groups of 6 dots with remainder 4,
· unexplode 4 dots to get 40 in the next box to the right,
· make six groups of 6 dots with remainder 4,
· and so on forever...

Operations on Decimals

Of course we can add, subtract, multiply, and divide decimal numbers by rewriting them as fractions and using
the algorithms we know there. Of course, sometimes it is a lot more work to convert to fractions than it is to just
work directly with the decimals (as long as you know what you're doing). So let's think about place value and
computing with decimals.

Adding and Subtracting Decimals

Remember that when we used the "Dots & Boxes" model to add, it looked like this.

                                                                Example: 163 + 489

    We then perform explosions until there are fewer than ten dots in each box, and we find that:
Subtraction was a little more complicated.

                                                                                       350
                                                                               OPERATIONS ON DECIMALS · 351

                                                           Example: 921 - 551

We start with the representation of 921:

Since we want to "take away" 551, that means we take away five dots from the hundreds box, leaving four
dots.

Now we want to take away five dots from the tens box, but we can't do it! There are only two dots there.
What can we do? Well, we still have some hundreds, so we can "unexplode" a hundreds dot, and put ten
dots in the tens box instead. Then we'll be able to take five of them away, leaving seven.

    (Notice that we also have one less dot in the hundreds box; there's only three dots there now.)
    Now we want to take one dot from the ones box, and that leaves no dots there.

    We conclude that:

   points." Use the "Dots & Boxes" model to explain why this shorthand makes sense.

Multiplying and Dividing: Powers of 10

Let's quickly review the "Dots & Boxes" model for multiplication of whole numbers before we get back to talking
about decimals.

                                      Example: 243192 × 4

If we want to compute               , it helps to remember what multiplication means. One interpretation
is: I want to add      to itself a total of four times. So there will be:

·  dots in the ones place,

·  dots in the tens place,

·  dots in the hundreds place,

· and so on.

Here's the start of the computation:

To finish the computation, we need to do some explosions to write the result as a familiar base 10 number:

   2. Do each computation, using reasoning like in the "Division and Decimals" examples.

You know that multiplying a base-ten whole number by 10 results in appending a zero to the right end of the
number. Your work above should convince you that this does not work for decimals!

       · Write a new rule that works for both whole numbers and decimals:

          decimal notation by ten? By one-hundred? Justify what you say.

Multiplying Decimals

You probably know an algorithm for multiplying decimal numbers by hand. But if you think carefully about the
algorithm, it should make sense based on what the decimal numbers represent and what it means to multiply.
Let's start by using number sense to think about multiplying whole numbers by decimals.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

       · Greater than 100.
       · Greater than 64 but less than 100.
       · At least 17, but less than 32.
       · Equal to 16.
       · Greater than 8 but less than 16.
       · Less than 8, but greater than 0.
354 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

    Be sure to justify your answers. You should use your number sense rather than computing by hand or with
    a calculator!

Earlier in this chapter, you multiplied decimal numbers by converting them to fractions and then using what you
know about multiplying fractions. There are other ways to think about multiplying that focus on number sense
and place value rather than on the mechanics of computation.

                                      Example: 321 × 0.4

Suppose a student wanted to compute              , but he didn't already know the standard algorithm.
What might she do? Here is one idea:
                                      . Since I want to multiply by and not by , my answer should
              I know that
              be of this one. So

You should notice that the student is using the associative property of multiplication:

                                                                Problem 15

For each computation below, the result of the computation is shown correctly, but the decimal point is
missing. Use number sense and reasoning to correctly place the decimal point, and briefly justify how you
know you're right.
(Don't use a calculator, don't work out the multiplication by hand, and don't use the trick of "counting the
number of decimal places." Use your number sense!)

On Your Own

2. In exercise (1) above, how does the number of digits to the right of the decimal point compare to the
   number of zeros in the denominator? Use what you know about place value to explain why your answer is
   always true (not just for the examples above).

3. Find each product.

4. In exercise (3) above, how is the number of zeros in the product related to the number of zeros in the two
   factors? Use what you know about place value to explain why your answer is always true (not just for the
   examples above).

a. If you write       as a fraction, how many zeros would be in the denominator?

b. What if you write  as a fraction,how many zeros would be in the denominator?

c. How many zeros would be in the denominator of the product of  and ? (Don't compute the
   product to answer this question!)

5. Use the fact that              and your answers to the exercises above to find  .

Explain how you got your answer.

                                                   Standard multiplication algorithm

The standard algorithm for multiplying decimal numbers can be described this way:
Step 1
Compute the product as if the two factors were whole numbers. (Ignore the decimal points.)
Step 2
Count the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in each factor, and add those numbers together.
Call the result .
Step 3
The sum that you found in Step 2 will be the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the
product. So place the decimal point according by counting the appropriate number of places from the right.

Dividing Decimals

As you might expect, dividing decimals is more complicated to explain than any of the other operations. It's

hard to adapt our "Dots & Boxes" model for division. Suppose we want to compute  . We can

                                                       Standard division algorithm

The standard algorithm for dividing numbers represented by finite decimal expansions is something like
this:
Step 1
Move the decimal point of the divisor to the end of the number.
Step 2
Move the decimal point of the dividend the same number of positions (the same distance and direction).
Step 3
Divide the new decimal dividend (from Step 2) by the new whole number divisor (from Step 1). Since
we're dividing by a whole number, our standard methods make sense.

This is a pretty mechanical description, and doesn't give a lot of insight into why this algorithm works.

   month? A year? Have you already reached that age? Or maybe you won't live that long?

· Again, before you figure it out, write down a guess.
· Now figure it out! When was / will be your billion-second birthday?

Were you surprised by the answers? People (most people, anyway) tend to have a very good sense for small,

everyday numbers, but have very bad instincts about big numbers. One problem is that we tend to think additively,

as if one billion is about a million plus a million more (give or take). But we need to think mulitplicatively in

situations like this. One billion is  .

So you could have just taken your answer to Problem 17 and multiplied it by      to get your answer to

Problem 18. Of course, you would probably still need to do some calculations to make sense of the answer.

Fermi Problems

James Boswell wrote,

              Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it.
                                                                                                                                      ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE · 361

But math proves this wrong. There is actually a third kind of knowledge: Knowledge that you figure out for
yourself. In fact, this is what scientists and mathematicians do for a living: they create new knowledge! Starting
with what is already known, they ask "what if..." questions. And eventually, they figure out something new,
something no one ever knew before!

Even for knowledge that you could look up (or ask someone), you can often figure out the answer (or a close
approximation to the answer) on your own. You need to use a little knowledge, and a little ingenuity.

Fermi problems, named for the physicist Enrico Fermi, involve using your knowledge, making educated guesses,
and doing reasonable calculations to come up with an answer that might at first seem unanswerable.

                       Example

Here's a classic Fermi problem: How many elementary school teachers are there in the state of Hawaii?

You might think: How could I possibly answer that? Why not just google it? (But some Fermi problems
we meet will have -- gasp! -- non-googleable answers.)

First let's define our terms. We'll say that we care about classroom teachers (not administrators,
supervisors, or other school personnel) who have a permanent position (not a sub, an aide, a resource room
teacher, or a student teacher) in a grade K-5 classroom.

But let's stop and think. Do you know the population of Hawaii? It's about  people. (That's

not exact, of course. But this is an exercise is estimation. We're trying to get at the order of magnitude of

the answer.)

How many of those people are elementary school students? Well, what do you know about the population
of Hawaii? Or what do you suspect is true? A reasonable guess would be that the population is evenly
distributed across all age groups. That would give a population that looks something like this:

age range # of people

0 - 9         125,000

10 - 19 125,000

20 - 29 125,000

30 - 39 125,000

40 - 49 125,000

50 - 59 125,000

60 - 69 125,000

70 - 79 125,000

We'll assume people don't live past 80. Of course some people do! But we're all about making simplifying
assumptions right now. That gives us eight age categories, with about 125,000 people in each category.

An even better guess (since we have a large university that draws lots of students) is that there's a "bump"
around college age. And some people live past 80, but there are probably fewer people in the older age
brackets. Maybe the breakdown is something like this? (If you have better guesses, use them!)
362 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

age range # of people

0 - 9     125,000

10 - 19 130,000

20 - 29 140,000

30 - 39 125,000

40 - 49 125,000

50 - 59 125,000

60 - 69 120,000

> 70      105,000

So, how many K-5 students are in Hawaii? That covers about six years of the 0-9 range. If we are still

going with about the same number of people at each age, there should be about 12,500 in each grade for a

total of                 K-5 students.

OK, but we really wanted to know about K-5 teachers. One nice thing about elementary school: there
tends to be just one teacher per class. So we need an estimate of how many classes, and that will tell us
how many teachers.

So, how many students in each class? It probably varies a bit, with smaller kindergarten classes (since
they are more rambunctious and need more attention), and larger fifth grade classes. There are also smaller
classes in private schools and charter schools, but larger classes in public schools. A reasonable average
might be 25 students per class across all grades K-5 and all schools.

So that makes            K-5 classrooms in Hawaii. And that should be the same as the
number of K-5 teachers.

How good is this estimate? Can you think of a way to check and find out for sure?

So now you see the process for tackling a Fermi problem:

  · Define your terms.
  · Write down what you know.
  · Make some reasonable guesses / estimates.
  · Do some simple calculations.

Try your hand at some of these:

Introduction

The word "geometry" comes from the ancient Greek words "geo" meaning Earth and "metron" meaning
measurement. It is probably the oldest field of mathematics, because of its usefulness in calculating lengths, areas,
and volumes of everyday objects.
The study of geometry has evolved a great deal during the last 3,000 years or so. Like all of mathematics, what's
really important in geometry is reasoning, making sense of problems, and justifying your solutions.
The mathematician Henri Poincaré said that

              Geometry is the art of good reasoning from bad drawings.

This insight should guide your study in this chapter. You should never trust a drawing. You might find that one
line segment appears to be longer than another, or an angle looks like it might be 90 degrees. But "appears to be"
and "looks like" are simply not good enough. You have to reason through the situation and figure out what you
know for sure and why you know it.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    Reflect on your learning of geometry in the past. What is geometry really about? Also think about these
    questions:

       · What is a point?
       · What is a line? A segment? A ray?
       · What is a plane?
       · What is a circle?
       · What is an angle?
       · Which of these basic objects can be measured? How are they measured? What kinds of tools are

          useful?

                                                                                       373
 Tangrams

  Tangrams are a seven-piece geometric puzzle that dates back at least to the Song Dynasty in China (about 1100
  AD). Below1 you will find the seven puzzle pieces. Make a careful copy (a photocopy or printout is best), cut out
  the puzzle pieces, and then use them to solve the problems in this section.

  Whenever you solve a tangram puzzle, your job is to use all seven pieces to form the shape. They should fit
  together like puzzle pieces, sitting flat on the table; no overlapping of the pieces is allowed.
  You can trace around your solutions to remember what you have done and to have a record of your work.

                                                                        Problem 1

      Use your tangram pieces to build the following designs2. How many can you make?

      (These are all separate challenges. Each one requires all seven pieces. Once you solve one, trace your
      solution. Then try to solve another one.)

    Follow these directions on your own:
       · Draw any triangle on your paper.
       · Draw a second triangle that is different in some way from your first one. Write down a sentence or
          two to say how it is different.
       · Draw a third triangle that is different from both of your other two. Describe how it is different.
       · Draw two more triangles, different from all the ones that came before.

    Compare your triangles and descriptions with a partner. To make "different" triangles, you have to change
    some feature of the triangle. Make a list of the features that you or your partner changed.
Triangles are classified according to different properties. The point of learning geometry is not to learn a lot of
vocabulary, but it's useful to use the correct terms for objects, so that we can communicate clearly. Here's a quick
dictionary of some types of triangles.

Remember that "geometry is the art of good reasoning from bad drawings." That means you can't always trust
your eyes. If you look at a picture of a triangle and one side looks like it's longer than another, that may just mean
the drawing was done a bit sloppily.

                                           Notation: Tick marks

Mathematicians either write down measurements or use tick marks to indicate when sides and angles are
supposed to be equal.

If two sides have the same measurement or the same number of tick marks, you must believe they are equal
and work out the problem accordingly, even if it doesn't look that way to your eyes.

      What do you notice? What does this suggest about the angles in a triangle?
  You may remember learning that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180°. In your class, you now have lots of
  examples of triangles where the sum of the angles seems to be 180°. But remember, our drawings are not exact.
  How can we be sure that our eyes are not deceiving us? How can we be sure that the sum of the angles in a triangle
  isn't 181° or 178°, but is really 180° on the nose in every case?

                                                                   Think / Pair / Share

      What would convince you beyond all doubt that the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180°? Would
      testing lots of cases be enough? How many is enough? Could you ever test every possible triangle?

 History: Euclid's axioms

  Often high school geometry teachers prove the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°, usually using some facts
  about parallel lines. But (maybe surprisingly?) it's just as good to take this as an axiom, as a given fact about how
  geometry works, and go from there. Perhaps this is less satisfying than proving it from some other statement, and
  if you're curious you can certainly find a proof or your instructor can share one with you.

      In about 300BC, Euclid1Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. was the first
      mathematician (as far as we know) who tried to write down careful axioms and then build from those
      axioms rigorous proofs of mathematical truths.

                                                   Euclid

Euclid had five axioms for geometry, the first four of which seemed pretty obvious to
mathematicians. People felt they were reasonable assumptions from which to build up
geometric truths:

1. Given two points, you can connect them with a straight line segment.
2. Given a line segment, you can extend it as far as you like in either direction, making a line.
3. Given a line segment, you can draw a circle having that segment as a radius.
4. All right angles are congruent.
The fifth postulate bothered people a bit more. It was originally stated in more flowery language, but it was
equivalent to this statement:
5. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°.
It's easy to see why this fifth axiom caused such a ruckus in mathematics. It seemed much less obvious than the
other four, and mathematicians felt like they were somehow cheating if they just assumed it rather than proving
it had to be true. Many mathematicians spent many, many years trying to prove this fifth axiom from the other
axioms, but they couldn't do it. And with good reason: There are other kinds of geometries where the first four
axioms are true, but the fifth one is not!
For example, if you do geometry on a sphere -- like a basketball or more importantly on the surface of the Earth
   386 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

  -- rather than on a flat plane, the first four axioms are true. But triangles are a little strange on the surface of the
  earth. Every triangle you can draw on the surface of the earth has an angle sum strictly greater than 180°. In fact,
  you can draw a triangle on the Earth that has three right angles2Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0
  Unported., making an angle sum of 270°.

                                                      Triangle with three right angles on a sphere.

  On a sphere like the Earth, the angle sum is not constant among all triangles. Bigger triangles have bigger angle
  sums, and smaller triangles have smaller angle sums, but even tiny triangles have angle sums that are greater than
  180°.
  The geometry you study in school is called Euclidean geometry; it is the geometry of a flat plane, of a flat world.
  It's a pretty good approximation for the little piece of the Earth that we see at any given time, but it's not the only
  geometry out there!

Repeat the following process several times (at least 10) and keep track of the results (a table has been
started for you).
388 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

· Pick three strips of paper. (The lengths do not have to be all different from each other; that's why
   you have multiple copies of each length.)

· Try to make a triangle with those three strips, and decide if you think it is possible or not. (Don't
   overlap the strips, cut them, or fold them. The length of the strips should be the length of the sides of
   the triangle.)

Your goal is to come up with a rule that describes when three lengths will make a triangle and when
they will not. Write down the rule in your own words.

    Compare your rule with other students. Then use your rule to answer the following questions. Keep in
    mind the goal is not to try to build the triangle, but to predict the outcome based on your rule.

       · Suppose you were asked to make a triangle with sides 40 units, 40 units, and 100 units long. Do you
          think you could do it? Explain your answer.

       · Suppose you were asked to make a triangle with sides 2.5 units, 2.6 units, and 5 units long. Do you
          think you could do it? Explain your answer.

You probably came up with some version of this statement:

                                                           Theorem: Triangle Inequality

    The sum of the lengths of two sides in a triangle is greater than the length of the third side.

Of course, we know that in geometry we should not believe our eyes. You need to look for an explanation. Why
does your statement make sense?

Remember that "geometry is the art of good reasoning from bad drawings." Our materials weren't very precise,
so how can we be sure this rule we've come up with is is correct?
Well in this case, the rule is really just the same as the saying "the shortest distance between two points is a straight
line." In fact, this is exactly what we mean by the words straight line in geometry.

SSS Congruence

We say that two triangles (or any two geometric objects) are congruent if they are exactly the same shape and the
same size. That means that if you could pick one of them up and move it to put down on the other, they would
exactly overlap.

                                                                      Problem 4

    Repeat the following process several times and keep track of the results.
       · Pick four strips of paper and form a quadrilateral with them. (If your four strips do not form a
          quadrilateral, pick another four strips.)
       · Try to make two different (non-congruent) quadrilaterals with the same four strips of paper. Record
          if you were able to do so.

                                                   Theorem: SSS (side-side-side) Congruence

    If two triangles have the same side lengths, then the triangles are congruent.
This most certainly is not true for quadrilaterals. For example, if you choose four strips that are all the same length,
you can make a square:

But you can also squish that square into a non-square rhombus. (Try it!)

If you don't choose four lengths that are all the same, in addition to "squishing" the shape, you can rearrange the
sides to make different (non-congruent) shapes. (Try it!)

                                      These two quadrilaterals have the same four side lengths as the two above,
                                                               but the sides are in a different order.

But this can't happen with triangles. Why not? Well, certainly you can't rearrange the three sides. That would be
just the same as rotating the triangle or flipping it over, but not making a new shape.
Why can't the triangles "squish" the way a quadrilateral (and other shapes) can? Here's one way to understand it.
Imagine you pick two of your three lengths and lay them on top of each other, hinged at one corner.

 This shows a longer purple dashed segment and a shorter green segment.
            The two segments are hinged at the red dot on the left.

Now imagine opening up the hinge a little at a time.
                                                                                                                      TRIANGLES AND QUADRILATERALS · 393

As the hinge opens up, the two non-hinged endpoints get farther and farther apart. Whatever your third length is
(assuming you are actually able to make a triangle with your three lengths), there is exactly one position of the
hinge where it will just exactly fit to close off the triangle. No other position will work.
Polygons

It can seem like the study of geometry in elementary school is nothing more than learning a bunch of definitions
and then classifying objects. In this part, you'll explore some problem solving and reasoning activities that are
based in geometry. But definitions are still important! So let's start with this one.

                                                                      Definition

    A polygon is:
       1. a plane figure
       2. that is bounded by a finite number of straight line segments
       3. in which each segment meets exactly two others, one at each of its endpoints.

    Just as the first step in problem solving is to understand the problem, the first step in reading a
    mathematical definition is to understand the definition.

       · Use the definition above to draw several examples of figures that are definitely polygons. (You
          should be able to say why your example fits the definition.)

       · Draw several non-examples as well: shapes that are definitely not polygons. (You should be able to
          say which part of the definition fails for your non-examples.)

A few comments about polygons:
  · The line segments that make up a polygon are called its edges and the points where they meet are called its
      vertices (singular: vertex).

                                                                                       394

· Because of properties (2) and (3) in the definition, the boundaries of polygons are not self-intersecting.

               Not a polygon.

· Polygons are named based on the number of sides they have.

Angle Sum

You know that the sum of the interior angles in any triangle is 180°. Can you say anything about the angles in
other polygons?
You probably know that rectangles have four 90° angles. So if if all quadrilaterals have the same interior angle
sum, it must be 360° (since 4 × 90° = 360°).
But notice: We don't necessarily have any reason to believe this constant sum would be true. Remember that SSS
congruence is true for triangles, but not for any other polygons. Triangles are special, and we shouldn't assume
that true statements about triangles will hold true for other shapes.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    Any quadrilateral can be split into two triangles, where the vertices of the triangles all coincide with the
    vertices of the quadrilateral:

    Use the pictures above to carefully explain why all quadrilaterals do, indeed, have an angle sum of 360°.

      triangles so that the vertices of the triangles all coincide with the vertices of the hexagon.

    A regular polygon has all sides the same length and all angles the same measure.

For example, squares are regular quadrilaterals -- all four sides are the same length, and all four angles measure
90°. But a non-square rectangle is not regular. Even though all of the angles are 90°, the sides are not all the
same length. Similarly, a non-square rhombus is not regular. Even though the sides of a rhombus are all the same
length, the angles can be different.

Platonic Solids

Of course, we live in a three-dimensional world (at least!), so only studying flat geometry doesn't make a lot of
sense. Why not think about some three-dimensional objects as well?

    A polyhedron is a solid (3-dimensional) figure bounded by polygons. A polyhedron has faces that are flat
    polygons, straight edges where the faces meet in pairs, and vertices where three or more edges meet.
    The plural of polyhedron is polyhedra.

    Look at the pictures of solids below, and decide which are polyhedra and which are not. You should be
    able to say why each figure does or does not fit the definition.

Remember that a regular polygon has all sides the same length and all angles the same measure. There is a similar
(if slightly more complicated) notion of regular for solid figures.

                                                                      Definition

    A regular polyhedron has faces that are all identical (congruent) regular polygons. All vertices are also
    identical (the same number of faces meet at each vertex).
    Regular polyhedra are also called Platonic solids (named for Plato).

If you fix the number of sides and their length, there is one and only one regular polygon with that number of sides.
That is, every regular quadrilateral is a square, but there can be different sized squares. Every regular octagon
looks like a stop sign, but it may be scaled up or down. Your job in this section is to figure out what we can say
about regular polyhedra.

On Your Own
Work on the following exercises on your own or with a partner. You will need to make lots of copies of the regular
polygons below. Copy and cut out at least:

  · 40 copies of the equilateral triangle,
  · 15 copies of the square,
  · 20 copies of the regular pentagon, and
  · 10 copies each of the hexagon, heptagon, and octagon.

You will also need some tape.

1. In any polyhedron, at least three polygons meet at each vertex. Start with the equilateral triangles: Put three
   of them together meeting at a vertex and tape them together. Then close them up so they form a solid shape.
   Can you complete this shape into a platonic solid? Be sure to check that at every vertex you have exactly
   three triangles meeting.

2. Now repeat this process, but start with four equilateral triangles around a single vertex. Then close them up
   so they form a solid shape. Can you complete this into a platonic solid? Be sure to check that at every
   vertex you have exactly four triangles meeting.

3. Repeat this process with five equilateral triangles, then six, then seven, and so on. Keep going until you are
   convinced you understand what's happening with Platonic solids that have triangular faces.

4. When you are done with triangular faces, move on to square faces. Work systematically: Try to build a
   Platonic solid with three squares at each vertex, then four, then five, etc. Keep going until you can make a
   definitive statement about Platonic solids with square faces.
404 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

   5. Repeat this process with the other regular polygons you cut out: pentagons, hexagons, heptagons, and
      octagons.

You must have noticed that the situation for Platonic solids is quite different from the situation for regular
polygons. There are infinitely many regular polygons (even if you don't account for size). There is a regular
polygon with n sides for every value of n bigger than 2. But for solids, we have the following (perhaps surprising)
result.

                                         Theorem

There are exactly five Platonic solids.

The key fact is that for a three-dimensional solid to close up and form a polyhedron, there must be less
than 360° around each vertex. Otherwise, it either lies flat (if there is exactly 360°) or folds over on itself (if there
is more than 360°).

                                                                 Problem 9

Based on your work in the exercises, you should be able to write a convincing justification of the Theorem
above. Here's a sketch, and you should fill in the explanations.

   1. If a Platonic solid has faces that are equilateral triangles, then fewer than 6 faces must meet at each
      vertex. Why?

   2. If a Platonic solid has square faces, then three faces can meet at each vertex, but not more than that.
      Why?

   3. If a Platonic solid has faces that are regular pentagons, then three faces can meet at each vertex, but
      not more than that. Why?

   4. Regular hexagons cannot be used as the faces for a Platonic solid. Why?
   5. Similarly, regular n-gons for n bigger than 6 cannot be used as the faces for a Platonic solid. Why?

Line Symmetry

If you can flip a figure over a line -- this is called reflecting the figure -- and then it appears unchanged, then the
figure has reflection symmetry or line symmetry. A line of symmetry divides an object into two mirror-image
halves. The dashed lines below are lines of symmetry:

Compare with the dashed lines below. Though they do cut the figures in half, they don't create mirror-image
halves. These are not lines of symmetry:

Rotational Symmetry

If you can turn a figure around a center point less than a full circle -- this is called a rotation -- and the figure

center of rotation, and the smallest angle you need to turn is called the angle of rotation.

Translational Symmetry

A translation (also called a slide) involves moving a figure in a specific direction for a specific distance. A vector
(a line segment with an arrow on one end) can be used to describe a translation, because the vector communicates
both a distance (the length of the segment) and a direction (the direction the arrow points).

  A design has translational symmetry if you can perform a translation on it and the figure appears unchanged. A

 Tessellations

  A tessellation1 is a design using one ore more geometric shapes with no overlaps and no gaps. The idea is that
  the design could be continued infinitely far to cover the whole plane (though of course we can only draw a small
  portion of it).

  Many tessellations have translational symmetry, but it's not strictly necessary. The Penrose tiling shown below2
  does not have any translational symmetry.

It's actually much harder to come up with these "aperiodic" tessellations than to come up with ones that have
translational symmetry. So we'll focus on how to make symmetric tessellations.
The first two tessellations above were made with a single geometric shape (called a tile) designed so that they can
fit together without gaps or overlaps. The third design uses two basic tiles. Tessellations are often called tilings,
and that's what you should think about: If I had tiles made in this shape, could I use them to tile my kitchen floor?
Or would it be impossible?

Work on these exercises on your own or with a partner. You will need lots of copies (maybe 10-15 each) of each
shape below. In each problem, focus on just a single tile for making your tessellation.

                                                              Theorem: Tessellations

    Any triangle will tessellate. So will any quadrilateral.
The explanation for this comes down to what you know about the sums of angles. The sum of the angles in a
triangle is 180°.

So if you make six copies of a single triangle and put them together at a point so that each angle appears twice,
there will be a total of 360° around the point, meaning the triangles fit together perfectly with no gaps and no
overlaps.

You can then repeat this at every vertex, using more and more copies of the same triangles.

On Your Own
Work on the following exercises on your own or with a partner. Here's how you can create your own Escher-like
drawings.
1. Select your basic tile. The first time you do this, it's easiest to start with a simple shape that you know will
tessellate, like an equilateral triangle, a square, or a regular hexagon.
2. Draw a "squiggle" on one side of your basic tile.

3. Cut out the squiggle, and move it to another side of your shape. You can either translate it straight across or
rotate it.

4. It's important that the cut-out lines up along the new edge in the same place that it appeared on its original edge.
5. Tape the squiggle into its new location. This is your basic tile. On a large piece of paper, trace around your tile.
Then move it the same way you moved the squiggle (translate or rotate) so that the squiggle fits in exactly where
you cut it out.

6. The shape will still tessellate, so go ahead and fill up your paper.
7. Now get creative. Color in your basic shape to look like something -- an animal? a flower? a colorful blob?
Add color and design throughout the tessellation to transform it into your own Escher-like drawing.

them both.

Building Towers

For this activity, you will need some construction materials:
  · You'll need lots of toothpicks.
  · You'll also need something to connect the toothpicks together. The best material for this is mini
      marshmallows; you can stick the ends of the toothpicks into the marshmallows to connect them. You can
      also use pieces of clay, bits of gummy candies, or other similar (sticky) material.

                                                                     Problem 16

    Try this as a warm-up activity. Grab exactly six toothpicks. Your job is to make four triangles using all six
    toothpicks. You cannot break any of the toothpicks or add any other materials besides the marshmallow
    connectors.

    Now comes the main challenge. You have ten minutes to build the tallest free-standing structure that you
    can make. "Free-standing" means that it will stand up on its own. You can't hold it up or lean it against
    something. When the ten minutes are up, back away from your tower and measure its height.

Introduction

In the 1950's and 1960's, historians couldn't agree on how the Polynesian islands -- including the Hawaiian
islands -- were settled. Some historians insisted that Pacific Islanders sailed deliberately around the Pacific
Ocean, relocating as necessary, and settling the islands with purpose and planning. Others insisted that such a
navigational and voyaging feat was impossible thousands of years ago, before European sailors would leave the
sight of land and sail into the open ocean. These historians believed that the Polynesian canoes were caught up in
storms, tossed and turned, and eventually washed up on the shores of faraway isles.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

       · How could such a debate ever be settled one way or the other, given that we can't go back in time to
          find out what happened?

       · What kinds of evidence would support the idea of "intentional voyages"? What kinds of evidence
          would support the idea of "accidental drift"?

       · What do you already know about how this debate was eventually settled?

 Hklea

  The Polynesian Voyaging Society (PVS) was founded in 1973 for scientific inquiry into the history and heritage of
  Hawaii: How did the Polynesians discover and settle these islands? How did they navigate without instruments,
  guiding themselves across ocean distances of 2500 miles or more?
  In 1973-1975, PVS built a replica of an ancient double-hulled voyaging canoe to conduct an experimental voyage
  from Hawaii to Tahiti. The canoe was designed by founder Herb Kawainui Kne and named Hklea ("Star of
  Gladness").
  On March 8th, 1975, Hklea was launched. Mau Piailug, a master navigator from the island of Satawal in
  Micronesia, navigated her to Tahiti using traditional navigation techniques (no modern instruments at all).

                                                                   Think / Pair / Share

         · What are some mathematical questions you can ask about voyaging on Hklea?
         · What kinds of problems (especially mathematics problems) did the crew have to solve before setting

            off on the voyage to Tahiti?
         · What are you curious about, with respect to voyaging on Hklea?

  When you teach elementary school, you will mostly likely be teaching all subjects to your students. One thing you
  should think about as a teacher: How can you connect the different subjects together? Specifically, how can you
  see mathematics in other fields of study, and how can you draw out that mathematical content?
  In this chapter, you'll explore just a tiny bit of the mathematics involved in voyaging on a traditional canoe. You
  will apply your knowledge of geometry to create scale drawings and make a star compass. And you'll use your
  knowledge of operations and algebraic thinking to plan the supplies for the voyage. The focus here is on applying
  your mathematical knowledge to a new situation.
  One of the first things to know about Hklea1 is what she looks like. You can find more pictures

    Here's some information about the dimensions of Hklea. Your job is to draw a good scale model of the
    canoe, like a floor plan.

       · Hklea is 62 feet 4 inches long. (This is "LOA" or "length overall" in navigation terms. It means
          the maximum length measured parallel to the waterline.)

       · Hklea is 17 feet 6 inches wide. (This is "at beam" meaning at the widest point.)
       · You can see from the picture that Hklea has two hulls, connected by a rectangular deck. The deck

          is about 40 feet long and 10 feet wide.
    Imagine you are above the canoe looking down at it. Draw a scale model of the hulls and the deck. Do not
    include the sails or any details; you are aiming to convey the overall shape in a scale drawing.
    You will use this scale drawing several times in the rest of this unit, so be sure to do a good job and keep it
    somewhere that you can find it later.
    Note: You don't have all the information you need! So you either need to find out the missing information

From the webpage above, you learned:

              The quartermaster is responsible for provisioning the canoe -- loading food, water and all needed supplies,
              and for maintaining Hklea's inventory. While this is not an on board job, it is critical to the safe and efficient
              sailing of the canoe.

                                                                      Problem 3

    quartermaster and the captain with provisioning the canoe for one leg of the voyage. You need to write a
    preliminary report for the quartermaster, documenting:

       1. Which leg of the trip are you focused on? (See the map below.)
       2. How long will that leg of the trip take? Explain how you figured that out.
       3. How much food and water will you need for the voyage? Explain how you figured that out.

The rest of this section contains pointers to information that may or may not be helpful to you as you make your
plans and create your report. Your job is to do the relevant research and then write your report. You should include
enough detail about how you came to your conclusions that the quartermaster can understand your reasoning.
Pick a leg of the route:
Here's a picture of the route planned for the Worldwide Voyage, which you can find at the Worldwide Voyage
website: http://www.hokulea.com/worldwide-voyage/ and a full-sized map here: https://tinyurl.com/WWVmap.
On the map, the different colors correspond to different years of the voyage. A "leg" means a dot-to-dot route on
the map.

After you pick a leg of the voyage, you'll need to figure out the total distance of that leg. This tool might help (or
you can find another way): http://www.acscdg.com/.
Here is some relevant information to help you figure out how long it will take Hklea to complete your chosen
leg:

  · The first trip from Hawaii to Tahiti in 1976 took a total of 34 days. (You probably want to use the tool
      above to compute the number of nautical miles.)

Plan the provisions:
Here is some information about provisions.
                                                                                                                                       WORLDWIDE VOYAGE · 445

· Hklea can carry about 11,000 pounds, including the weight of the crew, provisions, supplies, and
   personal gear.

· The supplies (sails, cooking equipment, safety equipment, communications equipment, etc.) account for
   about 3,500 pounds.

· The crew eats three meals per day and each crew member gets 0.8 gallons of water per day.

· For a trip that is expected to take 30 days, the quartermaster plans for 40 days' worth of supplies, in case of
   bad weather and other delays.
 Navigation

  The following is from http://pvs.kcc.hawaii.edu/ike/hookele/modern_wayfinding.html.

                 A voyage undertaken using modern wayfinding has three components:
                 Design a course strategy, which includes a reference course for reaching the vicinity of one's destination,
                 hopefully upwind, so that the canoe can sail downwind to the destination rather than having to tack into the
                 wind to get there. (Tacking involves sailing back and forth as closely as possible into the wind to make progress
                 against the wind; its very arduous and time-consuming, something to be avoided if at all possible, particularly
                 at the end of a long, difficult voyage.)
                 During the voyage, holding as closely as possible to the reference course while keeping track of (1) distance
                 and direction traveled; (2) one's position north and south and east and west of the reference course and (3) the
                 distance and direction to the destination.
                 Finding land after entering the vicinity of the destination, called a target screen or `the box'.

  So how is the navigation done -- especially component (2) -- through thousands of miles of open ocean? You
  can't see land. How can you hold closely to the reference course? How can you keep track of distance and
  direction traveled? How can you even know if you're going in the right direction if all you can see is blue ocean
  and blue sky?
  By day, the navigators use their deep knowledge of the oceans. Which way do the winds blow? Which way do the
  prevailing currents move? Clouds in the sky, flotsam in the water, and animal behaviors give them great insight
  into where land might be, and where they are in relation to it.
  By night, they use the stars. In this section, you'll learn just a tiny fraction of what these master navigators know
  about the stars.

                                                                   Think / Pair / Share

 Star Compass

  A fundamental tool for navigators on Hklea and other voyaging canoes is a star compass. Here's a picture of
  Mau Piailug2 and a star compass3 he used in his teaching.

The object in the center of the circle represents the canoe. The shells along the outside represent directional points.
The idea is to imagine the stars rising up from the horizon in the east, traveling through the night sky, and setting
past the horizon in the west. They move like they're on a sphere surrounding the Earth (it's called the celestial
sphere).

                                                                      Problem 4

    Nainoa Thompson developed a star compass with 32 equidistant points around a circle. (Note this is more
    points than in Mau's star compass pictured above.) You will first try to make a rough sketch of Nainoa's
    star compass based on this information.

       · Place 32 points around the circle so they are equally spaced.
       · The arcs between these equidistant points are called "houses." You will label each house with its

          Hawaiian name. Start with the four cardinal points:
                                                           kau: North.
                                                            Hema: South.
                                                            Hikina: East.

                                                         Komohana: West.
                                                                                                                                                       NAVIGATION · 449

       · The four quadrants also get names. (These cover all of the houses in the quadrant, so label them in
          the appropriate place inside the compass.)

                                                        Koolau: northeast.
                                                         Malani: southeast.
                                                         Kona: southwest.
                                                        Hoolua: northwest.

       · Moving from kau to Hikina (clockwise), there are seven houses. They are labeled in order as you
          move away from kau:

                                      Haka: "empty," describing the skies in this house.
                                N Leo: "the voices" of the stars speaking to the navigator.

                                                      Nlani: "the heavens."
                                    Manu: "bird," the Polynesian metaphor for a canoe.

                                                Noio: the Hawaiian tern (a bird).
                                                           ina: "land."

                                    L: "sun," which stays in this house most of the year.

       · The compass has a vertical line of symmetry, so there are the same seven houses in the same order as
          you move from kau to Komohana (counterclockwise).

       · The compass also has a horizontal line of symmetry. Use that fact to label the houses from Hema to
          Hikina (counterclockwise) and from Hema to Komohana (clockwise).

How is the star compass used in navigation? There are lots of ways. Here's a (very!) quick overview:

  · The canoe is pictured in the middle of the star compass, with all of the houses around.
  · Winds and ocean swells move directly across the star compass from north to south or vice versa.

         If the swells are coming from ina Koolau, they will be heading in the direction ina Kona. (Look
            at your star compass and trace out this path.)

         If the wind is coming from Nlani Malani, it will be heading towards Nlani Hoolua. (Look at your
            star compass and trace out this path.)

  · Stars stay in their houses, but also in their hemisphere. They do not move across the center of the circle.
  · Just like the sun, they rise in the east and set in the west.

         A (Sirius) rises in L Malanai and sets in L Kona. (Look at your star compass and trace out this
            path.)

         Hklea rises in ina Koolau and sets in ina Hoolua. (Look at your star compass and trace out
            this path.)
450 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

A navigator memorizes the houses of over 200 stars. At sunrise and sunset (when the sun or the stars are rising),
the navigator can use the star compass to memorize which way the wind is moving and which way the currents
are moving. The navigator can then use that information throughout the day or night to ensure the canoe stays on
course.

                                                                Think / Pair / Share

    Look again at the time-lapse picture of the stars:

       · Describe how this shows that stars "stay in their houses" and in their hemisphere as they move
          through the night sky.

       · The star Ke alii o kona i ka lewa (Canopus), rises in Nlani Malanai. Where does it set?

When teaching navigation while sitting on land, it's perfectly fine to have a rough sketch or model of the star
compass. But if you really have to do the navigation, you need to make a very, very precise star compass.
Imagine Nainoa Thompson, who navigated Hklea on the final leg of her journey from Hawaii to Rapa Nui, an
island even smaller and lower than Niihau. You have to be within 30 miles of Rapa Nui to see it. But a mistake
of even one degree would have led to Hklea being 60 miles off course. And if you end up drifting in the open
ocean and supplies run out? Well...
                 NAVIGATION · 451

Nainoa Thompson
452 · MATHEMATICS FOR ELEMENTARY TEACHERS

                                                                      Problem 5

    Now that you have a rough sketch of the star compass and know what it should look like, your job is to
    draw one that's as perfect as possible. That means you want to draw:

       1. A perfect circle (well, as perfect as possible). What tools can you use to do that? What tools would
          ancient Polynesian navigators have had to use?

       2. Thirty-two points around the circle that are exactly evenly spaced apart. (What tools would help
          you? What tools would ancient Polynesian navigators have had to use?)

       3. When you have finished, label your perfectly drawn star compass with the houses.

Of course, a star compass on a piece of paper isn't so useful when you're out on a canoe. How do you position
it properly? And how do you keep it from getting lost, damaged, or soaking wet? You paint it on the rails of the
canoe, permanently!

Look back at the drawing of Hklea. Find the "kilo" (navigator's seat) in the rear (aft) of the canoe. There is
actually one navigator's seat on either side of the deck.

                                                                      Problem 6

    Go back to the scale drawing of Hklea that you made in Problem 1. Add the navigator's seats to your
    drawing. You will then add the star compass to the rails as follows:

       1. Start with the kilo (seat) on the left (port) side of the canoe. That will be the center of your star
          compass. Imagine looking to the right. You want to see the star compass markings on the rails when
          you look to the right. Of course, Hklea is not a circular canoe, and the navigator doesn't sit at the
          center. So how can you make the markings in the right places?

       2. Now repeat that process, using the seat on the right (starboard) side of the canoe.

Nainoa Thompson has said:

Initially, I depended on geometry and analytic mathematics to help me in my quest to navigate the ancient way.
However as my ocean time and my time with Mau have grown, I have internalized this knowledge. I rely less
on mathematics and come closer and closer to navigating the way the ancients did.

Really he is still doing a lot of mathematics; it's just mathematics that he has internalized and that is now
second nature to him. The ancient navigators may not have spoken of their navigation techniques in the same
modern language we've been using -- compass points and perfect circles and degrees. But their mathematical
understanding was truly astonishing.
