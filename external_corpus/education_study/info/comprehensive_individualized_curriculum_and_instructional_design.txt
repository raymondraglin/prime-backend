Guiding Principles for Developing
Comprehensive and Meaningful Instruction for
Individuals with Complex Needs

                                                             Sheldon Loman, Portland State University

         Individuals with complex needs require supports from multiple providers across
multiple instructional domains. Designing and implementing effective supports for
individuals with complex needs requires intentional committed collaboration from all
stakeholders. This chapter introduces guiding principles for designing comprehensive
instructional supports for individuals with complex needs that should create a
conceptual and practical frame for the successive chapters of this text. Each of these
guiding principles is a vast topic with multiple associated texts and resources.
Therefore, within this chapter, practical resources are provided to help readers develop
their repertoire of tools for designing effective and meaningful supports for individuals
with complex needs.
                                                                                                                                                                               2

Six Guiding Principles for Developing Comprehensive Supports
         1. Plan with the individual and family
         2. Promote self-determination throughout the assessment, intervention, and
             monitoring process
         3. Examine the current and future inclusive environments
         4. Utilize Universal Design for Learning (UDL) principles in developing
             modifications and supports within inclusive environments
         5. Implement evidence-based practices to individualize instruction
         6. Use data to make decisions to improve instruction

Guiding Principle 1: Plan with the Individual and Family
An essential first step to designing and implementing instruction for individuals with
disabilities (IWD) is to plan with the individual and their family. Person-centered
planning is a process used with IWD and others that is key to implementing supports
for the individual (e.g., social workers, speech and language therapists, special
educators). The purpose of person-centered planning is to establish positive,
collaborative, meaningful, and individualized programs for IWD (Claes, Van Hove,
Vandevelvelde, Loon, & Schalock, 2010). There are several person-centered planning
models such as Planning Alternative Tomorrows with Hope (PATH; Pearpoint, O'Brien,
& Forest, 1993), Personal Futures Planning (O'Brien & Lovett, 1992), McGill Action
Planning (Vandercook, York, & Forest, 1989), and the Picture Method (Holburn,
Gordon, & Vietze, 2007). All of these models are designed to center the supports and
services for IWD with the individual and their families.
                                                                                                                                                                               3

         Choosing Outcomes and Accommodations for Children (COACH, Giangreco et
al., 2011) is a comprehensive, yet practical approach to collaborative instructional
planning for IWD who require intensive supports. The COACH process is designed to
focus on promoting achievement for IWD within inclusive settings. There are two parts
of COACH: Part A guides families and educators to determine a student's educational
program; and Part B guides the team to translate the family-identified priorities into
goals and objectives. Part A involves a family interview that helps IWD and their
families identify valued life outcomes and prioritize learning outcomes within selected
curriculum areas. Part A concludes with the student team identifying general supports
that will improve access and participation in the student's educational program. These
general supports outline accommodations, modifications, and individuals essential to
implementing a successful inclusive program for a student. Part B of COACH then
guides the team to translate these supports into measurable annual goals and short-
term objectives. Finally, the team delineates a "Program-at-a-glance" that is shared
with everyone who supports the student.

         A resource for assisting IWD plan their supports and services is the website
www.imdetermined.org. The "One-Pager" from this resource is a practical tool that
can be used by students and their teams to share strengths, preferences, interests,
and needs with new teachers, employers, case managers, and other people who may
support the students. A template is provided that allows students to type or handwrite
and embed pictures within this one-page document. Examples are provided on this
website for how this tool can be used. Overall, the "One-Pager" is a tool that can be
                                                                                                                                                                               4

used with students to ensure that they are the center of their instructional
programming.

         Person-centered planning outlines life-long dreams for the individual and plans
to help them achieve them. The process brings together the individual, their family,
and support-service providers (e.g., special and general educators, social workers,
community support providers) to collaborate in designing a cohesive instructional
program that addresses the individuals' values. This person-centered team
(sometimes called an instructional team) will follow a student along in their program, its
members consistently updating one another to improve the outcomes for the individual
and their family.
Guiding Principle 2: Promote Self-Determination throughout the Assessment,
Intervention, and Monitoring Process
When implementing programs for IWD it is important to seek their perspective on the
types and levels of supports they need. However, often times IWD struggle to express
their preferences and are not provided with opportunities to engage in activities to
promote their self-determination. For educators of IWD, promotion of self-
determination is foundational throughout the assessment, intervention, and monitoring
process.

         Promoting self-determination has become best practice in the education of IWD.
Self-determination is a broad construct in which no single practice or package of
practices applies. Based on work from Wehmeyer et al. (2011) and Walker et al.
(2011), self-determination comprises three dimensions in which an individual needs to
                                                                                                                                                                               5

develop: (a) causal agency (an individual's control of events), (b) proxy agency
(provision of supports and assistance allowing the individual to control events), and (c)
opportunities to act upon the environment. These dimensions and specific skills are
displayed in Figure 1 below.

Figure 1. Framework of Self-determination Dimensions and Skills/Conditions
(from Loman et al., 2010)

         Preference Assessments. During the assessment process, self-determination
can be promoted through the use of preference assessments. Preference
                                                                                                                                                                               6

assessments include the student in identifying reinforcers as well as identifying
meaningful activities and materials. Interviews of significant others regarding a
student's preferences are a good starting point. However, it is important to include the
individual student in his or her own preference assessment. The use of direct
observations of students interacting with different activities and materials is the most
reliable way to obtain this information.

         Several helpful resources for promoting self-determination are available through
the Zarrow Center for Learning Enrichment at the University of Oklahoma
(http://www.ou.edu/education/centers-and-partnerships/zarrow.html). The center
provides preference-indicator tools for individuals of all ages:

    · Child Preference indicators
         (http://www.ouhsc.edu/thecenter/products/documents/ChildPreferenceIndicator
         s_rev1107.pdf),

    · Personal Preference indicators
         (http://www.ouhsc.edu/thecenter/products/documents/CLL-
         UCEDD_Personal_Preference_Indicators_June%202006.pdf), and

    · Employment Support indicators
         (http://www.ouhsc.edu/thecenter/products/documents/EmploymentSupportIndi
         cators.pdf).

These tools can assist IWD in identifying preferences and promoting their self-
determination.

         A systematic preference assessment involves the direct observation of an
individual with different stimuli and observing their interactions with the materials or
                                                                                         7

activities. Common methods for this are free-access preference assessments and

forced-choice preference assessments. In a free-access preference assessment

(shown below in Figure 2), the assessor makes multiple materials or activities that may

be preferred by the student readily available. The student's interactions with the

materials or activities are recorded to identify the most preferred items. See a sample

template below:

Complete the table below noting how long the student engages with the

materials/activities during the session.

Figure 2. Free-Access Preference Assessment Template

         A forced-choice preference assessment involves selecting a specific number of
materials or activities and presenting them in pairs in a random fashion. At the
conclusion of a forced-choice preference assessment, a hierarchy of preferred
materials or activities is determined. An example of a forced-choice template is
available at:

         Self-determination practices. Five practices identified as having evidence for
promoting self-determination for IWD (Loman, Vatland, Strickland-Cohen, Horner, &
                                                                                                                                                                               8

Walker, 2010; Vatland et al., 2011) were: (a) use person-centered planning methods; (b)
use teacher-directed instructional strategies; (c) teach students skills needed to self-
direct learning; (d) create and maintain a system that involves family supports and
family involvement; and (e) organize environments to provide enriched opportunities,
supports, models, and resources. In their practice guide, Loman et al. (2010) provide a
definition of the practice, level of evidence and social validity, a brief summary of
support for the practice, instructions for how to implement the practice, and identified
barriers or limitations of the practice.

         The promotion of self-determination is critical to the development of an effective
and meaningful program for IWD. The practices and procedures presented within this
chapter and the remainder of this text should be framed with promoting self-
determination in mind.
Guiding Principle 3: Examine the Current and Future Inclusive Environments

         Mapping Objectives to Activities in Inclusive Environments. After planning
with the individual and understanding their preferences, the next step to designing an
effective inclusive instructional program is to examine the instructional environments.
When examining the current and future environments, identify their current goals and
objectives within the context of an age-appropriate inclusive instructional setting. A
common tool used for this is the Infused
Skills Grid (Peak Center Inc., 1999;
http://www.cde.state.co.us/cdesped/accommodationsmanual_infusedskillsgrid). The
Infused Skills Grid should be completed by inserting the student's current objectives in
the horizontal rows. Then, complete the schedule of a typical student's day (it is
                                                                                                                                                                               9

important that this schedule be based on a same-age peer without a disability). Using
the tool, the student's instructional team will identify when the objectives can be met
within the typical instructional settings. Usually all objectives can be addressed within
at least 90% of the typical schedule. A facilitator of this process, usually a special
educator, can help the team think of ways the objectives can be met within inclusive
environments. If an objective cannot be met within the inclusive environments, the
facilitator should ask the team if the objectives should be revised to be more
appropriate for a student within this setting.

         Identifying Strengths and Barriers within Inclusive Settings. A daily
schedule analysis (sometimes referred to as an ecological inventory; Figure 3) is used
to analyze the schedule and instructional environments within typical settings. Similar
to the Infused Skills Grid, the first step in completing this tool is to outline the classes
and environments the student would attend if he or she did not have a disability.
Following the columns in the daily schedule analysis tool, specify for this
class/environment: (a) the activities that all students engage in; (b) natural supports that
already exist for all students; (c) target skills that the focus student needs to develop in
order to participate in these activities; and (d) recommended accommodations and
modifications to promote participation for the focus student. A video example of a
completed daily schedule analysis with an explanation is provided in the following link:
http://my.brainshark.com/Daily-Schedule-Analysis-Simulation-1-39562592

         Breaking Down Tasks within Inclusive Environments. The daily schedule
analysis provides a broad picture of instructional targets and modifications needed for
an individual student. To break down specific target skills needed to be successful in
                                                                                                                                                                             10

inclusive environments, a task analysis should be conducted. A task analysis involves
breaking down the steps of a routine or task. These individual steps are then analyzed
for variations in cues and prompts to determine how to provide instruction that
promotes generalization of the skills.

         An example of a completed task-analysis form is provided below (Figure 4).
Using this task-analysis form, identify a logical step sequence for completing the
routine. Make sure to provide brief, but specific information in the step to prompt the
learner. For example, instead of "student will turn the door knob to the right" state
"turn the door knob." Using this consistent language will help those implementing the
plan identify verbal prompts to use with a student and help the student identify the
relevant features to cue their behavior. Next, identification of stimuli that could be
varied for each step should be notated in the adjacent column. Finally, data codes from
0 (no opportunity) to 1 (most intrusive level of prompting; e.g., physical prompting) to 2
(less-intrusive level of prompting; e.g., gestural prompting) to 3 (least intrusive level of
prompting; e.g., verbal prompting) to 4 (independent) are used to empirically document
student progress. A second sheet (Figure 5) is provided to allow for anecdotal and
qualitative data collection of student and teacher performance within the task. For

Guiding Principle 4: Utilize Universal Design for Learning Principles in Developing
Modifications and Supports
Planning instruction for IWD requires collaboration between general and special
educators (e.g., special education, speech and language therapist, occupational
therapist). This team of educators should be guided by the information compiled from
the person-centered planning process, student preference assessments, and
assessment of the instructional environments. All of this information will be utilized to
                                                                                                                                                                             14

embed a student's individualized instruction within the instruction of the Common Core
State Standards and College Career Readiness Standards within the general education
settings.

         The principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL; CAST, 2011) create a
framework for collaborative creation of curricula that involves both general and special
educators. A short You-Tube video presenting UDL from the Center for Applied
Special Technology demonstrates this framework (CAST;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDvKnY0g6e4). The primary UDL principles for
providing individuals with multiple means of representation, expression, and
engagement lay a foundation for designing Common Core units and lessons that
promote the participation of all learners.

         Developing a unit plan for Common Core content areas that address IWD in
general-education classrooms takes a coordinated effort from the instructional team.
Falco (2014; modified from Tamarkin, n.d.) created a unit/lesson redesign worksheet
(Figure 6) that can be used by instructional teams to ensure they are incorporating UDL
into their lessons. Within this worksheet, the team outlines the Common Core state
standards and lesson objectives that are being addressed. Then, the team outlines
how students will demonstrate their learning and what they currently do to teach these
skills. In the adjacent columns of the worksheet, instructional teams can then identify
ways they may augment their instruction to ensure that the principles of UDL are
incorporated in their lessons. View this video clip to see how a biology teacher has
utilized UDL within their instruction:

Guiding Principle 5: Implement Evidence-Based Practices to Individualize
Instruction
Implementation of effective instructional practices is the critical step that brings all of
the guiding principles together. In 2014, the National Professional Development Center
on Autism Spectrum Disorders (NPDC) has updated their autism intervention literature
review on evidence-based practices for children, youth, and young adults with Autism
Spectrum Disorders (ASD). In their review they identified 27 practices that were
considered "evidence-based." The document in its entirety is provided here:
http://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/sites/autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/files/2014-EBP-Report.pdf

         The NPDC has also developed evidence-based practice (EBP) briefs for 24 of
the identified EBPs available here: http://autismpdc.fpg.unc.edu/content/briefs. These
briefs provide a description of each of the practices, the evidence supporting the use
of the practices, and step-by-step instructions for implementing those practices.
Additionally, the NPDC and the Ohio Center for Autism and Low Incidence (OCALI)
have developed online modules for understanding each of these EBPs. Click on the
following link and register for a free account to access this resource:

         Ensuring that EBPs are embedded in inclusive environments is a challenge for
all educators. Scheduling and collaboration with the instructional team using the tools
already presented in this chapter will assist with this process. To further assist in the
process, Loman (2014) has framed a number of the EBPs within the UDL framework
                                                                                                                                                                             17

(Figure 7). This graphic may be helpful for instructional teams to determine how to
best support IWD in the Common Core content areas.

Guiding Principle 6: Use Data to Make Decisions to Improve Instruction
Every step of the process in designing and implementing a comprehensive instructional
program for IWD relies on the use of data. A number of tools presented throughout
this chapter may be used as sources of data to outline effective supports for IWD. The
COACH process (Giangreco, Cloninger, & Iverson, 2011) provides valuable information
that brings together information from individuals, their families, and school
professionals. These data are used to outline general supports and annual goals and
objectives for students. Preference assessments are another good source of data for
better understanding the learner and how to engage them throughout the learning
process. Additionally, the use of the daily schedule analysis and task analyses are
critical to guiding meaningful and effective instruction. Furthermore, data from
individualized plans of support such as behavior-support plans or curriculum-based
measures within the classroom will provide essential information to monitor the
progress of IWD.

         Conclusion. The six guiding principles presented in this chapter frame the
process of supporting IWD in inclusive settings. Led in partnership with the individual
and their family (ideally the student should lead this meeting), instructional teams of
individuals with complex support needs should consistently review data at least
quarterly to ensure all stakeholders are synergistically heading in a positive direction.
Data from Individualized Education Program (IEP) goals should be discussed as well as
how the student is engaging in the general-education curriculum. These team
meetings should always be guided by an agenda that presents current data and seeks
to remove barriers to success for the student. In order for these meetings to be
                                                                                                                                                                             19

effective, team members should consistently assume the following roles: Recorder
(types and distributes meeting minutes), Data Analyst (compiles and presents data of
student progress), Time Keeper (ensures topics are addressed in a timely fashion), and
Facilitator (keeps the meeting running; ideally the student). An individual student
meeting agenda template is provided below (Figure 8).

Naturalistic AAC Communication Intervention

                                                        Samuel Sennott, Portland State University

"...model, model, model..." --Patty Cassidy, CCC-SLP
         It was a crisp autumn day when I departed my graduate class in

augmentative and alternative communication alongside my course instructor Patty
Cassidy. It was one of those sublime moments after an inspiring class when you
find yourself thinking deeply about the subject matter. I remember innocently
enough asking her what she thought was most important about language learning
for children who could not use their voice to meet their full daily communication
needs. At that point we stopped on the steps of the College's building and she
shared that she thought modeling the communication systems we were using with
the children was the most important principle. She tapped me on the shoulder as
we were walking away and said, "model, model, model... remember that, Sam."
Walking away inspired from the class session and conversation, I had little idea
exactly how important those words and the concept they represent are for the
language acquisition process of children who have difficulty speaking. Five years
later I found myself defending a Ph.D. dissertation on the subject of teaching adults
to model using Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) to help children
learn how to use those AAC systems.
                                                                                                                                                                       23

         I remember finding classic texts on language input and motherese such as
Snow and Ferguson (1978) and realizing how long people have been interested in
the importance of modeling language interactively to children. The following quote
exemplifies the spirit of naturalistic communication interventions.

         When asked how a parent might best support a child's learning of language,
Roger Brown (in the introduction to the seminal Snow and Ferguson, [1978, p. 26])
provided the following response: "How can a concerned mother facilitate her child's
learning of language?" His answer was, "Believe that your child can understand
more than he or she can say, and seek, above all to communicate. To understand
and be understood. . . . If you concentrate on communicating, everything else will
follow." The research on communication interventions for children with disabilities
impacting their ability to communicate provides evidence that these same high
expectations and the use of AAC modeling based interventions can produce
benefits for individuals with CCN. The challenge is how to better provide a rich
communication environment full of models of language, engagement, high
expectations, and opportunities for participation. When these conditions are
provided, there is good reason to think that the learning of language ". . . will
follow."

         This chapter introduces AAC, shares select intervention resources, and then
introduces a naturalistic AAC intervention strategy, MODELER.
                                                                                                                                                                       24

What Is AAC?
Child language development is impacted by the interaction of the child's abilities in
all domains such as motor, vision, hearing, and language (Siegel & Cress, 2002).
For individuals with disabilities that impact their ability to meet their daily
communication needs using speech, language acquisition can be empowered
through providing access to Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)
(Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013).
AAC Definition
"AAC includes all forms of communication (other than oral speech) that are used to
express thoughts, needs, wants, and ideas. We all use AAC when we make facial
expressions or gestures, use symbols or pictures, or write. People with severe
speech or language problems rely on AAC to supplement existing speech or
replace speech that is not functional. Special augmentative aids, such as picture
and symbol communication boards and electronic devices, are available to help
people express themselves. This may increase social interaction, school
performance, and feelings of self-worth. AAC users should not stop using speech if
they are able to do so. The AAC aids and devices are used to enhance their
communication." American Speech-Hearing Association, retrieved from:
asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC/.

         There are many first-hand accounts of individuals who have found alternate
ways to communicate (Brown, 1964; Creech, 1992; Koppenhaver, Yoder, &
Erickson, 2002). As a whole, their writings, combined with research documenting
               25

efficacy express the message that despite not being able to speak, it is possible to
become a competent communicator by utilizing AAC (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013,
Romski & Sevcick, 1996).

         The goal of AAC, described by Porter (2007), is to give people the ability to
meet socially valued daily language needs efficiently, specifically, intelligibly, and
independently. This is accomplished both through using AAC tools and by
providing AAC intervention and training to support the individual using AAC.

         One fear many parents and professionals have is that by using AAC system
components to assist in communication, the child's speech development will be
impeded. Fortunately, this is not the case. Evidence suggests that AAC not only
does not impede development, but may even support speech development (Millar,
Light, & Schlosser, 2006). Parents, teachers, and therapists also may be concerned
about prerequisites for commencing AAC interventions, but as Cress (2002) points
out, there are no prerequisites for AAC.
                                                                            26

Communication and Language
Communication is sending messages. Language is the coded system of symbols
with agreed-upon patterns and rules that enables a community of people to interact
and communicate with each other and to efficiently send messages (Beukelman &
Mirenda, 2013). There are important social purposes of communication such as (a)
expressing needs and wants, (b) feeling social closeness, (c) sharing information, (d)
fulfilling established conventions of social etiquette (Light, 1988) and (e) engaging
with oneself in an internal dialogue (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013). Communicative
competence is not necessarily an inherent trait, but something that must be learned
and scaffolded. Communicative competence can be organized into linguistic,
operational, social, and strategic domains (Light, 1989).

    The National Joint Committee, A Communication Bill of Rights (NJC, 1992) is an
important document outlining the human and civil rights of people with complex
communication needs. This document draws connections to the concepts of
inclusion, self-determination, universal design for learning, the least dangerous
assumption, and valuing the human dignity of all people. Some of these rights are
more straightforward, such as "8. The right to have access at all times to any
                                                                                                                                                                       28

needed augmentative and alternative communication devices and other assistive
devices, and to have those devices in good working order." Yet others are much
more nuanced, "7. The right to have communication acts acknowledged and
responded to, even when the intent of these acts cannot be fulfilled by the
responder." Taken together, they serve as an important message for pre-service
teachers.

 National Joint Committee, A Communication Bill of Rights (NJC, 1992)

 All persons, regardless of the extent or severity of their disabilities, have a basic
 right to affect, through communication, the conditions of their own existence.
 Beyond this general right, a number of specific communication rights should be
 ensured in all daily interactions and interventions involving persons who have
 severe disabilities. These basic communication rights are as follows:

    1. The right to request desired objects, actions, events, and persons, and to
          express personal preferences, or feelings.

    2. The right to be offered choices end alternatives.
    3. The right to reject or refuse undesired objects, events, or actions, including

          the right to decline or reject all proffered choices.
    4. The right to request, and be given, attention from and interaction with

          another person.
    5. The right to request feedback or information about state, an object, a

          person, or an event of interest.
    6. The right to active treatment and intervention efforts to enable people with

          severe disabilities to communicate messages in whatever modes and as
          effectively and efficiently as their specific abilities will allow.
    7. The right to have communication acts acknowledged and responded to,
          even when the intent of these acts cannot be fulfilled by the responder.
    8. The right to have access at all times to any needed augmentative and
          alternative communication devices and other assistive devices, and to
          have those devices in good working order.
    9. The right to environmental contexts, interactions, and opportunities that
          expect and encourage persons with disabilities to participate as full
          communication partners with other people, including peers.
    10. The right to be informed about the people, things, and events in one's
          immediate environment.
    11. The right to be communicated with in a manner that recognizes and
          acknowledges the inherent dignity of the person being addressed,
          including the right to be part of communication exchanges about
          individuals that are conducted in his or her presence.
    12. The right to be communicated with in ways that are meaningful,
          understandable, and culturally and linguistically appropriate.

AAC modeling Rationale

Language input is an important factor in child language acquisition (Gallway &
Richards, 1994; Snow & Ferguson, 1978; Tomasello, 2003). During early childhood,
children using speech are exposed to large levels of language input and interaction
(Hart & Risley, 1995; Tomasello, 2003). The amount of words speaking children
typically hear in their first four years ranges from approximately eight to 50 million
words (Hart & Risley, 1995). Similarly to children who learn to communicate using
speech, language input is important to children who use other expressive
communication modalities as well, such as individuals with complex
communication needs (CCN) who require augmentative and alternative
communication (AAC). These individuals may communicate expressively using
various modalities such as unaided AAC modalities such as sign languages,
gestures, vocalizations, and speech, or aided AAC modalities such as with paper
and computer based communication displays (e.g., iPad). The overall AAC
language acquisition literature emphasizes the role of language input for individuals
with CCN who require AAC (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013). For example, research in
sign language acquisition stresses the importance of language input, demonstrating
that given appropriate sign language input, children can develop complex language
abilities using sign language (Bavelier, Newport, & Supalla, 2003; Newport &
Supalla, 2000).

         Individuals with CCN who use aided AAC systems, such as those with
picture or word systems that may be paper or computer based, also require
                                                                                                                                                                       31

appropriate language input (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013; Romski & Sevcik, 1996).
However, these individuals rarely observe models of AAC use, creating what Smith
& Grove (2003) called an asynchrony of language input to output. That is, these
individuals experience spoken language as input, but are expected to communicate
expressively using AAC. Consequently, a number of AAC interventions have been
developed in an attempt to provide this missing language input to individuals with
CCN as a way to stimulate language gains (see single-subject meta-analysis;
Sennott, Light, & McNaughton, 2014). For clarity and conciseness, Sennott et al.
(2014) used the term AAC modeling to consolidate and describe the various types
of language input provided through AAC modalities. Various AAC modeling
intervention packages have positively impacted four different language areas: (a)
pragmatics in the form of turn taking (e.g. Kent-Walsh, Binger, & Hasham, 2010); (b)
semantics in the form of receptive and expressive vocabulary (e.g. Drager et al.,
2006); (c) syntax in the form of increasing multi-symbol utterances (e.g. Binger,
Kent-Walsh, Berens, Del Campo, & Rivera, 2008); and (d) morphology in the form of
increased use of target structures (Binger, Maguire-Marshall, & Kent-Walsh, 2011).
analysis results also indicated that because of the packaged nature of the
interventions, parsing out modeling as the sole independent variable impacting
student performance was difficult. In addition to the AAC modeling variable, time
delay, and responding or recasting, were included in the majority of the reviewed
packaged interventions. Those three intervention variables have been included in a
                                                                                                                                                                       32

newly designed intervention package called ModelER (Model, Encourage, Respond)
for Read and Talk.

MODELER Strategy

         The ModelER intervention package is built on theory supporting the
importance of language input (Gallway & Richards, 1994; Hart & Risley, 1995,
Tomasello, 2003) and effective instructional components as highlighted in AAC
modeling research (Sennott et al., 2014).

Figure 1. MODELER for Read and Talk
         ModelER. The Improving Partner AAC Training (ImpAACt) series of studies

(e.g. Binger et al., 2008) effectively used variants of a specific strategy instructional
package (Read, Ask, and Answer [RAA] and related variants) to teach partners to
better engage in shared storybook reading with beginning communicators who use
AAC. These studies demonstrated positive results in the form of increased
communication turns (Kent-Walsh et al, 2010; Rosa-Lugo & Kent-Walsh, 2008),
increased multi-symbol communication turns (Binger et al., 2008, Binger, Kent-
Walsh, Ewing, & Taylor, 2010), and increased use of morphological forms (Binger,
                                                                                                                                                                       33

Maguire-Marshall, & Kent-Walsh, 2011). ModelER has been designed to build on
the findings of the ImpAACt research, but to optimize for generalization beyond the
context of shared storybook reading, because of the importance of promoting
interventions that can be used across multiple contexts (e.g. play, academics,
snack/ meal times) for children learning to use AAC.

Figure 2. Video example of MODELER found at http://youtu.be/d4tI-xqVoDE
         The major components of ModelER are (a) model - modeling AAC use

(Sennott et al., 2014); (b) encourage - encouraging communication through time
delay/ expectant delay (e.g. Halle, Baer, & Spradlin, 1981); and (c) respond -
responding to child communication attempts through AAC recasting (Camarata &
Nelson, 2006; Nelson et al., 1996; Harwood, Warren, & Yoder, 2003). AAC modeling
is the foundation of the intervention and is designed to provide a model of language
                                                                                                                                                                       34

use (pragmatics), content (semantics), and form (syntax and morphology) for the
individual with CCN learning to use AAC. Encouragement to communicate, in the
form of a time delay, is designed to provide opportunities for the child to initiate a
communication turn, showing them that the adult communication partner is waiting
and interested. As a support to the child's communication attempts, the respond
component focuses on recasting the child's utterance by repeating their utterance,
and expanding it in a meaningful way. The respond component is designed as an
adaptation of the recasting intervention described in Nelson et al. (1996), which
described that the recast maintains the basic meaning of what they child says,
focuses on expanding the length of utterance, and keeps the conversation turns
flowing. The hope is that the child can better attend to the more advanced
structures being modeled because the utterance is based on what they just
previously communicated. Put together, the sequence of modeling, encouraging by
waiting for the child to take a turn, and then responding through AAC recasting is
designed to create individualized, language-rich multi-turn communication
sequences.

         Read and Talk. The Read and Talk component of the package refers to
reading a book and talking about it through making comments or asking questions.
The Read and Talk components create a learning environment that would be typical
of an early childhood shared reading context. Variants of shared storybook
reading, such as dialogic reading, that includes engaging in conversation with the
child, has extensive empirical support in general education (Dale et al., 1996;
Whitehurst et al., 1988), special education (Ezell & Justice, 2005), and AAC specific
literatures (Bedroisian, 1999; Sennott et al., 2014; Stephenson, 2009).
                                                                                                                                                                       36

Dialogic reading interventions (e.g. Dale et al., 1996) are comprised of reading with
children and asking targeted questions, which matches the approach the RAA
strategy ImpAACt studies took (e.g. Kent-Walsh et al., 2010), which primarily
focused on reading and question asking. By including commenting in addition to
question asking, the approach taken in the Read and Talk components of the
intervention expands on the scope of adapting dialogic reading for children using
AAC. The decision to include both commenting and question asking was made
because question asking has the potential to place the child into a passive or
question prompt-dependent role, which could be detrimental to individuals who
require AAC (Light & Kelford Smith, 1993). Instead, this approach is designed to
teach the communication partners to model multiple pragmatic functions,
comments, and questions, with the objective of promoting the children taking
increasingly independent turns such as making comments or asking questions
themselves.

Conclusion
For children who are minimally verbal and use AAC it is important to develop an
expressive language system and to have an appropriate language learning
environment. The iPad combined with a communication app has become a very
popular AAC system, creating more opportunities for these children to have access
to expressive language. A number of useful resources have been introduced in this
chapter from various web sources. Specifically, the naturalistic communication
intervention MODELER has been introduced.

         In considering the language learning environment of children, we know about
the importance of language input described across general language acquisition
(Gallway & Richards, 1994; Gerken, 2008; Hart & Risley, 1995, Tomasello, 2003),
sign language (Bavelier et al., 2003; Newport & Supalla, 2000), and AAC (Goosens,
                                                                                                                                                                       38

Crain, & Elder, 1992; Romski & Sevcik, 1996; Sennott et al., 2013; Smith & Grove,
2003). AAC researchers have developed interventions that target providing models
of AAC use. Sennott and colleagues have developed a package intervention called
MODELER (Model, Encourage, Respond) that is designed to help the child's
communication partners provide AAC models in an easy, interactive format
throughout the day.

Chapter 3

Principles of Applied Behavior Analysis to Teach

                                                             Kristy Lee Park, George Mason University

         The current chapter will present an overview of Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)
as an effective teaching method. ABA is an approach that, when used properly, can
work to teach a wide range of behaviors to a wide range of participants. ABA is a
research-based science, derived from the experimental analysis of behavior and the
application of those procedures. Multiple studies demonstrate that people's lives can
be improved by learning academic skills (Gardner, Heward, & Grossi, 1994), social
skills (Garcia-Albea, Reeve, Brothers, & Reeve, 2014) and communication (Luczynski &
Hanley, 2013) and by the reduction of problematic behaviors (Roantree & Kennedy,
2012). The foundation of ABA rests on the analysis of environmental influences, such
as what happens before and after a problematic behavior (antecedents and
consequences) to predict when behaviors will increase, decrease, or remain the same.
These principles of reinforcement and punishment will be summarized to highlight the
main procedures that teachers may find effective in the classroom. Finally, this chapter
will end with a case example that will walk through how a teacher applies the principles
and procedures highlighted in this chapter.

         Based on the principles of learning theory, Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is an
applied science, meaning that practitioners use systematic procedures to teach,
resulting in improvements in areas like self-care, communication, academics, behavior
reductions, behavior, and/or recreation and leisure (Allen & Wallace, 2013; Van Camp &
                                                                                                                                                                             44

Hayes, 2012; Wolf, 1978). Behavior analysts approach problems of social significance
from a scientific perspective. It is not a matter of nature versus nurture but a matter of
nature and nurture working together to produce observable changes in behavior
(Skinner, 1974). This focus on social relevance, or social validity, to the individual
marks a division in the field of behaviorism from a strictly experimental or basic
research to an applied research. Baer, Wolfe, and Risley (1968) clarified this distinction
in the seminal article "Some Current Dimensions of Applied Behavior Analysis,"
published in the first issue of the Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, which describes
ABA and outlines the future applications of its characteristics. These seven
characteristics include: applied, behavioral, analytic, conceptual, technological,
effective, and generalizable. When using ABA, one incorporates these components
within a process to teach and evaluate effects of the approach. For example, one
starts with 1) choosing a socially relevant behavior, 2) measuring the behavior, 3) using
data to determine which treatment to use, 4) using data to implement procedures, and
5) using data to evaluate effects of the treatment (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007).
The characteristics of ABA will be described within this 5-step model to show how the
fundamental characteristics are interwoven with data to make a good ABA program.
Select a Socially Relevant Behavior

         ABA is applied, meaning that the targeted behavior is of social importance to the
individual, rather than its importance to theory (Baer et al., 1968). The proposed
behavior change is meaningful to the client and all those who may be affected by the
intervention (i.e., parents, siblings, staff). For each targeted problematic behavior, a
desired behavior is also identified, optimally a behavior that is incompatible with the
                                                                                                                                                                             45

problematic behavior. A common problem is that teachers have too many behaviors
identified for change. Cooper et al. (2007) provide guidance on the selection process
through guiding questions that help teachers set priorities or criteria for choosing one
behavior over another. These include:

    1. Does the behavior pose a danger to the student or others?
    2. Does changing the behavior improve the person's life and is this behavior

         change age-appropriate?
    3. What is the likelihood of success to change this behavior? For example, are

         there sufficient opportunities to show the behavior in the natural environment
         (i.e., classroom) and will teachers and staff reinforce this behavior when
         demonstrated?
    4. Will changing the behavior have long-standing effects or lead to further skill
         development?
    5. Do the benefits of teaching this behavior outweigh the costs (i.e., time,
         resources) needed?
These guiding questions assess the behavior of interest based on safety concerns,
probability of intervention fidelity by the staff who may be involved, and risk-benefit
analysis of the proposed behavior. Social relevance or applicability is therefore worked
into proposed short- and long-term goals, teaching procedures, and potential results
to increase maintenance and generalization of the skill use (Wolf, 1978). Examples can
include social skills to increase peer interactions, fluency of academic skills, decrease
of maladaptive behaviors that interfere with successful interactions with peers and
                                                                                                                                                                             46

staff, self-help skills to build independence, or leisure and recreational skills to improve
quality of life.
Measure the Behavior with a Reliable Data Collection System

         Behavioral means that the behavior itself is the subject matter, so the dependent
variable must be operationalized in observable and measurable terms with the goal of
having inter-observer reliability, or a high percentage of agreement between multiple
observers that the same behavior occurred or did not occur during observations. In
order for direct observations to occur, there must be a precise definition of the
behavior and a measurement system to record the behavior. Choosing a
measurement system depends on how the behavior is exhibited (Alberto & Troutman,
2003). For example, the behavior may be problematic because of how often it occurs
(i.e, too many times or not enough times) or the length of the response (i.e, too short or
too long). When the number of occurrences of the behavior is the problem, one would
choose an event-recording system if the behavior has a specific start and end in order
to teach occurrence, like the number of times a student talks out of turn during
instruction time. If the response does not have a distinct beginning and end, use an
interval recording system. When the length of time the behavior occurs is the problem,
choose duration recording to measure the span of each occurrence. Like duration,
latency measures time; however in this measurement, one measures the elapsed time
after a signal and the onset of the behavior. For example, one could measure the
amount of elapsed time between when the teacher gives the direction and when the
student starts the first problem.
                                                                                                                                                                             47

         The context in which the behavior is exhibited provides a picture of when the
behavior occurs or does not occur in relation to other events (Johnston & Pennypacker,
1993). Observing the changes of behavior requires knowledge of an analytic approach.
To be analytic requires a believable demonstration of the events that caused the
change in behavior. These changes of behavior are empirical demonstrations of
functional relations between antecedent events, behavior, and consequence events.
There are different degrees to this level of analytic behavior change. At the highest
level, research methodology using single-subject research designs (i.e., reversal,
multiple-baseline line) is used to determine if functional control is established, verified,
and replicated (Kennedy, 2005). A less-rigorous level still includes demonstrations of
prediction and control (i.e., baseline or phase with no intervention, intervention phase,
intervention removal, and reintroduction of the intervention) but may have lower levels
of inter-observer reliability of data-collection procedures. The value of the data
depends on the accuracy and reliability of the data to make decision about which
intervention to choose, continuation of the procedures, or when to stop the
intervention.
Select Evidence-Based Treatment Procedures Based on Behavior Contingencies

         Conceptually systematic highlights ABA's reference to the principles and basic
concepts of behavioral development (Baer et al., 1968). Predicting why the behavior
change occurred relies on the established principles in behavior analysis and the past
repertoires of the individual.

         One observes the patterns or relationships (i.e., contingency) between stimuli
before and after behavioral responses. An example of the contingency between the
                                                                                                                                                                             48

antecedent and behavior is provided in the following if-then contingency statements:
The behavior happens only when the antecedent has happened first, and if the
antecedent doesn't happen, the behavior doesn't happen. If the antecedent happens,
the behavior happens as well. The behavior doesn't happen unless and until the
antecedent has happened first. The repeated and predictable patterns between the
antecedent and/or consequent stimuli and the behavior are described as functional
relations. The function of behavior refers to the effect the behavior produces on the
environment and behavior serves two major functions: to obtain desired events (i.e.,
objects, attention) or to avoid/escape events (i.e., work, interaction with others). For
example, a student may cry as a function to get the desired object but the same
behavior for another student may use crying to escape work demands. This is why
ABA focuses on the context and contingencies for each student rather than a
topography-based intervention, in which all students who engage in the same behavior
get the same type of intervention. Interventions focus directly on environmental events
that generate and maintain behavior. It's the antecedents that get the behavior moving
but the consequences that keep the behavior going (Daniels, 2000); therefore, ABA
interventions arrange contingencies of reinforcement to alter the problematic behavior
to make the alternate behavior more effective, efficient, and relevant for the student
(Sugai & Horner, 2006).

         ABA makes interventions specific to the individual, based on the function the
behavior may serve for the person. These can be broadly categorized as function-
based (negative or positive reinforcement) and include antecedent-based (i.e.,
prompts, choice, environmental arrangements) and consequence-based procedures
                                                                                                                                                                             49

(i.e., positive punishment, token economy, response-cost, differential reinforcement
procedures). Antecedent technologies such as modeling, prompting, and prompt-
fading are often used to teach new behaviors, or shape new behaviors by reinforcing
successive approximations (Alberto & Troutman, 2003). Importantly, larger or more
complex skills are broken into component skills (i.e., task analysis) and skills are taught
in a specific teaching sequence (i.e., forward chaining, backward, total-task).
Instructional procedures like discrete trial training (DTT) or errorless learning have also
broken skills into teachable steps then presented in trials, or multiple opportunities,
until performance meets a criterion level.
Implement Procedures with Fidelity

         Effectiveness is the degree of learning, or the amount of change in student
performance, in other words, the change of behavior (either increase or decrease) from
baseline to after the intervention is implemented. Effectiveness looks at student
performance data to modify what is taught (i.e., programs or curricula) as well as how it
is taught. Data, especially data graphed visually, help teachers make decisions to
keep going, revise, or stop an intervention. When student performance is not being
made, contingencies surrounding the learning environment are examined and these
include monitoring and modifying staff behavior.

         Reliability measures and inter-observer agreement data collection provides an
objective look at the consistency of how staff are recording behavior and also how staff
are implementing the programs. A major component of staff performance is
technological, a term that describes the clarity and precision of written procedures so
that others can replicate the teaching. The success of interventions is largely
                                                                                                                                                                             50

dependent on the extent to which they are implemented as designed with accuracy
and consistency (i.e., treatment integrity; Gresham, 1989). To help with consistency,
procedures are operationalized into step-by-step actions with visual prompts that
prompt accurate staff behaviors (Noell et al., 2002). Performance feedback is another
valuable tool for helping staff improve performance in the implementation of
intervention plans (Codding, Livanis, Pace, & Vaca, 2008). In fact, research shows that
when staff implement procedures with high fidelity, rates of problematic behavior are
low, and the inverse is also shown--when there is low treatment fidelity, there is an
increase in problematic behavior (Fryling, Wallace, & Yassine, 2012; St. Peter Pipkin,
Vollmer, & Sloman, 2010).
Evaluate Long-term Effects of Treatment

         ABA is committed to teaching skills that are practical, relevant, and functional
for the student. The last ABA characteristic is generality, which describes whether
interventions produce lasting change in behavior that occurs in all relevant settings. A
student has truly learned the skill when the behavior is shown after a period of time
(e.g., 6 months), untaught scenarios, and novel responses to similar antecedents (Baer,
1982). This happens when practitioners incorporate generalization strategies into
teaching procedures through multiple teaching examples, practice opportunities
outside of the teaching setting, and, importantly, teach the students how to recruit
reinforcement (i.e., teacher attention) through socially acceptable behaviors (Reeve,
Reeve, Townsend, & Poulson, 2007). Incidental teaching has been used to promote
generalization of language skills (Hart & Risley, 1968), social interactions (Strain, 1983),
and reciprocal interactions with peer models (McGee, Almeida, & Sulzer-Azaroff, 1992).
                                                                                                                                                                             51

This teaching procedure occurs in the naturalistic context and consists of a prescribed
chain of student-teacher (or peer-sibling) interactions in which the student initiates a
request (e.g., reaching, pointing, vocalizing) and the item requested is given contingent
upon appropriate asking in the targeted mode.

         In this section, the characteristics of applied behavior analysis were described
within a model that all ABA-based approaches have in common which are: 1) select a
socially relevant behavior, 2) measure the behavior with a reliable data collection
system, 3) select an evidence-based treatment procedure, 4) implement the
procedures with fidelity, and 5) evaluate the long-term effects of the treatment.
Procedures

         This chapter has discussed how student behavior is regulated by
consequences, which are the events that occur after the behavior. The description and
analysis of these contingencies surrounding a behavior is operant conditioning, which
describes the probability of certain behaviors based on the history of consequences
(Skinner, 1974). Reinforcement and punishment are the core tools of operant
conditioning, and both affect the desired behavior: reinforcement increases and
punishment decreases the probability of the desired behavior. Events can be added in
(positive) or removed (negative) from reinforcement and punishment procedures. For
example, positive reinforcement is the addition of a stimulus (i.e. praise, token),
whereas negative reinforcement is the removal of a stimulus (i.e., loud noise, work
demand), and both maintain or increase the frequency of the behavior.
                                                                                                                                                                             52

Procedures to Increase Behaviors
         In negative reinforcement, a stimulus is present, and the occurrence of the

targeted behavior removes the stimulus (Cooper et al., 2007). For example, a difficult
task is presented, the student asks the teacher for help, the difficult task is removed,
and over time the frequency of the student asking the teacher for help increases. With
positive reinforcement, when the targeted behavior occurs, something is added to the
environment, and that behavior is more likely to occur in the future. What often gets
added is called reinforcers and the types of reinforcers include unconditioned
reinforcers (i.e., food, drink) and conditioned reinforcers (i.e., edible, sensory, tangible,
activity, social; Cooper et al., 2007). Reinforcers have different values for different
individuals; therefore, reinforcer assessments are conducted to identify potential
reinforcers. This is done by asking the student, asking others who know the student
well, observing the student, or using trial-based methods (i.e., single, paired, multiple;
Carr, Nicolson, & Higbee, 2000).

         Along with the potential value of reinforcers to the student, other factors related
to effectiveness include when it is provided (i.e., immediacy), the level of effort required
to perform the behavior and the likelihood of the delivery of the reinforcer (i.e.,
response effort), availability of the reinforcer elsewhere, and motivational effect (i.e.,
how much does the student want it based on the state of deprivation or satiation;
Michael, 2000). Reinforcers can be provided on a continuous or an intermittent
schedule, immediately after the behavior or after a delay, and the decision to use one
schedule of reinforcement or another can have predictable effects on the consistency
of performance and rate of response. This determines when the reinforcer is
                                                                                                                                                                             53

provided--immediately or after a delay (i.e., interval schedule) or after a specific
number of responses (i.e., ratio schedule). For example, when a student is learning
addition facts, the teacher may provide continuous reinforcement (after every
response) to get the quickest learning rate, then fade the schedule to reinforcement
after every third response (fixed ratio 3) based on student response.
Decreasing Unwanted Behavior

         Like reinforcement, punishment is defined by its effect, by adding (i.e., positive)
or removing (i.e., negative) something in the environment, to decrease the future
probability of the behavior. The problem with punishment procedures in itself is that
they don't teach what to do instead of the punished behavior, but only provide
temporary decrease with unintended potential side effects (Rolider, A., Cummings, A.,
& Van Houten, R. 1991). Extinction decreases behavior by discontinuing the
reinforcement after a behavior and is used in conjunction with reinforcement such as
differential reinforcement procedures (i.e., alternative, incompatible, other).
Example from the Classroom

         In the kindergarten classroom during center time, Ms. Kang ran over to the train
set to stop Alex from bothering a classmate again. After being put in time out, Alex
returned to the train center and initiated play by shoving a train track into the
classmate's hand. Then he grabbed a train from another peer. Alex was a bright
student, verbal and compliant to teacher requests; however, his behaviors during peer
play restricted interactions. Ms. Kang and Alex's mother agreed that teaching Alex to
play would help reduce aggressive behaviors and facilitate social interactions with
others. For step 1, select a socially relevant behavior, aggression was operationalized
                                                                                                                                                                             54

as unsolicited physical contact with peers (i.e., pushing, pulling, and/or forceful
grabbing, excluding tripping or falling onto peers). The long-term desired behavior was
to ask, wait, and accept the answer "no"; however, the short-term behavior included
appropriate peer social interactions using skills such as getting a peer's attention,
asking peers to play, and sharing objects for one minute.

         For step 2, measure the behavior, an event-recording data sheet was used
during the most problematic routine, center time. Appropriate peer interactions were
task analyzed into teachable steps and measured as the number of correct steps
completed (see Appendix). Ms. Kang and the instructional assistant, Ms. Sanchez,
used the operational definition and data-collection sheet to observe so that they both
agreed that the behavior was measured accurately. Next, both observed the social
interactions of four boys during the train center time using an antecedent-behavior-
consequence data sheet to identify predictable hypotheses such as, when the train
track is started by others, Alex will engage in aggression to obtain items (i.e., remove
the tracks), to start another track he designed. A reinforcer assessment indicated
trains as the highest reinforcer and the absence of a train track at home strengthened
the value of this reinforcer.

         The next step was to select an evidence-based treatment. A differential
reinforcement of alternative (DRA) procedure was used to decrease aggressive
behaviors through extinction (i.e., aggressive behavior no longer resulted in access to
item) and appropriate social interactions was reinforced with access to trains. The task
analysis of peer play with trains was directly taught. The ten steps were printed and
cut out so that Alex could sequence the steps. He then watched a teacher and then
                                                                                                                                                                             55

peer model each step. A backward chaining instructional model was used so that the
teacher prompted the first nine steps and Alex completed the last step independently.
This continued until he mastered all ten steps.

         In addition, the entire class was taught what respecting property and others
looked like during center time and the rules were reviewed before center times. To
neutralize the antecedent, each center activity was postponed until all peers were in
the group. The absence of aggressive behaviors (i.e., one-minute intervals) resulted in
a train sticker and the accumulation of train stickers allowed additional time in the train
centers.

         To measure implementation with fidelity, Ms. Kang and Ms. Sanchez agreed to
both take data for one session during five sessions available using the data sheets
located in the same secured location. The staff teaching steps were laminated and
both teachers reviewed the steps and the data during Thursday morning planning
times. Prior to baseline, the average number of aggressive occurrences was seven,
and afterward, when peer skills were directly taught through a DRA procedure, the
number of aggressive occurrences was zero. During baseline, the correct number of
steps completed was 10%, and after instruction, Alex maintained 80% or higher for
five consecutive days.

         Last, the ABA program was evaluated for effectiveness and generalization.
Based on the data, Ms. Kang continued with the DRA intervention and focused on
generalization of peer skills to other center areas. A checklist of the peer-interactions
task analysis was sent as homework for Alex's mother to work on with Alex and his
other peers.

Summary
    This chapter focused on applied behavior analysis (ABA), the definition, the

characteristics, and the procedures that make this a program that works to teach
desired behaviors. Teachers can design and implement an ABA program using a 5-
step model to:

    1) Select a socially relevant behavior
    2) Measure the behavior using reliable data-collection measures
    3) Select an evidence-based treatment based on the contingencies of the behavior
    4) Implement procedures with fidelity
    5) Evaluate long-term effects

Developing Function-based Interventions

                                                          Sheldon L. Loman, Portland State University
                               (based on an article from Loman, Rodriguez, & Borgmeier, 2014)

         This chapter presents a practical guide for the use of research-based critical
features to design positive behavioral interventions based on the reasons why students
engage in problem behaviors (i.e., the function of student behavior). Research-based
critical features of function-based supports for school personnel to use data from
functional behavioral assessments (FBA) to guide the development of individualized
behavior support plans are presented. Two case examples will illustrate the critical
features for developing function-based supports.

         Function-based supports are individualized interventions developed through the
process of conducting an FBA (Carr et al., 2002). The FBA process involves interviews,
rating scales, and direct observations conducted by trained school professionals. A
mnemonic that has been used to outline the steps in FBA process is DASH (Define,
Ask, See, Hypothesize). To start the FBA process, a behavior must be operationally
defined (it must be observable and measurable). The next step is to ask people close
to the student and the student (when possible) about what triggers and reinforces the
problem behavior. Then, a trained school professional conducts an observation of the
student (See) in the identified routine. Finally, a summary or hypothesis is made
regarding variables affecting the student's behavior.

         Based on data collected in the FBA, an antecedent-behavior-consequence (A-
B-C) sequence is outlined by a summary statement that specifically identifies: (a) when
and where problem behavior occurs and the environmental variables that consistently
                                                                                                                                                                             62

trigger problem behavior (i.e., context and antecedents); (b) an operational definition of
the problem behavior; and (c) the maintaining consequences that follow the problem
behavior(s) suggesting why a student engages in the identified problem behavior (i.e.,
function; for a more comprehensive review of how to conduct FBA see Crone &
Horner, 2003; or O'Neill et al., 1997). Function-based supports are designed using the
FBA summary statement to guide the development and/or selection of interventions
that prevent problem behavior while promoting desired outcomes for students.

         Since FBA was mandated in 1997, several books and manuals have been
published with the intent to teach function-based interventions (e.g., Chandler &
Dahlquist, 2010; Crone & Horner, 2003; O'Neill et al., 1997). Additionally, many states
and school districts have developed training models to teach school-based personnel
to conduct FBAs (Browning-Wright et al., 2007). These texts often present "critical
features" for developing behavioral supports for students with the most significant
behavioral concerns. However, this chapter will heed the call from the field to "scale
down" (Scott, Alter, & McQuillan, 2010) the focus to the basic features of function-
based supports to guide the development of interventions for students with moderate
behavioral problems. Therefore, setting events (events occurring outside of the school
that may affect student behavior) and corresponding strategies have intentionally been
omitted from the critical features presented to emphasize interventions that school
staff may implement to immediately improve the environment, curriculum, and
instruction affecting student behavior.

Resources for Conducting a Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA)
         A number of resources for conducting interviews and observations are available

via the Internet. For example, www.functionbasedthinking.com is a comprehensive
website with a training manual, interview and observation tools, and interactive web
lessons based on the research-based Basic FBA process (Loman, Strickland-Cohen, &
Borgmeier, 2013). At this website, the interview tool that is taught is the modified
Functional Assessment Checklists for Teachers (FACTS; March, Horner, Lewis-Palmer,
Brown, Crone, & Todd, 1999) available at:
https://sites.google.com/a/pdx.edu/functionbasedthinking/home/fba-bsp-instructions-
and-forms. Another useful interview tool for identifying the function of behavior that is
available online is the Motivation Assessment Scale (MAS; Durand, 1990:
http://www.nsseo.org/wp-content/uploads/MAS.pdf). The ABC Recording Form
(Loman, 2009) is taught and used as an observation procedure within the Basic FBA
process: https://sites.google.com/a/pdx.edu/functionbasedthinking/home/fba-bsp-
instructions-and-forms. Another popular tool is the Scatterplot that helps teachers
track student behavior across times and days. This scatterplot tool is available at:

support-via-complex-fba-bip-wraparound-for-students-with-tertiary-level-

the FBA process, review the training materials on www.functionbasedthinking.com and

website offers links to past webinars presenting information on conducting an FBA and
designing function-based supports.

ABC's of Function-Based Supports
         A function-based support plan should include components that (a) address

antecedent triggers to prevent problem behavior, (b) teach alternative and desired
behaviors, and (c) identify appropriate responses to desired and problem behaviors.
Figure 1 illustrates the A-B-C sequence and how function plays a pivotal role in
designing prevention strategies, teaching alternative or replacement behaviors, and
responding to both desired and problem behaviors. In Figure 1, antecedents are
defined as events or stimuli that immediately precede or trigger problem behavior.
Behavior is the observable behavior of concern (i.e., problem behavior). Consequence
is defined as the consistent response to the problem behavior that reinforces the
behavior. This logic is based on applied behavior analytic literature (e.g., Horner,
1994), suggesting function is where problem behavior intersects with the environment
to affect learning. Given this logic, an individual exhibiting problem behaviors has
learned: "Within a specific situation `X' (context), when `A' (antecedent is present) if I do
`B' (problem behavior), then `C' (the maintaining consequence) is likely to occur."
Through experience and repetition, the individual learns that the problem behavior is
effective or "functional" for meeting their needs. Therefore, the individual is likely to
continue to engage in the problem behavior under similar circumstances. Based on this
model, the function of an individual's behavior should guide the selection of each
component intervention (prevention, teaching, and consequence strategies) within a
positive behavior support plan.
                                                                                                                                                                             65

                    Using Assessment to Guide Function-Based Supports
Function-based supports are developed using a clear, detailed summary statement
from the FBA (outlining the antecedents, behaviors, and maintaining consequences
within a specific routine/context). This summary statement should be framed within a
specific routine or context because similar behaviors often serve different functions for
the student in different contexts. For example, a student may predictably hit a peer
during round robin reading so he can be sent to the back of the room to avoid reading
failure in front of peers, and he may also regularly hit a peer at recess so the peer quits
teasing him. Once the team has established a clear understanding of the problem
behavior and the environmental features predicting and maintaining problem behavior
in a given context, then they can develop function-based interventions.

         Above the dotted line in Figure 1, a Competing Behavior Pathway (O'Neill et al.,
1997) visually frames the FBA summary statement to guide function-based support
planning. The FBA summary statement or hypothesis forms the center of the
Competing Behavior Pathway (the antecedent(s), problem behavior(s), and maintaining
function of student behavior) for a prioritized routine or context. Within the Competing
Behavior Pathway the summary of behavior is used to inform identification of the
alternative behavior and desired behavior. Each is defined in Figure 1.

         A completed example of the FBA summary statement in Figure 2 should read,
"During math (routine/context) when Jackson is asked to work independently on a
double-digit multiplication worksheet (antecedent), he fidgets, gets off task, uses foul
language, slams his book, and picks on peers (problem behavior), which typically
results in the teacher asking Jackson to leave the room and go to the principal's office
                                                                                                                                                                             66

(consequence). It is hypothesized that Jackson's behavior is maintained by escaping
the independent math worksheet (function; the "why" or "pay-off")."

         The completed FBA summary statement for Sophia in Figure 3 should read,
"During carpet time (routine/context) when the whole class is receiving instruction and
Sophia is asked to sit quietly in her carpet square for more than five minutes
(antecedent), Sophia fidgets and disrupts the class by yelling or wandering around the
room (problem behavior), which typically results in Sophia's teacher chasing her
around the room, asking her to be quiet, and scolding her about how to behave
(consequence). Given this information, it is hypothesized that Sophia's disruptive
behaviors are maintained by obtaining teacher attention (function; the "why" or
"student pay-off")."

                              Selecting Function-Based Interventions
Using the FBA summary statement, the first step to developing a function-based
support plan involves identifying the (1) desired behavior (long-term goal) and (2) the
natural reinforcers resulting from this behavior (what typical students receive for
performing this behavior; labeled 1 and 2 in Figures 2, 3, & 4). The next step is
identifying an alternative behavior (short-term goal; labeled 3 in the figures) to achieve
the same function as the problem behavior (Carr, 1997). Once the alternative and
desired behaviors have been identified, the focus shifts toward the identification of
function-based interventions. Following identification of the alternative and desired
behaviors, the next focus is teaching these behaviors. The individual should be
provided explicit instruction of how and when to use the alternative behavior
appropriately as well as explicit instruction of the skills (or progression of skills)
                                                                                                                                                                             67

necessary to engage in the desired behavior (O'Neill et al., 1997). Explicit instruction of
the alternative behavior and skills supporting the use of the desired behavior should be
paired with antecedent and consequence interventions. Antecedent interventions
modify the events or stimuli triggering the problem behavior to prevent problem
behavior and concurrently prompt the alternative and/or desired behaviors. Then,
procedures for reinforcing alternative behaviors and desired behaviors should be
identified in such a way that the student receives valued reinforcement based on
reasonable expectations and time frames. Finally, responses to redirect problem
behavior and eliminate or reduce the pay-off for problem behavior should be identified.
The specific critical features of each of these components of a function-based support
plan will be presented in the following sections and are summarized in Figure 2.

                 Critical Features of Function-Based Alternative Behaviors
Begin the function based support plan by developing a clear definition of what the
student should do (versus what not to do). Very often a skill deficit (e.g. academic,
social, organizational, communication) prevents the student from being able to
regularly perform the desired behavior (long-term goal) right away. In Jackson's
example (see Figure 2), the desired behavior is for him to independently complete
double-digit multiplication problems, but he currently lacks the skills to perform this
task. Until this academic skill deficit is bridged, he is more likely to need a way to
avoid or escape a task he cannot complete. Jackson is likely to continue to engage in
or escalate problem behavior to avoid the difficult math task, unless he is provided
another way (alternative behavior) to have this need met.
                                                                                                                                                                             68

         An alternative behavior is an immediate attempt to reduce disruption and
potentially dangerous behavior in the classroom. The alternative behavior should be
viewed as a short-term solution to reduce problem behavior that provides a "window"
for teaching and reinforcing the skills necessary to achieve the long-term goal of the
desired behavior(s). To facilitate decreased problem behavior, it is important the
alternative behavior meets three critical criteria: the alternative behavior must serve
the same function (or purpose) as the problem behavior (Sprague & Horner, 1999),
be as easy as or easier to do than the problem behavior (Horner & Day, 1991) and
be socially acceptable (Haring, 1988). In the early stages of behavioral change it is
recommended to closely adhere to these criteria as one works to convince the student
to stray from the well-established habit and pathway of the problem behavior and
commit to a new alternative behavior to access the desired reinforcer. Over time, the
alternative behavior will be amended to increasingly approximate the desired behavior
(long-term goal). In the initial stages, however, it is important to ensure that the
student perceives the alternative behavior as an efficient way to have their needs met
or they are not likely to give up the problem behavior.

         According to the FBA summary statement for Jackson (Figure 2), he fidgets,
gets off task, displays foul language, slams books, and picks on peers to escape
difficult math tasks. The alternative behavior for Jackson must allow him to escape the
difficult math task (serve the same function as the problem behavior). Asking for a
break addresses this function and requires less energy than the series of tantrum
behaviors described earlier (easier). Additionally, requesting a break is more socially
                                                                                                                                                                             69

acceptable than throwing a tantrum by using foul language and throwing materials in
class.

         In Figure 3, the FBA summary indicates that Sophia is disrupting the class to
access teacher attention. A reasonable long-term behavioral goal for Sophia is to
quietly listen during carpet time, participate when it is her turn, and seek attention at
appropriate times. The first step to help Sophia toward her long-term goal is to select
an alternate behavior that meets the three critical features. First, the alternate behavior
should serve the same function as the problem behavior. In this case, Sophia is
engaging in disruption to access teacher attention. A more appropriate way to request
teacher attention is to raise her hand. Raising her hand to request attention should be
as easy as, or easier, to do than the disruptive behaviors, and it is a socially acceptable
behavior according to Sophia's teacher.

         The main goal of a function-based support plan is overcoming an established
habit and pattern of learning in which the individual uses a problem behavior because it
is functional (i.e., achieving a pay-off). The initial alternative behavior should be
markedly easier to do and more efficient in its pay-off than the problem behavior.
Otherwise, the individual may be less likely to abandon the "tried and true" problem
behavior for the new alternative behavior.

      Teaching the Alternative Behavior, Desired Behavior, and Approximations
Teaching is a critical component of all function-based interventions. Explicit instruction
is encouraged to promote fluency and use of the alternative behavior and the desired
behavior. Explicit instruction increases the likelihood that the individual understands
when, how, and where to use the alternative behavior, as well as the pay-off for using
                                                                                                                                                                             70

the alternative behavior (i.e., the same functional outcome as the problem behavior).
Ideally, instruction occurs with the person(s) and in the setting in which use of the
alternative behavior will occur. While the alternative behavior is a nice starting point, it
is a short-term solution, and over time the focus should shift toward increasing use of
the desired behavior.

         When teaching to promote use of the desired behavior(s), it is important to
understand the extent of the discrepancy between a student's current skills and the
desired behaviors. If there is a large discrepancy, it may be necessary to identify a
progressive instructional plan including instruction of necessary prerequisite skills and
a progression of approximations toward the desired behavior. The progression of
approximations toward the desired behavior would increasingly challenge the student
to take greater responsibility (increasing independence and self-management) to
access the reinforcers. Over time, instruction in the skills promoting use of the desired
behaviors would provide increasing access and exposure to natural reinforcement for
engaging in the desired behavior.

         For example, in Jackson's case, we could conduct an assessment to identify
Jackson's specific skill deficits and instructional needs in math. Then the behavior
specialist would teach Jackson to use a picture card to request to "take a break"
appropriately instead of using foul language and slamming books to avoid work. While
Jackson begins to break the habit of using the problem behavior, we will provide
instruction in multiplication and the prerequisite skills necessary for Jackson to be able
to perform the math worksheets independently (desired behavior). As Jackson builds
mastery in the necessary math and multiplication skills, the need to rely on the
alternative behavior to avoid tasks should decrease. Instruction to address the
                                                                                                                                                                             71

underlying math deficits should ultimately eliminate the need for student problem
behavior.

         As Jackson demonstrates fluency with requesting breaks appropriately and
refraining from slamming his hand on the desk and tearing papers, we would increase
the expectation for requesting breaks. Instead of giving breaks freely, we might limit
Jackson to three break tickets during math, and if he has any leftover tickets he can
cross off two problems from his worksheet. As Jackson's math skills increase, the
expectation may be that he finishes at least five problems before he can request a
break. When first increasing expectations and student responsibility, it is often
necessary to increase reinforcement for engaging in the desired behavior to motivate
the student to take the next step. As Jackson's math skills increase and he can
complete more problems, he is also accessing the natural reinforcement of pride in
work completion. At first it is important to make this explicit by praising student
progress, effort, and work completion by saying such things as, "You should be really
proud of how many problems you completed today."

         In Sophia's case, she would need explicit instruction and practice in raising her
hand and requesting attention. Requesting attention appropriately and reducing
disruption are important, but over time it will be important to increase time between
requests for attention to a schedule that is reasonable for the teacher. The next
approximation may be to systematically reduce the number of requests for attention
(three per carpet time to two, etc.). Additional social skills instruction on appropriate
ways (e.g. conversation starters, eye contact, smiling) and times to obtain adult
attention should increase Sophia's access to positive social attention during non-
instructional times. I ncreasing specific social skills paired with incentives (e.g., earning
                                                                                                                                                                             72

a game with an adult) for fewer requests for attention during instructional times will
help Sophia increase her endurance during instructional times and reduce her need to
solicit attention so frequently. Increased positive interactions and relationships with
adults (the natural reinforcers) should increase and maintain social skill use.

                 Critical Features of Function-Based Prevention Strategies
The next step in developing a function-based support plan is to determine strategies
to prevent the problem behavior. These include antecedent strategies that alter the
triggers to problem behavior. The literature suggests critical features for prevention
strategies that: (a) directly address the features of the antecedent (e.g., task,
people, environmental conditions) that trigger the problem behavior (Kern,
Choutka, & Sokol, 2002) and (b) directly address the hypothesized function of the
problem behavior (Kern, Gallagher, Starosta, Hickman, & George, 2006).

         Jackson (Figure 2, column A) is engaging in problem behavior when presented
with math worksheets (antecedent) to avoid difficult math tasks (function). Prevention
strategies could include reducing the difficulty of his assignment by interspersing
easier problems with addition and subtraction problems with which he can be more
successful. When this is done, his need to engage in problem behavior to escape the
task is prevented or reduced. A number of other prevention strategies have been
shown to address escape-motivated behaviors such as: (a) to pre-correct desired
behavior (Wilde, Koegel, & Koegel, 1992); (b) clarify or simplify instructions to a task
or activity (Munk & Repp, 1994); (c) provide student choices in the activity (Kern &
Dunlap, 1998); (d) build in frequent breaks from aversive tasks (Carr et al., 2000); (e)
shorten tasks (Kern & Dunlap, 1998); (f) intersperse easy tasks with difficult tasks
                                                                                                                                                                             73

(Horner & Day, 1991); and (g) embed aversive tasks within reinforcing activities
(Carr et al., 1994). Choosing the most appropriate intervention will depend on the
specific antecedent and function of behavior identified in the FBA summary (other
possible strategies based on the function of student behavior are presented in Tables 1
and 2).

         Sophia (Figure 3, column A) engages in disruptive behavior when asked to sit
quietly and listen with limited adult attention for five or more minutes at a time
(antecedent) to obtain teacher attention (function). Prevention strategies directly linked
to this function would provide Sophia with frequent teacher attention prior to problem
behavior, such as a check-in during transition to carpet time, giving Sophia jobs as
teacher helper, and seating her near the teacher so it is easier to periodically (every
three to four minutes) provide her with attention. These strategies directly address the
antecedent by reducing longer spans of time in which Sophia is not receiving adult
attention. Prevention strategies that have been effective at addressing attention-
maintained behaviors include: (a) use of peer-mediated instruction (Carter, Cushing,
Clark, & Kennedy, 2005); (b) self-management strategies where student monitors their
behavior to recruit feedback from the teacher (Koegel & Koegel, 1990); (c) provide
assistance with tasks (Ebanks & Fisher, 2003); and (d) provide the student with the
choice of working with a peer or teacher (Morrison & Rosales-Ruiz, 1997). Once again,
choosing the most appropriate prevention strategies will require a match to the specific
antecedent and function of behavior identified in the FBA summary statement.

               Critical Features of Function-Based Consequence Strategies
                                                                                                                                                                             74

Once teaching and prevention strategies have been selected, the next critical step is to
determine strategies to reinforce appropriate behavior and minimize or eliminate payoff
for problem behavior. Although many people associate the word "consequence" with
a punitive response, in behavioral terms consequences can be punitive or pleasant.
Within a Positive Behavior Support (PBS; Carr et al., 2002) framework, the goal is to
minimize the use of aversive consequences. The function (or purpose) of the student's
behavior should guide the selection of strategies to reinforce appropriate behaviors
and minimize payoff for problem behaviors.

         Reinforcing Appropriate Behavior. There are four critical features for identifying
effective reinforcers. The first two are broad strategies to reinforce the alternative
behavior (Petscher, Rey, & Bailey, 2009) and to reinforce desired behavior or
approximations toward the desired behavior (Wilder, Harris, Reagan, & Rasey,
2007). More specific considerations when setting up effective interventions to
encourage behavior are to identify reinforcers valued by the student (Horner & Day,
1991) and to set reasonable timeframes and expectations for the student to
encourage behavior (Cooper, Heron, & Heward, 2007). In our experience there are
two common mistakes in using reinforcement. The first mistake is selecting incentives
that are not valued by the student. The second common mistake is setting goals,
expectations, and time frames that are not reasonable for the student to achieve. If we
identify a desired reward but only offer it to the student for engaging in perfect
behavior, we are oftentimes setting the student up for failure rather than motivating
success. What is reasonable for a student depends on the student's current
performance as well as the discrepancy between this skill and the desired behavior.
                                                                                                                                                                             75

Often, we must begin by reinforcing approximations of the desired behavior in smaller
intervals of time before increasing to closer approximations of the desired behavior
over longer spans of time.

         For Jackson, when he asks for a break (alternative behavior), it is important to
reinforce this behavior by providing a break quickly. If Jackson does not learn that
asking for a break is a more effective and efficient way to get his needs met than the
fidgeting, slamming his hand on the desk, and tearing his papers, he will quickly resort
back to the problem behaviors that have worked so effectively in the past.
Additionally, he may earn a "free choice pass" if he completes a reasonable, specified
number of problems (desired behavior). If Jackson previously has only started one or
two problems on a worksheet, it is probably not a reasonable expectation that
tomorrow he will earn a reward for completing the entire worksheet. A more
reasonable goal might be that he attempts five problems tomorrow to earn the
incentive, a more attainable approximation of the desired behavior. By combining the
option for Jackson to take a break (alternative behavior), modifying the task to make it
easier (antecedent), and adding the incentive of the homework pass (reinforcement),
Jackson's team creates integrated supports that set him up to be successful. The
supports incentivize the desired behaviors and reduce Jackson's need to avoid difficult
tasks through inappropriate behaviors.

         For Sophia, when she raises her hand to request teacher attention (alternative
behavior), it is important to provide teacher attention (reinforcement) immediately.
Additionally, Sophia should receive more frequent attention for engaging in
appropriate, on-task behavior. She can also earn special time with the teacher if she
participates appropriately for the duration of carpet time and is appropriate even when
                                                                                                                                                                             76

not called on every time she raises her hand (desired behavior). Encouraging Sophia
with a highly valued reinforcer like "special teacher time" can be an effective motivator
to challenge her to progress through increasing approximations of the desired
behavior, as long as the expectations in this progression remain reasonable for Sophia.

         Responding to Problem Behavior. Despite our best efforts to set up students
and encourage them to engage in appropriate behavior, it is likely the student will
revert to problem behavior from time to time. Therefore, a function-based intervention
should include specific strategies for responding to problem behavior. These
strategies are redirecting to the alternative behavior at the earliest signs of
problem behavior (Kern & Clarke, 2005) and actively limiting or eliminating the pay-
off for problem behavior (extinction; Mace et al., 1988). At the earliest signs that the
student is engaging in or is likely to engage in the problem behavior, the first and best
option is to briefly remind the student to engage in the alternative behavior and then
reinforce the alternative behavior according to the plan. Additionally, it is critical if the
student does not respond to the prompt, the team has identified a response to the
problem behavior that does not inadvertently reinforce it.

         In Jackson's case, at the earliest sign of problem behavior (e.g. off-task
behaviors, fidgeting), his teacher should remind him he could request a break
(redirection). When Jackson asks for a break appropriately, the teacher should quickly
provide a break and acknowledge him for making a good choice to request a break
appropriately. If Jackson does engage in severe problem behaviors to escape the
task, he may temporarily be able to avoid the task to maintain safety and order in the
classroom. However, responses to remove him from the room should be minimized,
                                                                                                                                                                             77

and if he must be removed, the work should be sent with him with the expectation that
he completes the work when he calms down. Additionally, Jackson could also be
required to come in during recess or after school to complete those tasks to minimize
or eliminate his long-term opportunities to escape the task.

         In Sophia's case at the earliest signs of off-task behavior (fidgeting, looking
around the room), quickly use the visual prompt (limiting the richness of individual
verbal attention) to redirect her to quietly raise her hand to request attention. If she
does so appropriately, quickly provide teacher attention. If Sophia does not respond, it
is important that teacher attention is minimized or eliminated for problem behavior.
Instead of chasing Sophia around the room and having a "talk" with her about right and
wrong, attention to misbehavior should be limited. In many cases it is not safe for a
student to be running around the room, but it is possible to redirect a student in a more
impersonal way (no conversation, brief directions, limited eye contact, etc.) that limits
attention for problem behavior. In contrast, it is essential that when Sophia is engaging
in appropriate behavior she experience rich, high-quality attention so that she clearly
learns the difference between the outcomes for desired versus non-desired behavior.

                                                        Summary
As educators increasingly encounter students with complex academic, social, and
emotional needs, it is imperative they have research-based tools that can be
appropriately and effectively utilized in unique contexts. The research on the
effectiveness of function-based supports is vast, but educators are often missing the
"how to" or "practical" strategies drawn from research. This chapter highlights
"scaled-down" research-based critical features to consider when developing a
                                                                                                                                                                             78

function-based behavior support plan. It illustrates the importance of utilizing the
function of a student's behavior to outline prevention, teaching, and consequence
strategies synergistically to positively impact student outcomes. As a reference, a list
of essential components of behavior interventions presented in the chapter is provided
in Figures 1 and 4. Finally, possible antecedent, behavioral teaching, and consequence
strategies are presented for the functions of obtaining attention (Table 1) and escaping
tasks or stimuli (Table 2).

     · Replace problem behavior by teaching a socially acceptable, efficient behavior that allows
           student to obtain the pay-off/function
                o An appropriate Replacement Behavior:
                                 Serves the same function as the problem behavior
                                 Is easier to do & more efficient than the problem behavior
                                 Is socially acceptable

     · Prevent problem behaviors by directly addressing triggers & prompting replacement
           behaviors based on the function of behavior
                o Prevention Interventions should:
                                 Directly address the identified antecedent/trigger
                                 Directly address the function of the problem behavior
                                 Remind the student to use the replacement behavior

     · Reinforce replacement & desired behaviors based on function/pay off for the student
                o Immediately reinforce the use of replacement behaviors
                o Reinforce desired behaviors by:
                                 Using reasonable goals & expectations
                                 Using a reasonable time frame for achieving goals
                                 Ensure that the reinforce is valued (matches function)

     · Redirect problem behaviors by quickly & effectively redirecting student to replacement
           behavior
                o At the earliest sign of problem behavior:
                                 Redirect or prompt student to the replacement behavior

     · Minimize Reinforcement by ensuring that problem behaviors do NOT pay off for the
           student (i.e. does not result in the function of behavior)
                o When problem behaviors occur, identify a response that does not result in the desired
                      pay-off for the student.

iOS 8 Accessibility

                     Luis F. Pérez, Ph. D., Apple Distinguished Educator

         Released in the fall of 2014, iOS 8 is the latest version of Apple's operating
system for mobile devices such as the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch. This update was
not as significant as iOS 7, with its completely overhauled user interface, but in terms
of accessibility it continues to refine the user experience so that it works even better
and for more people.

         To locate the iOS accessibility features on your device, go to Settings > General
> Accessibility. The features are arranged into five categories. Three focus on the
needs of specific groups: vision, hearing, and learning. In iOS 8, there is a new
category called Media for enabling captions and audio descriptions during video
playback, and the category previously named Physical and Motor (which includes a
number of features for those with motor challenges) has been renamed Interaction.

         A handy option is the Accessibility Shortcut (formerly known as Triple-click
Home), which appears at the bottom of the Accessibility pane in Settings. This shortcut
allows you to enable and disable accessibility features by triple-clicking the Home
button on your device at any time. If you include more than one feature in the
Accessibility Shortcut you will see a popover menu when you triple-click the Home
button. You can choose which features you wish to enable from this menu while you
are reading an e-book, surfing the Web, or checking email, without the need to go
back into Settings.
                                                                                                                                                                             89

         What follows is an overview of the key accessibility features available on iOS
devices, with a special focus on the updates and new features in iOS 8.
Zoom

Zoom in iOS 8 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eH9VHHueSRE
         Apple enhanced the Zoom screen magnification feature in iOS 8 to provide even

more flexibility and customization. Whereas in previous versions you could only zoom
in on the entire screen (by double-tapping with three fingers with Zoom enabled), iOS 8
users now also have the ability to turn on a window mode where only part of the screen
is magnified while the rest of the screen remains at its default magnification.
                                                                                             90

Furthermore, a number of lens filters are available to customize the appearance

of the zoomed-in area of the screen. Lens filter options include:

· Inverted (similar to the Invert Colors feature available in previous versions of iOS,

which reverses the colors for added contrast),

· Grayscale (for removing all color and replacing it with shades of gray),

· Grayscale inverted (similar to inverted but with only shades of grayscale), and

· Low light (which dims the screen somewhat for those with light sensitivity).

Many of the options for customizing Zoom, such as the lens filters, are available from a

popover menu that can be accessed in a number of ways:

·  triple-tapping with three fingers while Zoom is enabled,

·  tapping the handle on the edge of the window in window mode, or

·  tapping a new floating controller that can be enabled in the Zoom

settings. You can move this controller if it gets in your way, and there is even an option

to reduce its opacity when it is inactive. A tap and hold of the controller turns it into a

virtual joystick for panning around the screen with the Zoom lens in window mode.
                                                                                                                                                                             91

Figure 1. Zoom options menu in window mode.
         The popover menu for Zoom also includes options for resizing the lens (the

zoomed part of the screen in window mode) as well as for adjusting the zoom level. To
resize the lens, choose Resize Lens from the popover menu, use the handles to resize
the window according to the user's needs, then tap anywhere outside the lens area to
set its size. To adjust the zoom level, move the slider at the bottom of the popover
menu until the magnification is at the desired level. A maximum magnification level for
the zoom slider can be set in the Zoom settings.
                                                                                                                                                                             92

The keyboard is much easier to use with Zoom in iOS 8. A new Follow Focus feature
allows Zoom to follow the keyboard focus as you type, and you can also choose to
have the keyboard remain at the default 1X magnification while the rest of the screen is
magnified.

VoiceOver
   VoiceOver is the built-in screen reader for iOS devices. For people who are blind,

VoiceOver converts the information on the screen into formats that are more
accessible, such as audio and Braille (when the iOS device is connected to a Bluetooth
Braille display). VoiceOver navigation can be performed in one of two ways:

· Drag your finger around the screen to hear what is under your finger (including items

   in the status bar and the Dock). When you want to select an item (i.e. open an app,
   turn on a setting) double-tap anywhere on the screen (this is the same as a single
   tap when VoiceOver is turned off).

· Use gestures: flick left or right to move the VoiceOver cursor (the black square that

   determines what VoiceOver will read back) then double-tap to make a selection (i.e
   open an app, turn on a setting).
In iOS 8, Apple added Alex, its natural-sounding voice previously only available on the
Mac. As on the Mac, Alex is not limited to VoiceOver, but will work with other iOS
speech technologies such as Speak Selection and the new Speak Screen (more on
those later). However, note that not all devices are supported (check the Apple website
to see if yours is on the supported list), and Siri still has its own voice rather than using
Alex.
                                                                                                                                                                             93

         Building on the handwriting-recognition feature introduced in iOS 7, iOS 8 also
supports Braille input. Both of these special input modes are accessed through the
Rotor, a special gesture for accessing many VoiceOver settings and navigation
options, which involves placing two fingers on the screen and turning a virtual dial.

Figure 2. The Rotor with Speech Rate selected.
         The Rotor is contextual, and the options that are available will depend on what

you are doing. However, you can add and remove options from the Rotor by going to
Accessibility > VoiceOver > Rotor and making sure only the options you want to be
available in the Rotor have a checkmark next to them.
                                                                                                                                                                             94

         In my opinion, command of the Rotor gesture and its options is what allows a
VoiceOver user to get the most out of this powerful screen reader and take its use to
the next level, beyond basic flick and swipe gestures.
With the Rotor, you can:

· adjust VoiceOver settings such as the speech rate and volume at any time, without

   having to leave a web page or email to go into Settings;

· navigate web pages by using the page's structural elements, such as headings,

   links, form elements, and more;

· edit text by accessing options such as copy, paste, and replace; and
· access the previously mentioned special input modes, Handwriting and Braille Input.

Handwriting, which was introduced in iOS 7, can be used to search for apps, enter
text, or navigate web pages by drawing letters on the screen. For example, to search
for the Camera app, you would turn the Rotor to select Handwriting, then draw the first
letter of the app's name (in this case "C") on the screen to hear a list of all apps that
start with that letter. While navigating a web page with the Safari browser you can draw
the letter "H" to navigate a web page by headings, the letter "L" to navigate by links,
and so on. The Handwriting feature supports the following gestures:

· Three-finger swipe up or down: switch between upper-case, lower-case, numbers,

   and punctuation.

· Two-finger swipe left: deletes the last character.
· Two-finger swipe right: adds a space.
· Three-finger swipe right: adds a new line when entering text.
                                                                                                                                                                             95

· Two-finger swipe up or down on the Home screen: navigates a list of apps once you

   have entered a few letters to narrow down your search (apps do not have to be on
   your Home screen, they can be anywhere on your device).

· Two-finger swipe up or down in Safari: navigates a list of headings, links or any other

   element you have selected by writing the corresponding letter first (H for heading, L
   for link and so on).

Alex and Braille Screen Input in iOS 8 Video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYUHiIlIrPk

         The Braille Input feature involves the use of an onscreen 6-dot Braille keyboard
that will translate 6-dot chords into text (on the iPad's bigger screen you can also
enable 8-dot Braille input). Two modes for Braille input are supported: screen away
                                                                                                                                                                             96

mode and table top mode. In screen away mode, the device can be held with the
screen facing away from the user and the Braille dots will appear on the right and left
edges of the screen. In table top mode, the dots are arranged in the shape of the letter
V when the device is placed on a tabletop or other flat surface. For the Braille input
mode, some of the supported gestures include:

· One-finger swipe left: deletes the most recent character.
· One-finger swipe right: adds a space.
· Two-finger swipe right (while entering text): adds a new line.
· Two-finger swipe right (on a Home screen): opens the selected app.
· One-finger swipe up/down while entering text: accesses typing suggestions.
· One-finger swipe up or down while on a Home screen: navigates a list of apps that

   start with the letters you started typing.

· One-finger swipe up or down in Safari: moves by the element whose letter you

   entered (headings, links, etc.).

· Three-finger swipe left or right: toggles between contracted and uncontracted (called

   "six dot") braille (on iPads, eight dot braille is also an option)

· Hold with one finger on the screen: enter "explore mode," where you can move a

   finger around to find the different dot positions.
You can exit out of either of the two special input modes (Handwriting and Braille) by
performing a scrub gesture (moving two fingers from side to side) or by turning the
rotor to a different item (speech rate, words, etc.).
                                                                                                                                                                             97

         In addition to on-screen Braille input, iOS devices support a number of
Bluetooth Braille displays for Braille output. A full list of supported displays is available
on the Apple website. Some Braille displays not only convert VoiceOver output to
Braille but also support control of the device through a number of buttons built into the
display. For example, on some displays you can tap a button on the display to scroll up
or down a page or screen.

Speech
         In addition to VoiceOver, iOS 8 includes support for the following speech

technologies: Speak Selection, Speak Screen, and Speak Auto-text. The options for
these speech features can be accessed under a new Speech pane found under Vision
in Accessibility. There you can tap Voices and choose from the many languages
supported in iOS 8, and for some languages you can even choose different dialects
(U.S. English, Australian English, etc.). Many of the dialects allow you to download
enhanced quality voices for even better results, but note that these voices take up
some space on your device. Some devices running the latest A7 and A8 processors
(iPad Air, iPad mini with Retina and iPhone 5s and later) also support the same Alex
voice that has been available on the Mac, providing even higher quality text-to-speech
support.

         Speak Selection speaks selected text in email, web pages and any document
where there is text that can be selected. Use of this feature requires two steps.

· Turn it on: in Accessibility > Speech tap the On/Off switch for Speak Selection. Use

   the slider to adjust the speaking rate.
                                                                                                                                                                             98

· Select text (this will depend on the app, but in Safari you tap, hold and let go, then

   use the blue handles to make a selection. From the popover menu, choose Speak
   and you will hear the selected text spoken aloud

Since iOS 6, Speak Selection can highlight words as the selected text is spoken aloud.
To enable word highlighting, go to Accessibility > Speech and make sure Highlight
Content is enabled.

Speak Screen in iOS 8 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WYpzKPyTyGM
         Speak Screen is a new feature in iOS 8 that is similar to Speak Selection but

does not require the user to make a selection first. With Speak Screen you perform a
gesture (swiping down with two fingers from the top of the screen) and the device will
speak everything that is on the display (including buttons and other interface elements).
If you prefer, you can use Siri to activate Speak Screen. Just activate Siri and say
"Speak Screen" and it should start reading the current screen aloud. Speak Screen has
a popover controller with a number of options for pausing and resuming speech,
adjusting the speech rate, and navigating the selection on the screen. This popover
menu can be moved to the side as needed by tapping the arrow on the left side, or you
can exit Speak Screen by tapping the X on the right side.
                                                                                                                                                                            100

         Speak auto-text: automatically reads the auto-corrections suggested when you

start typing some words, as well as the auto-capitalizations. This can save you from

Guided Access

Guided Access in iOS 8 Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lovgyT06qrw
         Guided Access was introduced as a way to set up the iPad or other iOS device

in a single app mode. In this mode, users are required to enter a passcode before they
can exit an app. Guided Access also can be used to disable certain areas of the
interface (for example, the Settings button in an app). To enable Guided Access, go to
Settings > Accessibility > Guided Access, then tap on Set Passcode to create the
passcode. To use the feature, open the app you want to lock into single app mode,
triple-click the Home button, and choose Guided Access. At the bottom of the screen
you can disable touch (if you want to use the device for display only) or disable screen
rotation. You can also disable the volume buttons, the sleep/wake button, or the
keyboard for even more control. Tap Start when you have set your options and you will
                                                                                                                                                                            102

be in single app mode (Guided Access). To stop Guided Access, triple-click Home
again and enter the passcode, then select End.

         While the options screen is visible, you can use your finger to draw a selection
around buttons or other parts of the interface you want to disable. Those areas will be
grayed out when Guided Access is started.

         A new option with iOS 8 is Time Limits. This lets you set up a time limit for how
long the user will be able to access the content on the iOS device. You can enable a
sound to warn the user the time limit is about to expire or use a spoken warning
instead (using text to speech). You set the warning type in Settings, then the length of
the time limit in the Guided Access options screen. With iOS 8, devices that included a
TouchID sensor allow the use of this sensor as an alternative for entering the passcode
to end a Guided Access session.

AssistiveTouch
         AssistiveTouch provides access to many hardware functions (volume buttons,

screen rotation) through software alternatives. AssistiveTouch also makes it possible to
use multi-finger gestures even if you do not have full use of all of your fingers.

         When you turn on AssistiveTouch, you will see a floating icon that looks like a
dot (you can move this icon if it gets in the way). Tapping the floating icon will bring up
the AssistiveTouch Menu with the following options:
                                                                                                                                                                            103

Figure 5. AssistiveTouch Menu
· Home: the same as clicking the Home button (for people who do not have the ability

  to perform a click).
· Siri: will activate the Siri personal assistant on devices that support that feature.

  When you are done, tap anywhere outside the popover window to dismiss Siri.
· Device: for adjusting and muting the volume, rotating the screen, locking the screen,

  and other device functions. Tap More for options that allow you to take a snapshot of
  the screen that will be saved to the device's Camera Roll, and open the task
  switcher, which can be used to see recently opened apps so that you can switch
  between apps. The Gestures option is for people who are unable to perform multi-
  touch gestures with more than one finger. For example, instead of swiping left or right
  with four fingers to switch apps (if Multitasking gestures are enabled on the iPad), you
  can do the same thing with one finger using AssistiveTouch.
                                                                                                                                                                            104

· Favorites: you can create your own gestures, in the AssistiveTouch section of the
  Accessibility Settings. A pinch gesture is already included for you.

· Notification Center: for accessing notifications from apps without having to swipe
  down from the top of the screen.

· Control Center: for accessing the Control Center without having to swipe up from the
  bottom of the screen.
         AssistiveTouch works well in conjunction with a number of special stylus

designs, including some that can be mounted on a head harness or held in the mouth
with a special mouthguard. These designs, along with others that have special grips,
can be used by those who are unable to hold a traditional stylus.

Switch Control
         Switch Control was introduced in iOS 7 and provides access to iOS devices for

those who have motor or cognitive difficulties that require them to use an adaptive
switch to interact with the iOS device. With Switch Control, items on the screen are
highlighted with a cursor sequentially, and when the desired item is highlighted it can
be activated by tapping the screen or a separate adaptive device connected to the iOS
device over Bluetooth.
                                                                                                                                                                            105

Figure 6. The Switch Control cursor
         A scanner menu can also be brought up to access scrolling, saved gestures,

and a number of device functions such as clicking the Home button or activating Siri.

Figure 7. The Switch Control scanner menu
Switch control is highly configurable in iOS:
· You can enable auto scanning and adjust the timing parameters for the auto

  scanning feature, including the number of times it will loop, how long you have to
  hold down the switch to activate an item (hold duration), and so on. Auto scanning
  requires less physical effort on the part of the user, but the timing can be tricky for
  those who are new to switch use.
· You can adjust the visual appearance and audio effects: for the visual appearance
  you can choose a large cursor and select from a number of colors for the scanning
  cursor. For audio, you can choose to hear an audio cue when the cursor advances,
  as well as enable speech and adjust the speaking rate. This last feature may be
                                                                                                                                                                            106

  helpful to someone who needs to use a switch device but also has low vision and
  needs the audio cues for the items on the screen.
· You can add multiple switch sources, and the switch source supports three options:
  external, screen, and camera. The first two are self-explanatory. You either tap on an
  external switch device or on the iOS device's screen to activate an item. The camera
  can also be set to recognize your head movements as an action, and you can assign
  different actions to either a right or a left head turn. When a head movement is added
  as a switch source, an option for adjusting the head movement sensitivity will be
  available. One thing to note is that you should probably have your iOS device on a
  stand if you plan to make use of the camera as a switch source. Otherwise, moving
  the device may cause the camera to not recognize your face as desired.

         Switch Control received only a minor update in iOS 8 that is intended to make
use of the feature more efficient. For example, the scanner menu does not include all of
the available options when it first comes up, but rather those that are most needed
based on the current context. The user can then scan to a second menu/screen of
options. Overall, the number of options available to the user has not changed, just the
way they are presented.

QuickType, Dictation, and Third-Party Keyboards
         The onscreen keyboard has gained smart word prediction in iOS 8. According to

Apple, the QuickType prediction depends not only on your past conversations and
writing style, but also on the person you are writing to and the app you are using. For
example, in Messages the keyboard will provide suggestions that match a more casual
                                                                                                                                                                            107

writing style, while in email it will suggest more formal language. Word prediction can
save time and effort for everyone, and it can be especially helpful for students who
struggle with spelling or those who find it difficult to enter text due to motor challenges.

Figure 8. QuickType and Dictation
         Dictation has added real-time feedback in iOS 8. This makes the feature easier

to use, as you can see exactly what you are dictating on the screen as you go, helping
you catch mistakes sooner. Starting Dictation is as simple as tapping a microphone
icon that appears to the left of the space bar, speaking the desired text and
punctuation, and then tapping done when finished. Dictation does not require any
previous training, but it does need an active Internet connection to work.

         In addition to QuickType, there is a new API third party developers can use to
create customized keyboards that users can choose from instead of the standard one
                                                                                                                                                                            108

included with iOS. Already, a number of third-party keyboards are available. Some of
my favorites are as follows:

· Keedogo: special keyboard for early writers with a simplified layout and lowercase

   letters

· Keedogo Plus: similar to Keedogo but with word prediction.
· Lowercase Keyboard: lowercase keyboard incorporating the Open Dyslexic font
· Fleksy: keyboard with support for swipe gestures and color themes
· Swype: keyboard that supports entering text through special gestures that require

   dragging a finger over the letters that make up each word

· TextExpander: enhanced shortcuts that save time by allowing you to save frequently

   typed blocks of text for use at any time

· Phraseboard Keyboard: allows you to create keys for frequently used phrases.
· Translator Keyboard: allows you to type in one language and automatically translate

   it into another language

· ai.type: improves the usability of the Shift key and allows for custom backgrounds

Installing and enabling each keyboard is a three-step process:

1. Download the app for the keyboard from the App Store.
2. Go to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards and choose Add New

      Keyboard. Your new keyboard will be listed under Third-Party Keyboards.

3. Activate the on-screen keyboard and tap the globe icon to the left of the space

      bar and choose your new keyboard.
                                                                                                                                                                            109

Display Options

         iOS includes a number of options for customizing how information is displayed
on the screen. These features can benefit not only those with vision loss, but also older
adults whose vision is fading. In iOS 8, the options for customizing the display include:
                                                                                                                                                                            110

· Invert Colors: reverses the color on the screen for people who need a higher

   contrast display

· Grayscale: a new feature in iOS 8 that replaces the color on the screen with shades

   of gray

· Larger Text: makes the text bigger on apps that support the Dynamic Type feature.

   Text size can also be adjusted in Settings > Display and Brightness in iOS 8.
   However, by enabling Larger Accessibility Sizes, you can make the text even bigger.

· Bold Text and Increase Contrast: adjusts the contrast of the text and the

   background so that the text is easier to read. For Bold Text, you must restart for
   changes to take effect. You can also adjust this setting in Display and Brightness in
   iOS 8.

· Button Shapes: adds a shape around buttons to make them easier to perceive
· Reduce Motion: replaces the zoom animation in iOS 8 with a simple fade that may

   be easier for some people who are sensitive to motion in the interface.

· On/Off Labels: adds an additional visual cue (a 1 or o) to each button to help you

   identify its state (whether it is on or off).

Audio Options
With iOS 8, the options for those with any kind of hearing loss will vary depending on
the device. On the iPad, there are three options:

· Hearing Aids: allows pairing with a number of Made for iPhone Hearing Aids with

   advanced features such as the ability to adjust the right and left volume separately
                                                                                                                                                                            111

   or together, environmental presets, and Live Listen for using the iOS device's
   microphone to pick up audio which can be relayed to the hearing aid

· Mono Audio: converts a stereo signal so that both channels will play out of each

   earpiece when you have headphones plugged in

· Balance control: allows you to adjust the audio level so that more of it plays out of

   either the left or right earpiece when headphones are plugged in
On the iPhone, you can also enable the device's flash as a visual alert, as well as turn
on Phone Noise Cancellation to improve the audio quality for phone calls when you
hold the phone up to your ear. For any of your contacts, you can set a custom vibration
pattern. This is done by editing the person's contact information, choosing Vibration >
Create New Vibration and tapping the custom vibration pattern on the screen.

         Although not considered accessibility features, Messages and FaceTime are two
communication technologies built into iOS that can be useful to those who are deaf
and need alternative modes of communication such as text messaging and video chat
for sign language.

Media
The new Media category in iOS 8 includes two options for customizing video content:

· Subtitles and Captioning: turns on captions on any video or podcast that includes

   them. Starting with iOS 7, you can customize the appearance of the captions by
   creating your own styles. These styles allow you to change the text size, font, and
   other options to make the text easier to see and read.

· Audio descriptions: enables a secondary audio track that describes the action for

   someone who is blind and cannot see what is on the screen.

Other Options
In addition to the options found in the Accessibility pane, iOS includes a number of
other features that, while they are not accessibility features per se, could benefit those
with special needs. Some of these include:

  · Messages: includes an option for sending audio clips from within the app, which
         will be of benefit to people who can't enter message text as quickly as they can
         speak. On the receiving end, these messages can be played back by just raising
         the device to hear them, making the interaction easier for those with motor
         difficulties. Video clips can also be sent in a similar way. For someone with a
         cognitive disability, the ability to see something in concrete terms with the help
         of a quick video clip will be helpful (a picture is worth a thousand words, right?).

  · Siri now has an always-on listening mode where the user can just say "Hey Siri"
         to activate the personal assistant. To avoid draining the battery, this mode will
         only work when the device is plugged into power. This will be helpful to any
         individual who has difficulty pressing the Home button to activate Siri.

  · The new support for a heath data API for tracking physical activity. For someone
         who is on the road to recovery (from an illness or an injury), such tools should
         prove helpful in keeping them on track and motivated about their
         progress. There is even an option for including a health card (with information
         about medications, allergies, and the like) in the lock screen. This idea will be
         taken even further when the new Apple Watch is released with a number of
         sensors for collecting health information that can be accessed with the Health
         app on iOS devices.
                                                                                                                                                                            114

  · A similar home automation API could come in handy for allowing people with
         motor difficulties to more easily control the appliances, lights, and other aspects
         of their home environment using iOS devices.

  · NFC payments (Apple Pay) could make interactions at gas stations, pharmacies,
         and other places of public accommodation easier for people with motor
         difficulties. Rather than fumbling with a wallet to take out a credit card or loyalty
         card before buying a coffee, all that's required is a simple tap of the phone (or
         upcoming watch) with the payment station.
         The Apple Watch, to be released in early 2015, also points forward to new

technologies and means of interaction that will benefit people with disabilities. A great
example is the new haptic feedback provided by the Taptic engine in the Apple Watch,
which will use subtle vibration patterns to guide someone when using turn-by-turn
navigation with the Maps app. Hopefully this technology will appear in future iPhones,
as it would be of great benefit for those who are blind.

         You can also communicate with the Apple Watch using tap patterns, doodles,
and what appear to be animated avatars, and I hope a similar app will eventually be
added to iOS. These features could be very useful for young people who are on the
autism spectrum or who otherwise have communication difficulties: for example, what
would be easier than drawing a big heart to tell your parent you love them?

         When you take into account all of the accessibility and other enhancements built
into iOS 8, it is clear that Apple is truly focused on creating an ecosystem of hardware,
apps, and services that work for everyone. These built-in features are a great example
of universal design, an approach where accessibility is built in rather than bolted on
                                                                                                                                                                            115

through additional applications that have to be purchased and installed by the user.
While iOS provides a great deal of customization through the large number of apps
available in the App Store, out of the box a user has much of the accessibility toolkit he
or she needs to access information and interact with the device on a level playing field
with non-disabled peers. Furthermore, the ability to use the same device as everyone
else, regardless of disability status, adds an element of social acceptability to iOS
devices that cannot be underestimated when considering their use with marginalized
populations.

Chapter 6
Using Content Acquisition Podcasts (CAPs) to
Improve Vocabulary Instruction and Learning for
Students with Disabilities and Their Teachers

              Michael J. Kennedy, John Romig, & Wendy J. Rodgers, University of Virginia

         A big challenge when teaching students with disabilities (SWD) within general
education placements is providing evidence-based instruction with fidelity and the
dosage needed to "move the needle" on academic performance (Fuchs, Fuchs, &
Stecker, 2010). Two key barriers preventing successful student outcomes that reside
beyond individual student control are (a) the purpose of content-area classrooms at the
upper elementary, middle, and high school levels, and (b) how instruction is delivered
within these settings (McKenzie, 2009). General-education teachers in the content
areas are often underprepared for the challenges associated with teaching SWD
(Brownell, Sindelar, Kiely, & Danielson, 2010; Mastropieri et al., 2005). Reasons
include limited coursework on serving SWD during teacher-preparation programs,
minimum support from the school district in terms of professional development, and
frequently, lack of content knowledge sufficient to adequately support students'
learning needs in specific content areas among special educators who may be
functioning in co-teaching roles (Kennedy & Ihle, 2012). In addition, teachers are
largely required to adhere closely to state- or district-provided pacing guides intended
to prepare students for high-stakes assessments that determine school, teacher, and
student accountability. Thus, pressures from various sources compel teachers to
move quickly through content without regard for the extent to which students are
                                                                                                                                                                            117

mastering it (Hallahan, Kauffman, & Pullen, 2015). The resulting mismatch between
SWD needs and the delivery of content (and its associated demands) is well
documented in terms of their struggles with various assessments and post-school
outcomes (see Smith, Manuel, & Stokes, 2012).
A Panacea for Students' Ills?

         Many researchers, educators, and other stakeholders consider technology to be
a tool that can help SWD and their teachers make critical improvements for learning
and other outcomes (Duffey & Fox, 2012; Fletcher, Schaffhauser, & Levi, 2012; U.S.
Department of Education, 2010). For some, technology writ large is a panacea for all
of the world's problems in education (hyperbole added). However, Perlman and
Redding (2011) found that in order to be used most effectively, technology must be
implemented in ways that align with curricular and teacher goals and must offer
students opportunities to use these tools during learning. While there is
documentation of student gains using technology in isolated cases (see Edyburn, 2013
for a recent review) the integration of technology at all levels remains surprisingly low
(Lu & Overbaugh, 2009). In sum, relative to how widespread technology's use has
become in the field, it is alarming to face up to the paper-thin empirical base for
technology's use with SWD in content-area classrooms (Kennedy, Deshler, & Lloyd,
2015).

         In addition to the under-implementation and utilization of technology, Kennedy
(2013) offered a different critique: Using technology for technology's sake is not
consistent with the requirement to provide individualized, evidence-based instruction
to SWD as noted in IEPs and required by IDEA. In other words, the presence of
                                                                                                                                                                            118

technology as a way to package or deliver content does not automatically inoculate
against lousy instruction. This does not mean technology should not be used with
SWD, far from it. Instead, stakeholders should resemble what Njenga and Fourie
(2010) call technoskeptics: Individuals who insist upon a higher level of theory,
empirical evidence, and patience before racing to adopt every new app or technology
tool they hear about on Twitter or Facebook. The purpose of this chapter is to
introduce a multimedia-based tool that can be created by teachers with technology
they already have on their computers, and which meets the standard of providing high
quality instruction to SWD. We provide examples of high-quality multimedia and step-
by-step instructions for production.

                                     Content Acquisition Podcasts
         Content Acquisition Podcasts, or CAPs, are short, multimedia-based
instructional vignettes that deliver high-quality instruction for one vocabulary term or
concept at a time. There are two domains of concern when creating CAPs: 1) The
looks and sounds of instruction independent of content, and 2) The shape of the
instruction being delivered using this tool. To address the looks and sounds of
instruction, CAPs are built using Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning
(2009) and the accompanying 12 evidence-based instructional design principles (2008).
CAPs can be used in a variety of flexible ways. Teachers can show CAPs during
traditional lectures; students can watch CAPs at home with or without parents; CAPs
can be viewed before exams or quizzes as a review, ahead of lectures as an advance
organizer, or really anytime students have a couple of minutes to receive high-quality
instruction. We feel CAPs' greatest strength is that they can be repeatedly and flexibly
                                                                                                                                                                            119

used among students and teachers in perpetuity once the upfront cost of production
(i.e. time) is paid.

         Figure 1 contains a list of Mayer's principles, a description of each, and effect
sizes based on Mayer's research. A sample CAP (that simultaneously introduces these
principles) is available at https://vimeo.com/89716786. A sample CAP that delivers
vocabulary instruction for students can be seen at www.qmediaplayer.com/?103. As
you watch this CAP, note the pace, the use of visuals, the repetition of the key
definition and information, the use of embedded questions, and the short length of the
video. None of the decisions regarding the looks and sounds of this CAP were made
without explicit reference to leading instructional design theory and evidence-based
practices (EBPs) for vocabulary instruction.

Shaping the Looks and Sounds of CAPs
         The CTML is grounded in cognitive load theory (Chandler & Sweller, 1991),

which states that all humans are subject to cognitive overload when capacity in
working memory is overwhelmed by environmental stimuli. This theory also builds
upon Paivio's (1986) dual processing principle (people learn using visual and auditory
inputs), and Baddeley's (1986)
model of working memory (people remember about three seconds worth of auditory
and visuospatial information, respectively, without taking explicit cognitive action to
remember it). Multimedia instruction is a known perpetrator of overwhelming viewers
with fast-paced, visually rich, instructionally redundant features that make no explicit
effort to structure content so that viewers have time for processing (Clark, 2009; 1983;
Mayer, 2009). The CTML and accompanying instructional design principles help
instructors do a better job of creating instruction that is a match for how people learn
(Mayer, 2009).

         Figure 2 contains a rubric used by Kennedy, Aronin, Newton, O'Neal, and
Thomas (2014) to score CAPs' adherence to Mayer's instructional design principles.
This rubric is simple, but it can help an instructor carefully study each of Mayer's
principles and consider how it influences the looks and sounds of instruction
throughout a CAP. Before attempting to create a CAP, we recommend careful study of
Mayer's principles and use of the rubric to evaluate multimedia currently being used to
teach students.

Empirical Evidence for CAPs
         There are two emerging research bases for CAPs' use in education. The first is

using CAPs to provide vocabulary instruction to SWD. Kennedy, Deshler, and Lloyd
(2015) randomly assigned 278 urban high school students, including 30 with learning
disabilities, to four experimental conditions: 1) Students assigned to watch CAPs
containing a combination of EBPs for teaching vocabulary, including explicit and
strategic instruction; 2) Students who learned using multimedia-based instruction that
did not adhere to Mayer's evidence-based instructional design principles. The
students in Group 1 assigned to watch CAPs containing a combination of evidence-
based practices for teaching vocabulary, including explicit and strategic instruction
significantly outperformed their classmates in Group 2. In a follow-up study, Kennedy,
Thomas, Meyer, Alves, and Lloyd (2014) measured vocabulary learning of high school
students with and without disabilities across two units in a social-studies course.
Students took turns either using CAPs or not during each unit. Results show
significant differences in performance on weekly curriculum-based measures when
students had access to the CAPs. Research continuing in this area is examining the
effects of CAPs on student vocabulary performance in science courses. Although
preliminary, these two empirical studies demonstrate that CAPs can help students
improve vocabulary performance.

         The second empirical base for CAPs is with teachers and teacher education
students. A total of 12 empirical articles support the use of CAPs to improve teacher
candidate knowledge of various topics compared to classmates who learn by either
reading or hearing a lecture containing the same content. A review highlighting several
                                                                                                                                                                            124

of these studies is available from Kennedy, Kellems, Thomas, and Newton (2015). A
free resource for teachers wishing to see sample CAPs or use them in teaching or
learning is available at www.SPEDIntro.com.
Embedding Evidence-Based Practices within CAPs

         While Mayer's model provides the roadmap for considering and designing the
looks and sounds of instruction, it offers no guidance in terms of the substance of the
content to be delivered. Therefore, CAPs must draw from a menu of EBPs for
vocabulary instruction depending on the term or concept being taught. A menu
containing EBPs that make particular sense for inclusion within the CAP model for
vocabulary instruction is presented in Figure 3. It is important to note that more is not
necessarily better when it comes to including EBPs within CAPs. Instead, logical
choices supported by the term/concept, the meaning, and how much information
students need to know should drive decision-making. To illustrate, it might make
sense when teaching the term biodegradable to explicitly teach students about the
prefix bio-, the root word degrade, the suffix -able, to give an example and non-
example of the term, and to define the term using a student-friendly definition attached
to an anchor image. In addition, it would make sense to create CAPs for other terms
being taught in this unit such as biodiversity, recycling, and conservation.
                                                                                                                                                                            125

Review and Select Relevant Evidence-Based Practices (EBPs)
Choose from this menu of vocabulary instruction EBPs that make sense for the term
being taught, given its content-specific meaning and students' learning needs. (Note:
This list is not exhaustive.)

    Evidence-based practices
            Semantic feature analysis and mapping (Ebbers & Denton, 2008)
            Explicit instruction, using examples/non-examples, student-friendly
            definitions, explicit language (Archer & Hughes, 2011)
            Keyword mnemonic strategy (Mastropieri, Berkeley, & Graetz, 2010)

            Word ID strategy (Lenz & Hughes, 1990)
            Morphemic awareness & analysis (Reed, 2008)
            Using instructional technology including visuals (Xin & Rieth, 2001)
            Graphic organizers (Dexter, Park, & Hughes, 2011)
            Content enhancements (Deshler & Shumaker, 2006)
            Anchored instruction (Cognition and Technology Group at Vanderbilt, 1990)
Figure 3. Sample evidence-based practices for teaching vocabulary
terms/concepts
         Figure 4 provides a worksheet teachers and other educators can use to plan the
content of CAPs before bringing them to life with Mayer's instructional design
principles. Some recommendations to help guide teachers planning to create CAPs
include the following:
    - Take a bank of vocabulary terms for a unit and practice matching them to EBPs
         that would be appropriate given student needs and the features of the term.
    - Write a script for the CAP in advance and share with a colleague.
    - Justify selection of EBPs during a planning meeting with teammates, including
         other special educators or general-education teachers.
                                                                                     126

      To operationalize these recommendations, Figure 5 is a functional score sheet

      an

instructor can use to evaluate a CAP's use of EBPs within the video. Kennedy et al.

(2014) used this score sheet in a recent study in which teacher candidates were taught

how to make CAPs; the products were evaluated using this, and the rubric of Mayer's

principles noted in Figure 2.

Table 1. CAP Production Steps

It is important to note that the path to creating CAPs is best left to the discretion

and preferences of the person creating the instructional tool. Therefore, the production

steps available through the aforementioned website and CAPs should be used as a

reference; user creativity and use of other products (e.g., Camtasia, etc.) are welcome.

That said, it is critical to ensure that CAPs adhere to Mayer's evidence-based

instructional design principles and to embed vocabulary instruction that matches the

topography of the term and the learner's needs.

Adding embedded questions. An additional step in the CAP development

process is optional, but potentially useful in supporting student learning. Embedding

comprehension and other questions throughout the CAP will give a teacher additional

data to aid in decision-making. Qmedia allows users to embed questions throughout

CAPs and provides data on questions for individual users and groups of users. To add

questions, the completed CAP video must be on a video-sharing site such as Vimeo or

YouTube. Once the video has been uploaded, go to www.qmediaplayer.com. The

remaining steps for embedding questions using Qmedia are presented in Figure 6.

CAPs under current research using assessment questions typically have two stop
                                                                                                                                                                            130

points: one pretest question at the beginning of the video and a series of questions at
the end of the video. Future research could examine at what point the number of
questions in a video begins to decrease comprehension due to a lack of coherent
viewing of the CAP.

                                                  Conclusion
         We began this chapter by noting challenges general and special education
teachers face with respect to implementing evidence-based instruction for SWD in
various instructional settings. It is very easy to offer technology as a path to
supporting students' needs, but the empirical evidence does not support applications
of technology as a student cure-all. With this in mind, teachers and other education
stakeholders should prioritize instructional design theory and evidence-based
instructional practices when designing or selecting technology to be used with SWD.
This will require educators to become technoskeptics, and to learn about evidence-
based design principles such as those from Mayer (2009) in order to properly evaluate
various instructional products brought to market.
         CAPs are an intentionally flexible instructional tool. Students can watch CAPs
during class, at home, before tests or quizzes, on the bus, and at other times when
they have an opportunity to spend a couple minutes receiving high-quality vocabulary
instruction. There is no right or wrong way to watch CAPs, so long as the learner is
engaged during the brief vignettes.

Directions for adding embedded questions to CAPs through Qmedia

Step 1: On the Qmediaplayer home page, click "Qedit."

Step 2: On the right side of the page, click "File," then "New." When a confirmation

window pops up, click "yes."

Step 3: Click "Settings" and follow steps below for initial setup. (Other features are

available through QMedia. The focus here is on what is most applicable to CAP

videos.)

Title                    Enter the CAP title (typically the term being taught)

                         If you want to collect data on individual students, click "true."

Require user login?      If you do not want individual student data stored, leave as

                         "false."

                         If using a YouTube or vimeo video, enter the entire identifying

                         information of the video.

                         (Eg. For YouTube:

Media source (Id or      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqbFgasTsDs

URL)                     For Vimeo: https://vimeo.com/111015222

                         The video should now appear in the player pane when you

                         click the preview button.

Stop time                Enter duration of CAP video in seconds.

Initial width % (0-100)  Enter "100"--this feature will make the video fill the browser
                         window.

Step 4: Click "Preview" to save progress.

Step 5: To add assessment questions, click "Content," then "Edit assessments" and

follow the steps below.

Note: In Qmedia terminology, an "assessment" is one stop point in a video that can

include one or multiple questions. A "step" is an individual question within an

assessment.

Step 5.1: Pause the video in the location you want to add an assessment.

Step 5.2: Click "Add assessment."

Step 5.3: An untitled assessment will appear. Click "untitled" and rename the

assessment. Assessment names are case sensitive and will be used when making data

reports.

Step 5.4: Click "Add Step." An untitled step will appear.

                         "Radio" is a standard multiple-choice question. These

Step type                questions are most appropriate for CAP videos. Radio
                         questions can also be used as true and false questions by

                         entering "true" and "false" as the answer options.

Step Id                  Enter the name of this specific question. Eg. "SOL
                         Question," "True or False," etc.

Text                     Enter the directions for the question. Ex. "Choose the best
                                                                                         132

                          answer."

Prompt                    Enter the assessment question. Ex. "What is an independent
                          variable?"

                          Enter any message you want the student to see if he or she

If right answer           gets the answer correct. Qmedia has a built-in response if
                          students get the answer correct. What is entered here is in

                          addition to the Qmedia statement.

                          Enter any message you want the student to see if he or she

If wrong answer           gets the answer incorrect. Qmedia has a built-in response if
                          students get the answer incorrect. What is entered here is in

                          addition to the Qmedia statement.

Number of tries           Enter the number of times the student will be allowed to
                          attempt the question.

Allow skipping            Select "true" if students will be able to skip this question.
                          Select "false" if a response is required.

Font size                 Select desired font size.

Options                   Click "Add new option" and enter each response option for
                          the question.

Designate a correct       Put an asterisk (*) in front of the correct answer (e.g., *1776).
answer                    The asterisk will not appear in the assessment, but it signals
                          to Qmedia which answer is correct.

Step 6: Save Qmedia video by following the steps below.

Step 6.1: Click "File," then "Save as."

Step 6.2: In the popup window enter your email address and a password you will use

to make future edits and create data reports. The password and email address can be

the same for every video you create in Qmedia.

Note: Check the "Private?" box if you do not want anyone else to see the video.

To edit an already existing Qmedia video, follow the steps below.

Step 7: Go to www.qmediaplayer.com

Step 7.1: Click "Qedit."

Step 7.2: Click "File," then "Open."

Step 7.3: Enter the email and password information used to save the video.

Step 7.4: Use steps 3-6 to edit. Remember to save the video after editing.

To view video on Qmedia without editing follow the steps below.

Note: Every Qmedia video is assigned a number when it is saved (eg. 103).

Step 8: In an Internet browser, enter www.qmediaplayer.com/show.htm?XXX where

the XXX represents the number assigned to the video. (Eg.

www.qmediaplayer.com/show.htm?103

Note: This link can then be added to a teacher's website or sent to students to allow

them to easily view the completed video.

Note: The original video uploaded to Vimeo or YouTube will still exist in its original

location without embedded questions. To watch videos with embedded questions,

viewers must go through Qmedia.
