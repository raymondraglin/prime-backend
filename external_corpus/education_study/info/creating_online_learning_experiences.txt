VIII CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
ABOUT THIS PROJECT

OVERVIEW

This book was created as a publication for the LINK
Research Lab at the University of Texas at Arlington
(UTA). The initial goal was to provide a resource for the
faculty at UTA and many other institutions to utilize as
they designed MOOCs and other online courses for
LINK Research Lab programs - as well as for other
departments and programs. In the spirit of openness and
collaboration, that goal was expanded into making this
book as general and context-independent as possible.
Where specific needs for unique contexts were needed
(for example, how to assess learners in a MOOC that
might have thousands of learners), we have noted the
specific contexts where they are most applicable. We also
invited a wide range of authors and reviewers from
different contexts and countries to add as many
viewpoints as possible. However, we know that we are
still falling short in many areas. If you see something you
would like to add, improve, or expand, please contact us
(matt@mattcrosslin.com). We would like to continually
update this book with new, expanded editions in the
future.

CREATION PROCESS

The first version of this book was more of a brief guide

                                                                               ABOUT THIS PROJECT IX
to dictate how instructors would create MOOCs for the
LINK Research Lab at UTA. After the lead author wrote
the initial handbook, additional LINK Lab personnel
were brought in to add more sections. At the suggestion
of George Siemens, we decided to expand the UTA
MOOC Handbook to include all forms of online course
design in as many contexts as we could cover (the original
guide being focused entirely on public 4-year
universities). This began the process of recruiting other
authors and contributors- first from within UTA, and
then from experts around the world. When the guide
expanded to a book, the content was divided into
chapters. However, the typical model of "one author
writes one chapter" didn't fit the best flow of the content.
Therefore, we decided to move away from that model by
allowing authors to contribute as much as they wanted
- be it a chapter, a section, or a paragraph. Many people
were invited, but we really only scratched the surface of
those that we wanted to reach out to. Hopefully in the
next edition we will get more of that list added. Also, we
began to specifically reach out to people from different
states, countries, and contexts from UTA to review the
book for places we missed important contextual
information. These reviewers gave us incredible feedback
that improved the book immensely. The only regret was,
again, time restraints, as we would have liked to invite
so many more to review. Again, that will hopefully be
improved upon in the next edition.

HOW TO APPROACH THIS BOOK

"Online learning experiences" is a broad term that covers

X CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
a large number of contexts and possibilities. Not all ideas
and processes covered in this book are going to work
in every learning context. We encourage you to evaluate
each idea presented against your specific needs and only
use those that will work for you (but also, feel free to
remix as needed). Additionally, please note that while
those who are new to creating online courses might want
to read the chapters in order, we tried our best to also
design the flow so that you can move around the text in
a non-linear fashion as well. Our goal with the structure
was to have a flow that works for those that read the
chapters in order, while giving the various sections and
chapters a sense of independence for those that want to
pick and choose (or for those that use this book more as
a reference). If you find something we missed in this goal,
please let us know.

XVI CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this book is to provide guidance and
advice for instructors who would like to develop an
online course. The overall goal is to provide some clarity
about many of the steps required to propose and design
a course, to describe the resources needed, and to explain
the roles of the stakeholders. Online courses generally
take much longer to develop than most people realize.
The information in this book is very important in that it
is based on practical experience gleaned from those that
have designed and offered successful courses.

But why "learning experiences"? Most people think of
learning in an official capacity as a course. The design
of a course is often referred to as instructional design.
Sometimes courses are designed by the instructor, but in
other instances specific people other than the instructor
provide the role of instructional designer. Over the past
decade, changes to the online world have resulted in
newer ways of thinking about learning that go beyond
instruction and courses to learning experiences. Our hope
is that, if you have already not begun to think in terms
of learning experiences, that this book will help you
transition your thinking in that direction(or continue to
evolve it for those that have already started).

For many, the arrival of Massive Open Online Courses

                                                                                          INTRODUCTION 1
(MOOCs) created a new paradigm of learning where
some courses could be massive and open to anyone in the
world (even though that had been happening in several
places long before MOOCs were a thing). The other end
of the spectrum from MOOCs would be small online
courses with limited enrollment - which many think of as
traditional online courses. Then there are many courses
that fall in the middle of these two points: massive limited
enrollment courses, small open courses, and so on. This
book will cover as many issues common to all of those
options as possible.
Good luck as you embark on or return into the world of
online learning!

2 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF ONLINE
COURSES

Modern online courses are an extension of older forms of
distance learning, going back to mail and correspondence
courses of the 1700s (Harting & Erthal, 2005). These
courses were followed in the 1900s by radio, telephone,
and television-based educational efforts (Harting &
Erthal, 2005). Computers were used to deliver
educational programs as early as the 1970s, even though
the technology was often a hindrance. However, with the
rise of personal computers, better Internet connections,
and digital video technology in the 1990s, many
universities began offering more courses online (Harting
& Erthal, 2005). While this shift meant that online
learning became more available to anyone with an
Internet connection, these courses were often offered to
select groups of learners. Starting in the 1970s and 1980s,
various groups and universities began creating open
learning or learning for all initiatives with the aim of
taking learning beyond the silos it was often contained
within (Harting & Erthal, 2005).

The first course to be called a "MOOC" was taught by
George Siemens and Stephen Downes in 2008
(Kovanovi, Joksimovi, Gasevi, Siemens, & Hatala,
2015). This course, Connectivism and Connective Knowledge
(CCK08), was labeled a "Massive Open Online Course"

                                                                                                 CHAPTER 1 3
after the fact by Dave Cormier. Attracting over 2200
students, CCK08 was really meant as an experiment in
connectivism rather than massive learning. In 2011,
Stanford University created their own MOOC -
Introduction to AI, taught by Sebastian Thrun and Peter
Norvig. This course attracted over 160,000 students,
along with massive media attention as well. The New
York Times called 2012 the "Year of the MOOC" because
several well-financed MOOC providers came into
existence, most notably Coursera, Udacity, and edX
(Kovanovi, Joksimovi, Gasevi, Siemens, & Hatala,
2015). Hype for MOOCs has died down since then, but
there is still considerable interest in what they mean for
education now and in the future. Despite the insistence
of some, MOOCs will not destroy or disrupt universities,
but they have already begun to make many examine
exactly what teaching at scale means.

As MOOCs grew in popularity, different terms were
created to label these different versions. The most useful
were "xMOOC" - used to describe teacher-centric
courses as "eXtension" of a traditional course - and
"cMOOC" - used to describe more student-centered
connectivist courses (Downes, 2013). Many other terms
such as MOOC2.0, MOOC3.0, etc have been proposed,
but these ideas have found little usage in most contexts.
Another term that has been proposed is SPOC - short
for "small private online course" (Fox, 2013). This term
was first used for a more business-oriented approach of
creating and licensing courses rather than what some
refer to as "traditional" online courses that are also
typically smaller and private (but not always).

4 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Traditional online courses come in many varieties, from
small cohort models to large "lecture hall" courses of
hundreds. Some of them are also considered "blended"
or "flipped" in that they meet partially in person and
partially online. Some traditional online courses even
integrate open features like Open Educational Resources
(OER), social networking tools like Twitter, and
collaborative learning. For the sake of clarity, in this
handbook the term "online courses" will refer to any
course that is offered partially or fully online to a specific
set of learners (like enrolled learners at a University or
company), while the term "MOOC" will refer only to
those courses that are considered MOOCs. There are
many places that regular online courses and MOOCs
overlap, and many places that they differ. This book will
explore both in the upcoming chapters, focusing mainly
on regular online courses while highlighting any unique
considerations for MOOCs as needed.

6 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
CHAPTER 2: BASIC PHILOSOPHIES

INSTRUCTOR-CENTERED VERSUS
STUDENT-CENTERED

Most (but not all) courses tend to be either focused on
the instructor as dispenser of knowledge, or the learner
as self-guided constructor of knowledge. Many courses
are a mixture of both, but gravitate towards one side or
the other regardless. Courses of any size can be either
student-centered or instructor-centered, so you will first
need to decide which direction your course will
(generally) take.

The more the instructor focuses on themselves as the
center of the course (some refer to this as "sage on the
stage"), the more students will rely on them as the one
to tell them everything... and to fix everything. This can
be overwhelming in MOOCs with thousands of learners,
but acceptable in smaller online courses with manageable
numbers (although many topics in any course can still
work well in student-centered approaches). The goal of
any course should be to push learners into a place of
learning how to learn about the course topic, so they can
become self-directed learners (Kop & Fournier, 2011).
This can also pose challenges for learners who were
taught to focus on the instructor as the center of the
class, or as the person to answer all questions. Instructors

                                                                                                 CHAPTER 2 7
might also find it difficult to release the control over
the class by letting learners take control (also sometimes
referred to as "guide on the side"). However, we
encourage you to keep self-directed learning in mind and
work to move your course or your learners in that
direction as much as possible.

Additionally, the massive nature of MOOCs and some
larger online courses dictates that instructors will not
have time to be the core of the course. Therefore, the
design of the course will need to focus (as much as
possible) on how to create self-determined learners
simply out of practicality. Learners will need to begin to
see other learners and the Internet as communities that
are a source of answers and support (Hew & Cheung,
2014). For example, some courses have had success with
creating voting systems that allow learners to post
questions in the discussion forums and then allow other
learners to "upvote" the ones that are most important.
The instructor then answers the top questions each week.
Other courses have encouraged learners to ask questions
through social media outlets such as Twitter or Facebook,
allowing instructors and other learners to answer as they
can. Both methods have pros and cons depending on
instructor's available time as well as personal viewpoints
of each method (various strategies to support each
method are covered in this book).

The main concept to keep in mind is that MOOCs and
larger courses can quickly become very student-centered
in nature due to their massive size, and this often
represents a major shift in power and control dynamics

8 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
for many instructors. Be prepared for this shift. Also keep
in mind that when teaching at this scale, learners don't
need you to just convey a bunch of factoids that they
can look up online or in a book. They will want you to
show them how to take control of the overall direction of
their learning, something that is often referred to as "self-
directed learning." This is yet another large shift for some
instructors. If these shifts are new for you, you might
want to look into a field called heutagogy, which is this the
study of self-directed learning (Blaschke, 2012).

ASYNCHRONOUS VERSUS SYNCHRONOUS

Another major factor about your course that will affect
many decisions is whether or not learners will be
interacting with each other and/or the course
synchronously or asynchronously. Synchronous courses
are basically those courses that have learners meeting
with each other and the instructor(s) in real time in the
same space. That space may be a physical classroom, a
video conference tool, or even a text-based chat tool - but
the key is that learning experience for each participant
is synchronized with the other participants. Typical on-
campus college courses are often seen as synchronous -
learners consume the materials (lectures) at the same time
and place, discuss course topics during class time, and
complete assignments like tests in class. Asynchronous
courses are those that do not require learners to meet in
the same space at the same time. Typical online courses
are often seen as asynchronous - learners consume the
materials at different times, post to discussion boards at

                                                                                                 CHAPTER 2 9
the different times, and complete assignments at different
times.

However, these are often not completely separate
constructs. On campus courses can have online
asynchronous components added for after class work.
Online courses can have synchronous video chat sessions
or live lectures mixed in with asynchronous discussion
boards. Sometimes these mixtures are determined by
company or institutional policy, other times they are left
up to the instructor. If these decisions are left to you, you
will need to decide what mixture is right for your course
and your learners (keep in mind that sometimes the ideal
solution for the course is not ideal for specific learners -
in this case, try as much as possible to go with what is best
for the learners).

Much of what you read for the rest of this book will also
need to be filtered through how much of your course
is synchronous and how much is asynchronous. For
example, if your students are working adults that need
maximum flexibility, you might decide to make your
course entirely asynchronous. This would probably mean
that you would not spend much time on tools that enable
video conferencing. However, no matter what the mix
of synchronous/asynchronous ends up being, you should
keep in mind you are still dealing with humans. Your
course designs will need to keep the human element in
your course in mind while designing for either modality.
One good resource to read about this topic is an article
called "Bringing out the Human in Synchronous and
Asynchronous Media for Learning" by Maha Bali.

10 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS OF LEARNING

Much can be said about the underlying theoretical
foundations of learning. Many, many books and articles
have been written on the topic, so this is not an area
that can easily be skimmed lightly. However, it can be
of benefit to your course for you to think through what
your theoretical goals/desires/requirements are for your
course, and then to design appropriately after clearly
setting your expectations. Therefore, a basic overview is
presented here.

Looking at learning as either instructor-centered or
students-centered is a good place to start, but it can get
much more complex than that. For the sake of space, we
will expand this list to three possibilities:

      Instructivism: Knowledge transfer from an
         expert

      Constructivism: Constructed self-discovery
         (often guided by an expert)

      Connectivism: Networking with connections to
         gain knowledge or skills

Each is actually more complex than the provided
definitions, and there are various other areas that fit in
between, beside, and outside of these. These terms could
also be considered basic power dynamics that describe who
is in control of learning in your course.

Intersecting and sometimes paralleling these power
dynamics are teaching methodologies for designing the

                                                                                               CHAPTER 2 11
course itself. Again, there are many of these that could be
listed, but we will stick with a simplified list:

      Pedagogy: Often seen as a general word for any
         method or practice of teaching, an older way of
         looking at this is that the instructor is at the
         center of and in control of the transmission of
         what is taught.

      Andragogy: A methodology that draws on life
         experiences and knowledge of the learner (rather
         than the teacher) to form the basis for learning.

      Heutagogy: Self-determined learning that focuses
         on how to learn rather than what to learn.

Again, these are simplified definitions rather that specific
descriptions that cover every aspect of these terms. The
power dynamics and methodologies mentioned also tend
to blend into each other as well. They can also be
combined and arranged in a grid-like pattern to help you
get even more specific about the design of your course:

GOALS, OBJECTIVES, AND COMPETENCIES

All courses set out to have learners learn something
through a transfer of knowledge and/or skills. However,
different teachers at different institutions will have
different methods for how they teach that something.
Once you know what you want your learners to learn,
you need to start planning how you are going to teach it
or how your learners are going to learn it, depending on
where the focus of your course is. Creating well-written
statements on how learning occurs will not only help
you design your course, but also will help your learners
understand what is going to happen in the course of
learning.

Many words are used for these statements: goals,
objectives, outcomes, strategies, competencies, etc. Some
see many of these words as interchangeable. For the sake
of this manual, we will focus on three:

                                                                                               CHAPTER 2 15
    1. Goal: A goal is a more general, broad statement of
         the overall intention of the course. There may be
         one for a course, or a list of a few. They can also
         be intangible and not measured by any standard.
         Goals can usually be accompanied by objectives or
         competencies.

    2. Objective: An objective is a precise statement of
         how to specifically achieve a goal. Generally, what
         sets objectives apart from goals is that they
         provide a specific way to measure learning
         outcomes and student performance. Objectives
         tend to be more tangible and shorter in duration
         than goals while focusing on what learners need
         to know. They can be accompanied by
         competencies, or stand on their own, in support
         of course goals.

    3. Competency: A competency is the ability to apply
         what has been learned to a function or task.
         Competencies are often more complex and higher
         level than objectives. They can work alongside
         objectives, or stand on their own, in support of
         course goals.

As an instructor, you may already have a good idea of
the goals, objectives, or competencies you will use in your
course. They may have been given to you by your
institution or company. Or you may have never thought
about any of them. Generally, you will want to have at
least a draft of these written out before you design your
course (they can, and probably will, change during the
design process). On the other hand, you may want to let

16 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
your learners determine the goals and objectives for the
course (or even to map their own competencies as the
course progresses). Even if that is the case, you will still
want to be familiar with how to create goals, objectives,
and competencies in order to lead your learners through
the process. Much has been written on how to write
effective goals, objectives, and competencies. We will only
cover the basics here, but if you need to go more in depth,
there are many resources online to look into.

The important thing to remember in writing goals is to
not confuse them with objectives and competencies.
Remember to keep them general and overarching for the
course, but not so general that they basically just say
"Students will learn _______ [topic of the course]". Try
to think of what students will learn rather than a list
of topics. You can do this by looking at your course
backwards - what will learners have accomplished by
the end of your course? Focus on what learners will be
doing rather than the topic. Make sure that learners can
understand them (aka avoid jargon). For more details, see:

      "A Primer on Writing Effective Learning-
         Centered Course Goals" by Robert K. Noyd (DFB)
         & The Staff of The Center for Educational
         Excellence (CEE) US Air Force Academy

There are many different ways to structure objectives,
but we recommend a good starting place is with the
Behavior/Conditions/Criteria structure. In this
structure, objectives should start with the behavior - what
students will be able to do ("create a timeline of historical
events that led to World War I"). Then add a condition

                                                                                               CHAPTER 2 17
- how they will be able to do it, usually added before
the behavior in a written objective ("After reading the
chapters on World War 1"). Finally, follow all of this with
the criteria - the method for determining how they
demonstrated mastery of the objective ("by correctly
answering 70% or more of the questions on the World
War 1 test"). Be sure to avoid unmeasurable words like
"understand," "know," or "appreciation for" in the
behavior; make sure that each objective feeds into the
goal; and ensure that every goal has a good number of
objectives to support it. If not, revise your goals and/or
objectives. For more details, see:

      How to Write Learning Objectives that Meet
         Demanding Behavioral Criteria" by Bob Kizlik

Just like objectives, competencies can be approached and
structured in many different ways. They are sometimes
utilized in more standard learning situations, or can
become the central structural feature of learning in
competency-based learning. There are typically three
concepts to keep in mind when creating competencies.
First, competencies should be focused on the learner,
rather than on the content or you as the instructor. Make
sure that you are creating a way for learners to focus on
their individual needs as they collaborate or work with
others. Second, competencies should focus on outcomes
over course structure. Many courses start with a "topic
per week" approach and build out from there, but
competencies may take more or less time than a week to
complete. Third, competencies should be able to adjust
and flex with the different individual needs of individual

18 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
learners. Objectives tend to create one set of standards
for all learners to attain in the same manner, whereas
competencies tend to provide flexible structure for
learners to personalize the learning experience to their
needs and contexts. For more details, see:

      3 Key Characteristics of Competency Based
         Learning" by Deb Everhart

Competencies tend to work best when situated in an
overall context of competency-based learning. While
there is disagreement over some of the specifics of
competency-based learning, there are a few key concepts
that generally tend to differentiate it from more
traditional course structures. The biggest key concept is
flexibility. Competency-based learning tends to allow
learners to determine what exactly they are going to learn
about a particular topic, how long they need to learn it,
and how they will demonstrate that they have mastered
the topic. Learners also typically do not advance until
they have proven mastery, unlike traditional learning
scenarios where all learners advance based on the
calendar regardless of mastery. Additionally, class
structures and organization as well as content or
activities can be adjusted by individual learners to fit their
specific social, cultural, and learning contexts and needs.
For more details, see:

      What is Competency-Based Learning?" by
         TeachThought Staff

                                                                                               CHAPTER 2 19
ALIGNMENT

Once you have created your goals, objectives, and/or
competencies, keep these at the forefront during the
entire course development. Everything that goes into the
course needs to relate back to these.

      The course content (text and videos) and
         technology should support the goals, objectives,
         and/or competencies.

      The learning activities need to give learners a
         chance to practice what they need to learn
         through the goals, objectives, and/or
         competencies - as well as prepare them for any
         assessments.

      Any assessments should specifically measure each
         goal, objective, and/or competency.

When all of these items (course content, learning
activities, and assessments) are aligned with the goals,
objectives, and/or competencies, they will work to
reinforce one another. Conversely, if any of these items
are misaligned, it can lead to learner frustration. This may
be realized if a learner says "The readings did not prepare
me for the test." What may have gone wrong if a learner
says this? Consider this quote: "If you design assessments
as an afterthought at the end of designing the instruction
(a common but unfortunate mistake), you are likely to
design the wrong content and the course activities and
the assessments are likely to be far less meaningful or
appropriate" (Shank, 2006). This is exactly what courses
that are not aligned look like. You are giving learners

20 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
puzzle pieces that don't line up. It may be that the
instructor created learning objectives but then chose
content that they found interesting, but that was
irrelevant to the objective. Then, they designed an
assessment based on that misaligned content. Since the
content was irrelevant to the objective, the assessment,
in turn, is not going to evaluate whether the learner
mastered the objective.

A good practice to ensure you are aligning your content is
to create a course map. A simple table to show how each
objective or competency is aligned with goals, content,
technology, learning activities, and assessments will help
visualize the alignment. An example table is provided
below.

OPENNESS

As you work through theory, goals, etc., one idea to also
consider with your course is openness. Openness is often
connected with MOOCs today, but the truth is that any

                                                         CHAPTER 2 21
course can be open or even have open elements. Even
though the second "O" in MOOC is "Openness," many
don't realize that it means more than "free" or "anyone
can sign up." Traditional online courses can also
incorporate many aspects of openness even if the course
itself is not considered "open." In fact, many instructors
like to include aspects of openness in their traditional
online courses.

A course that is completely "open" means many things,
including that the content is freely accessible for all
(Rodriguez, 2013). What that statement means is that
videos can be downloaded, PowerPoints used in videos
can be downloaded, all learning materials to be used are
available for free, all content is available from the
beginning of the course, and learners still have access
to the course indefinitely after the last course day. This
can be a major paradigm shift for those that are used to
teaching in a closed course online or face-to-face. The
expectation is that anyone can access any part of the
course at any time, and even in some cases re-use or
remix the content in their courses. This would limit using
expensive textbooks, tools, or websites that have
commonly been used for years in education. This may
also mean using open-source solutions outside of the
ones offered officially on campus. The main idea to keep
in mind is that if a course is considered to be "open," there
would be few restrictions on who can access any portion
of it. This leads to certain freedoms and certain problems,
as will be discussed in later sections.

However, if certain institutional limitations prevent

22 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
complete openness, many courses can implement some
aspects of openness as desired or allowed. This is up to
the instructor (or course designer if there is someone
designated for that role specifically), but just keep in mind
to keep the course completely open if referring to it as a
MOOC.

The major issue to consider in relation to openness is
licensing and permissions. Certain forms of copyright are
very restrictive, and therefore not completely "open." For
many, your institution or company will already have
made decisions on how the content and activities (text,
image, video, etc.) you have created will be licensed. For
others, you may have some or total freedom to license the
content and activities that you create as you like. If you
decide to use any type of open license for your content
and activities, this could increase the impact and spread
of your content outside of the course, as well as make
it accessible to more learners. Just keep in mind that
materials put into closed LMS systems under "fair use"
cannot be turned into open content without permission
from the copyright holder of that material. For more
information on open licensing, see the section in Chapter
8 on Open Educational Resources.

ACCESSIBILITY

One aspect of openness that all courses must take into
consideration, regardless of size or theory or where/how
the course is offered, is accessibility. Certain learners
have various considerations when interacting with online
courses due to disability, socioeconomic situations, or
any number of other factors. You may work at an

                                                                                               CHAPTER 2 23
institution or company that has staff to ensure your
courses are as accessible as possible. If that is the case,
then you must listen to everything they tell you to do with
your course. Accessibility design is not only a good idea,
it is usually also the law.

If your institution or company does not have a person or
department to ensure that your course is fully accessible,
it will be up to you to do so. Even if you have someone
else to review your course, designing with accessibility
in mind can typically save a lot of time in the long run.
You will find that it is better to design your course right
the first time than to spend a lot of extra time correcting
accessibility issues later on.

Different tools have different accessibility standards that
often evolve as technology changes. The best thing you
can do is search for accessibility guidelines for the tool
you wish to use ("accessibility standards for Word docs,"
"accessibility standards for online videos," etc). Also keep
in mind the tools that your learners might use, such as
screen readers. A screen reader is an assistive device that
attempts to convey what is on screen to people with
various sight and reading issues. Different screen reading
devices have different abilities to convey what is on the
screen, so try to keep tools like that in mind when
designing course materials. Here are some general
guidelines to keep in mind about accessibility (others will
be covered in later chapters as well):

      Audio and Video: make sure to caption videos
         and provide downloadable transcripts for audio
         and video files. Closed Captions are optimal for

24 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
   video. See the Chapter on Videos for more details.

 Images: Always put a detailed description of the
   image in the "alt" box in your image editor or html
   code. Make sure you are not conveying course
   information only in a graphic. Your important
   content should always be in text. If your image is
   essential to the content, but too complex to
   summarize as alternate text, then you will need to
   look into how to make complex images accessible
   in the tool you are using.

 Color: Don't use color alone to highlight or
   convey meaning. Remember that not everyone
   sees color the same.

 Color Contrast: Make sure there is sufficient
   contract between foreground and background
   colors, especially in text, to be easily readable by
   all. Low contrast make words harder to read.
   When in doubt, use a color contrast checker to be
   sure.

 Flashing/Blinking: Avoid flashing or blinking
   elements (especially blinking red text) at all costs.
   Flashing or blinking elements can cause a wide
   range of unsafe responses in people with various
   medical conditions.

 Headings: Don't just use large bold text to divide
   up your content - use the appropriate Heading 1,
   Heading 2, etc. tags. If you don't use headings,
   please consider doing so to organize your text for
   screen readers. Remember not to skip heading
   levels, and to use only one "Heading 1" per page.

                                                                                       CHAPTER 2 25
      Lists: When making a list, make sure to use list
         tags or buttons to do so, rather than dashes,
         pluses, etc. This also helps screen readers.

      Links: Make sure the text you turn into a link
         actually gives an accurate description of where the
         link is taking the reader to. "Click here" really tells
         people nothing about the link, especially if they
         skipped to it with a screen reader.

      Tables: Do not use tables to organize images or
         content on a screen (this is popular with some
         designers to get images or text to look certain
         ways). Only use tables to communicate data in
         table format. Make sure to always use column
         headers when doing so as well - this also helps
         screen readers.

      Chunking: Break down long passages of text into
         manageable chunks of content on separate pages.
         Learners should not have to use the scrollbar on
         pages when viewing on average size screens.

      Forms: If you are creating a form online, make
         sure that the form elements are in the right order
         for screen readers. You can do this with the Tab
         key - just Tab through your form and make sure
         everything goes in order. Also make sure you can
         submit the form by pressing the Enter key. In fact,
         make sure that everything can work without a
         mouse (not everyone can use them). Make sure
         form fields have labels.

      Interactive Objects: Various interactive objects
         and tools that are being integrated into online

26 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         learning also need to work completely with a
         keyboard. Whatever tool or software you use,
         make sure to check how accessible it is first.

      Equations/Formulas/Notations: Math and
         Science courses sometimes have extra accessibility
         issues due to the use of various symbols, formulas,
         and other elements. Make sure to look into
         something like MathML to make those elements
         as accessible as possible.

Depending on where you want to teach the course, or
what tools you use, there may be other accessibility issues
you need to look into. The list above is not an exhaustive
or complete list, so be sure to do some research and check
to make sure you are up to date on all accessibility issues
that apply to your course. Here are a few places to start
learning about accessibility:

      WebAIM has website design accessibility training,
         evaluation, and certifications that are also
         applicable to online courses as well.

      W3C also has an entire site dedicated to web
         accessibility - including lessons, guides, and
         validation tools.

      If you are not sure how to provide captions for
         complex images, this guide on captions can help
         give you some ideas.

      WebAIM also has a very good Screen Reader
         Simulation (along with other simulation tools)
         that helps you experience what it is like to use a
         screen reader.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 2 27
HOW MOOCS DIFFER FROM OTHER ONLINE
COURSES

MOOCs are can sometimes be very different from
regular online courses, which in themselves are different
from on campus face-to-face courses. You should have
at least several years' worth of experience designing and
offering traditional online courses before offering a
MOOC. However, even extremely experienced online
instructors will find many new challenges to face in their
first MOOC. Some basic differences include:

      Scale. MOOCs can have anywhere from a few
         hundred to tens and hundreds of thousands of
         learners. Instructors cannot have a goal of
         interacting with all learners. (Milligan, Littlejohn,
         & Margaryan, 2013)

      Intensity. MOOCs are often supplemental parts
         of the learner's educational process. They don't
         sign up to get a full college course and often don't
         have that much time. (Milligan, Littlejohn, &
         Margaryan, 2013)

      Flexibility. While the content in MOOCs may be
         presented in a linear fashion, many learners may
         drop in and out or even start at any moment,
         therefore the course has to be able to withstand
         nonlinear learning paths. (McAuley, Stewart,
         Siemens, & Cormier, 2010)

      Varied. Enrollment is open to anyone, so typical
         university requirements of pre-requisite
         knowledge are not a barrier to entry. Learners

28 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         could be anywhere from complete newbies to
         industry leading experts. (Milligan, Littlejohn, &
         Margaryan, 2013)

With this in mind, there are several questions that you as
an instructor should ask yourself before deciding to offer
a MOOC. What goals do you have as an instructor that
led you to choose a MOOC over other course formats?
Is a MOOC the best option given those goals? What are
your motivations for using a MOOC? Will a MOOC help
or hinder those goals? With those questions in mind,
consider what can and can't be accomplished with a
MOOC:

      MOOCs can: cover basic knowledge or a small
         amount of knowledge.

      MOOCs can't: adequately cover as much content
         or as much depth as a for-credit college course.

      MOOCS can: lay the groundwork for creating a
         small collection of learners interested in exploring
         a specific topic.

      MOOCs can't: create an instant community just
         because everyone signed up for the same topic at
         the same time.

      MOOCs can: bring together a very diverse group
         of learners.

      MOOCs can't: make that diverse group of
         learners actually learn or be nice to one another
         just because they signed up.

      MOOCs can: challenge motivated learners to

                                                                                               CHAPTER 2 29
         engage with the topic if they choose.

      MOOCs can't: prove that everyone that said they
         learned the content actually did learn without
         cheating.

Many of these issues and differences stem from the
openness of MOOCs. Open means much more than just
being "free to anyone that wants to sign up," as was
examined in the previous section on Openness.

CHAPTER 3: INSTITUTIONAL COURSES

While online courses could potentially cover any topic,
your institution or company may have a specific niche
within the online learning world that they focus on. Or
you may have the freedom to cover any topic you like.
Either way, there are several areas related to online
course design that you should be familiar with before you
propose and create a new course.

QUALITY STANDARDS

Both regular online courses and MOOCs should be
expected to be held to the same high quality standards as
traditional in-person courses. This means that time and
resources should be allocated to create the best possible
course experience for learners. This includes, but is not
limited to:

      Well-planned and organized course designs
      Completing all pre-planned course content and

         activities before the first day of class. You may
         want to design in some flexibility for certain parts
         of your course - just make sure this flexibility is
         intentional and not due to lack of planning. See
         the section on "Planning for Flexibility" for more
         details.
      Content that is well-written, fully edited, and

                                                                                               CHAPTER 3 33
         professional in tone.

      Focused content that is not excessively time-
         consuming (if you have a lot of content, maybe
         consider creating an open textbook?).

      If creating a MOOC, all resources, material, tools,
         and textbooks offered for free along with the
         course.

      Use of Open Educational Resources (OER) where
         possible (see the chapter on "Open Educational
         Resources").

      Professionally created graphics that enhance and
         add to the content; no distracting extraneous
         graphics.

      Use of well-written and edited scripts for all video
         production.

      Professionally recorded and edited videos.

      Captioning and transcripts for all video content.

      Professionally created video graphics, slides, and
         animations.

      Well-attended social media outlets.

      Consistent and frequent communication from
         course instructors.

      Timely response to participant concerns.

A note on MOOCs: even though MOOCs are offered
for free, you cannot skimp on quality. These courses are
broadcast to anyone in the world, and therefore serve as
the visible face of your institution or organization for

34 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
many that have never heard of it. Please ensure that all
parts of the course are of the highest quality possible.

QUALITY REVIEW

An important step in any creation process is the
evaluation of the final product, or quality assurance; and
this is true for course design as well. All online courses
are generally expected to be held to the same high quality
standard of traditional in person courses, especially at
institutions that are accredited by any external
accreditation group or board. This means that time and
resources should be allocated to create the best possible
course experience for learners.

What, or who, determines elements of a quality course?
Rather than reinvent the wheel, a popular option is to
utilize quality standards that have been developed by
nationally recognized organizations, such as the Quality
Matters Rubric or the Online Learning Consortium (OLC)
Quality Course Teaching and Instructional Practice Scorecard.
Once you have decided which standards you would like
to follow, it is important to implement them during
course design, rather than checking for them at the end of
course design.

Implementing quality standards into a course can yield
benefits for both the instructor and student. For example,
in regards to course design (layout, organization, and
navigation), participants rated courses with high
findability as a better overall experience. Students
reported lower levels of self-efficacy and motivation after
interacting with courses rated low in findability

                                                                                               CHAPTER 3 35
(Simunich, Robins, & Kelly, 2015). When it is clear to
learners how to navigate the course, where to find
materials, and how to submit assignments, learners have
to ask fewer procedural questions and the course is easier
to manage for the instructor. The instructor could even
have more time to provide quality feedback to learners
(of which learners crave) versus spending time answering
procedural questions.

Some questions you will see addressed in popular quality
standards are listed below. This list is a very high-level
summary - there are many more details to consider
within these topics. For example, the Quality Matters
rubric has 43 standards and the OLC Scorecard has 97
standards.

Course Design

      Is navigation clear and logical?
      Are course materials organized well, with no

         clutter or distracting elements?
      Is the design of the course consistent from week-

         to-week?
      Is it easy for learners to find what they need?

Course Objectives

      Are all course objectives measurable?
      Is the course content and assignments aligned to

         the course objectives?

Clarity

36 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
As a note, clarity is an important component of online
course design which will be covered more in Chapter
5. In contrast with in-person courses, online learners
cannot seek immediate clarification for instructions that
are not understood. A delay in clarity can cost online
learners valuable time. Therefore, you will see many
standards that reference being "clear" or "clearly stated".

      Are course and institution policies clearly stated?
      Are learners given all course information at the

         beginning of the course?
      Is how to use the content clearly explained?
      Are assignment instructions and expectations

         clear?
      Is the overall course grading policy and grading

         for individual assignments clear?

Engagement

      Are opportunities for engagement with other
         learners, the teacher, and the content built in to
         the course?

Student Support

      Is information provided about the technology
         required in the course, as well as how learners can
         get help should technical problems arise?

Accessibility

      Has course content been formatted for

                                                                                               CHAPTER 3 37
         accessibility?

POLICIES AND REQUIREMENTS

All online courses offered through any institution or
company will be required to adhere to all applicable
institutional or corporate course policies and
requirements. There may also be a specific group in
charge of regulating online course quality at your
institution or corporation. But even if there is not one
specific group in charge of regulating course quality for
you, you are highly encourage to follow all suggestions
in this manual and to seek out feedback from trained
instructional designers. Additionally, you will be
expected to know and adhere to all policies and
requirements of any service that you utilize in your
course (Blackboard, edX, Google, Facebook, WordPress,
etc.). Please be sure to familiarize yourself with any
service you wish to use before using them.

YOUR COURSE DESIGN TEAM

Creating an online course can be a major undertaking
that will require a large team of people. Unless your
institution currently has anyone working on course
design full time, your team will consist of people who
are working on your course in addition to other duties.
If your institution or company does not provide team
members for you, you should consider recruiting from
people whose normal job duties cover various aspects of
online course creation (as their workloads allow). This
team will include, but is not limited to:

38 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
1. Core Design Team:

         1. All Course Instructor(s) and Subject
             Matter Expert(s) (if not the same people).

         2. Instructional Designer(s) trained in
             learning theory to assist in designing
             content.

         3. Graphic Designer(s) to create necessary
             graphics (most courses require at least a
             few).

         4. Faculty and Administrative Personnel
             that may have a role in supporting,
             reviewing, and approving courses.

         5. Library Support Personnel to help locate
             pre-existing resources for your course.

2. Media Creation Team (please see the video
    chapter section on the time requirements for
    video creation to ensure that you have recruited
    enough people with enough available time to
    create the amount of video desired):

         1. Video Script Copy Editor(s) to assist in
             preparing scripts and transcripts.

         2. Videographer(s) to professionally record
             videos.

         3. Video Editor(s) to create final videos from
             raw recordings.

         4. Video Graphic Creator(s) for any
             animations, graphics, slides, etc, you wish
             to have added.

             5. UX Specialists and other Technical
                  Positions for creation of any media
                  elements that are not just text based (games,
                  websites, etc).

    3. Content and Design Assessment Team (see the
         "Design Assessment & Review" chapter for more
         details):

             1. Content Reviewer(s) to provide feedback
                  on content.

             2. Design Reviewer(s) to provide feedback on
                  the overall course design.

             3. Quality Analysts such as course quality
                  analysts, copyright reviewers, editors, and

                  accessibility standards.

             3. Guest Experts for videos or online
                  sessions, if desired.

             4. If you are running a MOOC or other
                  course that needs advertising: Marketing
                  Experts to spread the word about your
                  MOOC.

40 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
POSSIBLE HOSTING PLATFORMS

Your institution or company may already have a platform
(sometimes called "LMS" for "learning management
system" or "CMS" for "course/content management
system") for hosting courses that you are required to use.
For a traditional online course, these could be something
like Canvas, Blackboard, or Moodle. For a MOOC, that
could be something like EdX or Coursera. Additionally,
there are other options out there, including using open
source platforms such as WordPress to host content. If
you do not have one of these services as an option, there
are a few possibilities to host content:

      WordPress: WordPress offers free services to
         anyone that wishes to set up a website at
         wordpress.com. Click here for more information
         on how to use WordPress as a classroom.

      Moodle: MoodleCloud is an affordable option for
         hosting a course in Moodle.

      Reclaim Hosting: If you want a flexible option to
         use WordPress, Moodle, Drupal, or any number of
         other open source programs, Reclaim Hosting is a
         good service made by educators for educators.

      Blackboard: Blackboard offers a free online
         course hosting service.

      Google Classroom: Google also offers a place to
         put classes online at google classrooms.

Please note that you will need to choose a platform that
matches the openness of your course. If you want to run

                                                                                               CHAPTER 3 41
a MOOC or have open material in any online course, the
closed nature of many LMS tools like Blackboard may
not make them a good tool for offering open content
or courses. On the other hand, if there are reasons you
are choosing to limit access to your course to only those
that register for it (like sensitive course content or
institutional requirements), the open nature of services
like EdX may not make them a good choice for your
course.

LEARNING ANALYTICS

One growing trend in education is the exploration of data
that online learning tools generate in an analytical way.
Whether you or your users realize it or not, everything
that you do online is usually recorded in a database
somewhere. This data has typically been locked away
from everyone (except for the company that collected it),
but that is starting to change.

Most of the tools that you can use in online learning -
from WordPress to EdX to Canvas to Blackboard - will
offer you the ability to see some kind of analysis of the
data activity in your course/website account/etc. If you
use that analysis to improve your course or influence
your learners, those actions move into the realm of
Learning Analytics. Your institution or company may
require that you use analytics, and even provide deeper
results from companies like Civitas. On the other hand,
your institution or company may not even know this data
exists.

The study of learning analytics is still a newer field with

42 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
many unknowns. However, there is interesting work
occurring in the field as it grows. For a good overview
of the field, we recommend The Handbook of Learning
Analytics edited by Charles Lang, George Siemens, Alyssa
Wise, and Dragan Gasevi. This handbook "is designed
to meet the needs of a new and growing field. It aims to
balance rigor, quality, open access and breadth of appeal
and was devised to be an introduction to the current state
of research."

The most important concept to keep in mind about
learning analytics is that the data being analyzed contains
sensitive personal information covered by many legal
guidelines. Ideally, you and your learners will be fully
informed about what is collected, how it is collected, what
is done with it after it is collected, and so on. Additionally,
the ideal legal scenario is that you and your learners
would choose to "opt in" to allowing this collection if you
agree with having your data utilized in this manner.

However, the more likely typical scenario is that little
clear information is given to end users about data
collection, with users being put in the position of having
to opt out of data collection (or even worse, have no way
of opting out if they want to get into a course). If this is
the case with the tools you use, we would suggest that you
take the initiative to clearly communicate with learners
everything you can discover about data collection in
every tool you use, including how to opt out if they so
choose. Data collection in education is a controversial
topic, so it is best to be open and clear as much as it is
possible within your context.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 3 43
Many reasons exist for considering the ethical dilemmas
within learning analytics. For example, looking at the
data the wrong way could lead to profiling learners
unfairly. Additionally, the algorithms used to create the
analytics will carry with them the bias of those that
created them. Learners are always unique individuals that
can defy the classification systems that analytics utilize.
For more information on these issues, as well as ways to
ethically use learning analytics, see this article:

      "7 Ethical Concerns With Learning Analytics" By
         Jim Yupangco

ETHICAL ISSUES RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY

Many tend to think of technology, algorithms, and
analytics as neutral entities that do not have programmed
assumptions, contexts, and biases in them. However, this
is not the case. All software has been found to reflect,
in small and large ways, the biases and assumptions of
those that created it (VanderLeest, 2004). This does not
necessarily mean that you should never use these tools,
but you should think through what these programmed
biases are and what they mean for how you use them in a
course (as well as how and what you communicate about
those tools to learners).

For example, "personalized learning" is a current
buzzword in online learning circles, with many
organizations putting large amounts of money into the
concept. Those organizations have goals behind the
money they put into their products, and biases for and
against certain philosophical schools of thought. For

44 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
instance, see this brief examination of some the ideas
shaping personalized learning in some of the largest
donors to the concept:

      "'Personalized Learning' and the Power of the
         Gates Foundation to Shape Education Policy" by
         Audrey Watters

The way that personalized learning is being shaped may
or may not disagree with your vision of learning,
however, you should know how it is being shaped before
using any tools connected to these organizations. You
should also take those influences into account when
utilizing tools and communicating about those tools to
learners.

An even deeper ethical consideration to explore is how
inequalities are part of the very fabric of the Internet
itself. Some think of this in terms of a digital divide. A
better concept to examine would be digital redlining: "the
creation and maintenance of technological policies,
practices, pedagogy, and investment decisions that
enforce class boundaries and discriminate against specific
groups." This definition comes from this article that looks
deeper into problems inherent in the Internet itself:

      "Pedagogy and the Logic of Platforms" by Chris
         Gilliard

Since this is an ever-evolving issue in education across
hundreds of technologies, resources, websites, concepts,
hardware, etc, you will need to do some searching for the
specific tools and ideas you want to use in your course,

                                                                                               CHAPTER 3 45
or that pertain to your context. For instance, if you work
in "for profit education," you probably should familiarize
yourself with the work of Tressie McMillan Cottom in
LowerEd (although she also covers many other topics you
should be aware of). The work of Audrey Watters at Hack
Education covers multiple ideas and technologies in
education from a historical critical lens. Chris
Gilliard's work in Digital Redlining and Student Framing
is also a good place to start. For international views on
technology issues, Maha Bali covers a wide range of

46 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
CHAPTER 4: PRODUCTION TIMELINES AND
PROCESSES

Once you are familiar with online learning in general
and the tools you will need, you will need to decide if a
MOOC or a regular online course is the right choice for
you. Once you have decided which the best choice is, the
next step is to begin the official proposal process.

PROPOSALS FOR NEW COURSES

All proposed online courses will probably need to have
the approval of someone before offering the course: a
Director, a Dean, and/or a department head of the
College or department to be offering the course. Online
courses require extensive resources that must be covered
by the instructor's organizational oversight. Please have
the proposal approved as you would any other courses
through your department or company.

Ideally, a proposal for a new course will need to be
submitted as soon as possible, at least one year before
the course is offered. Minimum proposal lead time for
shorter courses that are focused more on interaction (and
therefore require less media production) could shorten
the due date for proposals to six months.

Additionally, you will need to have already recruited a
course design team as well as decided on which

                                                                                               CHAPTER 4 47
platform(s) to utilize in your course. If your institution
or company does not offer these services for you, you
should recruit from people you work with whose normal
job duties cover various aspects of course creation (as
their workloads allow). You may also seek out grants and
teaching assistants to assist you as your department or
college allows. The course design team should be noted
on the proposal form.

Also note that a timeline for the creation of the course
should be submitted with the proposal. In your proposal,
you may also wish to include a reference to any quality
standards you will utilize to evaluate the course. Online
courses are generally expected to be completely ready to
go by the first day the course is offered, so please plan to
finish your design and pre-planned content and activities
well before the first day of course (be sure to build in
a few weeks at the end of the development process for
quality review as well, depending on your review
process). An orientation week before the course starts is a
good idea for working out any kinks with your learners.

CREATION OF APPROVED COURSES

Once a course has been approved, the creation process
should begin immediately - within one week of the
approval or less. This will include:

    1. Assign tasks to various members of your team.

    2. Create checkpoints with your departmental/
         organizational oversight to submit work in
         progress updates.

48 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
    3. Begin video creation (since video can take a long
         time to create, this should begin as soon as the
         course is approved).

    4. Begin creation of content.

    5. Create social media outlets, hashtags, etc. (if left to
         the last minute, someone may take the username/
         tag/etc. you want).

    6. Decide how the content created in the course will
         be licensed (see the chapter on Open Educational
         Resources for more details).

Within one month of approval, you should have at least
one full module or week completed (including videos and
graphics). This should be submitted to your
departmental/organizational oversight or an
instructional designer for review.

Within half the time between approval and when the
course starts (ideally six months before the course
begins), you should have at least half of the course
completed (including videos and graphics). This will be
submitted to your departmental/organizational oversight
or an instructional designer for review. However, your
departmental/organizational oversight or instructional
designer may request more frequent updates for more
complex courses.

One month before the course begins, everything for the
course should be complete and ready to go. This should
be submitted to your content and design reviewers for
full review.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 4 49
Any issues identified in the full review should be
addressed by one week before the course begins.

Additionally, we recommend that sometime within one
week before the course begins that you open the course
for a test run with any interested learners to ensure there
are no final issues.

DESIGN ASSESSMENT AND REVIEW

The course development plan should include assessment
and review of your course design. Your instructional
designer should include this in the course design, but it
may also require additional resources from you as the
instructor. If you do not have internal quality standards
to follow, you can utilize national quality standards, as
referenced in the "Quality Review" section of Chapter 3,
during both formative and summative assessments.

Formative Assessment is basically a review of the course
content and design as the course is being designed. You
should probably have at least one colleague review the
content of your course several times to give you feedback
on issues such as clarity, ease of navigation, content
alignment, workload balance, and technical concerns.
Additionally, the instructional designer will need to have
at least one other instructional designer review the design
of the course several times to provide feedback on the
overall course design. One helpful suggestion for quality
assessment is to first develop only one module or week
of content and submit it for a formative review. This
initial review should provide feedback in regards to the
quality standards you have selected to follow. Then, take

50 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
the feedback received and implement it as you continue
the design of the course.

Summative Assessment is basically review of the course
after it has been offered. This could consist of grades,
participant feedback, or course data. Most of this will not
magically appear, so you will need to plan for feedback as
part of the design process. Course participant assessment
techniques will be covered later in this book. Participant
feedback can be gained from several sources, including
Twitter feeds, pre- and post-course surveys, and forum
posts. Course data can include all types of electronically
collected information, from clicks on content links, to
time spent on specific pages, to profile information. You
will need to contact the course platform you use for
specific details on what data is collected and how you
access it.

Not only is course design assessment a good source for
data in published papers, but it is also a good place to gain
insight into how to update your course before offering
it again. For example, you can review how well your
student activities and assessments reflected the quality
of the learning objectives based on what the results of
summative assessment tell you. No course is perfect the
first time it is offered, so updates and changes are
expected after each offering.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 4 51
52 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
CHAPTER 5: EFFECTIVE PRACTICES

WHAT WE KNOW WORKS

In general, there are many different ways to design online
courses that work in different contexts, and many ways to
design online courses that do not work in various other
contexts. We are avoiding the term "best practices" here
because online teaching and learning can vary in different
contexts, making "best" a problematic term. We can offer
a list of some things that we know will usually work
better in most online courses:

      Spending time and resources to create a high
         quality learning experience (Lorenzo & Moore,
         2002; Hayes, 2015).

      Creating lessons that focus more on active
         engagement and less on passive content
         consumption (Lorenzo & Moore, 2002; Hayes,
         2015).

      If possible, especially in MOOCs, shorter course
         durations with simple, straight forward
         organization ( Jordan, 2015).

      Less focus and time on videos to watch and/or
         text to read per week (DiCarlo, 2009; Guo, Kim, &
         Rubin, 2014).

      If possible, especially in MOOCs, one topic or

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 53
         module per week ( Jordan, 2015).

      Completing the entire course design before the
         start date (Dick, Carey, & Carey, 2001). Many
         institutions and companies require this in order to
         allow time for quality review. You can build
         flexibility and open ended activities into your
         course, but the structure for that should be there
         before the courses starts (see the section on
         "Planning for Flexibility").

      Utilizing networked learning and interactive
         activities (Siemens, 2005).

      Instructors that participate in the social media
         outlets and discussion forums (Mathieson &
         Leafman, 2014; Zheng, Han, Rosson, & Carroll,
         2016).

      Listening to and responding promptly to
         participant concerns (Groundwater-Smith, 2008;
         Khalil & Ebner, 2014).

      Connecting content with current events and
         current life experiences of the learners (Cercone,
         2008).

      Well written goals/objectives/competencies
         accompanied by content and activities that align
         well with them (Dick, Carey, & Carey, 2001).

      Clear communication for all aspects of the course
         (Warren & Wakefield, 2012).

CLEAR COMMUNICATION

Speaking of clear communication, we should take a

54 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
minute to highlight that clear communication is
important for all aspects of education. Communication is
a foundational element of educational theory (Warren &
Wakefield, 2012); without clear communication, learners
can feel confused and discouraged. Many different
theories of communication exist; the important thing is
to pick one that works and stick with it. For those that
need some guidance, one suggestion is the Learning and
Teaching as Communicative Actions (LTCA) theory
developed by Dr. Scott Warren from the works of Jurgen
Habermas. LTCA theory basically breaks educational
communications down into four communicative types:

      Normative communicative actions are those
         that communicate knowledge that has been
         socially negotiated through time, such as social
         norms or expectations for student activities.
         While these actions are often based on past
         experiences, they can also evolve through time.

      Strategic communicative actions are probably
         the most familiar educational communicative
         actions for most educators. These communicative
         actions occur most often through lectures,
         textbooks, and other methods where specific
         reified knowledge is transferred to the learner.

      Constative communicative actions are debates,
         arguments, and discourses that allow learners to
         make claims and counterclaims. Constative
         communication is also where social
         constructivism and connectivism connects with
         LTCA theory, as learners come to agreement over

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 55
         constructed knowledge through these
         communicative actions

      Dramaturgical communicative actions are those
         that allow for expression. Learners can reflect or
         create artifacts that express the knowledge they
         have gained as well as who that knowledge makes
         them as a person.

The important aspect of LTCA theory (or any other
theory you choose to use) is to evaluate what you are
trying to communicate in various parts of the course and
then make sure to communicate effectively without
confusing communication styles. For example, don't set
up a blogging assignment that would require students to
use dramaturgical communicative actions and then create
long, detailed instructions requiring learners to use
strategic communicative actions.

For more information on LTCA theory, see the
theoretical framework sections of the following articles:

      "Learning and Teaching as Communicative
         Actions: A Mixed-Methods Twitter Study" by
         Jenny S. Wakefield, Scott J. Warren, and Metta
         Alsobrook

         Actions: Improving Historical Knowledge and
         Cognition Through Second Life Avatar Role Play"

         Rankin, Leila A. Mills, and Jonathan S. Gratch

TYPES OF COMMUNICATION AND

56 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
INTERACTION

Communication is an aspect of teaching that we all know
happens, but many do not think fully through what that
means. The types of clear communication you will want
in your course will most likely flow from the underlying
theories you subscribe to for the power dynamics and
methodology of your course (see the previous
"Theoretical Foundations of Learning" section). Looking
across the literature, various researchers (Moore, 1989;
Hillman, Willis, & Gunawardena, 1994; Anderson &
Garrison, 1998; Dron, 2007; Wang, Chen, & Anderson,
2014) have identified at least 12 types of communication
types that can happen in education:

      student-teacher (ex: instructivist lecture, student
         teaching the teacher, or student networking with
         teacher)

      student-student (ex: student mentorship, one-on-
         one study groups, or student teaching another
         student)

      student-content (ex: reading a textbook, watching
         a video, listening to audio, or reading a website)

      student-interface (ex: connectivist online
         interactions, gaming, or computerized learning
         tools)

      teacher-teacher (ex: collaborative teaching, cross-
         course alignment, or professional development)

      teacher-content (ex: teacher-authored textbooks
         or websites, teacher blogs, or professional study)

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 57
      content-content (ex: algorithms that determine
         new or remedial content; artificial intelligence)

      group-content (ex: constructivist group work,
         connectivist resource sharing, or group readings)

      group-group (ex: debate teams, group
         presentations, or academic group competitions)

      learner-group (ex: individual work presented to
         group for debate, student as the teacher exercises)

      teacher-group (ex: teacher contribution to group
         work, group presentation to teacher)

      networked with sets of people or objects (ex:
         Wikipedia, crowdsourced learning, or online
         collaborative note-taking)

Some courses will have one communication type for the
entire class. Others will have a few types, while still others
will have different types for each activity. Also, while
some types of communication like "student-teacher" may
lean towards certain power dynamics like instructivism,
that does not have to be the only possibility. For example,
student-teacher interactions could be constructivist if the
student is teaching the instructor, or possibly even
connectivist if a learner is bringing their instructor into a
networked learning experience.

The important issue to think through is what kind of
communication types you will need to accomplish clear
communication in the power dynamics or methodologies
you desire for your course, and then which
communication types will you need for individual
assignments in your course. For a discussion on applying

58 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
power dynamics, methodologies, clear communication,
and communication types to specific assignments, see the
later section on "Connecting Activities to Theory and
Communication". Additionally, for a deeper discussion
of the communication issues touched on here, see the
communication sections of "From Instructivism to
Connectivism: Theoretical Underpinnings of MOOCs"
by Matt Crosslin.

PLANNING FOR FLEXIBILITY

Many instructors like to have a well-structured and
planned out course, while others prefer varying levels of
flexibility to change the course content, structure, and/or
activities based on many factors (such as current events,
flexible lesson schedules, learner interest, etc). When we
refer to having a course completely designed and
reviewed by the first day of class, this refers to all of the
content and activities that you already know will be a part
of the course. For some courses, this will be all of the
content and activities. For other courses, this is more of
a "plan" or "outline" of what could happen depending on
various factors.

Planning for flexibility in your course can be challenging,
but the benefits will often make up for the difficult parts.
Mia Zamora and Alan Levine refer to this as building a
"Course Spine" that outlines the major course elements,
but leaves room to fill in details as the course progresses
(Levine, 2018). Other ways of looking at this concept
include "student-centered learning" and "problem based
learning" depending on how the course is structured.
Various ways to design your course to utilize these ideas

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 59
will be explored throughout this book. Additionally,
Chapter 13 is dedicated to more advanced course design
methods that fall into these categories, such as Self-
Mapped Learning Pathways and Rhizomatic Learning.

One thing to keep in mind: there is a difference
between "planning for flexibility" and "I ran out of time,
so let's make this up at the last minute." Flexibility should
flow from what you want your learners to accomplish in
the course, not from your lack of planning ahead. In many
cases, planning a well-designed, flexible course design
could take as much time (or more) as writing out
traditional instructor-focused content and activities.

HUMANIZING ONLINE LEARNING

A larger concept to keep in mind is the isolation that
can occur to learners in online learning, away from the
immediate contact created by being in the same physical
location as other learners. Some learners may prefer this
distance, while others may feel the effects of the isolation.
The idea of "Humanizing" an online course is basically
the process or creating ways to connect learners with
each other and the instructors across the distance of
online learning.

One helpful way to organize and think about humanizing
online learning is through the Community of Inquiry
(CoI) framework (Arbaugh, Bangert, & Cleveland-Innes,
2010). CoI basically focuses on increasing three
"presences" to help learners construct personal meaning
in learning as well as to collectively confirm mutual

60 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
understandings: teaching presence, social presence, and
cognitive presence.

Teaching presence is a large portion of what this manual
is covering: designing and facilitating a course in ways
that clearly communicates how learning will occur,
effectively humanizing or increasing the presence of the
instructor. Examples would include clearly defining
expectations, creating avenues to encourage learner
agency, and timely feedback to learners. One good way
to make sure this happens is create a schedule for you
to communicate with your learners, via email or other
methods, and then make sure you stick to that schedule.

Social presence focuses on the learners in the course,
helping them to see themselves as an individual "real
person" that can actively and safely participate in the
course. Many of these concepts are also covered in this
manual. Examples would include drawing in participants,
creating low-risk ways for them to express themselves,
and establishing Codes of Conduct (see the chapter on
"Utilizing Social Learning").

Cognitive presence is a bit more abstract of a concept, but
it basically covers looking at the entire learning process
for ways to encourage students to think about their
learning, reflect on that learning, and sharing their
learning process with others. Examples would include
encouraging learners to take ownership of their learning,
building in reflection activities, and creating avenues for
learners to share and interact with those reflections (for
instance, by blogging).

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 61

         compilation edited by Whitney Kilgore

SYNCHRONOUS INTERACTIVE SESSIONS

One possible way to foster teaching presence is to
schedule time for synchronous interactive sessions
during your course. This could include virtual office
hours, live sessions, unhangouts, or other ways for you to
connect with your learners virtually "in person."

The basic idea behind these sessions is that you choose
a time to meet, a synchronous service to utilize (usually
one that is free to use and allows flexibility to use video
and audio if you choose), and set some parameters for
what will happen at the session. Will it be a teaching
session where learners listen to what you have to share?
Will it be a Q&A/Office Hours type of session? Will it be
a group work/discussion session where learners interact
with each other? Depending on how you want to
structure the session, make sure your tool can handle the
service you want to utilize.

Virtual Office Hours will typically be a time for learners
to ask questions. This will typically involve scheduling
a recurring time each week for people to come ask
questions online. If you are teaching an online course, we

62 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
strongly suggest you set virtual office hours. Most online
chat or video tools will have a set of options that can
handle the "one-on-one office hours" format, but if you
want to have more of a group Q&A, you might want to
use a tool that can handle multiple users at once. Also
consider recording the sessions for those that can't make
it.

Live Sessions can be used for anything, from group
discussions to online lecture sessions. If you are intending
to broadcast information, you can use a tool that allows
learners to watch more than interact (screen sharing is
also a good option to make sure is available in the tool you
utilize as well). If you want to field questions, be sure the
tool you use has an option for that functionality (look for
text chat, polling, and other interactive options). Again,
consider recording the sessions for those that can't make
it.

Unhangouts are less structured sessions that allow
learners to connect with each other as they like. This is
more learner-centered that other sessions, but allows for
more self-determined learning designs.

Online gaming and virtual reality are two emerging
ideas for online interaction. Many have heard of Second
Life, which in the past was used for more nuanced online
interaction. Tools like Second Life are still around, and
are sometimes used in online learning. These tools are
not for every course or topic, but if you have a compelling
educational idea for using them, you should explore the
possibilities.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 63
Some issues to keep in mind:

      Online synchronous tools can cause accessibility
         issues for some learners - keep that in mind when
         choosing tools.

      Make sure to think about what times would be
         best for your specific learners in your course, and
         maybe have alternate times for those that live in
         different time zones or that work various
         schedules.

      Make sure to record the sessions as much as
         possible for those that cannot make it for various
         reasons.

      As much as you want to encourage learners to
         turn on their cameras or identify themselves to
         help them connect with each other, make sure to
         leave open the option that learners can also be
         anonymous if they choose. Some learners are shy
         or have other reasons to not reveal fully who they
         are online.

      Try to communicate as clearly as you can about
         the session before it starts. What will be covered?
         Can you take a poll beforehand to see where
         students are? Should they come with one thing
         specific to share or ask? What will happen if the
         tool you choose to use crashes or doesn't work?

      Make sure you offer a good reason for learners to
         be there. Don't just repeat what is in a book or in
         the course already. Cover new material, have
         learners interact with each other, or do something

64 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         that gives the learners something they can't get in
         other areas of the course.

Some possible tools to use:

      Zoom: Zoom has become a popular video
         conferencing system. It has the flexibility to allow
         large numbers of people on a single conference
         call, giving participants flexibility and ease of use.
         The free version does have some limits if you are
         in a larger course that you should take into
         consideration:

      Skype: Skype is a popular program for making
         online phone calls, but it can also be useful for
         virtual office hours and smaller group discussions.

      MIT's Unhangout: MIT's Unhangout is "an open
         source platform for running large-scale,
         participant-driven events online." Participants
         gather in a lobby and then are sent to breakout
         rooms to interact with each other.

      YouTube Live: YouTube Live took over for
         Google Hangouts on Air, with a focus on
         broadcasting live events. This is a good tool for
         broadcast (with some limited ability for questions
         from those watching), or for smaller online
         interactive meetings of 10 people or less.

      Institutional Tools: services like Canvas and
         Blackboard could have various tools bundled with
         them at your institution or company, so check to
         see what services you might already have access
         to. Your institution might also have other tools

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 65
         like Adobe Connect as well.

WHAT WE KNOW DOES NOT WORK

Finally, we offer a list of some things that we generally
know will not usually work well in most online courses,
also known as "pitfalls to avoid":

      Making your course content videos too long.
         People generally only have a 5-8 minute attention
         span. (Guo, Kim, & Rubin, 2014)

      Having too many videos or too much content in
         each week. Participants generally don't have time
         for a massive amount of content consumption,
         and they often don't remember much of it if they
         just passively consume it. (DiCarlo, 2009; Guo,
         Kim, & Rubin, 2014)

      Creating too much of the course structure "on the
         fly." Flexibility is always a good idea in teaching,
         but working on the main structure of the course
         design right before the course is supposed to go
         live can decreases quality considerably (Dick,
         Carey, & Carey, 2001). Remember - there is a
         difference between "planning for flexibility" and "I
         ran out of time, so let's make this up at the last
         minute." See the previous section on "Planning for
         Flexibility"

      Instructors that ignore social media or don't even
         allow learners to set-up or utilize any social media
         avenues. Social media is one of the a few ways to
         increase "teacher presence" in courses. (Mathieson
         & Leafman, 2014; Zheng, Han, Rosson, & Carroll,

66 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         2016)

      Low quality content or video, or recording videos
         when a video is not necessary. Online course
         participants generally have higher demands on
         quality than in the past. (Lorenzo & Moore, 2002;
         Hayes, 2015)

      Complex structures with excessive numbers of
         modules and topics covered. You generally want
         to stick with one topic / module per week, with a
         streamlined, easy to follow structure - especially
         in MOOCs. ( Jordan, 2015)

      MOOCs also have a few extra pitfalls to avoid:

               Replicating a full college course as a
                  MOOC. Learners have varying reasons for
                  taking MOOCs, from just wanting a
                  preview of a topic to gaining a certificate.
                  (Milligan, Littlejohn, & Margaryan, 2013)

               Long course duration. The longer your
                  MOOC, the higher the dropout rate will be.
                  Eight weeks is really the upper limit of
                  MOOC duration, with 5-6 weeks being
                  ideal. ( Jordan, 2015)

Please realize that no course is perfect. You will probably
not do everything that works and avoid everything that
does not work in every course offering. The ideal is to
look at the items on these lists as goals to strive for. For
instance, your course is not going to fall apart if two of
the videos go over 8 minutes long. We have just learned
from experience that forgetting too many of the things

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 67
that work or doing too many of the things that don't work
will cause more learners to drop out or even complain on
social media or course evaluations.

DEALING WITH STUDENT ISSUES

At some point in your course, you are going to run into
learners that have some type of problem: they may not
understand something, or have gotten behind, or any
other common student issues. You should probably
decide now how to react to issues. Some instructors tend
to take an approach of catching and shaming learners that
have issues. You may have read an article or blog post
lamenting how many have grandmothers that pass away
each semester, or how learners try weird excuses to get
out of due dates, or how various life issues bleed into
the class. These instructors usually take a very hard line
stance that involves not believing learners.

Certainly some learners will lie at some point about
something. However, creating an atmosphere that
assumes this from the beginning will tend to add more
tension than is needed in a course. We would generally
encourage you to take a stance that gives learners the
benefit of the doubt, showing compassion instead of
suspicion.

A lot of this boils down to how you handle course
assignments and deadlines. There may be some required
assignments or assessments that are given to you by the
institution. Others will be under your control. One way
to deal with late work and excuses is to look at
assignment grading as more of a conversation than a one-

68 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
time "gotcha!" event. For example, allow learners to turn
assignments in for early feedback before deadlines.
Create avenues for learners that genuinely get behind to
be able to catch up. Ask yourself: Are you more concerned
with them learning the content, or learning a calendar?

TO GRADE OR NOT TO GRADE?

Of course, many student issues arise from various aspects
of grading or assessment in courses. Many people work in
institutions or companies that require grades. However,
not everyone does, and even many places that require
grades leave it up to the instructor on how to calculate
those grades.

For several decades, many educators have been
questioning the practice of grading (Kohn, 2011;
Sackstein, 2015). Sometimes this is because the grades
have to include things that have nothing to do with what
the learner actually learned. A student that completely
understands the concept of a lesson, but runs a few days
late can potentially earn the same grade as the person that
really doesn't get the concept but follows all the technical
instructions perfectly. Other educators object to how
grades are a reflection of how well learners can game
the grading system rather than learn the content. Still
others object to the unnecessary competition that society
creates around the highest grades, and the pressure that
puts on learners. There are many reasons to find grades
problematic.

But is it possible to have a meaningful class without
grades? There are many different ways to look at this.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 5 69
Some instructors will allow learners to create the grading
system for the class. Others will allow learners to grade
themselves. Still others will abolish grades altogether and
replace them with things like badges, certificates, and
other forms of alternative certification (see the section on
"Certification and Badges" for more information on that).
There is a range of responses to the problems that many
see with grades. If you are thinking of taking a different
path with grading in your course, here are some resources
to consider reading:

      "What's the Problem with Grades?" by Alfie Kohn
      "Why I Don't Grade" by Jesse Stommel
      "12 Alternatives To Letter Grades In Education"

         by Terry Heick
      "Ungrading My Class - Reflections on a Second

         Iteration" by Maha Bali

Whether or not you are going to grade your students,
have them grade themselves, or go grade-less in your
course, you will still need to take several issues
concerning how you design your assessment (or your
learners' self-assessments) into consideration. See the
Chapter on "Assessment and Grading Issues" for more
details on those considerations.

74 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
CHAPTER 6: CREATING EFFECTIVE COURSE
ACTIVITIES

In order to cross over from passive content consumption
into active learning, you will need to make real-life
activities the focus of your course content (Hayes, 2015).
Activities can be discussions, interactive assignments,
blogging, and social media participation - or could even
involve learners themselves creating content and
activities.

PLATFORM-SPECIFIC ACTIVITIES

Most course platforms have several categories of
activities that range from standard online activities to
innovative technology-driven interaction. The exact tools
you have access to will vary based on the one you are
using, but there are some that tend to be universal.
Becoming familiar with these activities before you design
will help you actively imagine where they could be
utilized in your class.

      Discussions: Most platforms have a discussion
         tool, and they all tend to operate in similar
         fashions. However, if you desire to use discussion
         tools, you should become familiar with how the
         one for your specific platform works as some
         versions are different in some ways than the

                                                                                               CHAPTER 6 75
         typical discussion tool.

      Problems/Questions: These tools often have
         different names, but the general idea is that they
         are basically online test questions. Sometimes
         these can be placed in the flow of content to add
         some interaction, or other times these are in a
         separate area as a standard "test." These can also
         be used as informal or ungraded polls to gauge
         learner interest or feedback.

      Exercises and Tools: There are also usually
         several other tools that accomplish various
         interactive tasks. These include everything from
         internal blogs, to drag and drop images, to
         discipline-specific problems such as the periodic
         table tool.

BLOGGING AND EXTERNAL ACTIVITIES

Of course, you are also free to use blogs and other
external sources in your course as either the main focus
of connectivist learning or as a supplement to the content
you create. See the chapter on "Social Learning" for more
details on how create these types of activities. Your
instructional designer should also be familiar with using
these tools in an online course.

How to Choose From Various Similar Tools

[Adopted from "The Confusion Over a Little Thing Called
Blog" by Matt Crosslin, published in the former MoodleZine
Online Journal, July 2006]

When looking at the various tools that are available to

76 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
you in a course, you will notice that there are many
similarities between various tools. How exactly are blogs
different from online journal tools or even discussion
boards? When it comes down to it, many tools like blogs,
journals, and discussion boards are all forms of personal
publication that have similar core components:

      Genesis: something prods the need for the tool
         into existence. This prod may be the need to
         reflect on personal issues, or the need to start an
         online conversation.

      Input: there is always a place to type in what you
         want to say, and then press "Submit." Any type of
         media can be submitted - text, audio, or video.

      Interface: The submission is viewed through an
         interface. This may resemble the reverse
         chronological reflection journals with feedback at
         the end format of blogs, or the typical
         chronological feedback format of threaded
         discussions, or any number of configurations.

      Feedback: sometimes a function for the truly
         brave (or the gluttons for punishment), there are
         often ways to receive responses from either the
         instructor or other learners or both. Whether it is
         getting grades from the instructor or arguments
         from strangers around the world - there is almost
         always an opening for something.

Of course, we still tend to see blogs, journals, discussion
boards, and other tools as totally separate entities. This is
because each one of them have a totally different focus.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 6 77
That focus determines how all of the above listed
components end up functioning. Let's look at a few
examples:

      For blogs, the focus is on the most recent input in
      a string of inputs. This means that the interface is
      going to display the entries reverse chronologically.
      This also means that the input device is going to
      allow for several entries. The feedback mechanism
      usually will only allow for comments on one specific
      input at a time, and related discussions will
      sometimes be confusing to follow because of that.

      For journal tools, the focus is on the overall insight of
      the entry (or entries). This means that the instructor
      is usually the only one to be able to return feedback.
      Many times, the input and interface features are
      minimal or even non-existent ("just e-mail me a
      Word doc"), even though they can be well-developed
      in some tools like Blackboard.

      For discussion boards, the focus is on the feedback to
      the initial question or comment (the genesis). This
      means that the interface will focus on how to display
      these responses in an easy to read format. Some
      discussion board tools obviously don't spend very
      much time on developing this, but others do.

Ultimately, the differences between various tools may not
matter for your desired assignment, or it may mean the
difference between a confusing activity and a successful
activity. The important take away from this section is to
think through exactly what you want to accomplish with

78 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
any given activity, and then find a tool to match your
intended goals.

RENEWABLE ASSIGNMENTS AND ACTIVITIES

The problem with many assignments and activities is that
they are often locked away in password protected
learning management systems. This can be good for
privacy and safety reasons, but many learners want to
have ways to show off the work that they do in class to
others (including potential or current employers). While
some portfolio systems exist to assist with getting content
out of the "walled garden" effect of learning management
systems, many of these are still more closed off than some
learners would like. Some refer to these kinds of
assignments as "disposable," because they get turned in
for class and then deleted once the course is removed or
archived off of the system they were submitted to.

One way to deal with this issue is by creating open
assignments or activities. These are activities that take
place somewhere online, either on a public website or
on a website that the learners control. Because of this
distributed structure, finding learner's work can be
difficult unless a system is created for collecting these
responses and resources. They are often referred to as
"renewable" assignments or activities, in contrast to
"disposable" assignments that often occur within the
LMS. Some examples include having learners edit
Wikipedia articles for accuracy, or blogging about their
learning process. For more information and some ideas,
see these resources:

                                                                                               CHAPTER 6 79
      "Toward Renewable Assessments" by David Wiley

      "Opting for Renewable Assessments" by Jason B.
         Jones

      "Renewable Assignments: Student Work Adding
         Value to the World" by Christina Hendricks

The main focus of renewable assignments would be to
create assignments for learners that allows them to add
value to the world in some way. Since this value may look
different to different learners in different contexts, one
way to facilitate renewability is by creating assignment
banks, the focus of the next section.

ASSIGNMENT BANKS

Due to the fact that online courses will draw in
participants from different learning contexts, one idea
to accommodate differing contexts is to create a flexible
assignment bank for learners to choose from various
assignment options. One innovative pedagogical
approach that has the potential to work well in both
MOOCs and traditional online courses is the utilization
of assignment banks. Jim Groom's ds106 (Digital
Storytelling) course at the University of Mary
Washington (UMW) serves as an early example of
effectively implementing assignment banks into both
types of courses. DS106 is free and open to participants
across the globe while simultaneously functioning as a
for-credit course at UMW.

One of the key features of this course, the assignment
bank, allows students flexibility in their submission types

80 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
by promoting learner choice through ten unique
classifications (e.g. video, 3D printed, written, etc.)
(DS106 Assignment Bank, 2016) and use of personal web
domains (Groom, 2015). This lack of rigidity has the
potential to stimulate creativity when compared to
traditional, formulaic assignments. Another strength of
the ds106 assignment bank is that the course compiles
submissions in an open environment that is also available
to future students. This can help develop online
community over time and encourage investment in the
course by students, both of which have the potential to
increase engagement and retention (Groom, 2013).

Evaluating submissions through assignment banks can
take place in a number of ways. For example, DS106
utilizes a public difficulty rating system of one to five
stars, which students accrue when they complete a
submission. Other courses might implement a cumulative
point system. In this case, students could complete a
number of assignments with different values to earn
credit. The types could vary by depth of knowledge,
length of time to complete, level of collaboration with
peers, or a number of other factors.

CONNECTING ACTIVITIES TO THEORY AND
COMMUNICATION

In previous sections "Theoretical Foundations of
Learning," "Clear Communication," and "Types of
Communication," we looked at how to determine power
dynamics, methodology, and communication types for
your course and course activities. This chapter has
introduced various tools and ideas for activities in

                                                                                               CHAPTER 6 81
courses. It is now time to bring this all together to look
at how to choose assignments for your course. This is
not a very complex concept once you have examined all
of the foundations, but many people will create online
courses without putting much thought at all into it, and
then wonder why they do not even come close to getting
the results they desire from their courses. There are really
four basic steps:

    1. Determine the Main Power Dynamic for the
         Course (Instructivist, Constructivist,
         Connectivist, etc). Ask yourself "What is the main
         reason for the dynamic I selected?" and "What
         other power structures could also possibly be part
         of the course design?" It is okay to have mixtures
         of others, but thinking through that may make
         you reconsider the main one.

    2. Determine the Main Methodology for the
         Course (Pedagogy, Andragogy, Heutagogy, etc).
         Ask yourself "What is the main reason for the
         methodology I selected?" and "What other
         methodologies could also possibly be part of the
         course design?" Again, it is okay to have mixtures
         of methodologies, but thinking through that may
         make you reconsider the main one.

    3. Make a List of Every Type of Communication
         You Think Would Be Utilized in the Course (see
         the previous section on "Types of Communication
         and Interaction"). This may be a short list (or a list
         of one) or a long list. Then, next to each type of
         communication, write out the power structure

82 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         and methodology you want to use with each type.
         Use this list to re-evaluate numbers one and two.

    4. Create a Map of the Activities You Would Like
         in the Course. The final step is to start listing the
         activities (or activity ideas) that you want in the
         course. Then connect those with a communicative
         action (Normative, Strategic, Constative,
         Dramaturgical, etc - see previous section on
         "Clear Communication"). Connect each of those
         with a type of communication. Next, add the
         power dynamic and methodological match for
         each item in the list. This process may cause you
         to revise previous steps, or even the map of
         activities. Finally, match your activities to your
         goals/outcomes/competencies (and make sure
         there are no gaps), order the list, and begin
         plugging it into the course outline.

As you can see, this process requires a lot of looking at
different parts and revising as analysis reveals missing
elements or incorrect identifications. For example, a list
of assignments may reveal that you desire to have mostly
heutagogical networked activities where you previously
identified instructivist pedagogical student-teacher
strategic communication as your course structure. This
should lead you to reconsider the overall structure of the
course (or to redesign the activities to match the existing
structure).

helpful worksheet for the steps listed above, see "From

                                                                                               CHAPTER 6 83

84 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
CHAPTER 7: CREATING EFFECTIVE COURSE
CONTENT

In addition to activities, online courses also usually
contain content. Content can be videos, text, webpages,
and textbooks. While MOOCs are typically lighter in
these areas than a typical online course, traditional online
courses can also be light on content, while MOOCs can
be heavy on content. This content can be external to the
LMS platform, or hosted inside of it. Since we encourage
a focus on active learning over passive consumption of
content in courses, we also encourage you to consider
the activities first and then add content to support those
activities. However, whatever format your content takes,
please realize that online course participants have come
to expect high quality learning experiences (Hayes, 2015).
Please make plans to have all pre-determined content
completed and available to participants well before the
first day of class.

MICROLEARNING AND MICROCONTENT

Microlearning (or short bits of learning) is one type of
instruction that works very well with online learning
(Hug, 2010), especially with large informal online classes.
Theo Hug (2010, 2012) defines microlearning as, "... [A]n
abbreviated manner of expression for all sorts of short-
time learning activities with microcontent" (p. 2268).

                                                                                               CHAPTER 7 85
Learners benefit from these shorter bursts of information
rather than facing a wall of text while taking an online
course. The advantage of microlearning is that students
can decide what content they want to learn and just focus
on that bit of information. This works well for students
who are just interested in part of the content of the
course, but may not be involved with the course as a
whole.

To avoid cognitive load (Sweller, 1988), or loading
students down with too much information all at once,
consider breaking up curricular content into shorter
chunks of content, or microcontent. Microlearning is the
idea of taking your curriculum and grouping it in too
much briefer units. Think about curriculum in terms of
two main categories: text based content and multimedia
based content. Multi-modal information might take the
shape of audio or video, for instance, or a brief
infographic or concept map (Semingson, Crosslin, &
Dellinger, 2015). For instance, for audio-based learning,
you can create and share micro podcasts that are one to
five minutes in length. You might also consider making
microcontent in the form of videos that are one to five
minutes in length. The main recommendation here is to
keep microlearning under five minutes in length, as
described in other parts of this handbook.

For an example,see micro podcasts from Dr. Peggy
Semingson on the audio platform SoundCloud.

Notice that these micro podcasts linked above are
accompanied by a verbatim transcript for each micro
podcast. We highly suggest that you write the transcript

86 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
first and then do the recording of the micro podcast so
as to avoid filler words when doing the recording. You
can record micro podcasts using your mobile device with
the built-in voice memo feature. Suggested platforms
include SoundCloud, Audioboom, or Mixcloud. More
details on this can be found in the "Creating Quality
Videos" chapter later in this handbook.

Some ideas for using microlearning with assessment
might include a two to three question quiz, following
a bit of content such as a short video. You might also
send students on a very brief web-based expedition to
look for web-based content or information to share on a
discussion board. The goal in this type of task is to keep
time spent on learning short and brief; again, under 5
minutes is ideal.

To keep students active in their own learning, you might
also consider having students create a short text-based
response to a discussion prompt, or have students create
a short podcast or video that is one to five minutes in
length. This type of task give students agency over their
own learning, yet is low stakes enough that it won't take
a lot of time to complete (in theory!). Encourage students
to use their mobile device, such as a smartphone or tablet,
as a way to engage with microlearning and microlearning
based tasks.

Other ideas to use microlearning and create professor-
authored content for a course:

    1. Mobile devices to create microcontent: Use your
         phone to take a picture of yourself to post on your

                                                                                               CHAPTER 7 87
         LMS or CMS. You can use this for your profile
         picture or syllabus picture. Take pictures of
         landscapes in your city to include in course for a
         "local" look for online students to feel connected
         to the region. Click here for examples of such
         content. Then, have students do the same and post
         a picture of themselves, or something related to an
         aspect of the course content.

    2. Use your smartphone to record a short video to
         post to your course. For example: "reminder"
         videos (1-2 minutes) that nudge students along
         with assignments. Also, provide commentary on
         real world applications as they relate to your
         course content. Include these as content in your
         course.

TEXT CONTENT

Most LMS and CMS platform have very robust tools for
creating content. You can also link to external websites
for content, or designate an electronic or physical
textbooks. We recommend choosing websites and books
that are free to use, in keeping with the general idea of
openness. There are many open educational resource
services that offer a wide range of books and other open
materials. We highly encourage you to use these resources
for your course. See the chapter on Open Educational
Resources for more information.

Most online content delivery platforms are linear in their
presentation of content, so keep that in mind when
designing content. Leaving the flow of content to skip

88 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
around to another section can be difficult for some
learners, so plan to keep all content and activities in a
linear path as much as possible. This will come in handy
when breaking large sections of content into manageable
chunks. While you can have all content on one long page,
scrolling down through that content can introduce scroll
fatigue, causing your participants to lose focus (Gobet
et al, 2001). Take advantage of the linear paradigm to
create several smaller chunks of text intermingled with
activities to help your participants engage more with the
material.

However, don't forget that you have the entire World
Wide Web at your disposal, full of information and ideas.
Why not send your participants out there to find the
content for themselves and share it with one another
through discussion forums or blog posts? Or you could
even create more advanced learner-centered course
structures to allow learners to map their own learning
pathway. See the chapter on "Advanced Course Design"
for more ideas in this area. Even though it can be helpful
to many learners to keep your course linear, you can
always encourage some learners to take a non-linear
approach to learning if they find that helpful.

VIDEO CONTENT

Most online courses contain some portion of video
content. Some even deliver all content though videos. We
recommend having at least a few videos in your course.
This will help your learners connect with you in ways
they can't through text alone. We have a few
recommendations for video content in courses:

                                                                                               CHAPTER 7 89
      Quality: Please keep video quality in mind, even
         in MOOCs. Even though MOOCs are free,
         learners are expecting high quality (Hayes, 2015).
         Low quality videos can cause some participants to
         drop out. You will need to find a way to utilize a
         high quality production facility, with professional
         quality microphones and cameras, as well as a
         monitor for displaying your script. And yes, you
         will need to use a script (see the chapter on video
         production for the reasons why even the best
         lecturers need to use a script).

      Length: Most people can only watch about 5-10
         minutes in one setting. We recommend keeping
         each video around 3-6 minutes long (Guo, Kim, &
         Rubin, 2014). If you need more time than that,
         then please consider breaking the content into
         multiple parts.

      Total Amount of Videos: This is an important
         consideration in MOOCs, but can also serve as a
         good guide for any course as well. Most MOOC
         participants are taking a MOOC in their limited
         spare time. If there are too many videos, even if
         they are less than 10 minutes long, learners will be
         tempted drop out. Remember that any one
         MOOC cannot substitute for a full college course.
         Learners will not be able to watch 1-3 hours of
         video in any given week. We recommend the
         weekly video limit being 30 minutes or less (Guo,
         Kim, & Rubin, 2014). For traditional online
         courses, there can be more video, but please
         remember to not overload your learners with

90 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         more than they can handle in a given week.

      Captioning: Learners with accessibility issues as
         well as those who do not speak the language that
         your course is delivered in must have captions and
         transcripts. These must be timed and
         downloadable. Additionally, any PowerPoints or
         handouts covered in the video should be available
         for download.

HOSTING VIDEO CONTENT

Some LMS and CMS platforms will have options for
hosting video content. Some will even have very specific
requirements for offering video content. Others will not
actually host videos, so you will need to use other services
for hosting any videos you create. A few general tips on
hosting videos:

      Open Video Hosting Service: In keeping with
         principles of openness, we generally recommend
         hosting your videos as much as possible on open
         platforms such as YouTube, Vimeo, or other
         options. You will need to have an account with
         this service to host the videos you create. Once
         you upload your videos to your account, you can
         embed the videos into your LMS/CMS platform.
         Many of these platforms, such as Blackboard,
         EdX, and WordPress, support native YouTube
         embedding. Other services like Vimeo are not
         supported by all platforms, so be sure to check
         with both your LMS/CMS platform and the video
         hosting service you offer.

                                                                                               CHAPTER 7 91
      Video Downloads: Some students have
         bandwidth limits or accessibility issues that makes
         video streaming difficult. Allowing your learners
         to download videos to watch later can help. This
         is optional, but highly recommended. Some video
         hosting services allow this, others do not. If not,
         you will need a website or other file hosting
         system that allows file storage and download. You
         will want to use a standard video format like MP4
         if so.

      Transcriptions: These are often required by law
         in many places where your students will be taking
         your course, so please plan to provide
         transcriptions. This would be in addition to
         captioning your videos (see the chapter on video
         creation). Not all platforms allow this, while
         others allow transcriptions but require specific
         formats. For instance, the edX platform uses SRT
         files to provide captions and transcriptions. If
         available, we also recommend turning on the
         option that allows the transcript to be
         downloaded, as this will help more students with
         access issues. If not available, then we recommend
         uploading the transcript as separate file and
         adding a download link under the video.

      PowerPoints/Handouts: If you use slides or other
         material in your video, we also recommend
         uploading those so that learners can download
         and view while watching the video. Again, this
         helps some learners with accessibility issues.

92 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
DIVERSITY IN CONTENT AND VIDEOS

Keep in mind that all content in video or text format will
express a point of view that is based in the context of the
people that created the content. This is not necessarily a
bad thing, but it may cause some confusion for those that
come from a different social or cultural context (often
referred to as "sociocultural"). Everything from our
ethnicity to educational level to history to geographic
location to personal interests to political views and so
on combine to create unique sociocultural contexts. We
all exist with these various circles, and those circles have
their unique norms, social cues, etc.

Because of this, it is good to keep in mind the diversity of
your learners when creating content. Don't do anything
outrageous or culturally insensitive, but take the time to
explain things that others may not understand. Think
through issues like:

      Do all the people in my examples or graphics look
         like me?

      What statements or images would not make sense
         to those living elsewhere?

      Am I looking at all issues from all angles, or just
         the ones I am familiar with?

      Do I express any of my opinions as facts?

Also be aware of the external content you are choosing.
Does it primarily represent one or two sociocultural
contexts? How could you change that? Are there ways you
can involve your learners in content creation to expand

                                                                                               CHAPTER 7 93
diversity? See the later section on "Diversity in Online
Courses" for more information and resources on
examining sociocultural influences in your course
overall, including the content.

LOCATING OPEN EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES

Before diving into creating course content yourself,
consider looking for content that has been created by
others and shared openly for others to re-use. This type
of content - whether it is text, images, videos, audio,
books, or any kind of media - is commonly called "Open
Educational Resources" (OER). The creator of that media
has shared that media via permissions that allow you to
use them in your course. In many cases, you are even free
to re-mix and modify these resources as you see fit. Not
finding the perfect text or video for a particular topic?
Look into OER to see if you can mix together something
that is a better fix.

Where do you find OER? You can usually search typical
websites like Google, Flickr, YouTube, and other websites
for open content (typically licensed under a Creative
Commons license rather than traditional copyright). For
a more in depth look at how to search for open text
images, video, and audio content, see this guide:

      Find OER

Interested in creating your own OER? See the next
chapter on Open Educational Resources for more details
on licensing and open options.

96 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
CHAPTER 8: OPEN EDUCATIONAL
RESOURCES

The section on openness in the previous chapter touched
on the concept of "open" as being more complex than just
"free." In a more formal sense, educational resources that
are released openly are often called "open educational
resources" (OER). But there is often more to OER being
considered "open" than just price. The OER Commons
define OER as "teaching and learning materials that you
may freely use and reuse, without charge.... OER often
have a Creative Commons or GNU license that state
specifically how the material may be used, reused,
adapted, and shared." Other organizations have slightly
similar or different definitions than this - you can see a
list of some here.

WHY GO OPEN?

Many institutions and companies are pushing for an
increased usage of open resources in their courses as this
practice can help learners save on the costs of materials.
This is usually accompanied by a push for instructors
to create open resources as well. If you have the option
to release your content as an open resource, there are
also other benefits to doing so in addition to the savings
for your learners. Your work and/or research as a
professional would be available to a wider audience,

                                                                                               CHAPTER 8 97
gaining you increased recognition among colleagues.
This wider audience could give you more people looking
at your work to review and give feedback, improving
quality and accessibility. This could also help spread the
reputation of your institution or company to new areas
or contexts. All of this helps you participate in the often-
forgotten social responsibility of providing education for
all. Open resources are a great chance to help your
learners and many others in many ways.

WHAT IS AN OER?

OER are typically created using the same tools as
anything else - word processors, graphic editor
programs, etc. No special new skills or tools are
necessarily to create OER beyond what you already have
been using to create course content or activities.
Anything that you create in a course could become an
OER: text, articles, books, graphics, videos, activities,
assignments, assessments, games, etc. The difference
between OER and typical resources are the permissions
that you assign to the works you create. One popular way
to look at these permissions is the 5R Open Course Design
Framework by Lumen Learning:

      Retain: Other people have permission to make,
         own, and control copies of your resource.

      Reuse: Other people can use your resource in a
         wide range of ways (like in a class, a website, a
         video, etc.).

      Revise: Other people can adapt, adjust, modify, or
         alter your resource itself (for example, translating

98 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         it into another language).

      Remix: Other people can combine your original
         or revised resource with other materials to create
         something new.

      Redistribute: Other people can share copies of
         your original resources, their revisions, or their
         remixes with others.

Of course, many people can already do this with many
resources online. The difference with OER is that you
give permission to do these through a specific open
license.

OPEN LICENSING

Most people are familiar with copyright, although
probably not the details of copyright law. The main point
of copyright is to protect the usage and distribution of
original works of authorship, usually in favor of the
creator of the work. Anything under copyright is
designated as "all rights reserved."

On the other end of the spectrum is public domain, where
either the owner has released all rights, or the rights have
expired. This is typically referred to as "no rights
reserved." Different countries, and even different states
within various countries, will have varying copyright
laws that address rights and public domain. Click here for
an example of the differences with in the United States.

Between these two options resides the bulk of open
licensing that is often referred to as "some rights
reserved." One of the most popular ways to license these

                                                                                               CHAPTER 8 99
works is through a Creative Commons (CC) license.
These are a set of licenses that designate how you would
like your work to be attributed, shared, and used (or not
used) for commercial purposes. CC licenses are open, free
to use, and popular with millions around the world. Also,
it is important to note that CC works in parallel with
copyright - you can still retain copyright while using CC.

Utilizing a CC license can help get your work out to more
people. A brief review of the different CC licenses:

      Attribution (CC BY): Other people can distribute,
         remix, tweak, and build upon your work
         (commercially or non-commercially), as long as
         they give you credit for your original work.

      Attribution-ShareAlike (CC BY SA): Others
         people can remix, tweak, and build upon your
         work (commercially or non-commercially), as
         long as they give you credit and license their new
         work under the same terms.

      Attribution-NonCommercial (CC BY NC):
         Other people can remix, tweak, and build upon
         your work (non-commercially). Their new work
         must also credit you and be non-commercial, but
         they don't have to license their derivative works
         the same way you did.

      Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike (CC
         BY NC SA): Other people can remix, tweak, and
         build upon your work (non-commercially) - as
         long as they give you credit and license their new
         work under the same terms.

100 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
      Attribution-NoDerivatives (CC BY ND): Others
         can share your work - commercially and non-
         commercially - as long as your worked is credited
         to you and shared complete and unchanged.

      Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs (CC BY
         NC ND): Others can download your work and
         share with others as long as they give you credit,
         don't change your work in any way, or use your
         work commercially.

Please note that the last two licenses (CC BY ND and CC
BY NC ND) are not considered OER compliant because
they do not allow works to be revised or remixed. If you
are not sure which license to choose, or want help in
choosing a license, see the CC License Chooser page for
help:

Keep in mind that licensing does not just apply to text
content. Images, videos, animations, and other creative
works can also be offered through an open license. With
all forms of media - especially video content - just
remember to keep track of everything you use when
creating the media. Not everything you use may be free
to include in an open license. For example, if you use a
famous song for background music in your videos, you
won't be able to release those videos as OER. Keep this is
mind with graphics, music, sound effects, and other parts
you utilize when creating video or media. There are vast
libraries of license-free media that you can use if needed
- just search for the type of license-free media you need.
You may have to look at multiple websites to find exactly
what you are looking for.

                                                                                             CHAPTER 8 101
SHARING OER BEYOND YOUR CLASS

Once you create your resource, you will obviously share
it within your course. But if that was your end goal with
sharing, you probably didn't need to go the OER route.
The next step is to consider how to get that resource out
beyond your course.

The main issues you will want to consider are
accessibility and platform. You will want to make sure
that your OER meets accessibility standards, as well as
working with the platform you want to share it on. For
media-type works, you will probably consider media
sharing websites like YouTube, Flickr, Vimeo, and others.
Make sure to do some research to make sure there isn't
some less popular service that might be a better fit for
your media type (for example, YouTube doesn't allow
users to download videos, so you will need to take that
into consideration).

For some OER, you might want to upload your resources
to your own website, or create a blog to publish them
on. You may even want to host your videos on your own
website. These topics are covered in the Creating Content
chapter.

Of course, in an educational context, the focus of OER
creation will be more on creating educational tools,
modules, etc. rather than on individual media files. Some
resources like the OER Commons can be better suited for
building education specific resources in addition to just
content. You can see a list of other resource options with
an educational or multi-media focus on this page.

DESIGNING COURSES USING OER

Building an online course entirely using OER is a
challenging process, although there is a great wealth of
different resources and textbooks available. Some of
these resources, as stated previously, allow you to use
or remix the chapters, assessments, etc., as necessary to
create your course. Not every academic field or subject
area has available OER. Sometimes you will want to (or
out of necessity: need to) author your own OER.
However, if you truly want to design your entire course
using OER and not use a ready-made OER textbook with
its accompanying materials, this can be challenging as
well.

Additionally, if you are a proponent of a particular
instructional design model, then outlining your course
(which most models advocate) will be an important initial
step that will guide the OER decisions that you will need
to make. Decisions about what materials best serve
students will be dictated by that outline. Also, deciding
how you want to provide those materials, either
embedded in the course, or through hyperlinks, etc., will
also be important (see chapter 5 - Effective Practices).

One of the benefits of OER is the versatility of formats
available; one downside is that using OER materials
unlocks the possibility of change. Consider what would
happen if you link to materials that become outdated...
or even removed from the web. Because of this, you will
need to review materials regularly to make sure links to
materials aren't broken. You will also need to consider

                                                                                             CHAPTER 8 103
what method of adding the material to your course will
best benefit your learners:

      Direct Link. Directly linking to material is the
         easiest way to connect to OER, but the downside
         is that you frequently have to check each link to
         make sure they are still working.

      Copy and Paste. If you copy and paste materials
         into whatever hosting platform you choose, you
         now have the materials permanently placed
         within the course. This eliminates the need to
         worry about a link breaking due to missing
         content. However, you no longer have a link to the
         source content, so changes to the original material
         will not be reflected in your course.

      Embed Through Iframe. If you are embedding
         material using an iframe (which typically means
         utilizing a 3rd party source like a YouTube video),
         you don't need to update the content because it is
         linked to the source directly. If there is a change in
         the material, the change will be automatically
         reflected on the course page. Many websites allow
         embeds, but not all do.

      Dynamic Connections. More complex methods
         of adding OERs are possible using JavaScript,
         LTIs, and other technical methods. You will need
         to follow the instructions of the provider of the
         material and your course platform to make these
         happen, and not all connections work well.

No matter which method you utilize, any/all OER

104 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
material should be reviewed regularly for outdated
information and appropriate permissions.

When building a course using OER, here are some main
considerations you should keep in mind:

      Make sure the material is hosted on a reliable,
         stable website (websites like OpenStax and OER
         Commons that are less likely to be available today
         and gone tomorrow) and you understand the
         permissions associated with the material. Not all
         OER is the same (see the Open Licensing section
         above).

      Remember: not all material online is OER. For
         instance, not every YouTube video is considered
         OER. When it comes to permissions, one common
         gray area of understanding is the appropriate use
         of YouTube. Most YouTube videos do not carry a
         Creative Commons License. Those that are not
         CC licensed are not OERs. They are free to access
         and they can be linked to, but be sure to check
         your company or institutional policy before
         embedding into a course (even when utilizing a
         password-protected platform). Some companies
         or institutions might have a policy against
         YouTube embeds. This would apply to Ted Talks
         as well.

      The decisions you make about how OER will be
         used in your course and its placement in your
         course will often be dictated by the permissions
         associated with the OER.

                                                                                             CHAPTER 8 105
      Consider how you can add variety with OER.
         Think about mixing it up in your course by using
         different mediums: video, textbooks, materials,
         etc. Here is a sample list of various types of OER
         available:
               Animations
               Assessments
               Assignments
               Case Studies
               Collections
               ePortfolios
               Learning Object Repositories
               Full Online Courses
               Online Course Modules
               Open (Access) Journal Articles
               Open (Access) Textbooks
               Presentations
               Quizzes/Tests
               Reference Materials
               Simulations
               Tutorials
               Videos

      Always check accessibility. Not all OER is
         accessible (see the section on "Accessibility" in
         Chapter 2 for more details).

CHAPTER 9: ASSESSMENT AND GRADING
ISSUES

GRADING IN ONLINE COURSES

Grading and assessment in learning is a complex subject
that can (and often does) fill an entire book alone. It is
also an area that all instructors with any experience in
teaching know well. Grading can run the gamut from
informal off the cuff questions thrown out spontaneously
in class to gauge understanding, all the way to extensively
controlled, proctored high stake tests.

To add to this complexity, every LMS and CMS system
has slightly or majorly different ways to create and
administer assessments. Your options may be limited to
a few tools, or overwhelmingly complex in options. It is
outside the scope of this manual to cover every single
option of every tool, as there are too many to realistically
cover, and they will change immediately after any list is
completed. Instead, we will cover some issues concerning
assessment and grading in general, giving a few ideas for
better ways of approaching the concept of assessment.
You may be teaching as part of program or company
that has required tests or certifications that are beyond
your scope to control. Therefore, this will be a brief
examination of those scenarios that you can control.

                                                                                             CHAPTER 9 107
Keep in mind that grading and assessment online is very
different from grading and assessing in face to face
classrooms. In face to face classrooms, there is much that
you can do to tell if your learners are learning without
giving a formal assignment or test. The immediacy of
being in the same room with your learners allows you
to gauge non-verbal clues, as well as allowing learners to
ask questions in the moment. But when teaching online,
you will need to find some way of determining what was
actually learned by your learners. These are often
referred to as "traces" or "artifacts." Limitations and
affordances of the platform you utilize will affect what
these traces or artifacts look like. For instance, learners
that are online will have access to the entire Internet
while learning, making high stakes standardized testing
problematic. Learners can just look up answers on the
web (and proctoring tools that promise security are often
easy to get around). Therefore, you might want to
consider moving away from multiple choice tests and
consider other more authentic ways of assessing what
was learned.

Another aspect to consider when grading is the context of
your course itself. For example, MOOCs will be assessed
differently than smaller closed online courses. There
would really be no way for an instructor to grade
hundreds or thousands of papers in a MOOC, so if you
are teaching a MOOC you would need to think of other
ways to assess learning. Maybe multiple choice quizzes
can be more of a "self-check" than a grade? Can those
students that want to do projects utilize peer review if
you give them a rubric to guide them? See the later

108 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
section on "Testing Issues Specific to MOOCs" for more
on this topic.

Also keep in mind that there could be other differences
in how you create graded assignments - such as the
difference between undergraduate and graduate courses,
or the difference between training new employees versus
re-training existing employees that need skills upgrades.
In general, the more experience your learners will bring
to your course (like in graduate courses, continuing
education seminars, labor force re-skilling programs,
etc), the more you will want to build on that existing
knowledge and skills with more authentic projects than
to transmit new information that needs to be memorized.

Earlier in this book, we discussed the decision to grade
or not grade. Much of this chapter will be focused on
those courses that have decided to grade. However, even
in courses where the grade is more of a conversation,
or students are grading themselves, the concepts covered
here can still guide the creation of assessments in those
scenarios. Additionally, even when you have your
learners creating their own assignments, this section can
help give you tips for how to guide your learners in that
process.

FRAMING LEARNERS

The first step in effective assessment is to take a good
look at how you are framing your students. Does the
way you design your tests frame them positively as co-
learners or apprentices with you, or negatively as possible
cheaters? Are you designing assessments that genuinely

                                                                                             CHAPTER 9 109
help with the learning process, or serve as a "gotcha!" for
weeding out "weaker" students or those "not doing the
work"? We would suggest taking a more positive look at
your learners and their learning process, and designing
your assessment strategy from that viewpoint.

Of course, there are students that are going to cheat. This
happens in face-to-face courses, so of course it will
happen in online courses. You will need to assume that
learners can Google a lot of things while taking
assessments. There are many companies selling
monitoring devices or systems aimed at cutting down
on cheating. Keep in mind these are not perfect - most
students know how to fool them. Just do a search online
if you don't believe me: as soon as any company releases
a new proctoring solution, there are soon videos online
how to fool that new system. Some further thoughts on
proctoring tools and student framing:

      "Shaming and Framing: Imagining Students at an
         Education Conference" by Chris Gilliard

Something to keep in mind is that learners who cheat
do so because they have been given an assessment that
is cheatable. In many ways, they are treating the test as
a game to beat. This is the problem with standardized
testing based on rote memorization: the answers are the
same for everyone - and typically already on WikiPedia
or some other website somewhere - so why do I need to
memorize them in the first place? That is a good question
to filter all of our course activities thorough: are students
learning a skill and then just being tested on factoids

110 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
about that skill? Is that really a good way to help them
learn?

TYPES OF ASSESSMENT

As previously mentioned, there is a long and ever-
changing list of assessment tools and options. You are
probably already familiar with many of them. While not
an exhaustive list, here are some of the more common
types of assessments you will see utilized in courses:

      Informal Polling: Usually used to gauge
         understanding in recent topics, or interest in
         future topics. These might be specific tools used
         to aggregate responses, or multiple choice
         questions utilized to collect more nuanced
         differences.

      Standardized Testing: These are the most
         common assessments, utilizing problem types
         such as multiple choice, true/false, matching, and
         other forms of standardized question formats.
         The answers are usually the same or similar for all
         learners, and tend to focus on rote memorization
         of facts or application of ideas to scenarios.

      Written Responses: This can take many forms,
         from open ended questions in a standardized
         tests, to comprehensive exams, to term papers.
         Learners may be required to remember a large
         amount of specific information, or to take what
         they know and apply it to problem-based
         scenarios.

      Oral Presentation: Learners either need to

                                                                                             CHAPTER 9 111
         prepare a speech or other presentation for the
         instructor and/or other learners, or answer a
         series of questions correctly.

      Skills Test/Demonstration: When courses focus
         more on skills than information, often instructors
         will create some type of hands-on demonstration
         of skills gained.

      Activities: Any course activity can potentially be
         assessed in different ways, from discussion forums
         to blog entries to creative artifact creation (video,
         graphics, sound recordings, etc.) or any other
         work learners produce.

      Group Projects: Group projects are sometimes
         class activities, and at other times are assessments.
         These projects usually involve teams working
         together over a long amount of time to create a
         complex artifact or presentation.

      Portfolios/Cumulative/Capstone Projects:
         These are usually a collection of many
         assignments assembled over the entirety of the
         course (or multiple courses). These are often
         evaluated on not only the overall content, but also
         how they are presented or assembled.

SUGGESTIONS FOR ASSESSMENT PRACTICES

Due to the large number of assessment options, it would
take several books to cover them all. What we suggest
is to determine what assessment plan would work best
for your course, and then search for effective practices
and tips on those specific options and tools. There are a

112 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
few ideas we would suggest you take in to consideration
before making decisions:

      Involve the learners as much as possible in the
         process of assessing their own knowledge or
         skills. The more they can take ownership of their
         learning process, the more they will learn. Don't
         just look at how to involve them in the actual
         assessment, but in the design of what is tested or
         how learning is assessed overall.

      Don't look at testing as a way to catch bad
         students or punish lazy learners. Many
         standardized tests fall into this category.
         Standardized tests can work as a way to help
         learners know what they should take away from a
         section of content. But that will work best if you
         give them unlimited attempts to take the test as a
         self-check-up.

      Build in ways for learners to give you feedback on
         any form of assessment, even required testing that
         you have no control over.

      Consider giving learners the option to determine
         how they can best communicate to you what they
         have learned. You might be surprised by their
         creativity. This requires some flexibility, but it
         also becomes more difficult for learners to cheat if
         every person is creating a custom artifact.

      Look at assessment as a conversation over time,
         not a one-time event. Can they turn in a rough
         draft of their paper or portfolio or project to you
         for feedback? If they get behind, are there

                                                                                             CHAPTER 9 113
         pathways for them to get caught up?

      Make your job more focused. Some courses have
         so many discussion boards and tests and papers
         and so on to grade, that the instructors spend all
         of their time grading. Some grading rubrics get so
         complex that it takes forever to read, understand,
         fill out, and explain them. Focus your attention on
         what parts really needs to be assessed, and then
         focus on what you really need to know to fully
         assess. So much assessment can fall into the "busy
         work" category. This just burdens you and the
         learner.

      Where possible, focus on skills demonstrations,
         portfolios, and other more comprehensive forms
         of assessment. Have learners apply what they have
         learned, not just regurgitate factoids.

STANDARDIZED AND OPEN-ENDED RUBRICS

Rubrics are a popular tool to use in grading online
assignments. Some think they are a great way to
standardize the grading process, while others think they
are a way to stifle individual thinking in learners. This
difference in opinion probably stems from the fact that
some courses may need a more standardized approach,
while others may need a more open-ended approach.
Standardized rubrics can be seen as a more fair approach
to grading by some learners that gives them a specific
road-map for every part of an assignment. On the other
hand, more open rubrics can save time and headaches,
while allowing your learners to have some freedom and
flexibility in their learning.

114 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
The most common way to design standardized rubrics
is to have extensive details on each line of the rubric
explaining what each point counts for, with several rows
of criteria covering every aspect of each assignment:

Introduction  10 points:   5 points:      2 points:     0 points:
/ Topic       Student      Student        Student is    Student
              properly     generates      missing       has no
              generates    questions      either        questions
              questions    and has a      introduction  or topical
              around a     partial        or topical    questions.
              topic and    introduction.  questions.
              introduces
              them fully.

This method creates a strict roadmap that helps many
learners. However, it also rarely allows learners to wrestle
with what they want to do for an assignment.
Additionally, there are many gaps that learners could fall
into between point values or descriptions. These issues
may not apply to all assignments, so you may find that
a standardized rubric works best for your course design.
Just keep in mind that these can be more time consuming
to create and utilize from the instructor viewpoint.

Another way to approach grading issues is to take a more
flexible, open-ended approach to creating rubrics. For
example, try to have fewer rows that focus more on
learners showing their knowledge than focusing on
various assignment details like word count or assignment
formats. Simply give the general area that will be graded,
the parameters that you will look for, and a total number
of points possible. Then leave an open slot for you to
enter the points they earn in that area and a place for you
to explain why you gave those points. For example:

                                          CHAPTER 9 115
Subject  Subject              20 (comment)  (points
                                            earned)
Knowledge knowledge is

         evident

         throughout the

         project. All

         information is

         clear, appropriate,

         and correct.

This format can help you look at grading as more of a
conversation than a final decree, especially if you allow
learners to turn in early versions of assignments for
formative feedback. However, keep in mind that learners
may not be accustomed to this more open-ended
approach, so you may cause anxiety if you do not scaffold
them into this less structured approach.

TESTING ISSUES SPECIFIC TO MOOCS

Testing in a MOOC environment offers many unique
challenges. The large number of students means that
grading individual assignments is nearly impossible for
most instructors. Some MOOC platforms will provide
a number of self-grading options that can help in these
situations. Additionally, you can create self- and peer-
reviewed rubrics if that method will fit your design.
There are also developments in the area of auto-graded
papers that will analyze how you grade 100 papers, and
then apply that logic to the rest of the papers. However,
this feature is still in the testing phase.

The main concept to keep in mind is that MOOCs are
open, and all participants will have access to the entire
Internet when taking tests. This means that you do not
want to design your tests as a big "gotcha" to catch

116 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
learners that didn't memorize the content. You will want
to design the tests as a means to see if students can find
the correct answer using whatever resources they can,
and then indicate the correct answer on a test. Or, you
may wish to design peer-reviewed assignments that aren't
based as much on correct answers as much as evaluating
how well content has been applied. Finally, you can also
create self-review rubrics that allow participants to
reflect on their own learning in a deeper manner.

The main idea to keep in mind is that MOOC culture
does not require an instructor to grade thousands of tests,
papers, and forum posts every week. That would be
unthinkable. So design your courses accordingly.

CERTIFICATION AND BADGES

Many MOOC providers will offer certificates and / or
badges to participants that complete their courses.
Certificates and badges can be part of regular online
courses as well. Typically these forms of reward are
optional, meaning learners can still participate in a course
even if they do not want to seek a badge or certificate.
However, in many cases, badge or certificates are part of
the official requirement to complete the course.

When badges or certificates are optional, keep in mind
that some participants will want the certificates, and
some will just want to learn the content for personal
reasons. So you might want to have a certain set of
activities for all participants, and then a special set of
activities and / or assessments for those participants that
are seeking certification.

                                                                                             CHAPTER 9 117
In theory, anyone can use any tool to make a badge or
certificate and send it to those that earn them. However,
this could quickly lead to learners sharing these images
with others that have not completed the work. Therefore,
it is recommended to use a system that credentials secure
badges and / or certificates in some ways. Usually, these
are centralized spaces that allows you to create the
credential and then serve as the gatekeeper to handing
them out. Learners often have to create an account on the
service to display their badges or certificates earned. If
you are interested, here are some credentialing resources:

      Credly: free service for up to 500 badges.
      OpenBadges: widely accepted open credentialing

         system.
      Issuing OpenBadges.
      Badgr: free, open-source credentialing system.

CHAPTER 10: CREATING QUALITY VIDEOS

Video production is a time-intensive process that
requires extensive planning and preparation. Please
review the following sections to ensure that you have
allotted enough time and resources to create the desired
amount of video you would like for your course.

TIMED TRANSCRIPTS

In order to meet most online accessibility guidelines, you
will need to have transcriptions (timed if possible) for
every video you produce. Some video hosting systems
require a specific type of transcript format for their
system (such as SRT - a timed format that allows specific
words to appear on the screen as they are being spoken
in the video), while others will accept many different
formats. Make sure to check with your video hosting
service. You can always pay a transcription service to
create transcription files from completed videos, but just
keep in mind this can get expensive. One way to save
time and money on transcriptions is to create your videos
using the recommended guidelines below. These
guidelines will help you create a professional video with a
transcript already in hand to be quickly converted to any
transcription format.

THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SCRIPT CREATION
PROCESS

The most time-intensive process for presenters is
creating a script. But also the single most important prep
is to prepare a script. This heavily impacts editing time
for the final media. It also impacts how the students
digest the material. It also impacts government-
mandated needs for closed-captioning.

Impact on students: Research has shown that there is
only a short duration of time (about 4.5 minutes), before
students start to lose interest in the media and stop
paying attention (Guo, Kim, & Rubin, 2014). If this is
true, why not capitalize on the value of a well-performed
efficient presentation (devoid of digressions, mis-cues,
fumbling over mis-placed slides, and tons of fillers like
"Ummmm")? All of these issues can be avoided if the
presenter has a script, and performs the script with a
degree of enthusiasm and engagement. With a script, it
takes far less air-time to get a point across, than if the idea
was presented ad-lib.

Impact on delivery: Often, the delivery of online media
(especially when prepared using tax-payer dollars at state
institutions) is required to be multi-channel, ie, close-
captioning is often mandated for all audio tracks. If your
subject matter is highly technical, it is far better that you
(as the expert) provide a transcript of what is said, rather
than having a transcript prepared by a third-party (who

                                                                                           CHAPTER 10 121
probably does not know your subject matter or your
specialized terminology).

Impact on Editing: There are two extremes in editing
the audio track of a presentation.

    1. The audio is a scripted performance, and the
         performer has practiced the script a few times,
         and performs the script "on-camera" with
         relatively few errors or re-takes. A scripted
         performance usually results in a recording in
         which the presenter sounds knowledgeable,
         authoritative, and well-prepared. In a well
         scripted performance, the presenter delivers the
         material with a degree of dynamic enthusiasm.
         The speaker gains credibility.

    2. The audio is an unscripted performance, in which
         the performer must conceive and present the
         material on-the-fly. Ad-lib performances tend to
         ramble, be disorganized, and have a speech
         register which is slow (because idea and
         terminology is being retrieved from memory, and
         this requires mental processing time - the
         performer tends to speak faster than they think,
         so the presentation slows down verbally to match
         the slow processing time that it takes to construct
         the discussion in the presenter's mind). If the
         performer makes some verbal mistakes, then the
         performer will employ conversation repair
         mechanisms to re-direct the audience back to the
         corrected train-of-thought. These repair
         mechanisms involve louder speaking volume,

122 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         change of pitch and speaking rate. (If the editor
         removes the mistakes, then the voice quality
         before and after the splice (where the mistake was
         removed) do not match, and the audience knows
         that a substantial edit has occurred. Also, in an
         unscripted performance, the presenter usually
         sounds distracted or unknowledgeable, unsure
         and un-authoritative, and dis-organized and un-
         prepared. The audience wonders why they are
         listening to someone who does not know the
         topic. Students wonder why they are required to
         submit well-organized assignments on time, when
         the instructor clearly is disorganized and doing
         things at the last minute. The speaker loses
         credibility.

In terms of production schedule, there is a trade-off in
pre-production workload and post-production
workload. Usually, the presenter is responsible for most
of the pre-production workload, and the editor is
responsible for the bulk of the post-production
workload.

SCRIPT CREATION PROCESS

One highly recommended method for script creation is
to pre-record the presenter delivering the material live
(in class or into a Dictaphone device) to serve as raw
content. This pre-recording is then transcribed, and then
edited, to improve rhetorical organization (eliminate
digressions and back-tracking or combine clarification
question answers with original statements), to correct
improper vocabulary issues, and to adjust the

                                                                                           CHAPTER 10 123
information density to match the requirements of
potential on-screen video effects (this usually involves
replacing minimal grammatical phrases (like pronouns or
generic verbs like "do", ie replace "if you do this" with "If
you perform this calculation")).

Please note that parts of the script preparation can be
performed by persons other than the presenter. The
presenter delivers a live-performance of the presentation,
but can then hand off that recording to a GTA or
transcription service to get a transcription, and then the
GTA or the presenter can edit the script. The edited script
is then given back to the presenter for review and
practice. Therefore, it is possible that the presenter only
be involved in about 2 hours of the 5-hour script-prep
activity.

The rule of thumb is that live lectures usually distill down
by 2/3 when converted to professional audio. Therefore,
in order to create a video segment of up to 10 minutes,
the following table will describe minimum estimates for
pre-pre work:

Live performance raw content capture (lecture, etc)         0.5

                                                            hours

                                                            5.0
                                                            hours

124 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Also, as noted earlier, a complete script is much easier to
convert to the required SRT format. For instructions on
how to create SRT files yourself, please see this guide:

      "How to Create an SRT File" by Andrew Meer

In some cases, you may not have the ability to go through
this entire process. In those cases, focus on what you
can accomplish. Start by writing your script out in a
conversational tone. Then read it out loud to time it and
see who it sounds to you. Edit your script and read aloud
until you feel you get it correct. Remove extra parts and
rabbit trails that aren't needed as you perfect it. Then
practice with the final version a few times before
recording it. Even if you think you are good at "winging
it," preparation and practice will make you sound more
professional. Finally, look at suggestions for how to make
good marketing or branding videos - these contain tips
that will help any video script writing process. For one
example, see:

      "How to Write an Awesome Video Script in 8
         Steps" by Jake Kilroy

AUDIO EDITING

At a minimum, the audio editor must listen to the full
length of the recording. If the recording is absolutely
clean, with zero edits required, then the audio editor
spent 10 minutes "editing." However, the typical scripted
session will involve a small number of edits to correct
for mis-pronunciations, stumbles, and page-turning, etc.
As such, typically, 20% of the recorded scripted session

                                                                                           CHAPTER 10 125
is discarded. If the session is scripted, it is fairly easy to
make splices that are "undetectable" in the final cut.

In contrast, if the session is unscripted (for example,
lecture capture), typically, a very large number of edits
have to be made to generate a final cut that is devoid
of information errors, organization errors, speech errors,
etc. As a result, typically, two-thirds of the unscripted
studio session is discarded.

OVERALL TIME CONSIDERATIONS

Therefore, to create up to 10 minutes of quality video,
a minimum of 6.5 hours is required if no problems are
encountered. However, the chance that there will be no
issues is very, very small. Additionally, this is the estimate
for straight video with no graphics, animations, self-
revealing equations, etc. (see "Graphics and Video
Preparation" below)

To put this into perspective, let's compare to full in-
person lecture capture. Consider a presenter going to
class 3 times per week for one hour presentation for 15
weeks (a standard MWF one-hour lecture format). Let's
consider that it takes these 45 hours of unscripted
sessions (contact hours) to deliver a course-load of
information. That will require a total of about 540 man-
hours to produce, and will yield only 15 hours of finished
audio tracks.

On the other hand, if the presenter were to take those 45
hours of live-presentation time, and re-allocated them to
30 hours of script prep (enhanced by additional hours of

126 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
GTA/transcription service involvement) and 15 hours of
studio presentation, then this will require only 135 total
man-hours to process, and will yield 12 hours of finished
audio tracks (and these audio tracks will be higher
quality - the presenter will appear to be better-informed,
more authoritative, and better-prepared - that is, more
professional, with higher credibility).

Thus, with scripted studio performances for audio of a
standard course, there is approximately 400 man-hour
savings. This block of 400 man-hours can be re-directed
to providing more elaborate graphics for this course (or
providing audio editing for 2 additional courses, or
providing the audio editing for this course for 1/3 of the
price...)

GRAPHICS AND VIDEO PREPARATION

The graphics/moving parts portion of video creation is
much more time-consuming, but typically, requires less
presenter time. The presenter provides a bunch of raw
materials to the media editor, and the media editor
spends weeks and weeks building media. This impacts
monetary budgeting and time-budgeting (to ensure the
finished media is deployed on time). The chart at the
beginning of this section demonstrates how the overall
production time increases quickly with the addition of
slides, animations, self-revealing equations, etc. However
these graphics are important for illustrating points and
examples and should not be left out just because of time
considerations.

The difficulty in estimating time requirements for these

                                                                                           CHAPTER 10 127
additions is that complexity can vary greatly. For
example, self-revealing equations look very simple when
comparing the final product to computer animated
graphics, but can take much longer to create due to the
extensive needs of proper placement, spacing, and
readability of each individual character. This process can
also be slowed down by inferior raw material provided by
instructors (for example, handwritten notes that are hard
to read and not properly written out).

In order to ensure the best possible delivery of content
with the least amount of wasted time, we recommend all
materials to be created digitally in a native digital format
(for example, graphics created in a graphics editor and
not just a scan of a textbook page). If the media specialist
can copy and paste high quality content right into the
video editor program, this can save them and the
presenter enormous amounts of time. It may seem like
it is faster to write out a formula on paper than take the
time to enter it in an equation editor, but if the media
specialist has to call you and set up a meeting to clarify
what doesn't look right and then meet for an hour or
more to clear up one equation and so on and so forth, you
might actually cause more time in the long run by trying
to save time up front.

Therefore, please sit down with your technical media
consultant to go through all graphical needs to ensure
you are using the highest quality creation method from
the beginning. Even if it does turn out that they need to
do a hand sketch to create a completely new animation
from scratch (which is rare), at least they will have created

128 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
their own hand sketch that they will understand from the
beginning.
LICENSING AND VIDEOS
Another issue to consider when creating your videos is
how they will be licensed. For many people, your
institution or company will already have made decisions
on how the videos you have created will be licensed. For
others, you may have some or total freedom to license the
videos that you create as you like. If you decide to use any
type of open license for your video, this could increase
the impact and spread of your content outside of the
course. For more details on open licensing (and licensing
in general), see the chapter on Open Educational
Resources.

CHAPTER 11: UTILIZING SOCIAL LEARNING
IN ONLINE COURSES

You may have noticed that many online courses utilize
social media outlets such as Facebook and Twitter. While
there really is no one right way to utilize social media
in a course, there are concepts and designs that work
better than others. This section will cover some ideas and
suggestions for social media usage in your course.

DESIGNING FOR SOCIAL LEARNING

While there are many different ways to use social media
in an online course, they generally fall into two different
categories:

    1. Official Communication: Announcements and
         other course communications are re-posted on
         various social media outlets in order to boost their
         signal with all learners, or to encourage
         interaction with these communications.

    2. Social Interaction: Learners form connections on
         social media sites to ask questions, gain assistance
         from other learners, and possibly form future
         networking connections. These are less formal
         and easier to connect with than official course
         forums.

                                                                                           CHAPTER 11 131
Additionally, some courses encourage participants to
work on social media sites (such as blogs) to create
content for the courses that is then submitted to other
participants for peer feedback. Some courses (usually
MOOCs, but not always) exist completely on social media
outlets outside of an official Learning Management
System. This form of learning is called connectivism, and
MOOCs that are designed with this structure are referred
to as cMOOCs (Siemens, 2005). For more details on this
topic, see the section on Personal Learning Networks
later on in this manual.

The key for designing for social media is to have a clear
purpose for what you want to do and then to make sure
that you stick with that method. If you are using certain
social media outlets for official communication, then
make sure this is clearly communicated in the design. If
you want participants to use social media for interaction
with other participants, then also make that clear.
However, creating a long list of rules for using these social
media outlets will usually have a chilling effect on
informal usage, so avoid placing a large number of rules.

Please keep in mind that social media is not a safe place
for everyone. Bullying and harassment are a major issue
on all social networking sites, with most failing to do
anything to curb any of it. Make sure to allow alternatives
to social networking for your learners, including
everything from using pseudonyms to using alternative,
lesser-known services to not using any social networking
websites at all. Additionally, if you are creating a course
for a government owned entity such as a public

132 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
university, you will need to carefully follow government
guidelines for student privacy. For example, in the United
States, state universities have to follow FERPA (Family
Educational Rights and Privacy Act) guidelines in relation
to utilizing social networking websites:

      Official FERPA Recap

      Example of FERPA at a Glance for Faculty from
         one college

      "15 Social Networking Safety Tips from Norton
         Security" by Emma Kavanagh

      "5 Do's and Don'ts for College Students Using
         Social Media" by Jeff Greer

The instructional designer you choose for your course
should have a background in all learning design
philosophies, including social learning. Be sure to seek
their advice for how to design for social learning within
your specific course.

SOCIAL NETWORKING WEBSITES

Here are specific suggestions for using various popular
social networking sites.

First of all, you will want to find a short, but easy to
remember code name for your course that is available
across all of the social media sites that you want to utilize
in order to help participants find your outlets more easily.
It could be something related to the course number, ie
"econ101mooc." Space is a premium on some sites like
Twitter, so be sure to keep it as short as possible.

                                                                                           CHAPTER 11 133
Twitter

Twitter can be a good site to broadcast quick
announcements, ideas, relevant news articles, and links
to full updates. Make sure your Twitter username is
available, and make it match your course hashtag (i.e.
"http://twitter.com/econ101mooc"). You can add a fuller
course name in the settings. Also, make sure to update
the avatar to match your institutional or company logos,
and have a graphic designer create a header image that
matches any other graphic art used for the course.

Twitter Hashtags

Conversations on Twitter usually revolve around
hashtags. You can't own these, but you do want to pick
one that few people use in order to help keep the
conversation focused on your course. Participants often
search Twitter for course hashtags, so creating one that
matches your courses Twitter ID (if you have one) will
help put your official tweets in the search result. For
example, you would check to see if "#econ101mooc" is
used much, and if not - AND it is available as a username
- use both of those.

Facebook Page

A Facebook Page (not group) can serve as another official
channel for announcements, relevant web links, and
other course communications. Your social media
coordinator will need to create a Facebook Page with
their account and then upgrade you and all other course
instructors to group admins. You will want to use the
same Page ID that you use for your Twitter username

134 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
(i.e. "http://facebook.com/pages/econ101mooc") for
consistency. You can always make the display name more
descriptive.

Facebook Group

While Facebook Pages tend to be more formal
communication spaces, Facebook Groups are more
focused on the members and therefore are more
interactive. You can create a group in addition to the
Facebook Page - some participants tend to favor one over
the other for a range of reasons. As with Facebook Pages,
you will also want to use the same Group ID that you use
for your Twitter username (i.e. "http://facebook.com/
group/econ101mooc") for consistency. You can always
make the display name more descriptive.

Google Account (Gmail, Google+, Etc)

As discussed previously, you may need a YouTube

account and channel to host your course videos. It is

usually a good idea to use the entire Google account that

comes along with this. A Gmail account that matches

your  other     social                networks      (i.e.

"econg101mooc@gmail.com") could serve as a great

centralized email for the course (especially in MOOCs).

Creating a Google+ page for your course can also serve

as an alternative for users that are not fans of Facebook

or Twitter. All of these accounts connect and interact

smoothly. They also interact with Google Hangouts.

Google Hangouts and YouTube Live

If you wish to have a live online session with at least

                                      CHAPTER 11 135
one or more people in your course, Google Hangouts or
YouTube Live are good options. A Google Hangout will
allow up to ten instructors or guests to interact online,
while YouTube Live will allow unlimited numbers of
people to watch a streaming session live. These are then
archived on your YouTube channel. Just make sure to
do a test run before really using Google Hangouts or
YouTube Live as the settings can be tricky. Also be sure
to set up the Google Hangout or YouTube Live through
your course Google+ page or YouTube account in order
to keep everything connected.

WordPress Blog

As you can see, there are many social media outlets to
keep track of. One way to connect with all of them is to
create content on a WordPress blog. Content created on a
blog can automatically be posted to Facebook and Twitter
through behind-the-scenes connections (see the "Jetpack"
extension for more on this feature). This would be a good
way to post announcements - create them in WordPress,
automatically post them to social media outlets, and then
copy and paste the message into an announcement in
your course platform.

Hootsuite, Known, and Other Social Media Managers

There are also several other sites that can help you
manage multiple social media outlets. Hootsuite and
Known are two of the more popular ones. Other services
can also work well. There are also several mobile apps
that can help - for example, the iPad Twitter app lets
you connect several Twitter accounts in one app.

136 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Additionally, Facebook has a mobile app specifically for
running pages.

Slack

Slack is a newer messaging system that has been growing
in popularity recently. It is a good tool for group
collaborations that need to be asynchronous in nature.
Groups can also share files, videos, images, and other
documents within Slack easily. Additionally, Slack can
integrate with many other tools like calendars and
messaging systems. Slack groups can be organized by
channels that are designated for specific topics, groups, or
other configuration.

Alternatives to Popular Social Networking Websites

Some or even many of your learners may object to using
certain social media tools for many reasons. Some may
feel it is not safe for them to have an online presence
(often due to real life threats or other issues). Some may
object to the ads in various services. Some may not like
their personal data being sold to advertisers. These
concerns are valid, and you will need to explain these
issues clearly to all learners. Additionally, you will need to
embrace alternatives for those that have concerns. There
are different ways to address concerns:

      If learners want to be on social media but have
         concerns about their full identity being online (or
         maybe tied to specific contentious course
         content), then discuss the option of using a

         You Podcast Under Your Real Name, or a

                                                                                           CHAPTER 11 137
         Pseudonym?" by Daniel J. Lewis (focused on
         podcasting, but applicable to any social media) for
         a good discussion of the pros and cons of using
         real names and pseudonyms.

      If learners are concerned about ads or data, they
         could explore other services with different polices
         than the popular services like Facebook or
         Twitter. For example, see "What are the Best
         Alternatives to Facebook?" with a chart on how
         various alternative services handle these issues. Or
         look into open-source alternatives like Mastodon.

      For learners that do not want to be on social
         media at all, create ways for them to complete
         course assignments in other ways. For instance,
         could they read other's tweets and then email their
         responses to you, or post them in a close
         discussion board on your institutional LMS/
         CMS? This may not seem like an ideal solution to
         some learners, but it does respect the privacy of
         those that wish to stay off of social media. Some
         services will offer tools that will embed in courses
         - for example, Twitter offers a twitter hashtag
         search result widget that embeds web pages.
         Adding this in your course would allow learners
         to see Twitter activity without having an account.
         You will need to check with the service you want
         to use to see if this is possible, or search for third
         party possibilities as well.

PERSONAL LEARNING NETWORKS

Wikipedia describes a Personal Learning Network (PLN)

138 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
as "an informal learning network that consists of the
people a learner interacts with and derives knowledge
from.... in a PLN, a person makes a connection with
another person with the specific intent that some type
of learning will occur because of that connection".
Connectivist MOOCs utilize PLNs as the main mode of
course interaction, but they can also be utilized in any
course. One of the benefits of connectivist learning is that
participants retain control over their course work and
can therefore display their accomplishments to anyone
that they choose.

Many of the social learning tools mentioned above are
typically used in PLNs. However, instructors should
never assume that just telling participants to use these
tools will encourage their usage. Lessons will need to
be designed to specifically incorporate PLNs into the
activities. Activities will need to encourage learners to
post work to their social media sites, and then share the
link with the course inside of the LMS/CMS platform.
Additionally, instructors that are actively using the
Twitter Hashtag as well as blogging about the course
content will need to encourage participants to join in.

Additionally, a course hub of some type that pulls
together participant blog posts, tweets, videos, images,
and other work can help encourage learners to
participant in social learning. A self-hosted WordPress
blog with certain tools installed (see the "FeedWordPress"
extension) can be one tool to create a course hub.

If you are interested in exploring these options for your
course, be sure to find an instructional designer for your

                                                                                           CHAPTER 11 139
team that is familiar with connectivism and social
learning. Further details on these topics are outside of the
scope of this manual, but if you are interested in these
topics, see the links below:

DIVERSITY IN ONLINE COURSES

One of the benefits of moving into online learning is
the ability to connect with a more diverse audience of
learners that many face-to-face learning experiences tend
to lack. When adding on top of that a layer of openness
or social learning, the diversity can increase even more.
However, even within smaller groups that may share
ethnicity or location, there are still many sociocultural
factors such as religious beliefs, socioeconomic status,
political affiliation, and geographic location that will
bring in different viewpoints, opinions, and life
experiences.

The first step in embracing diversity in online leaning is
for instructors and course designers to become aware of
the influence that their own unique social and cultural
contexts have had on their views. No matter who you are,
your unique social and cultural contexts have influenced
what you know, how you learned what you know, and
how you want to teach what you know. This also means
that those unique sociocultural factors place a filter or
worldview on your teaching and communication that

140 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
could be confusing to others from different sociocultural
contexts.

We all believe that respect is a major foundation for
teaching. Before we ask our students to respect each
other's unique worldviews, we should consider
evaluating our worldview to see how it influences our
teaching and interactions. There are many ways to
evaluate your worldview to develop a sense of cultural
awareness. If you need a place to start, one option is
the Cultural Awareness Online Continuing Education
Course. The audience for this self-paced lesson is nurses,
but the awareness it fosters can help people in any field.

Once you have a good idea of how your worldview affects
your course, it might be a good idea to review your
content and activities for possible issues. Then you will
need to develop a system to communicate your
expectations of respect and interaction with the learners
in the course. Analysis into the Bystander Effect (see
"Social Media: The Modern Stage for the Bystander
Effect?") as well as the concept of "the wisdom of the
crowds" (see "The Madness of the Crowds" by Tim
Hwang) has found that people will generally stand by
when they see disrespect or attacks happening online (or
maybe even join in the attack where they might not have
said anything if they were the only one). Therefore,
course designers need to implement guidelines for
respect for diversity in their courses. The next section
covers this issue.

                                                                                           CHAPTER 11 141
SAFETY ISSUES AND CODES OF CONDUCT

Courses offered through institutions or companies often
are required to adhere to various honor codes or codes of
conduct at all times. However, not all codes are enough
to deal with safety issues in all courses, and some
institutions do not have them. Additionally, MOOCs will
attract many participants that are not officially bound
by institutional codes because they are not under the
authority of the institution. This can possibly create
unique situations when dealing with harassment and
bullying that happens online. As an instructor, your top
priority should be to create a learning environment that
is safe as possible for all learners. Several years of social
networking has basically taught us that the community
does not always necessarily rise up and expel abusers
or defend victims (Brody & Vangelisti, 2016). You will
need to develop a Code of Conduct to spell out how you
expect participants to act in your course as well as what
will happen if they violate the Code. Even though many
online courses seem to be fairly safe for most learners,
please be prepared to point out the Code of Conduct and
enforce it if necessary.

A Code of Conduct should include at least the following
components:

      Harassment free policy

      Description of what counts as harassment

      Description of what could happen to those that
         harass other participants (including you as the
         instructor cooperating with any legal action that

142 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
         might occur)
      An encouragement to report harassment
      A statement that declares these codes apply at all

         course related activities.
      Links to all Privacy Statements of all services

         recommended in the course (Facebook, Twitter,
         etc.)
      Links to avenues of reporting abuse on any
         services utilized in your course (Facebook,
         Twitter, etc.)

Codes of Conduct, please see the following resources:

CHAPTER 12: MINDFULNESS IN ONLINE
COURSES

Online courses have given learners across the globe a
unique opportunity to learn outside of formal
educational settings and in less supervised environments.
The independent nature of this form of learning
heightens the need for learners to have the tools to both
initiate and manage their own learning. Moreover, as
individuals engage with content, instructors, and fellow
students exclusively online, an explicit focus on
techniques meant to deepen the learning experience
becomes increasingly important. All learners in both in-
person and online courses are in need of effective skills
and strategies to become aware of and self-regulate their
thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Within physical
classrooms, and even within smaller fully online courses,
instructors can somewhat easily incorporate activities
such as journaling and peer discussion intended to
promote states of mind that foster deep reflection and
perspective taking. As some courses grow to a massive
scale, the task of promoting these qualities becomes much
more difficult. One way of fostering these skills is by
incorporating contemplation in your course.

Contemplation is the central focus of contemplative
science -- a growing multidisciplinary field aimed at
understanding the mind-body systems through

                                                                                           CHAPTER 12 145
contemplative practices (Roeser & Zelazo, 2012).
Mindfulness, a term quite popular among educators at
the moment, is one construct that falls under the
umbrella of contemplative science. Contemporary
researchers define mindfulness as paying attention to the
present moment, including thoughts and emotions, with
acceptance, curiosity, and kindness (Brown & Ryan, 2003;
Kabat-Zinn, 1994). Mindfulness is an ancient idea with
roots in different philosophies and religious traditions.
Over the last century, mindfulness has been adopted
globally and is now a widely used contemplative exercise.

CULTIVATING MINDFUL AWARENESS AND
REFLECTION

Mindfulness meditation trains skills by applying restraint
on ordinarily uncontrolled mental or physical activities
(Mind and Life Education Research Network [MLERN],
2012), encouraging the use of voluntary control in order
to focus attention on certain objects (e.g., the breath) or
thoughts (e.g., kindness to others). Schools throughout
the United States are incorporating mindfulness
meditation into educational curricula with the goal of
enhancing self-awareness and self-regulation of
attention, emotions, and behavior (Greenberg & Harris,
2012; MLERN, 2012). While mindfulness is readily
criticized, the science supporting it is quite persuasive.
Individuals who engage in mindfulness practice
demonstrate reduced anxiety and depression (Hofmann,
Sawyer, Witt, & Oh, 2010; Holzel et al., 2013), lower stress
(Baer, 2003; Creswell et al., 2016), improved attention
skills (Becerra, Dandrade, & Harms, 2016; Jha,

146 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Krompinger, & Baime, 2007; Sedlmeier et al., 2012),
increased self-regulation (Tang et al., 2007), and richer
and more positive personal relationships (Carson,
Carson, Gil, & Baucom, 2004; Coatsworth, Duncan,
Greenberg, & Nix, 2010). Recently, researchers have
shown that students who engage in mindfulness activities
perform better academically, even in mathematics
(Schonert-Reichl et al., 2015).

Mindfulness and contemplative science more broadly has
been applied to the learning sciences in what is termed
contemplative education. Roeser and Peck (2009) defined
contemplative education as "a set of pedagogical practices
designed to cultivate the potentials of mindful awareness
and volition in an ethical-relational context in which the
values of personal growth, learning, moral living, and
caring for others are also nurtured" (p. 127).
Contemplative education provides a specific set of
practices designed to nurture mindfulness and
intentional forms of being and learning. What's necessary
for contemplative education is a competent teacher
(either a person or a set of teachings) and pedagogical
practices embedded in experiential learning aimed at
cultivating relaxed and concentrated states of awareness
within learners. These practices are placed in a larger
context of ethics and values such as open-mindedness,
curiosity, and respect for others. Learning practices that
fall under contemplative education include activities such
as meditation, reflecting upon existential questions, being
in nature, physical activities such as yoga or tai chi, and
doing art (Roeser & Peck, 2009).

                                                                                           CHAPTER 12 147
EXAMPLES OF CONTEMPLATIVE PRACTICES

One exemplary MOOC that focuses on contemplative
education through mindfulness at scale is the edX course
"Transforming Business, Society, and Self with U.Lab."
The lead instructor is Otto Scharmer out of MIT. Adam
Yukelson is the co-instructor and lead designer for the
course who has shared information and experiences of
their students with me. The course began in January 2015
and ran for eight weeks, during which they had
approximately 42,000 registered participants. During the
first run of their course, which may or may not be due to
their focus on mindfulness, they had the fourth-highest
completion rate on edX. The majority of learners in their
course have no previous experience with mindfulness.

The purpose of the course, as Mr. Yukelson stated, is
"designed to help leaders at all levels in business,
government, and civil society identify and shift the
deeper patterns of thought that, when left unexamined,
keep us re-enacting results in social systems that almost
nobody wants." This is where mindfulness and
contemplative practices become crucial. Dr. Scharmer
and Mr. Yukelson view mindfulness as one helpful
method for suspending and letting go of patterns of
thought. This suspension of typical habits of thinking
opens up new possibilities of being.

The instructors begin by introducing the principles
behind mindfulness primarily by focusing on the
different ways one can pay attention. This serves as the
basis for what many participants referred to as the most
crucial element of the course--coaching circles. Coaching

148 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
circles are peer-led, and use a seven-step process "case
clinic" process. They teach the process through two
instructional videos, then give participants a mechanism
outside of edX to self-select into groups of 5-6. The
coaching circles meet one hour per week, with each
meeting focusing on one of the members. In some
instances, a coaching circle consists of friends and
colleagues and they meet in person, but many of the
circles only meet virtually. The individuals in these
groups typically do not know each other prior to entering
the course and will set up their weekly meetings using
Google Hangouts or Skype. Mr. Yukelson shared
feedback from two learners from the MOOC.

   "The connection with other circle members was personally
   transformative. Although I missed the first coaching circle
   call, I felt as though I had known the others my entire
   life.... My skepticism around the ability to connect in such
   a way melted. I realized it was not the medium [through
   which] I communicated, but how I showed up internally
   that made all the difference! This paradigm shift will stick
   with me for the rest of my life. After endless in-person
   and online `downloading' sessions that went nowhere, this
   was as though a portal I never knew existed was opened
   completely. All I had to do was walk through it with the love
   and support of the others. I was so struck with `I am them'
   and `they are me'."

   "I've never spoken to someone I don't know on video as
   a first means of contact before, and after I overcame my
   initial shyness I found the experience empowering...
   Within an hour and a half our circle reached such a deep
   level of connectedness and trust, it was as if we knew each
   other since ages."

In addition to coaching circles, the course also includes

                                                                                           CHAPTER 12 149
live sessions, conducted in livestream with a twitter feed
on the side. The live sessions include a variety of
contemplative practices including guided journaling and
meditation. The full live sessions are 1.5 hours. The
maximum number of unique viewers the instructors have
had for a session is approximately 20,000. Many learners
view the live sessions together in self-organized "hubs."

In addition to the techniques utilized in the particular
MOOC described above, there are various contemplative
practices that can be incorporated into your course,
whether it is a MOOC or a regular online course. The
practices outlined below have been used in online classes
which may be useful for any instructor. The activities
outlined below draw from Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn, Mindful Tech by
David M. Levy, and Contemplative Practices in Higher
Education by Daniel Barbezat and Mirabai Bush.

Mindful Breathing (3 - 6 minutes)

This activity serves as the building blocks for establishing
present moment awareness. The practice is simple, but
not easy. The focus of attention turns to the feeling of
the breath moving in and out of the body. The mind
will wander, but the practice comes in bringing attention
back to the breath again and again. By doing this simple
practice daily, students are strengthening their ability to
pay attention. There are many smartphone applications
and resources online that offer guided breathing
practices. One that is available both on your phone and
online is Stop, Breathe, and Think, which has been used

150 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
in research studies involving the effects of mindfulness
meditation on learning.

An example of the instructions:

   "Adopt a posture that is both relaxed and alert. (Example: Sit
   upright in a chair, feet on the ground, hands folded in your
   lap, eyes either closed or slightly open). Begin attending to the
   sensations of your breathing. Identify a place in your body
   (stomach, chest, tip of your nose) where you can feel the physical
   sensations that arise as you breathe in and out. Notice when your
   mind wanders away from the sensations of the breath. Bring your
   attention back to the breath whenever your mind wanders."

Deep Listening (10 minutes)

This activity is designed to bring in deep listening to daily
life. In this activity, everyone finds a partner in the course.
Then, one person speaks and the other listens in complete
silence. The listener listens as carefully as possible, letting
go of interpretations, judgments, and reactions, as well
as irrelevant thoughts, memories, and plans. When the
speaker finishes, the listener repeats as closely as possible
what the speaker said. The original speaker sits in silence
while the listener repeats this back to them.

   Instructions: Find a partner. You are encouraged to connect with
   someone in your course, but you can do this with a family member
   or friend if you cannot find a class partner. In this exercise, you
   will take turns listening and speaking.

       1. One partner will spend 3 minutes speaking about a course
            topic or an aspect of his or her life. Set a timer that will
            make a noise when the 3 minutes is up, avoiding looking
            at the time.

                  This 3 minutes is devoted to the speaker. The

                                                                                           CHAPTER 12 151
                     listener sits in silence. If the speaker runs out of
                     things to say, sit in silence. Whenever you have
                     something to say, you may continue speaking
                     again.

       2. The listener should listen in silence. When you listen, give
            your full attention to the speaker. Be curious, but don't
            ask questions while listening. You may acknowledge with
            facial expressions or by nodding your head. Try not to
            over acknowledge. You may feel an urge to coach, identify,
            chime in, or interrupt. This is normal. Just notice when
            this occurs and resist the temptation to act. Listen with
            kindness. When thoughts or emotions come into your
            mind, simply notice them and gently return your full
            attention to the speaker. If the speaker runs out of things
            to say, give him or her the space for silence, and then be
            available to listen when he or she speaks again.

       3. After the alarm sounds, set the alarm for 1 minute.

       4. Repeat what you have heard from the speaker. Simply
            paraphrase, don't memorize.

       5. After the alarm sounds, the speaker should take 1 more
            minute to clarify anything she feels was misunderstood by
            the listener. Again, one person speaks at a time in a kind
            and respectful manner.

       6. Switch turns. Repeat steps one through five. Now the
            speaker is the listener and the listener the speaker.

       7. Reflect on how it feels to be listened to so closely and what
            it felt like to listen deeply to another person. This can be a
            conversation lasting however long you prefer.

       8. End by thanking the other person for listening.

Mindful Check-in (3 - 6 minutes)

This activity is designed to remind students to actually
experience what is happening in the moment, rather than
simply achieving goals and marking off to-do lists. Often

152 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
there is too much emphasis on going through the motions
rather than noticing what is going on with your mind and
body. The exercise asks students to explore the breath
and body, emotional states, and the quality of attention.

   Instructions: Take a few minutes to answer the following
   questions.

   What is the quality of your attention?

         Are you focused or distracted? Take time to think about
         how you are attending to what is happening in the current
         moment.

   What is the quality of your breathing?

         Take a moment to notice the current rhythm and pattern
         of your breathing, but don't attempt to change it. Is your
         breathing fast, slow? Are you holding your breath?

   What is going on in and with your body?

         Notice your heart rate and posture. How are you sitting,
         standing, or lying down? Are you comfortable? Notice any
         places of tension and any place you feel you can relax. It
         may be your cheeks, your shoulders, your eyebrows, or your
         chest.

   What is your current emotional state?

         Try to find a word to describe your current emotional state.
         Try to sense how you are feeling in this moment. Don't place
         judgment on this feeling, just notice.

   After you have gained familiarity with the asking yourself these
   questions, you can take time during your day to ask, "How am I
   feeling right now?".

                                                                                           CHAPTER 12 153
The Multitasking Exercise (20 - 30 minutes)

Use this exercise to pay attention to what you're doing
online. Notice your multitasking strategy. For example,
when do you decide to switch from one task to another?
Some of us respond to every interruption immediately,
while others carefully limit the number of interruptions
and respond selectively. By observing how you multitask,
you will have the chance to see your strategy and make
changes if you would like.

    1. Download recording software.

               You can use any software available. At
                  minimum chose a tool where you can see what
                  is happening on your desktop, laptop, or mobile
                  screen. Some options: RescueTime, Screencast-
                  O-Matic, CamStudio, and Screencastify. If you
                  choose not to download the software, you can
                  attempt to notice your multitasking. Rather
                  than writing down observations, you can turn
                  on an audio recorder and speak your
                  observations. A third option is to ask a friend or
                  family member to observe you while you
                  multitask. You can also to do this with a
                  classmate, sharing screens, and observing each
                  other's activity while multitasking. Make sure
                  not to violate anyone's privacy from sensitive
                  information on your screen if you are having
                  someone observe you!

    2. Multitask as you usually do

154 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
           Do this at a time of day and location when
             you're certain to be dealing with multiple
             windows and applications, and possibly
             interrupted by other technology or face-to-face
             interactions. Record multiple sessions or just
             one.

3. Watch the video

           Observe what you are doing and feeling or have
             someone tell you what they observed.

4. Log what you observe

           Watch the recording immediately after the
             session to note any feelings from the recent
             experience. Take note of how you felt (breath,
             body, attention) during the different points. Pay
             attention to where you made choices to move to
             another activity or remain on one task.

           Example: "Facebook, paying bills, twitter.
             Knowing I'm being recorded. Noticing how
             many times I touch my glasses, moving my feet
             around. Facebook is open and lots of folks
             responding to something I posted earlier but
             choosing to stick with what I am doing so that I
             can complete it. Impatient while a photo uploads
             so switch to emails. New class registrant so
             switch to Excel. Take care of that task--feels
             good."

5. Summarize

                                                                                     CHAPTER 12 155
               Reflect on what you've logged. Write about the
                  patterns you're discovering. Which dimensions
                  of your present experience were most salient?
                  Were you able to notice the times when you did
                  switch to another task? How would you
                  characterize your multitasking?

    6. Form personal guidelines

               You may notice changes that you want to make.
                  For example, you may notice your shoulders are
                  tense, breathing is shallow, brow is furrowed,
                  and you want to pay attention to these signs of
                  stress to relax your body. You may also want to
                  change your multitasking behavior.

    7. Share and discuss

               Share your multitasking experience with a
                  classmate using the deep listening practice
                  described earlier.

Journal Writing (5 minutes)

Writing in a journal is one of the oldest methods of self-
exploration and introspection. A journal can help you live
in the present moment, to cultivate awareness, and to
bring in gratitude. Students are instructed to write about
their experiences in the first person, without thought of
another reader besides themselves. Students can write
with pen and paper or on computer or tablet. Journaling
differs from a keeping a diary, as a diary records daily
events. Journal entries foster reflection of mental and
emotional activities of the individual.

156 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
   Instructions: Keep a daily journal (either handwritten or
   electronic). Each entry should be about a paragraph. Record your
   feelings, thoughts, sensations, and any related experiences. This
   is not an exercise to record what you've done. Think of it as a
   conversation partner to reflect on reactions to daily life. Some
   questions to consider asking yourself in your reflection: What
   troubled you today? What made you happy today? What is one
   thing you are grateful for today? What are you enjoying about
   your work? What are you enjoying about your family?

Deep Reflection (10 - 20 minutes)

This activity aims to give students silence while they
deeply reflect on their goals and how they are spending
their time. Students are encouraged to freely write
answers to the following questions.

    1. What matters here? Make a list of how you want to
         spend your time in this program. This might be going to
         class, studying, spending time with close friends,
         perhaps volunteering in your community or reading
         books not on any course's required reading list. What
         matters to you?

               This question is about taking ownership for
                  oneself in the world.

    2. How do you spend your time?

             1. Make a list of how you actually spent your time,
                  on average, each day over the past week.

             2. Match the list from question one to this list.

    3. How well do your commitments actually match your
         goals?

                                                                                           CHAPTER 12 157
               You may find strong overlap between the lists.
                  Many people do not. How can you align your
                  time commitments to reflect your personal
                  convictions?

CONCLUSION

The ability to sustain attention and self-regulate with
qualities of openness, curiosity, and respect are important
for academic success and critical for getting and
maintaining employment. The techniques designed to
improve these abilities are only beginning to gain
momentum in the classroom and, in addition, the
scientific evidence supporting these practices continues
to grow through educational research. What may work
effectively in the physical classroom will require
thoughtful adaptation and creativity by instructors in
order to be deployed at scale. Some instructors like Dr.
Scharmer and Mr. Yukelson are leading the way. It is clear
that to explicitly focus on these qualities of being requires
courage and humility from instructors. Contemplative
practices, to the extent they have positive effects on
learners, may also cause reciprocal effects between
learners and instructors. To whatever extent learners
grow in their awareness, reflection, curiosity, and respect
for others, instructors stand to benefit greatly from this
approach.

CHAPTER 13: ADVANCED COURSE DESIGN

Much of what this manual covers so far would still fall
under the category of traditional or standard online
learning. Of course, don't let terms like "traditional" or
"standard" fool you - online learning is still relatively new
in the larger picture of learning, and there is a lot we don't
know about it.

While there is no standard or threshold for what makes
something "standard" or "advanced" course design, there
are many ideas and structures (or lack of structure) that
would be considered "cutting edge" or "experimental" by
many. This chapter will briefly touch on a few of these
that you can try in your courses. There are many others
beyond these. If you can think of something that is
outside of what is covered in this manual, but would be
a good idea for your course - then search online to see
if someone has already tried it. You might be surprised at
what you find. For now, let's take a brief look at several
different ways to think outside of the standard course
structure.

SELF- MAPPED LEARNING PATHWAYS

This guide has covered many different ways of looking
at learning, as well as many different philosophical ways
of designing courses. You may be teaching a topic that
clearly lends itself to one type of design or learning

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 163
theory. If that is the case, then you have a clear path
before you. However, you may be looking at the different
options and thinking that there are several that may or
may not apply, or that you have some learners that would
appreciate different ways of approaching course content,
or even learners with vastly different contexts that have
vastly different educational needs. If that is you, then you
may be wondering if it is even possible to accommodate
such flexibility in your course without designing several
different parallel courses.

One possible way to approach this is through a design
method called Self-Mapped Learning Pathways (Crosslin,
2018; Crosslin & Wakefield, 2016). The basic idea was
initially called a dual-layer approach, because it entailed
having two layers to a course (Crosslin & Dellinger, 2015;
Kilgore & Al-Freih, 2017). One was an instructor-led
layer that followed a defined pathway through course
content. The other layer was a student-centered layer that
allowed learners to create their own pathway through
the course content. Because "layers" implies a hierarchy,
the concept of layers was changed over to "modalities"
(Instructor Centered or Student Centered) that are both
equally valid (Crosslin, Dellinger, Joksimovic, Kovanovic,
& Gasevic, 2018). Learners can choose either modality
or both at any point in the course, and then change that
mix as needed at any time (figure 1). Thus, the learners
map their own pathway through the course structure and
content.

164 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Figure 1: Theoretical Design of a Self-Mapped Learning Pathways Course

For example, a learner may come into a course, look at
the instructor content and decide they are already
familiar with it. They then decide to look at the content
from their specific sociocultural lens by finding resources
online. However, at some point, they run into something
they aren't familiar with, so they jump over to the
instructor-centered content to find what they need to
know. They see that there is an interesting discussion
with the learners that are following the instructor-led
path, so they also decide to participate in that, while
blogging their own experiences on their website.Keep in
mind that while this structure sounds like a fairly straight
forward design process (left side of figure 2), the reality is
that courses designed with this structure can (and often
do) take on much more complex structures - full of
different choices on the instructor-focused side as well
as meandering options on the learner-focused side (right
side of figure 2). On the right side of figure 2 below, the
blue lines represent how the instructor-focused modality
can still have different options and non-linear lessons.
The red area represents the organically forming official

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 165
options for learner-focused pathways, surrounded by the
gray areas that represent the unofficial options that
learners could choose to add to their pathway as they
create and follow their learning map.

Figure 2: Theory Versus Reality of Self-Mapped Learning Pathways Design

Also consider how learners may take different pathways
through the course design that are not straight (or even
non-linear). For example, the left side of figure 3
showcases a meandering learning pathway, while the
right side showcases how a learner might pick and choose
various parts at different times. Your learning context
may not allow for this much flexibility, but keep in mind
these possibilities if you have that option.

Figure 3: Meandering and Non-Linear Learner Possibilities

The interesting flexibility behind this design is that it has

166 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
options for beginners that just want to follow instructors,
as well as options for experts that want to go deeper (and
for those that fall somewhere in between the two). For
more information on the structure, see these blog posts
(mostly about MOOCs that implemented this design, but
still applicable to any online courses in many ways):

      "Designing a Dual Layer cMOOC/xMOOC" by
         Matt Crosslin

      "Digging Into What "Choice" is in Customizable
         Modality/Dual-Layer" by Matt Crosslin

      "Every Choice is Awesome. Every Path is Cool
         When You're in #HumanMOOC" by Matt
         Crosslin

Various research projects have looked into the pathway
options learners have chosen in this model (Crosslin,
2016; Crosslin, Dellinger, Joksimovic, Kovanovic, &
Gasevic, 2018), how learners have navigated autonomy in
this model (Dawson, Joksimovic, Kovanovic, Gasevic, &
Siemens, 2015), and the issues that various technologies
utilized in designing for this model have cause learners
(Rose, et al., 2015).

Creating a Learning Pathways Course

While at first glance, it might seem that this design
methodology requires creating two completely different
versions of the same course. However, the best way to
look at the design process is not as two separate courses,
but as one way to truly accomplish learner-centered self-
determined learning. There are three overall steps to the
process:

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 167
    1. Create a set of competencies to guide the
         instructor-led modality and provide suggestions
         for the learner-centered modality.

    2. Design the instructor led modality based on
         objectives that will accomplish the competencies.

    3. Create suggestions and scaffolding for assisting
         learners with the transition from the instructor-
         centered modality to the learner-centered
         modality. This is where many learners will have
         the least experience, and therefore will need the
         most help.

The biggest thing to remember is that the key to this
form of design, as with any learner-centered design
methodology, is for you as the instructor to release
control. This will mean that learners will need more time
to adjust and map their own pathway. It also means you
will need to not overwhelm yourself with grading on the
instructor-focused modality. You will be answering a lot
of questions and providing a lot of guidance, so make
sure to build time in for that. Also keep in mind that this
design methodology is not an "all or nothing" idea. You
can take the parts of it that make sense for your course, or
slowly ease yourself into it over several courses. Learning
gets messier the more it moves away from centralized
control, so get ready for flexibility if you decide to go
down this path. Leigh A. Hall has written a series of blog
posts on how she wrestles through these issues - a few
sample ones are listed here:

      "Documenting Customizable Pathways" by Leigh
         A. Hall

         Hall

Objectives and Competencies

Both objectives and competencies have been covered in
this manual already. You could actually switch numbers
1 and 2 in the previous three step process if you already
have objectives and a full course. Just start with the
objectives you have for a course and start converting
those into competencies. A quick and imperfect way to
start that is to remove the conditions and criteria from
your objectives, just leaving the behavior to form the
foundation of the competency. The main idea to keep in
mind is that your competencies will still need to cover
your topic well enough to still accomplish the overall goal
of the course, but flexible enough to allow for alternate
pathways (you might even consider letting your learners
remix or rethink your competencies as their own). For
a bit more detail on creating competencies out of
objectives, please see:

      "Bridging Learners From Instructivism to
         Connectivism" by Matt Crosslin

Designing the Instructor-Focused Modality

The main thing to keep in mind when designing the
instructor-focused modality is to keep it focused on the
instructor. This doesn't mean that you leave out any
student group work or social interactive activities. Far

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 169
from it - you need to make sure that this modality is a
well-designed instructional pathway. Think of what you
would do for learners that are completely new to the
topic you are covering, and guide them down that path.
Just remember that some learners may be coming in and
out of this modality as needed, so be sure to avoid any
long term repeating group work that could suffer from
learners changing modalities. Of course, on the other
hand, it can also be helpful to have groups step out into
their own learning pathway together, depending on the
course topic. Just remember that you don't want to force
learners into learner-centered or connectivist activities -
they need to choose those options for themselves.

A quick note about assessment: grading projects and
activities does become difficult when learners are
creating their own pathway. Many of the suggestions of
effective assessment covered in Chapter 9 would help
here. Open rubrics can be one way to grade across
modalities, especially if you focus on what the learners
actually learned and not the format of how they proved
their accomplishments. In this design modality, it is up to
the learner to demonstrate what they have learned. They
can do so by following your suggestions in the instructor-
focused modality, or by creating a different artifact in
the student-centered modality. So instead of focusing on
page numbers and word counts, look at the competency
itself and evaluate solely on that.

Scaffolding Learners to Self-Mapping

Most learners are used to following the instructor, so
they might need help transitioning into mapping their

170 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
own pathway. Learners will need to develop higher levels
of self-direction and drive to be successful in a course
designed like this. You will probably need to constantly
remind them that they can take this level of control over
their learning pathway, as well as answer questions about
what you think about their ideas. Therefore, you should
approach this design methodology as more of a
conversation that opens up over time. You can help
learners think through some of these issues by providing
scaffolding and example ideas throughout the course.
One example of this has already been covered in Chapter
6 in the section on Assignment Banks. Whenever you
create an assignment in the instructor-centered modality,
you can also list some alternative assignment ideas or
artifacts to draw learners to the self-mapped pathway.
Others have tried to add an element of games to their
assignment banks by adding point values to assignments
in the bank (see the next section on gamification). You can
also create guides for other tools that learners could use,
or even interactive maps of their options (click here for
an example in one MOOC). Or, the platform you use
might have learning analytics tools that can help you and
your learners with scaffolding. For more details on
scaffolding in this design scenario, see:

      "Visual Flow of Learner Tools in the Dual Layer
         MOOC" by Matt Crosslin

The biggest question with this design methodology is
how does a learner create a learning pathway? There are
probably many different ways to look at this issue, but
one example is documented here:

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 171

         Matt Crosslin

GAMIFICATION AND GAME-BASED LEARNING

Using games in learning is not a new concept. Most of
us have played learning games at least a few times in our
education. However, many are not aware how diverse or
developed the idea of games in learning is. From adding
game elements to role playing to video games to
simulations to virtual reality to text-based scenarios and
on and on, there are many options for combining games
and learning. However, as you read through this brief
overview, please keep in mind things like accessibility
and access. Not all learners have access to high level
computing equipment, and others have accessibility
issues with their eyesight or hearing or other issues that
limit how they can experience some of these ideas. Please
keep in mind those students when considering games in
education, and make sure to keep your course activities
accessible to all.

The intersection of games and learning is a large area
that could fill its own book (and already has several times
over). There are also differences between gamification,
educational gaming, game-based education, and other
terms. We will cover a brief overview here with links to
more information if you would like to explore these ideas
for your courses.

Gamification

In an education setting, gamification is the addition of
game-design elements to an overall educational context.

172 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
This could be anything from using stars or level-up game
elements in place of grades, to educational quests, to
game-based rewards systems in courses. This can be a
simple and inexpensive addition to a course, or a complex
and expensive design process. If you have ever
experienced an element of a game that you thought might
make your course more interesting, this is a great way to
add it. For more ideas, see these articles:

      "4 Ways To Bring Gamification of Education To
         Your Classroom" by Suzanne Holloway

      "Gamification in Education" by Vicki Davis

      Gamification of Learning

Game-Based Learning/Educational Games

Game-Based Learning is exactly what its name states:
basing education on one or more games that were either
designed for education, or that have some kind of
educational value (even if not designed specifically for
education). Many people think "video games" when they
hear of this, and while video games are a big part of
game-based learning, it could also include simulations,
problem-based learning, board games, re-enactments, or
other non-digital means. Some teachers find and
purchase games that are already designed for the purpose
that they desire, while others attempt to build the games
themselves or have groups of learners create games. This
takes an extensive amount of planning (and possibly

Augmented/Virtual Reality

The concepts of augmented reality (AR) and virtual
reality (VR) have been gaining a fair amount of attention
recently. However, it is too early to see if they will become
trends or footnotes in education. Historically they have
both tended to require expensive equipment and design
to create, but recent advancements in technology have
turned most smart phones into AR/VR machines -
sometimes with no added equipment, and other times
with a cheap $10 headset. The basic idea of augmented
reality is that it is a technology that layers or augments
digital content onto live video of the real world around
us. Think of games like PokemonGo! or mobile apps that
layer driving directions over live video on your phone.
Virtual reality is usually a more immersive experience,
typically cutting the user off from experiencing the real
world while they are immersed into a video/audio
3-dimensional realistic simulation. Much of the work in
the VR field seems to center on either simulation of
experiences (virtual field trips to historical sites, nursing
process simulations, etc) or more immersive passive
experiences (go inside a working heart, watch gorillas in
their native habitat, etc). More experimental ideas allow
learners to create art in 3-D spaces, create their own AR
apps, or build their own games in VR. This area is still

new (and often inaccessible to many), but if you are
interested, here is more to read:

eXperience Play

Game-based Education and Gamification can seem
overwhelming at first. If you are interested in games, but
not sure where to start, one place to consider is the
eXperience Play professional development website.
Created by two educational gamers that you might have
met showing off their games at various Ed-Tech
conferences (Keegan Long-Wheeler and John Stewart),
eXperience Play is "meant for anyone interested in
building games to use in the classroom or wanting to
facilitate student game development as part of their
courses." You can read through the lessons online, and
begin experimenting yourself. These lessons teach you
about text-based games in a free and easy to use program
called Twine. This approach leads you through a method
that is easy for even the newest of beginners to try, but

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 175

MOBILE LEARNING

Mobile devices have gone from novelty to near necessity
in a relatively short amount of time. Because of this, many
have started to look into the educational opportunities
these devices could afford. From consuming educational
content anywhere that a learner goes, to designing
learning activities that get learners to interact with the
world around them using their phone as part of the
exercise, there are many uses for mobile devices in
learning (sometimes referred to as m-learning or mobile
learning). However, please keep in mind that not all
phones are the same, and not everyone even has a phone
(no matter what you think you might observe around
you). The first thing to keep in mind when considering
mobile learning is what you will do for learners that don't
have access to phones, or phones with advanced features,
or even phones without Internet access. Make sure to
include options (or allow learners to create their own
options) that are flexible for various levels of phone
ownership. Also keep in mind that accessibility issues also
apply to mobile content and activities as well - you will
have students that have sight or hearing or other
accessibility issues that will need to be considered in this
area.

Mobile Content

One form of mobile learning is the creation or scaling

176 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
of content or activities with the intent of having learners
utilize it on mobile devices. This can be anything from
creating mobile friendly versions of content or activities
to creating specific smartphone applications (apps) that
work natively on mobile devices. This is an area that most
online instructors should be aware of, as in some parts
of the world, mobile devices are much more common
than laptops or desktop computers. With this in mind, the
important questions to ask yourself are: does my content
adjust to mobile devices? Do the video or audio files in
my courses work on smartphones (and can they be
downloaded to view in places that have poor network
connection)? Are the activities you have in your course
mobile friendly (some discussion forums, for example,
don't adjust to mobile devices very well)? Some LMS
providers (as well as tools like WordPress) have been
offering mobile friendly options - or even dedicated apps
- for a long time. Your learners will benefit greatly if you
know how those work, and how you might need to adjust
content and/or activities for apps or mobile devices.

Using Mobile Devices in Context

Another way of looking at mobile learning is to utilize
the capabilities of mobile devices within the context of
learners' everyday lives. For example, are they learning
about architecture, and could take pictures of examples of
architecture in the world around them? Are you studying
weather patterns, and they could capture videos of
weather examples? Can learners go on a museum tour
and take notes on their phone as they walk through
exhibits? Maybe they can meet with an expert in your
field and record the interview on their phone? There are

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 177
many possibilities, but the idea is for learners to use their
devices to interact with the world around them as they go
throughout life. You or your students could even venture
into mobile app creation in a more self-determined
learning method, as well.

There are a large number of possibilities when it comes
to mobile learning. If you are interested in learning more
about this area, here are some ideas for articles to look
into:

      "M-Learning"

      "12 Principles of Mobile Learning"

      "The Ultimate Teacher's Guide To Creating
         Educational Apps" by Jeff Dunn.

      This article suggests some expensive app builders,
         but there are free ones: "5 Simple Tools For
         Teachers To Create And Publish Apps Of Their
         Own"

RHIZOMATIC LEARNING

Rhizomatic learning is a learner-focused design
methodology based on the guiding principle of "the
community is the curriculum" (Cormier, 2008). Many
educational models and contexts have been created
through the years that allow learners to design and
determine their own learning; however, many of these
still contain some type of directive or oversight from the
instructor. Others will focus on having some type of class
voting system that will give learners some control to
determine the course structure at the beginning, but then

178 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
solidifies this design early on without allowance for
change or individual variations for personal needs.

Rhizomatic learning is different from these other forms
of learner-centered design in that learning is mapped by
the learning community throughout the whole process,
always with the ability to change or encompass variations
for individual learners. As Cormier (2008) states, the
"community acts as the curriculum, spontaneously
shaping, constructing, and reconstructing itself and the
subject of its learning in the same way that the rhizome
responds to changing environmental conditions" (para
13). This way of approaching education uses the rhizome
as a metaphor because "a rhizomatic plant has no center
and no defined boundary; rather, it is made up of a
number of semi-independent nodes, each of which is
capable of growing and spreading on its own, bounded
only by the limits of its habitat" (Cormier, 2008, para 4).

In some ways, this may seem to be a way to create a
course without planning. However, keep in mind that
many learners may not be ready for this form of shifting-
structure learning, so you may have to spend some time
scaffolding learners into this model, possibly by utilizing
self-regulated, self-directed, and then self-determined
learning as stepping stones into rhizomatic learning.
Sometimes it helps to have learners look at course goals
and learning objectives as something more like "learning
subjectives" that are their own self-determined goals.

A special note here: this way of learning may not work in
all contexts for all topics. However, if you are interested

                                                                                           CHAPTER 13 179
in trying this idea out with your course, here are some
suggested resources to help out:

CHAPTER 14: MARKETING OF AN ONLINE
COURSE

Now that you have successfully planned your course it is
time to tell the world about it and get those enrollment
numbers moving. For those in more traditional
institutions and companies, this may just mean getting
your course listed in the course catalog or company
newsletter. However, for other courses (especially
MOOCs), you might need to do a lot of the promotion
yourself. For those that need to self-promote their course,
here are some tips.

GRASSROOTS MARKETING VS. MASS
MARKETING

Marketing an online course is a delicate blend of two
common marketing strategies:

Grassroots marketing is targeting your marketing
efforts to a small group in the hopes that the group will
spread your message to a much larger audience.
Grassroots marketing of your course involves identifying
your target audience, the individuals that are more likely
to want to enroll in your course. For example, a course
on web development would target individuals obtaining
degrees or work in the fields of marketing, computer
science or advertising. Additionally, you would send

                                                                                           CHAPTER 14 183
announcements or post on the message boards for
publications that share your target audience. For the
example web development course, it would be best to
reach out to publications such as Smashing Magazine, Net
Magazine, Computer Arts, and many others that can be
found with a simple Google search.

Mass marketing is an attempt to appeal to an entire
market with one basic marketing strategy. Mass
marketing of your course is best described as casting a
wide net to find those individuals that are not in the
areas where your target audience is typically found. Using
the previous web development course example, mass
marketing is appropriate to reach those individuals that
are interested in web development, but are in the
psychology department or in the health sciences field that
would never hear about your course through your
targeted grassroots marketing efforts. Sending an
announcement to university or company newsletters and
purchasing advertising space in student newspapers to
reach a diverse audience are a few ideas. Also, utilizing
the institution or company that your course is connected
to could yield satisfactory enrollment results as well.
Work with your institution or company to help promote
the course through the alumni office, university
communications channels, and to the employee
community through HR learning and training channels.
Homepages, newsletters, bulletins, and alumni magazines
can also reach those individuals that are hard to reach.

UTILIZING YOUR COURSE PLATFORM

If you are hosting your course through channels like

184 CREATING ONLINE LEARNING EXPERIENCES
Coursera or edX, USE THEM! Many course providers
- especially those that offer MOOCS - have blogs that
instructors can contribute to and publicize the benefits of
their course to participants. Providers have the same goal
that you do when it comes to your enrollment numbers
and the quality of your course. With this common goal
in mind, they can provide tips and information on how
to market your course through your institution and other
channels - as long as you look for them.

SOCIAL MEDIA AND OTHER CHANNELS

Social media is a great marketing tool when it comes to
spreading the news about products, services, and (now)
MOOCS and other online courses. If you do not have
a social media presence, then it is time to get one and
build your network. Additionally, utilize the social media
presence of your institution or company, along with the
social media presence of your course provider.

If you have any connections to additional media outlets
or other institutions, make sure to inform them about
your course and include the links to your course
wherever your biography appears: personal websites,
departmental websites, social media profiles, and speaker
agencies.

                                                                                           CHAPTER 14 185

CONCLUSION

There are still many other issues that have not yet been
covered. You might have noticed that this manual does
not go much into overall processes to follow to create
courses. While there are many out there (Dick, Carey, &
Carey, 2001; Smith & Ragan, 2004), most of them that are
some variation of the ADDIE method. ADDIE stands for
the five steps that most course design processes typically
go through: Analyze the need for a course, Develop the
content and activity ideas, Design the actual content and
activities, Implement the course (i.e. teach it), and Evaluate
how well the course goes. Of course, just by reading
through that list you can begin to see that design models
can never be fully linear. Reliance on linear processes
remains the problem of most design methods: design is
messy and not linear. It also doesn't stop because the
course is being taught. However, many other resources
have covered the design process very well, so if you need
a general guide, those sources can be helpful.

At the end of the day, you will probably be the best person
to lay out your own process for creating a course. Take
the ideas you have learned here (or maybe refreshed your
memory about) and just start somewhere. This manual
follows the way that some generally follow when they
create a course, but you may want to remix or reorder

                                                                                          CONCLUSION 187
to fit your needs. Just keep your learners and their needs
central to whatever process you decide to follow.
