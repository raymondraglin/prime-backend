STUDENTS AND INSTRUCTORS

TO THE STUDENT, PART 1: WELCOME!
When it comes to learning, many students don't give it much more thought than, well, they just need
to pay attention, take good notes (if they can figure out how), and study hard enough to pass the tests,
assuming they will likely have about as much trouble or success as they have always had. The smart
people, it seems, along with those who are naturally organized, will always do better, and people not
born with those advantages will just have to try to get by as best they can.

   And most people have some kind of learning struggle in one area or another of school, on the job, or
wherever else new material needs to be learned.

   But here is some good news.
   Thanks to education research and development in the last fifty years or so, there are now many
more strategies, methods, and perspectives available to help us all succeed, to help us all "learn like a
professional," despite past struggles. Fortunately, many advancements have been made in the study of

                                                                                                                                                                 HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 1
how people learn, how our brains function, and even how we can use strategies we hadn't thought of
before - for example, this online text - to become the most effective learners we can be.

   That is the purpose of the lessons in this book.
   Enjoy.

TO THE STUDENT, PART 2: ON THE LESSON DESIGN AND CONTENT

There are numerous skills and strategies involved in effective learning. Time management, goal
setting, note-taking, reading critically, applying memory techniques, and employing good test-taking
strategies are but a few.

   This Open Education Resource (OER) is designed to assist you in your quest for success both
inside and outside of academia because understanding how to engage effectively in any learning
environment applies not only at school but also at work, home, and within the community.

   The lessons are designed for educational institutions that include community colleges and
alternative higher education settings where the learner demographic includes not only young, single
people but also older people who may have entered higher education for the first time or who are
returning after some years. It includes displaced or disabled workers who have to re-train for a
different field of employment, ex-military people who are now accessing their educational benefits,
and international students. It includes single moms and dads, people with part- and full- time jobs,
and those actively seeking employment as the term ensues. In short, this course was designed keeping
in mind all of the kinds of learners that we might serve, you, in your unique situation, among them.

   In the lessons that follow, you will study excerpts from the experts on effective learning, thinking,
and reading; experience a variety of presentation formats; and have plenty of opportunities to practice
what you learn.

   The course will include a portfolio project as a take-home mid-term, and another portfolio
project as a take-home final in which you will have the opportunity to gather what works for you
from the variety of effective learning strategies provided throughout the course . The take-home mid-
term project will conclude Units 1-3, and the take-home final will conclude Units 4-6.

TO THE INSTRUCTOR,

Lane Community College's EL115 course is offered through our Academic Learning Skills
Department. Although it is part of our developmental education offerings, the credits we assign
are transferable to colleges and universities. This particular course is designed to meet face-to-face,
twice per week, for 1.5 hours per class, or some other configuration of times and days to total
approximately 30 hours of instruction. It meets for an eleven-week term, the last week reserved for
finals or presentations depending upon the class. However, with the addition of optional assignments
and activities listed at the end of each unit, there is enough material for a full semester, as well.

   NOTE: Lane also features a visit to the college library as part of this course, when it can be
scheduled, for an introductory site tour and a tour of online library resources.

   The units can be easily adapted to other presentation formats as well as to online learning
platforms. At Lane, it will net the successful student 3 credits on completion. The lesson plans are
structured to reflect Lane's Core Learning Outcomes (CLOs):

     · Think Critically

     · Engage diverse values with civic and ethical awareness

2 PHYLLIS NISSILA
     · Create ideas and solutions
     · Communicate effectively, and
     · Apply learning
Each unit, which can cover up to two weeks, is organized with:
     · an overview that includes unit topics, objectives, materials, terms, and a to-do list;
     · the lessons presented in various formats;
     · lesson exercises for in-class assignments and/or homework;
     · optional activities/assignments/extra credit opportunities to meet the needs of both online

         and face-to face students;
     · the rubrics for the take-home mid-term (after Units 1-3) and the take-home final (after Units

         4-6)
     · Back Matter that includes

               a Glossary of Terms, also featured in the lesson in which they appear.
               Graphic Organizers for reading comprehension and writing
               Outside of the text resources:

                        a complete, linked list of Lane Instructor Dan Hodges' "Study Tips". Several of
                           the tips and excerpts are referenced in the lessons.

SPECIFIC CRITICAL THINKING/CRITICAL READING OBJECTIVES:

     · Students will develop metacognitive awareness in order to identify and solve comprehension
         problems.

     · Students will accurately identify and explain the hierarchy of critical thinking. (Bloom's
         Taxonomy)

     · Students will demonstrate increased facility, range, and persistence as readers by utilizing
         such strategies as identifying and annotating for key ideas and supporting information, by
         building cognitive routines such as asking questions of the text, working in collaborative
         relationships with peers about the reading process and comprehension, and building their
         knowledge of reading as a discipline and an integral part of academic, career, and civic
         success.

     · Students will explain how and why critical thinking/reading is necessary in academic and
         non-academic contexts.

     · Students will demonstrate development as a CT and analyze and evaluate problems/strengths
         of individual critical thinking in general and specifically for college level reading

         comprehension.
     · Students will demonstrate CT in coursework contexts such as reading graphics, complex

         rubrics, test/essay prompts, and by identifying traditional patterns in reading (cause/effect,
         comparison/contrast, definition, exemplification, etc.).
     · Students will identify CT concepts presented in most textbooks: bias, fact/opinion,
         propaganda, logical fallacy, deductive/inductive reasoning, inference, connotation/
         denotation.

LESSON 1.1: THE THREE LEARNING STYLES

                                                              By the time students enter higher education, most

                                                              have a pretty good idea how they learn best, though

                                                              they may not have thought about it specifically.

                                                              Perhaps you do, too.

                                                              For example, is it easier for you to learn by reading

                                                              the instructions or by studying charts and graphs

                                                              (visual learning)? Do you do better by hearing

                                                              someone explain something or by listening to a video

                                                              presentation (auditory, also known as aural,

                                                              learning)? Or, does it help you to actually "get your

"College Students" by CollegeDegrees360 is licensed under CC  hands on" whatever the task is, whether writing a
BY-SA 2.0                                                     paper, fixing the sink, or organizing a softball game
                                                              (kinesthetic learning)?

These three learning styles, as they are called, are some of the most common ways we comprehend

information, whether learning in a classroom, a kitchen, or on the job. We will be covering two

additional well-known learning theories, the "Brain Dominance Theory" and "Gardner's Theory of

Multiple Intelligences," as well. But for starters, complete the following exercise.

                                                    UNIT 1, EXERCISE 1.1

   Take the Learning Style Inventory to capture your "best practices" when it comes to the basic
three learning styles. This inventory and others you will take throughout the course will become
part of your take-home mid-term and take-home final. When you complete the "Learning Styles
Inventory":

      1. Download the inventory.

      2. Download the article What's Your Learning Style.

      3. Based on your inventory results, annotate by highlighting, underling, circling, or
           some other annotation device, ideas about how to maximize your learning style and
           strengthen others from the lists of multiple styles and preferences. Annotate for at least
           FIVE helpful perspectives and/or strategies per each of the three learning styles. Save

LESSON 1.2: VISUAL LEARNING

                                                 Studies indicate that up to 80% of us use our sense of sight as our
                                              primary learning style, or modality. Unfortunately, a lot of
                                              information in classrooms, workshops, meetings, and so on, is
                                              delivered in a lecture format. Nevertheless, there are still visual
                                              strategies that can be used to aid the learner.

                                                 To see how one teacher expanded her classroom presentations
                                              to include more visual strategies (and her success with that), and to
                                              offer several more visual strategies that may be helpful for you, too,
                                              complete the following exercise.

LESSON 1.3: AUDITORY LEARNING

                        Modality number two is learning by hearing, or auditory/aural learning. Studies
                     show that the percentage of people who learn best by hearing is as low as 10%, so most
                     of us need strategies for how to get the most out of straight lecture classes or workshop
                     and meeting presentations.

                        For a reminder of how tricky this type of learning can be, complete the following
                     exercise.

"Helping hands" by AlphaZeta is in the Public     Kinesthetic or hands-on/tactile learners, surprisingly,
Domain, CC0                                    comprise only about 25-50% of learners. But maybe I'm
                                               surprised because I am definitely a kinesthetic learner! It is my
                                               major mode. For kinesthetic learners, adding physical
                                               movement as a comprehension strategy is one of the best ways
                                               to learn. They do not do as well just listening to lectures or
                                               watching videos or sitting through power point presentations.

                                                  You have already gleaned much information on how to adapt
                                               a learning environment for this kind of learner from the
                                               previous readings and exercises in this unit. Now, take a look at
                                               one special environment designed primarily for hands-on
                                               learning, and complete the exercise below.

                                                    UNIT 1, EXERCISE 4.1
   For a look at one way kinesthetic learning has been incorporated into an educational facility
specifically for learning challenged students, take a look at a website advertising a facility called
Academy at SOAR. There is a short video presentation, and several features to read and learn about
this facility that serves a population that often struggles in more traditional settings.
   As you watch and read, you will learn about several kinesthetically-designed learning activities
including hiking, rock climbing, snorkeling, a Spanish-immersion program and more.
   For each of FIVE of these activities, write down as many traditional classroom or "regular
school" learning tasks as you can think of. This is a good activity for a team or study group, as well
as for individual students.

Get the idea?
The results of your lists will be discussed in class.

                        UNIT 1, EXERCISE 4.2

PART A: Team activity.

1. Team up in groups of three at the most.

2. Your instructor will assign each team a "learning style" (visual, auditory, or
    kinesthetic).

3. Decide how you would teach a group of teens, in a high-risk group for not
    completing their high school education, the importance of graduating.

4. Use "your learning style" to decide how you would present the information.

5. Oh, and your community LOVES to fund education, so you have an UNLIMITED
    budget for field trips, production projects, etc. NOTE: you do not have to actually
    present the lesson, just describe it to share with the class, later on. For online learners,
    you can perhaps get together with a study group, or do this on your own, choosing any
    of the learning styles.

   PART B: Independent activity-case study. Help Ben!

   Ben, a first-time college student who has not attended school since he graduated high school ten
years ago, is anxious about succeeding in college. He recently had to quit his very successful,
though small, construction business after he hurt himself and could no longer do many of the
tasks. Although he was disappointed, he sold his business and decided to invest his money in
higher education to fulfill a dream he had as a youngster: becoming a history teacher. He loves to
read as much as he loves building custom homes, so he looks at what happened to him as a chance
to start a new chapter. That said, he's nervous.

   He was never an "A" student in school, although he received several awards for his work in shop
and art classes. He also did pretty well in history classes as long as he could use his creativity. He
found it hard to sit still and he was easily distracted when the teachers lectured, but he was one of
the first to comprehend the information on charts and graphs. His GPA was high enough, however,
to get him into college.

   He wonders if you would give him some strategies about how to help him get the most out of his
classes, given what he has shared, here.

   Instructions: write a letter to Ben with TEN advice points to help him in his classes. Include
specific strategies related to what you believe are his strongest learning styles. But also keep in

14 PHYLLIS NISSILA
mind where he struggles, too, so you can offer him some help there, as well. He has to take the
following classes his first term: math, writing, effective learning, physical education, and an elective
which, as you might guess, is History of the Americas, 101. A letter of advice of about 250 words
will suffice.

                                                                                                                                                   HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 15
LESSON 1.5: THE BRAIN DOMINANCE THEORY

"Rainbow Brain" by Muffinator is in     The next learning theory reviewed in this series is somewhat
the Public Domain, CC0               controversial. It is called the "Brain Dominance Theory," or, technically,
                                     Lateralization of Brain Function. This theory suggests that certain
                                     approaches to thinking and learning differ according to the hemispheres,
                                     left and right, of the brain. Critics of this theory claim it is the result of
                                     pop psychology more than sound science. Indeed, common sense
                                     indicates that, of course, we utilize all parts of the brain
                                     continually-which is why I like the multi-colored graphic of the brain. It
                                     infers a kind of brain symmetry-if not of function, of form.

                                        To utilize your own "both/and" brain power, first read the article
                                     linked above, annotating for, or taking notes on, information you want
                                     to remember and include, perhaps, in your mid-term portfolio project
                                     and for your responses to the exercises below.

                                            UNIT 1, EXERCISE 5.1

1. Review the chart below that gives a brief summary of the so-called right/left brain
    kinds of activities, thinking, and preferences.

                    LEFT BRAIN                   RIGHT BRAIN
                    Logical                      Uses feeling/intuition
                    Detail oriented              Perceives the "big picture"
                    Facts are important          Imagination is important
                    Math and science interests   Philosophy, religion, art interests
                    Perceives patterns           Perceives spatial relationships
                    Reality based                Fantasy is a focus
                    Keen on analysis/strategies  Considers possibilities
                    Linear thinking              Thinks holistically

2. Based on the information gleaned in the article and in # 1, design two 8 1/2 by 11
    inches posters, one for each side of the brain, illustrating the same information as is on
    the chart, but according to how you think each kind of thinker/learner might design
    them. For example, the poster for "right brain" thinking/learning might be much more
    colorful. The student might also think of some sort of paper structure (origami?) by
    which to illustrate the differences. Enjoy.

16 PHYLLIS NISSILA
                        UNIT 1, EXERCISE 5.2

   Based on the information in the article and the chart, above, compare how friends, "R.B." (Right
Brain) and "L.B." (Left Brain) would respond to planning a weekend getaway to the fictitious
"Wilderness Resort" located in the lush, Pacific Northwest of the U.S. Activities could include:
planning, packing, traveling to and from, meals, indoor/outdoor activities, and so on. Contrast R.B.
and L.B. regarding at least 5 different activities. EXAMPLE: regarding packing for activities both
indoor (heated pool, fully equipped exercise room, a few casino type gaming tables, dancing, etc.)
and outdoor (hiking, boating, guided field trips through an old growth forest, etc.), RB takes a
casual approach: whatever is clean and easy to pack. LB first checks weather forecasts and maybe
the location of any poison ivy that might be growing in the forest.

An organization chart might help with this exercise:

ACTIVITY R.B. RESPONSE  L.B. RESPONSE

                                                   UNIT 1, EXERCISE 5.3

   1. Answer the following question (no more than about 150 words):

   Though it is controversial, how do you think knowing about the Brain Dominance Theory can still help
you in the learning process? As you are thinking about this subject, consider how you might enhance your
current response to learning and completing assignments or tasks by trying out either new left-brain or right-
brain approaches.

LESSON 1.6: HOWARD GARDNER'S MULTIPLE INTELLIGENCES THEORY

The last learning theory previewed here is called Gardner's Multiple Intelligences Theory, of which
there are currently nine so-called intelligences, listed as follows. (Note: number nine is pretty new on
Professor Gardner's evolving list and is yet to be included in most representative graphics, such as the
one below.)

    1. musical-rhythmic and harmonic
    2. visual-spatial
    3. verbal-linguistic
    4. logical-mathematical
    5. bodily-kinesthetic
    6. interpersonal
    7. intrapersonal
    8. naturalist
    9. existential.

18 PHYLLIS NISSILA
"Multiple intelligence" by Sajaganesandip is licensed under CC BY-SA 4.0

When I began teaching effective learning classes, there were still just the original eight intelligences.
According to the article, Gardner may soon add even more, including "teaching-pedagogical
intelligence... humor, cooking and sexual intelligence." In Gardner's view, human beings are indeed
multi-talented and multi-intelligent.

   To help you remember the various learning abilities cited in this theory that are available to us
to comprehend and interact with the environments in which we live, study, and work, complete the
exercises below.

                                                                                                                                                               HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 19
                         UNIT 1, EXERCISE 6.1

1. Read the article linked above.

2. Create a list of these intelligences, but define them in your own words.

3. For each intelligence and definition, also create a picture as a mnemonic device. You
    may wish to create a three-column chart on which to organize the information, for
    example:

INTELLIGENCE DEFINITION  PICTURE/SYMBOL

                                                   UNIT 1, EXERCISE 6.2

   PART A
   Individually, in a team, or in a study group, list as many "intelligences" you can discern that
would be used to accomplish the following tasks:

      1. Shopping for groceries:
      2. Changing the oil in the car:
      3. Planning a garden:
      4. Acing a math test:
      5. Writing a report on the human digestive system:
      6. Running a 10k fundraising event:
      7. Comforting a friend who just lost a loved one:
      8. Organizing a softball game:
      9. Collecting samples of music from Latin American countries:
    10. Hosting a religious study:
    11. Designing a brochure of information for new college students:
    12. Performing a scene with your study group from a Shakespearean play:

TO THE INSTRUCTOR: OPTIONAL ASSIGNMENTS/ACTIVITIES/EXTRA CREDIT
OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNIT 1

ICE BREAKER

Since this is the first week of the course, an "ice breaker" for face-to-face classes helps students get
to know each other better while also providing an opportunity to introduce two mnemonic devices:
remembering by using association and organizing information by using a graphic (in this case, a
three-column chart).

· Direct students to create a chart that has three columns. In the first column, they will write
   their classmates' names. Across from each name in the second a third columns, they will write
   a word then a picture or symbol for each classmate that will help them remember the names (a
   fishing pole for one who likes to fish, for example, a flower for a gardener, a hat for another
   who says he always wears hats). Explain that they will be filling it out for as many classmates
   as they can in whatever time is available for this activity.

· Demonstrate by filling out the first entry for yourself. A "word association" for me might be
   that I am tall, or that I am the instructor. I ask the students what kind of picture or symbol
   usually represents a teacher to them. Most often, it will be an apple.

· Give students an amount of time to get as many names down as they can. Afterwards, they can
   test themselves using this mnemonic creation by studying it however they want to, to help
   them remember names. Of course, they have also engaged in a good opportunity to find out
   who they will be learning and working with in a casual and enjoyable way-as has the
   instructor.

SYLLABUS TREASURE HUNT

Many students will simply tuck a course syllabus away in their notebook. It's a pretty dull document,
after all, with information such as course standards, objectives, classroom rules and regulations, and
the like. They might do little more than glance at it and transfer the instructor's email address and
phone number to their cell phone.

   However, there is often not only vital but also very useful information in a syllabus: grading
information, holidays/school closure lists, where they might access disability accommodations,
campus emergency numbers, how to lodge a grievance and many more useful items. One way to not
only help them realize that a syllabus contains vital data but also to practice annotation skills is to
assign a treasure hunt.

   I usually tell the students to annotate (highlight, underline, circle, make marginal notes) for the
following three items:

1. Information they especially want to remember (most annotate my contact info)

2. Information they have a question or concern about

    3. Any additional information they would appreciate having on this handy resource

Here is a sample EL115 syllabus treasure hunt for a typical EL115 course syllabus at Lane.

SIMPLE NOTEBOOK ORGANIZATION PLAN

An additional activity for a face-to-face class is to assign the students a simple notebook organization
task (for in-class or for homework). Of course, some students may already have a lovely
organizational plan. Here is my suggestion:

   From the topmost page when you open the notebook, insert:

     · Your assignment/to-do list(s)
     · Course syllabus
     · Perhaps a list of classmates names/contact information: sample classmate contact form.
     · Your text or other official materials (downloaded text, if it is to be downloaded, any additional

         packets that might be required)
     · 12 notebook dividers (one for the handouts, hand backs, scored/graded assignments for each

         of the 10 weeks of the course; and two for students' choice. Some of my students prefer to
         keep all quiz/assessment type tasks in one place, for example. Some of them keep paper in
         another for note taking or other tasks.

CAMPUS-WIDE VIRTUAL, OR ONLINE, WEBSITE TREASURE HUNT

This can be created as an actual physical search around campus for student services, or a website hunt.
For our students at Lane, here is a sample online hunt: Lane Community College Students Services,
campus treasure hunt.

OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES AND/OR GRADING ELEMENTS FOR UNIT
1

Grades for this course as taught are determined primarily by the rubrics for the rubric for-take-home
mid-term and for the take-home final portfolio projects assigned at the end of Unit 3 and Unit 6,
respectively. This instructor teaches this as a face-to-face class presented on a Course Management
System (MOODLE, at Lane), and includes points for attendance, as well as some miscellaneous
homework assignments, mostly lesson exericises. However, this OER can be used for online or hybrid
classes as well.

   Here are some suggestions for additional course components and grading elements:

     · The Glossary of Terms in the back is good information for weekly quizzes, mid-term tests,
         and/or final exams.

     · For exercise 5.2 (re: the Brain dominance Theory), students could act out their responses.

LESSON 2.1: WORLD VIEW AND SELF EFFICACY

WORLD VIEW

   Most textbook chapters on management tasks involved in             "World" by Clker-Free-Vector-Images is in the
effective learning start with the famous (and infamous) topic of      Public Domain, CC0
procrastination. The term comes from Middle French and Latin
and, of course, means putting something off until later.

   It is hardly necessary to define this common problem at
school-and everywhere else-in any language, however. We all
know what it is. We all do it, and we've all suffered to some extent
because of it (missed deadlines tend to make instructors-and
bosses-crabby).

   But here is a problem: some people procrastinate more than
others. And NOT just because they are lazy, disorganized,
unmotivated, or confused about what to do. Those might be the
surface assumptions and sometimes true, but at other times, or
perhaps beneath what appear to be the behaviors listed above,
defeating habits like procrastination have to do with deeper issues,
maybe beliefs and thought patterns such as:

· "What's the use if I get this done, or not?"
· "I do better under stress, so leaving things until the last minute actually helps me."
· "I'm just naturally disorganized."
· "I never manage to do anything on time. I've always been that way!"

This is why Unit 2 begins with "foundational issues," perspectives and beliefs about ourselves such as
our world view that operates at the bottom of our pile of motivations, and our sense of self-efficacy (or
lack thereof) that generates thoughts that either work for or against us when it comes to successfully
managing time, tools, and environments of learning. Lesson 2.2 deals with procrastination itself, often
a by-product of a negative or unexamined world view and a low sense of self-efficacy, but with an
emphasis on how to overcome it.

   First, here is a look at world view, a concept some experts put at the foundational level of how we
think and perceive the world. On top of our world view, so to speak, and as a result of it, are our
beliefs. And on top of beliefs lay our conscious-level feelings and thoughts.

                                                                      HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 25
   Our world view, as researcher F. Heylighen defines it, is "a framework that ties everything together,
that allows us to understand society, the world, and our place in it, and that could help us to make the
critical decisions which will shape our future." In his article What is a world view? Heylighen, citing the
work of Belgian philosopher Leo Apostel, lists seven basic components of a person's world view:

    1. A model of the world (how the world functions/how it is structured)
    2. Explanation (of the model)
    3. Futurology (where are we going?)
    4. Values (good/evil)
    5. Action (plans of action based on our values)
    6. Knowledge (true and false)
    7. Building Blocks (what fragments of others' world views helped us shape ours)

These components cover the fundamental questions about existence human beings find themselves
mulling over in time, questions that ultimately guide beliefs, thoughts, and feelings.

   Exercise 2.1 is based on Heylighen's article. Whereas this exercise is not a "personal inventory" per
se, it has value in guiding the learner to discovering, perhaps, some foundational issues that can hinder
a successful approach to overcoming non-productive actions and habits such as procrastination.

26 PHYLLIS NISSILA
   For example, if a person has a world view that is post modern, he/she views the world with a heavy
dose of skepticism and distrust of ideologies, rationality, and absolute truth. Therefore, it might be
easy to subscribe to a "What's the use?" thought and feeling when it comes to academic and work-
world norms such as being on time and getting one's work done.

   Note: it is not necessary, however, to know precisely which world view one has been influenced
by to complete the exercise. Indeed, most people more or less absorb their world views from parents,
institutions, and the culture in which they grew up. The value in knowing such information about
oneself is in understanding how to deal with certain attitudes and beliefs that work against successful
learning, and success in life in general. It is also valuable to know what has contributed to successful
attitudes and beliefs so that these can be affirmed and reinforced for future success.

                                                            UNIT 2, EXERCISE 2.1

               1. Read the article by Heylighen, linked above, for a more detailed explanation of world
                    view and the seven components he cites.

               2. Briefly respond to your thoughts on each of the seven components. If you have not
                    given much thought to some of them as of yet, take time to consider them now. Three
                    to five sentences will likely be sufficient for each component, for a total of
                    approximately 21-35 sentences. It would be helpful to number the components. This
                    does not have to be completed as an essay.

SELF EFFICACY

Self efficacy, or one's sense of being able to achieve goals, is an essential ingredient in a learner's
ability to succeed. Thoughts and feelings on this topic, which stem from one's beliefs (remember the
pyramid illustration) contribute to more, or less, success.

   A key element of self efficacy is the concept of locus of control. As the definition indicates, the
locus, or place, of control is usually either internal or external, but sometimes it is both.

   Obviously if a person believes that he/she is in control of situations and outcomes (an internal
locus) achieving goals is more likely. If a person believes he/she is controlled by external forces,
achieving goals is less likely. But everyone experiences both internal and external forces for various
reasons. For example, choosing to do the right thing on the job is based on the external control of
workplace rules. Yet, one might apply for the job based on one's internal belief that he/she can
succeed. And both internal and external loci of control are in operation when one chooses to do the
right thing at any time based on one's beliefs about God.

   For a more detailed explanation and the relationship of self efficacy to locus of control, complete
exercise 2.2.

                                                                                                                                                               HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 27

           After reading the definition of this concept in the article cited above, answer the following
        questions:

               1. List three attitudes and/or perspectives that a person with a primarily internal locus
                    of control might have that will help him/her succeed in life, and why.

               2. List three attitudes and/or perspectives that a person with a primarily external locus
                    of control might have that might hinder his/her success, and why.

               3. List three instances where both internal and external loci of control help a person,
                    and why.

           A chart might help you organize your response.

help you solve what is arguably the number one detriment to        Domain, CC0
effective learning at school, home, and/or on the job (aka
procrastination), complete Exercise 2.1, below.
This personal inventory is a bit different from others you may
have taken. It incorporates very little about the usual bad habit
suspects when it comes to the "P" word and includes more on
the other reasons for such a habit, as suggested in the previous
lesson as well as one or two other procrastination-inducers
which have cropped up in our now social-media-saturated lives.
Perhaps there is, in fact, more to your challenges with
procrastination than the assumptions about laziness,
disorganization, etc. See what you think. More importantly, see
what you can do about it.

   For each item, circle one. Oh, and by the way, feel free to add any comments you wish.
Sometimes quick-answer exercises like this just don't have enough of YOUR personal response
options, but try not to overthink things. This is, after all, a simple snapshot of where your beliefs

            NOTE: This exercise is not graded on responses. The answer key to this personal inventory is to
        get right into helping the learner start solving some of these causes of procrastination.

As promised above, let's get started with some immediate solutions as well as some perspectives
that might, in time, help you adjust your thoughts and feelings or perhaps a flagging sense of self
efficacy and/or other reasons you might commit the "P" word.

                                                            UNIT 2, EXERCISE 2.2
           Instructions:

               1. From your responses to exercise 2.1, select your top five challenges when it comes to
                    procrastinating. Create a chart, such as this, but leave yourself ample space to fill in
                    solutions you find:

   2. Keeping in mind your top 5 picks, do a search for relevant information online and insert what
information strikes you as being most helpful.

   Also, note: future lessons on reading comprehension, organization of time and materials, etc.,
will also help you with solutions, so this can be an ongoing treasure hunt for you as you conquer
one of a learner's worst enemies...you know...the "P" word...

   There is a new phenomenon called "social media addiction". I'm sure I don't need to elaborate. I,
myself, succumb from time to time. However, for more specifics, perspectives, and assistance in
conquering this particular cause of procrastination, download the article and annotate it for
information you think might help you. Write a short summary (5-7 sentences).

LESSON 2.3: SCHEDULES AND SCHEDULING

Some people just seem to be born organized. The remaining 95%

of the population* need help, especially when it come to

organizing time!

It used to be that physical organizers, called schedulers or day-

timers, came in pocket- or purse- sized folders, books, or

multipurpose binder creations with cleverly designed nooks and

crannies for everything from pens and pencils, to cell phones, to

daily, weekly, and yearly schedules, address and phone number

lists, and other handy components. Now, cell phones and other      "Clock" by geralt is in the Public Domain,
electronic gadgets advertise apps for such things, though some     CC0
people still prefer hard copies.

For students, early in your school career such a management tool was not really necessary. Other

people handed you a schedule, defined your routines, and that was that. Not so for college students,

where changing term requirements and time demands that differ from class to class can present a

variety of management challenges. Of course, add other life factors such as children, work, and/or

caring for aging parents and, well, many people not only want, but NEED a strategy to stay organized.

But before we get into some specific management tools, complete the exercise, below, designed

to help you determine what your best times of the day to accomplish academic activities are. Some

people describe themselves as night people, others as morning people. Others, with busy lives, might

say "I'm a 24/7 person!" But the more we know about ourselves in this regard, the more we will be

able to adjust our schedule to be more effective.

                                                    UNIT 2, EXERCISE 3.1
   Read the list below of academic tasks meant to be completed outside of class. Beneath that list
are time slots during an eighteen-hour day. If you are not restricted by work schedules or other
obligations, from what you know about your best times of the day to accomplish certain things,
when would you tend to be at your peak performance for each activity? (Later on, you will
complete a schedule for all of your current school, work, meals, relaxation time, and home life
obligations). Think about this matching exercise as a wish list.

   Insert the numbers of as many of the activities listed on top that apply to your schedule this term
in the appropriate time slots on the bottom. Not all may apply to your course of study. You may
also be inclined to split the same activity into more than one time of day. Some activities may
extend to two or more hours. When you are finished, complete the reflection activity below.

           Again, considering this a wish list of what you know to be the best times of day/night for you to
        be at your most alert for the types of tasks noted, write about three ways you might be able to

        Write approximately 100-150 words, or about half a page, double-spaced.
           A few things to think about as you reflect:

                · What kind of changes in your current class and study schedule might be more effective
                    for you this term?

                · How might keeping in mind that most instructors advise scheduling anywhere from one
                    to three hours outside of classwork for every hour in class influence any changes in your
                    current schedule or your thoughts about future schedules?

                                                             UNIT 2, EXERCISE 3.2
           Before you fill out your "real life" schedule, you know, the one that includes all of the other
        things you do and are responsible for, read the article How to Plan Your Time so that You Can Get
        Your Homework Done by Dan Hodges (study tip # 14, scroll down to page 36). Add 5
        recommendations from his article to your reflection in Exercise 3.1 that you think might help you
        manage your time more efficiently.

                                                             UNIT 2, EXERCISE 3.3
           Based on your responses to exercises 3.1 and 3.2, fill out a reasonable schedule for you for one
        week, all seven days. Incorporate what you learned about yourself in the previous exercises, that is,
        your best time of day for studying certain subjects, and how you might alter your current schedule
        to insert a few of the recommendations.

                   activities and obligations you have to accomplish in one week.
               · Color code each activity for easier reference. For example, blue for class times, green for
                   study blocks, red for work, purple for relaxation time ("buffer time," as it is also known),
                   brown for home life activities.
               · NOTE: for some people, a work schedule can change from week to week. Just choose
                   the most typical week for you this term.
               · When you are finished, write a short, 5-7 sentence reflection on how you believe your
                   altered schedule can improve your time management skills. You might already have a
                   pretty good schedule, but most students find at least a few changes they can make.

LESSON 2.4: GRAPHIC ORGANIZERS AND STUDY CARDS

STUDY CARDS

   This lesson focuses on flash cards for studying any subject,       "nerd alert" by drcw is licensed under CC BY 2.0
and graphic organizers for various kinds of essays. We covered
how to organize a notebook in the first lesson, Optional
Assignments, # 3, which is another essential organizational
tool.

   First, let's take a look at study, or flash, cards. For the first
activity, you will need a set of either 3×5 or 4×6 cards, colored,
lined, or plain. Colored pencils or markers might also help you
create more effective study cards.

                                            UNIT 2, EXERCISE 4.1

1. Read the article How to Make Flash Cards.

2. Create a flash card for the 5 methods suggested. On one side, put the sub-heading
    (e.g., "Preparing to Make Flash Cards"), and on the other, condense the advice to bullet
    points or numbered points.

3. Copy your cards onto online "cards" according to the instructions in method 3 or
    method 4.

GRAPHIC ORGANIZERS FOR PAPERS

The next tools management topic concerns graphic organizers for papers. Every class, not just
writing classes, sooner or later includes some kind of essay, whether expository essays such as
exemplification, cause and effect, process, comparison/contrast, or definition papers or other
genres such as narrative, descriptive or argument. Most writing instructors will require that students
to complete outlines or fill out graphic organizers to help organize their writing prior to actually
writing the essay. The kind of outline that may be required will depend upon the style manual used in
the class. Here, however, are several common types of organizers:

                                              This form is also suitable for a definition paper by using only one column and adding more
                                              supporting detail ovals if more than three definition expansion methods are used. What is
                                              your topic? What is your thesis statement? Below are three boxes for subtopics. Under each
                                              box for a subtopic is space for 3 supporting details.

LESSON 2.5: STUDY AREAS AND STUDY GROUPS

TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE, INDIVIDUAL STUDY SPACES

Most students more or less take what they can get when it

comes to study areas. Schools usually offer a variety of nooks and

crannies for students to hunker down and get their assignments

done. The school library is a good (and quiet) place. Many

common areas elsewhere on campus have tables, chairs, couches,

and lounges to accommodate learners. But most students end up

doing the majority of their outside of class work at home.

Home environments may be limited in terms of providing all

of the recommended aspects of a good study space, but many of

the recommendations can be either implemented or adapted

from what a student has on hand or what can be improvised no

matter what environment he or she is living in. Elements            "Cluttered desk" by OpenClipart-Vectors is in
conducive to a more effective study/homework experience             the Public Domain, CC0
include such things as good lighting, ample supplies, comfortable

seating, adequate space, and personalizing the study area to add a touch of inspiration and motivation.

Before taking a look at some expert advice to help you with your particular study area challenges, if

any, complete the exercise below.

                                                   UNIT 2, EXERCISE 5.1

   PART A

   Describe your current study area at home-the good, the bad, the ugly. Be thorough.

   PART B

   Read what the experts advise in the article How to Make a Study Space and list as many ways
you think you can realistically improve, change, (or start over...) your study area. Remember, you
might not have the advantage of a whole room, or even a corner of a room, but there are still some
changes you can make to create a more effective study environment. Take notes from the article for
each of the "Parts" of an effective study area featured, as well as the "Tips" at the end. Organize
your list, titled "How I Could Improve My Study Area," like this:

   Part 1:

                                                                    HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 41

TIPS FOR EFFECTIVE STUDY GROUPS
The list of tips linked in Exercise 5.2, below, is more for organizing the group itself, not just the
location and equipment. Study groups, whether meeting in a dorm, the library (check your library to
see if there are rooms you can reserve for this purpose), a coffee shop, or somewhere else, usually
find what is convenient. What this lesson concerns are the dynamics of the group itself. That is, how
to ensure that a study group does not devolve into more of a socializing occasion. The tips offered
here cover such topics as the steps to take, warnings, and things you will need.

                                                            UNIT 2, EXERCISE 5.2

             PART A: Study Area-Help Tran
           Create a plan for Tran, based on the recommendations, above, on how to organize a study are in
        her busy home where she lives with six members of her family.
           Tran is a first year college student from Vietnam. She has been in the U.S. with her family for
        three years and recently passed the English Language Learner classes at the topmost level, so now
        she looks forward to pursuing her degree in Business Management.

42 PHYLLIS NISSILA
   She lives with six other family members, her mother, father, grandmother, and three younger
siblings aged 14, 12, and 9. Their home is located right next door to the family restaurant. This
makes it convenient for Tran and her parents to work their regular shifts and to fill in if one or the
other is ill. Tran is also responsible at times to help her younger siblings with their homework and/
or take them to school and other activities if her parents are busy. This usually occurs at peak times
for customers in the restaurant. Her grandmother helps out when she can but arthritis flare-ups
prevent her from working as much as she would like.

   Tran does have a small bedroom to herself, but it also sometimes serves as a storage room for
restaurant supplies, mostly paper goods, so it can get crowded.

   She is anticipating setting up an effective homework/study area for what she knows will soon
become more of an intensive course load.

   PART B: Study Group-Help The Athletes
   Jeb, Andrew and Nelson are first year students at the university on sports scholarships: Jeb for
basketball, Andrew for tennis, and Nelson for track and field. They share an apartment near the
college sports complex. They are all taking Math 95 this term and realize that forming a study
group as their instructor encouraged everyone to do would really help them, too.
   One of the problems in getting a group going is that they are all big fans of ESPN and each one
favors a different sport, so the television tends to be on long-and loud.
   They also enjoy trying out all the restaurants in this southern city which is famous for having the
best barbecue joints in the nation. They have calculated that there are at least seven restaurants
nearby they want to get to know.
   And then there are those campus parties on Friday and Saturday nights...
   Although the men are highly motivated to eventually finish their degrees in business, culinary
arts, and economics, they could use some advice on how to form a useful study group-and how to
stick with it, particularly before their sports programs kick into high gear.

                                                                                                                                                   HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 43
TO THE INSTRUCTOR: OPTIONAL ASSIGNMENTS/ACTIVITIES/EXTRA CREDIT
OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNIT 2

OPTIONAL EXTRA CREDIT OPPORTUNITIES AND/OR GRADING ELEMENTS FOR UNIT
2

Here are some suggestions for additional course components and grading elements:

     · The Glossary of Terms in the back is good information for weekly quizzes, mid-term tests,
         and/or final exams.

     · See Exercise 2.2 for instructions on adding to the chart of procrastination challenges and how
         to solve them.

     · Lesson 2.1 on World View and Self Efficacy includes a reference to a listing of the various
         kinds of world views. Optional assignments might include:
               summarizing the kinds of world views
               writing a comparison/contrast of world views
               creating a chart of world views
               writing an historical perspective
               researching one specific world view

     · See Exercise 2.3 on creating a schedule. Students might experiment with two or three
         different kinds of schedules rather than just filling out one. When the schedules are
         completed, this might be a good opportunity for a peer review activity where students review
         each others' schedules and review for elements such as:
               enough relaxation or buffer times between obligations, study periods, etc.
               enough study time for each subject.
               having completed the rubric for the task: one full week, all tasks, color-coded.

     · To expand the Wrap-Up Activity for the lesson on graphic organizers and study cards (4),
         students can
               write one of the papers for which they have created graphic organizers.

     · After completing Exercise 5.1 on recommendations for a personal study area, students can
         design their ideal study area on graph paper.

     · After completing Exercise 5.1 students can create inspirational posters to personalize their
         study area.

     · After completing Exercise 5.1 students can investigate the great variety of white noise for
         studying YouTube videos and report on them.

READING APPRENTICESHIP APPROACH

"Books" by Hermann is in the Public     Most students entering college have not yet dealt with the level
Domain, CC0                          of difficulty involved in reading-and comprehending-scholarly
                                     textbooks and articles. The challenge may even surprise some who
                                     have pretty good reading and comprehension skills so far. Other
                                     students for whom reading has mostly consisted of social media,
                                     texts, forum chat rooms, and emails, find they are intimidated by
                                     the sheer amount of reading there is in college classes. There are
                                     other challenges as well, having to do with a variety of issues. To
                                     begin this unit, complete the "Reading Sample for Annotation,"
                                     below, to determine where your reading challenges might exist.

                                                   UNIT 3, EXERCISE 1.1

   Below is an excerpt from Wikipedia on the subject of reading comprehension. As you read it,
annotate for the relevant bulleted items, just below. You may not experience all of the listed items.

   You can highlight, circle, underline, and/or write notes in the margins. You will have fifteen
minutes to complete this exercise. Note that several of the terms in the excerpt are technical and
most people would not normally know them. These would be examples of items to circle or
highlight, not look up at this point.

   P.S. I tried to find something relevant, but "dry," if you know what I mean (no offense to the
wonderful author of this article).

       · words or terms you do not know or remember: you do not have to look them up now

       · where you may have lost your concentration (put a note next to the section)

       · where you had some confusion about meaning

       · where you became distracted by environmental issues such as noises, lighting, etc.

       · where you had to re-read for meaning

       · where you became frustrated with the reading material

       · where you felt restless

               Reading comprehension is defined as the level of understanding of a text/message. This understanding
            comes from the interaction between the words that are written and how they trigger knowledge outside
            the text/message. Comprehension is a "creative, multifaceted process" dependent upon four language
            skills: phonology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics.Proficient reading depends on the ability to
            recognize words quickly and effortlessly. It is also determined by an individual's cognitive development,
            which is "the construction of thought processes". Some people learn through education or instruction and
            others through direct experiences.

               There are specific traits that determine how successfully an individual will comprehend text, including
            prior knowledge about the subject, well-developed language, and the ability to make inferences. Having
            the skill to monitor comprehension is a factor: "Why is this important?" and "Do I need to read the entire
            text?" are examples. Lastly, is the ability to be self-correcting to solve comprehension problems as they
            arise.

                  Reading comprehension levels

               Reading comprehension involves two levels of processing, shallow (low-level) processing and deep
            (high-level) processing. Deep processing involves semantic processing, which happens when we encode
            the meaning of a word and relate it to similar words. Shallow processing involves structural and
            phonemic recognition, the processing of sentence and word structure and their associated sounds. This
            theory was first identified by Fergus I. M. Craik and Robert S. Lockhart.

                  Brain region activation

               Comprehension levels can now be observed through the use of a fMRI, functional magnetic resonance
            imaging. fMRIs' are used to determine the specific neural pathways of activation across two conditions,
            narrative-level comprehension and sentence-level comprehension. Images showed that there was less
            brain region activation during sentence-level comprehension, suggesting a shared reliance with
            comprehension pathways. The scans also showed an enhanced temporal activation during narrative levels
            tests indicating this approach activates situation and spatial processing.

                  History

               Initially most comprehension teaching was based on imparting selected techniques that when taken
            together would allow students to be strategic readers however in 40 years of testing these methods never
            seemed to win support in empirical research. One such strategy for improving reading comprehension is
            the technique called SQ3R: Survey, Question, Read, Recite, and Review that was introduced by Francis
            Pleasant Robinson in his 1946 book Effective Study.

               Between 1969 and to about 2000 a number of "strategies" were devised for teaching students to employ
            self-guided methods for improving reading comprehension. In 1969 Anthony Manzo designed and found
            empirical support for the ReQuest, or Reciprocal Questioning Procedure, it was the first method to
            convert emerging theories of social and imitation learning into teaching methods through the use of a
            talk rotation between students and teacher called cognitive modeling.[citation needed]

               Since the turn of the 21st century, comprehension lessons usually consist of students answering
            teachers' questions, writing responses to questions on their own, or both. The whole group version of this
            practice also often included "Round-robin reading", wherein teachers called on individual students to
            read a portion of the text. In the last quarter of the 20th century, evidence accumulated that the read-test
            methods were more successful assessing rather than teaching comprehension.[citation needed] Instead of
            using the prior read-test method, research studies have concluded that there are much more effective
            ways to teach comprehension. Much work has been done in the area of teaching novice readers a bank of
            "reading strategies," or tools to interpret and analyze text.[12]

               Instruction in comprehension strategy use often involves the gradual release of responsibility, wherein

48 PHYLLIS NISSILA
teachers initially explain and model strategies. Over time, they give students more and more
responsibility for using the strategies until they can use them independently. This technique is generally
associated with the idea of self-regulation and reflects social cognitive theory, originally conceptualized
by Albert Bandura.

   Vocabulary

   Reading comprehension and vocabulary are inextricably linked. The ability to decode or identify and
pronounce words is self-evidently important, but knowing what the words mean has a major and direct
effect on knowing what any specific passage means. Students with a smaller vocabulary than other
students comprehend less of what they read and it has been suggested that the most impactful way to
improve comprehension is to improve vocabulary.

   Most words are learned gradually through a wide variety of environments: television, books, and
conversations. Some words are more complex and difficult to learn, such as homonyms, words that have
multiple meanings and those with figurative meanings, like idioms, similes, and metaphors.

   Three tier vocabulary words

   Several theories of vocabulary instruction exist, namely, one focused on intensive instruction of a few
high value words, one focused on broad instruction of many useful words, and a third focused on
strategies for learning new word etc...

   Broad vocabulary approach

   The method of focusing of broad instruction on many words was developed by Andrew Biemiller who
argued that more words would benefit students more, even if the instruction was short and teacher-
directed. He suggested that teachers teach a large number of words before reading a book to students, by
merely giving short definitions, such as synonyms, and then pointing out the words and their meaning
while reading the book to students.The method contrasts with the approach by emphasizing quantity
versus quality. There is no evidence to suggest the primacy of either approach.

   Morphemic instruction

   The final vocabulary technique, strategies for learning new words, can be further subdivided into
instruction on using context and instruction on using morphemes, or meaningful units within words to
learn their meaning. Morphemic instruction has been shown to produce positive outcomes for students
reading and vocabulary knowledge, but context has proved unreliable as a strategy and it is no longer
considered a useful strategy to teach students. This conclusion does not disqualify the value in "learning"
morphemic analysis - prefixes, suffixes and roots - but rather suggests that it be imparted incidentally
and in context. Accordingly, there are methods designed to achieve this, such as Incidental Morpheme
Analysis.

   [...]

   Reciprocal teaching

   In the 1980s Annemarie Sullivan Palincsar and Ann L. Brown developed a technique called reciprocal
teaching that taught students to predict, summarize, clarify, and ask questions for sections of a text. The
use of strategies like summarizing after each paragraph have come to be seen as effective strategies for
building students' comprehension. The idea is that students will develop stronger reading comprehension
skills on their own if the teacher gives them explicit mental tools for unpacking text.

   Instructional conversations

   "Instructional conversations", or comprehension through discussion, create higher-level thinking
opportunities for students by promoting critical and aesthetic thinking about the text. According to
Vivian Thayer, class discussions help students to generate ideas and new questions. (Goldenberg, p. 317).

                                                                                                                                               HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 49
            Dr. Neil Postman has said, "All our knowledge results from questions, which is another way of saying that
            question-asking is our most important intellectual tool" (Response to Intervention). There are several
            types of questions that a teacher should focus on: remembering; testing understanding; application or
            solving; invite synthesis or creating; and evaluation and judging. Teachers should model these types of
            questions through "think-alouds" before, during, and after reading a text. When a student can relate a
            passage to an experience, another book, or other facts about the world, they are "making a connection."
            Making connections help students understand the author's purpose and fiction or non-fiction story.

                  Text factors

               There are factors, that once discerned, make it easier for the reader to understand the written text. One
            is the genre, like folktales, historical fiction, biographies or poetry. Each genre has its own characteristics
            for text structure, that once understood help the reader comprehend it. A story is composed of a plot,
            characters, setting, point of view, and theme. Informational books provide real world knowledge for
            students and have unique features such as: headings, maps, vocabulary, and an index. Poems are written
            in different forms and the most commonly used are: rhymed verse, haikus, free verse, and narratives.
            Poetry uses devices such as: alliteration, repetition, rhyme, metaphors, and similes. "When children are
            familiar with genres, organizational patterns, and text features in books they're reading, they're better
            able to create those text factors in their own writing."

THE READING APPRENTICESHIP (RA) APPROACH TO COMPREHENSION

Now to some strategies to help you with some typical college-level comprehension challenges as well
as some of your specific challenges identified in the previous exercise.

   This lesson focuses on a method called Reading Apprenticeship. It is based on the premise that
people who have become expert readers can assist learners by modeling what they have learned to
do. As explained in the text, Reading for understanding, How Reading Apprenticeship Improves Disciplinary
Learning in Secondary and College Classrooms, "One literacy educator describes the idea of the
cognitive apprenticeship in reading by comparing the process of learning to read with that of learning
to ride a bike. In both cases, a more proficient other is present to support the beginner, engaging the
beginner in the activity and calling attention to often overlooked or hidden strategies."

   This is a strategy that takes a metacognitive (how we think about how we think) approach to
comprehension, utilizing various strategies readers may already know they know how to do, then
adding even more. For example, most readers have learned to make predictions (think ahead to
the next stage of a plot in a mystery, for example), ask questions concerning meanings ("I wonder
about..."), visualize a scene being described, associate the material being read to some other material,
and, at the end, summarize the material (particularly if required to do so by an instructor or for a
paper).

   I like to call these our "hard drive" skills. Like a computer hard drive always humming in the
background doing its thing behind the scenes, our metacognitive skills have already been assisting
us as readers. We just don't usually talk about what we are doing, for example, "Well, by golly, now
I'm predicting what Godzilla will do to the poor villagers in about two scenes from now," we just
automatically predict, especially if we are familiar with characters and plot lines. For another example,
"I am now going to visualize this scene in graveyard when Hamlet comes across the deceased court
jester's skull in Act V, Scene 1." We just see it in our mind's eye.

LESSON 3.2: GETTING THE MOST OUT OF YOUR TEXTBOOKS

READING TEXTBOOKS: FRONT AND BACK MATTER

                          Before diving into every line of text in a textbook reading assignment, it is

                          helpful-and saves time-to find out, first, what resources the entire book has to

                          offer you. Then, as those chapter readings are assigned, it helps to first skim read

                          them for the big picture meaning.

                          Exercise 2.1 will help you find all the resources in your textbook-and some

                          textbooks have a lot more help in the front matter and back matter of the text

                          than you may realize. I always think of one Effective Learning student who,

                          when given this exercise to use on any textbook he had with him, picked his math

"Books" by                book. He was at that time re-taking that math class because he had failed it the
Clker-Free-Vector-Images  term before. As he did the exercise, he realized the back matter of the book
is in the Public Domain,  included an answer key for half of the problems for every exercise. "Had I known
CC0                       this last term," he said, "I would have passed!" See if you, too, find something

useful in your textbook that perhaps you didn't know was there, either.

Exercises 2.2 and 2.3 will then cover good strategies for skim reading specific chapters as well as a

strategy for getting the most out of graphics included in textbooks.

                                                   UNIT 3, EXERCISE 2.1

   Here is a list of several kinds of resources typically in the front of a textbook, known as "front

           Answer the following questions:

               1. Were there any surprises for you?
               2. How can you use the front and back matter in your text to help you with your

                    studies? (3 or 4 sentences)

SKIM READING TEXTBOOK CHAPTERS
Before doing a detailed reading of a textbook chapter, get the big picture by following these steps:

     · Similar to reading the Table of Contents for the entire book, read the Introduction or Chapter
         Overview, whichever the textbook features, for the main ideas and how they are divided.

     · Read the headings and sub-headings.
     · Note the graphics (charts, tables, illustrations, etc.).
     · Read the first one or two sentences in the paragraphs (the paragraph topic is sometimes

         covered in more than one sentence).
     · Read the last sentence in each paragraph which might be a paragraph summary.
     · Read the summary of the entire chapter, if given.
     · Read any sentence with boldface or italicized words or word groups in it which are usually

         either key ideas or a technical terms.
     · Stop when needed if you come across a complicated idea or topic and take a little more time

         to skim it until you understand it.
     · Skim the study questions, too. They will help you focus on key points.

                                                            UNIT 3, EXERCISE 2.2

                                                                                                                                                               HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 53
           Using the recommendations on how to skim through textbook chapters, do so with a textbook
        chapter of your choice. When you are finished, close the book and write about the following: write
        down as many of the main ideas of this chapter as you can remember by skim reading it. Try not to
        look back. When finished, check your work to make sure you have transcribed the information
        correctly.

READING GRAPHICS
                                        Listed below are various types of data found on most graphics, whether

                                     a pie chart, bar graph, line chart, or other type.
                                        The key to comprehending graphics and using them to get more

                                     meaning from a textbook chapter or an article, or to answer study
                                     questions, is to pay close attention to the typical elements of the graphic.
                                     Not every graphic includes all of the elements listed.
                                1. Title
                                2. Captions

                                4. Axis information (vertical information, or "Y" data, and horizontal
         information, or "X" data)
    5. Publication date (important for the most current information)
    6. Publisher (important for credibility)
    7. Labels
    8. Color (used to differentiate and compare data)
    9. Size (also used to represent comparisons)
  10. Spatial positions (helps for comparing and contrasting)
  11. Patterns represented by the content, itself, and
  12. Trends that appear more evident when viewing the visual representation of the data.
It is easy to overlook all of the information present in a graphic, so give yourself enough time to note
all the elements and their meanings before answering questions about them. Exercise 3.3 offers some
practice.

LESSON 3.3: PATTERNS AND CONTEXT CLUES

PATTERNS                      Knowing the pattern of an article, essay, or textbook chapter aids
                           comprehension. For each kind of writing certain clue words, also called linking
"Texture" by ZIPNON is in  and transition words, are used. They signal the direction the writer is taking.
the Public Domain, CC0     For example, when writing an essay with a contrast pattern the clue words
                           would include "in contrast," "although," "conversely," and "however". For
                           another example, writing to emphasize a point is often presented with clue
                           words such as "again," "as a matter of fact," and "for this reason." Below is a list
                           of common clue words used for various patterns in writing. Note: a passage
                           could include more than one pattern (Exercise 3.1 includes examples of this).

           4. Draw pictures of the characters, setting, and scenes in your story. This might make them more
        real as well as giving you more ideas for what to do next. It might also cause new appreciation for
        writing because you might soon realize you stink at art, therefore you'll want to get back to your
        story as soon as possible.

           6. Listen to some music, but try to match the music with the kind of writing you are working on.
        For example, if it's a mystery, pick something dark and worrisome with lots of organ music and
        cymbal crashing. if you are working on a peaceful scene, listen to something like "Flora Featherly's
        Greatest Oboe Hits," or something with a lot of flutes. If it's a romance, find an orchestral piece
        loaded with violins written in the nineteenth century. But if you are a writing crime detective
        drama, plug into a few tunes from the Goth-rock band "Shrapnel," in particular anything on their
        latest CD, "Scream Bloody Murder". Not only will it put you in the mood for blood, guts and gore
        but also it will likely keep you up nights out of fear-thus giving you more time to write!

CONTEXT CLUES

Besides clues to help you determine the pattern or genre of a reading selection, there are clues to
help you figure out the meaning of specific words that are unfamiliar to you. Here are the five most
common:
1. Definition/Explanation Clues: sometimes the meaning of a word or phrase is given right after its
use.
Example: Taxidermy, the art of preparing, stuffing, and mounting the skins of animals (especially
vertebrates) for display or for other sources of study, is popular among museum curators.
2. Restatement/Synonym Clues: sometimes a word is presented in a simpler way.
Example: Stuffing dead animals has been a dream of Stedman Nimblebody, author of Taxidermy
Through the Ages, ever since his pet snake died when Steddie was six years old. He still misses Mr.
Scaly Face.
3. Contrast/Antonym Clues: sometimes the meaning of a word is clarified by presenting a word or
phrase opposite of its meaning.
Example: Little Steddie wanted to visit the Taxidermy Museum but the rest of the family preferred a
trip to the Zoo to see live animals.
4. Inference/General Context Clues: sometimes the meaning of a word or phrase is in the
surrounding sentences, or must be inferred or implied by the general meaning of a selection.
Example: When Steddie finally got the chance to visit the Taxidermy Museum, he was very excited.
He even found a stuffed snake that looked exactly like Mr. Scaly Face! "Just think," he exclaimed to

58 PHYLLIS NISSILA
his parents, "If Mr. Scaly Face was stuffed, I could still tease the cat and the dog with him!"
5. Punctuation: the correct use of punctuation helps a reader get the meaning of a term, phrase, or
thought. Likewise, incorrectly placed or missing punctuation sometimes gives an entirely different
and incorrect meaning across.
Example:
Missing punctuation: Is it time to eat Grandma?
Corrected: Is it time to eat, Grandma?

                    UNIT 3, EXERCISE 3.2

There are many examples online of punctuation errors in signs that change the meaning. Create

a chart such as the one below for 5 of the signs that you really like.

LESSON 3.4: CLOSE READING FOR LITERATURE

CLOSE READING

                                                In addition to using reading comprehension skills such as

                                                predicting, visualizing, "talking to the text," skimming a

                                                textbook before reading, and noting patterns and context clues

                                                as featured in lessons one, two, and three, another strategy called

                                                "close reading" is helpful. This is popular with literature

                                                professors; however, the skills involved in close reading are

                                                applicable to any complex reading assignment.

                                                I usually begin my close reading instructions with a visual

                                                demonstration. Perhaps describing it here will help you, too.

"Books" by Wokandapix is in the Public Domain,     Since this kind of comprehension starts with knowing
CC0                                             nothing about the elements of a story, novel, poem, or essay, I

                                                stand with my arms spread wide.

I then discuss, briefly, each element of a work starting with the title as a place to begin

comprehension, while slowly moving my arms toward one another, a few inches per element.

Titles, for starters, particularly of non-fiction works, usually tell you precisely what the main idea,

or thesis, is. For example, a book about "The History of the Roman Empire" usually gives you just

that-the history of the Roman Empire.

This is not usually true, however, for works of fiction, for which inference is the key to

comprehension. For example, "Story of an Hour," by Kate Chopin, while it might seem to be

something about time, also suggests it is about something other than a clock ticking away seconds and

minutes, and indeed it is.

I next add the author, as this might aid comprehension. For example, most students are familiar

with Stephen King, who writes in the horror genre. Knowing this element brings the arms in a bit

closer as the reader will know to anticipate (and predict) a horror story with a lot of plot twists and

turns in some horrible ways. Prediction has begun.

Next, I briefly discuss how knowing about the remaining elements - plot, characters, and setting

- help the reader close in on meaning enough to be able to discuss the theme or themes of the work

with reasonable evidence to support one's conclusion.

This visual of the arms getting closer together can continue through a discussion of close reading

of small passages, individual sentences, and even specific words. Each level of careful attention and

thought helps a reader "read between the lines" when meaning is not overtly stated, when themes are

inferred rather than explained outright.

Exercises 4.1 and 4.2 demonstrate how we already engage in this kind of thinking-for different

purposes.

                                                   UNIT 3, EXERCISE 4.1
   Idioms are good examples of inference, or "reading between the lines." They also employ the
comparison skill called metaphor (comparing two things without using the terms "like" or "as").
   Write out as many meanings for the list of idioms, below, as you can.
   (Note: for international students: here is an additional reference list, if needed that includes
meanings).
   Some examples are:
   Keep it under your hat.
   Over the hill.
   Barking up the wrong tree.
   Paint the town red.
   Lion's share.
   Turned a deaf ear.
   Up a creek without a paddle.
   Eyes are bigger than your stomach.
   Put your nose to the grindstone.
   Keep your shoulder to the wheel.
   Running on empty.
   Too many irons in the fire.
   Spitting image.
   Born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
   Wild goose chase.
   Clear sailing.
   Walking on cloud nine.

                                                   UNIT 3, EXERCISE 4.2
   Captions and titles for pictures, art, and sculpture are also examples of the use of inference. At
Lane, we have a number of sculptures on the grounds as well as a small art gallery of student work.
Take a "mini field trip" around campus or if the weather is bad, access the list of art works at Lane.
Choose three artworks to re-name, using inference.

                                                                                                                                                   HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 61

           Cartoons, especially editorial cartoons, also make good use of inference skills.
           For the cartoon, below, answers the questions about each of its elements to get to the meaning.
        Cartoons, like other forms of art, include additional visual elements such as facial expressions, and
        setting. Many of us are able to comprehend cartoons within a few seconds just because we have so
        many inference skills already in our "hard drives," so to speak, but examining them now will be a
        good reminder of how to comprehend complex subject matter-by close examination of all of the
        elements.

FOR STUDYING

HOW TO STUDY MATH

                                                 Math is one of those subjects that many people struggle

                                                 with in college. One reason for this is that many students

                                                 haven't taken a math class for a few-or many-years and math

                                                 is one subject that, as the old expression goes, "if you don't

                                                 use it, you lose it." This isn't always the case, of course. Some

                                                 people with more "logical/mathematical intelligence"

                                                 (remember Gardner's Multiple Intelligences from Unit 1?)

"Math" by Pixapopz is in the Public Domain, CC0  enjoy math and seem to easily transition to college level math
                                                 courses, or at least may not have to take preparatory classes

                                                 beforehand.

For everyone, however, no matter what the level of math or interest (or lack thereof), there are a

number of steps that will help a student achieve greater success. The exercise below will help with

this process.

                                            UNIT 3, EXERCISE 5.1

1. Read the article How to Study Math. The article features 12 Steps in the study
    process, 7 Tips that include perspectives to ease common stressors along with a few
    memory helps and some encouragement, 4 Warnings for further advice and
    encouragement, and a list of things you will need.

2. From all of the advice given in the article, make a list of your personal "Top Twenty
    Tips for Success in Math Classes".

HOW TO STUDY SCIENCE

In a previous lesson, we covered some basics when it comes to getting the most out of any textbook.
However, science textbooks-and science itself-present a bit more of a challenge. In this subject, there
are a lot of specialized words, symbols, and formulas to comprehend and memorize. The following
exercise will help you discover your own methods and techniques.

                                                              HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 63

               1. In a search engine such as Google, type in the key words "how to learn science

                    words, symbols, and formulas." Add "YouTube" if you prefer to learn from video
                    presentations. Sample search results: "how to memorize the Periodic Table of
                    Elements," "how to write word equations for chemical reactions," "word equations
                    examples," and so on. Scroll through a few pages of these, narrowing your search by
                    looking for subjects you are interested in such as medicine, psychology, biology, botany,
                    anthropology, archaeology, etc.
               2. From what you found, above, create a list of five resources. Include a very brief
                    summary of the information presented in the resources, and how you think the
                    resources can help you. It might help you organize your thoughts by making a chart
                    such as this:

Here are some suggestions for additional course components and grading elements:

     · The Glossary of Terms in the back is good information for weekly quizzes, mid-term tests,
         and/or final exams.

     · To supplement the "Close Reading" lesson, students can clip editorial cartoons from local
         newspapers and analyze them according the elements listed in exercise 4.3.

     · For that same lesson, students can explore other artwork on campus and come up with titles
         and/or captions.

     · The instructor may wish to take students on a "close reading" journey by using a poem she or
         he is familiar with. Here are three poems I have used, but there are limitless numbers of good
         poems for this exercise:
               Asphodel, That Greeny Flower and Other Love Poems by William Carlos Williams
               "Autobiography in Five Short Chapters," by Portia Nelson
               "Mushrooms," by Sylvia Plath

RUBRIC FOR THE TAKE-HOME MID-TERM PORTFOLIO PROJECT DUE AFTER
THE COMPLETION OF UNITS 1-3

Here are the requirements for the two Portfolio Projects. One will serve as the take-home mid-term
that covers Units 1-3, and the other will serve as the take-home final that covers Units 4-6.
TASK #1
Write a letter to yourself in which you summarize the tips, strategies, and skills learned in each of the
first three Units that you believe will help you the most in your educational career. The letter should
be typed and double-spaced, approximately 3 pages in length (750-900 words), and cover the material
from the lessons on:

     · Three Learning Styles

     · Comprehending and Studying Math and Science

It will be scored on the basis of thoroughness and details.
   Possible 50 Points

TASK 2
This is the creative response task. Choose from among the options below. Your creation should
feature tips, strategies, and skills you wrote about in Task #1. It will also be scored on thoroughness
and details.

   Possible 50 Points

     · Choose a different creative response for each Portfolio Project. You can also make your own

         proposal for a creative response and get permission from the instructor. NOTE: for any
         option involving a presentation or performance, be sure to check with me regarding time
         allotments if this is a class setting.
     · Some options are more creative than others; some require specific skills, for example, #s 3 and
         7. Others are more "academic," for example, #19. Some require certain talents or hobby
         interests, for example, #s 5, 6, and 9.

The hope is that you have an opportunity to exercise your talents and skills a little more and have
some fun while exploring a variety of different ways to apply your learning.

LESSON 4.1: NOTE-TAKING PART 1, LISTENING

NON-VERBAL COMMUNICATION

   When we think about listening we think about, well, hearing sounds via the
ears. However, when it comes to listening in order to pick up key points for
note-taking, it takes more than just hearing. In this case, it takes a "critical ear,"
that is, absorbing key points by noticing not only the words spoken, but also
by noting tones, volume and even the body language that goes along.
Additionally, being an active listener increases a note-taker's chances of
getting the information needed. Exercise 1 illustrates common non-verbal
communication.

        closer attention. It might be from these examples, or something quite different. For example, an
        instructor might move close to the front row and fold his/her arms to indicate that what he or she
        will be saying is of a more serious nature. For another example, if he or she moves toward the
        white board to write something, it's probably key information.

ACTIVE LISTENING
In previous units, we covered ways that students can actively engage in the learning process in order
to get the most out of their education. There are ways to actively listen as well, in order to get the
most out of lectures and, more importantly, take all of the notes that might be required. The video in
the next exercise covers several active listening strategies along with why we sometimes have
difficulty listening.

   PART A
   Watch the 7minute TED talk 5 ways to listen better and answer the following questions:

      1. What 3 types of listening does the speaker discuss?
      2. How and why have we been "losing our ability to listen," as the speaker suggests? He

           cites 5 ways.
      3. What are the 5 tools we can use to listen better?

LESSON 4.2: NOTE-TAKING PART 2, KEY INFORMATION AND FORMATS

   Perhaps the most useful learning tools of all are notes taken
from both lectures and course materials. By annotating for key
information, then condensing it, students not only create
personalized summaries but also aid their memory by using
both visual and kinesthetic learning styles. Add auditory, too,
if the notes are taken from a lecture or video.

   Often, students are unsure about what constitutes "key
information." Here is a list of items to highlight or annotate for
in textbooks and a list of items to listen for in lectures.

KEY INFORMATION IN TEXTBOOKS                                        "Notes" by English106 is licensed under CC BY 2.0

In addition to paying attention to all the items listed in Lesson 3.2, Getting the Most Out of Your
Textbooks, the following elements of a textbook chapter are especially important in helping you
discern key information:

· Introductions

· Summaries

· Study questions

· Topic sentences (as the speaker in the video on "Skim Reading," exercise 3.2, also in Lesson 3.2
   notes: sometimes the reader has to read the first two or even three sentences of a paragraph or
   section to get the entire main topic).

· Anything that is bolded, or in some other way set off from the default print size and style.
   Sub-topic titles are good examples of this.

· "Side bars," which are boxes of related information. These might include statistics, brief
   biographies of authors or persons of note related to the chapter content, price points on
   brochures for businesses, charts, graphs, photographs, and/or illustrations. They are typically
   a different color or in some other way set off for attention but not as the focal point of the
   text. Pay attention to the captions or legends that might accompany graphics. In this e-text,
   the exercises are set apart in side bars.

· Glossary terms that may be incorporated in the margins or otherwise set apart.

· Some textbooks include outlines of each chapter's main points in the introductory section.

KEY INFORMATION IN LECTURES

As the lecturer, live or video, presents the material, there are two types of key information cues to be
aware of.

74 PHYLLIS NISSILA
NONVERBAL CUES
As covered in the previous lesson on listening skills, a speaker will often have unique facial and body
nonverbal cues that alert you to several things, as you learn to "read" your professor:

     · Stances or movements that alert you to when he/she will shift to a different topic or subtopic.
     · Other cues that alert you to when the information is of special significance (including verbal

         clues, below).
VERBAL CLUES

     · Pay attention to when the speaker uses any of the transition clues used in reading
         comprehension, as listed in Lesson 3.3, context clues. Click on common clue words for a
         separate list.

     · Many speakers also announce when they are adding information or changing topics in
         various other ways.

For tips on how to deal with fast talkers, when you should NOT take notes, what note-taking formats
work well, and other advice, complete the exercise below.

                                                            UNIT 4, EXERCISE 2.1
           There are, of course, as many ways to take notes as there are note-takers with creative minds!
        For this exercise, do an online search using the key words, "fun and creative ways to take notes
        YouTube." Preview as many as you like. Pick one (these are all fairly short), then take notes on it (!)
        in the creative way suggested. Be sure to cite the YouTube source (title and URL) in your notes.

                                 TECHNIQUES; UNIT TERMS

           Memorization has gotten a bad rap recently. Lots of students, and even some educators, say that being able
        to reason is more important than knowing facts; and besides, why bother committing things to memory when
        you've got Google? My response to this - after I've finished inwardly groaning - is that of course reasoning is
        important, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't know facts as well. It's not like you have to choose between
        one or the other. Besides, facts give you a foundation on which to reason about things. Stephanie Weisman

LESSON 5.1: MEMORY MODEL AND TECHNIQUES

                         This lesson incorporates a view of the memory cycle from initial input to long-
                      term storage, along with memory principles and techniques.

                         For starters, take a pre test to asses what memory techniques you already use.

                      AN INFORMATION PROCESSING MODEL

                      Once information has been encoded, we have to retain it. Our brains take the

                      encoded information and place it in storage. Storage is the creation of a permanent

"Sweet Memories" by   record of information.
`Playingwithbrushes'     In order for a memory to go into storage (i.e., long-term memory), it has to pass

                      Long-Term Memory. These stages were first proposed by Richard Atkinson and

                      Richard Shiffrin (1968). Their model of human memory is based on the belief that

we process memories in the same way that a computer processes information.

           While reading through the article linked here, "Atkinson-Shiffrin model of memory" answer the
        following questions.

           SENSORY INPUT
           1. If you are just walking along somewhere and pass by the usual sights, sounds, smells, etc.,
        about how long do you think you would remember what you just took in by your senses? (Note:
        nothing out of the ordinary happens.)
           2. If you do nothing at all to help you remember what you just took in by your senses, about how
        many discrete units (pieces) of data (or input, i.e., sights, sounds, smells, etc.) would you be able to
        remember for the brief period of time?
           WORKING MEMORY (ALSO KNOWN AS SHORT TERM MEMORY)
           3. Now, If you immediately begin to try to remember the input for later (for example, you notice
        you just passed a shop you've been meaning to go to, or you smell something really good coming
        from a restaurant that reminds you of something you like), about how many items could you then
        remember?
           4. How long could you keep them in your memory by just using one or two memory techniques,
        such as associating them with something (like a memory)?
           LONG TERM MEMORY
           5. About how many items can you keep in your "permanent" memory storage?
           6. How long can you keep them there?
           RELATED QUESTIONS
           7. Why is "cramming" new information the night before a test not a good idea? Go beyond the
        information in the article to common sense issues.

Memory and Age-Good News!

                                        Recent studies on the age range of college students reveals that more

                                        older learners are attending both universities and community colleges.

                                        For four-year programs, the average age is 25. For community college,

                                        it is 29. The age range has steadily increased from the year 2000. In

                                        many classes at Lane, it is quite common to have students in their

                                        forties, fifties, even sixties. There are, of course, myriad reasons for

                                        people entering or re-entering higher education that include the state

"Digital literacy training for senior   of the economy, changed work and family situations, and veterans

Access is licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0   Many of my older students especially look forward to the topic of
                                        memory covered in Effective Learning. They cite the usual concerns

around an aging brain. But there is good news! The article featured in exercise 1, linked below,

covers what changes about the memory as we age, what kinds of memory age does affect and what

kind stays the same, and 8 ways to help the memory.

                                                   UNIT 5, EXERCISE 2.1

   1. Read the article "People Over 40: Learning and Memory," by Dan Hodges. It is Study Tip #16,
page 42, on the PDF file with all of the rest of the Tips. You will need to scroll down.

   2. Write a letter of help and encouragement based on Hodges' advice to Cathy who is 50 and just
now entering community college after raising three children and one grandchild. In the letter,
cover at least 10 suggestions for her. Cathy has always had a dream to pursue a Culinary Arts
degree and open a healthy foods restaurant. She is concerned, however, about being able to
memorize all of the material in her required courses. She is worried about her decreasing ability to
remember names and faces right away, and the fact that it seems to take her longer to learn new
things. She is quite confident of comprehending and passing classes related to her major because
she has been a "foodie" as far back as she can remember. She has also won many awards for her
cooking and baking at the county fair over the years. However, she hasn't had a math or writing
class since high school, and those are her big concerns.

PRE-TEST STRATEGIES

   Q: When should you start preparing for the first test?
Circle...

1. The night before.
2. The week prior.
3. The first day of classes.

If you answered "3. The first day of classes," you are correct. If

you circled all three, you are also correct. Preparing to pass      "Anxiety" by HAMZA BUTT is licensed under CC
tests is something that begins when learning begins and             BY 2.0
continues all the way through to the final exam.

Many students, however, don't start thinking about test taking, whether weekly exams, mid-terms,

or finals, until the day before when they engage in an all-nighter, or cramming. From the previous

unit on memory, you might recall that the brain can only process an average of 5-7 new pieces of

information at a time. Additionally, unless memory devices are used to aid memory and to cement

information into long term memory (or at least until the test is over tomorrow!) chances are slim that

students who cram will effectively learn and remember the information.

Additionally, a lot of students are unaware of the many strategies available to help with the test-

taking experience before, during, and after. For starters, take a look at what has helped you so far.

88 PHYLLIS NISSILA
MID-TEST STRATEGIES

Here is a list of the most common-and useful-strategies to survive this ubiquitous college
experience. Note: the important topic of test anxiety will be covered separately, in lesson 6.2.

     · Scan the test, first, to get the big picture of how many test items there are, what types there are
         (multiple choice, matching, essay, etc.), and the point values of each item or group of items.

     · Determine which way you want to approach the test:
               Some students start with the easy questions first, that is, the ones they immediately
                  know the answers to, saving the difficult ones for later, knowing they can spend the
                  remaining time on them.
               Some students begin with the biggest-point items first, to make sure they get the most
                  points.

     · Determine a schedule that takes into consideration how long you have to test, and the types of
         questions on the test. Essay questions, for example, will require more time than multiple
         choice, or matching questions.

     · Keep your eye on the clock.

     · If you can mark on the test, put a check mark next to items you are not sure of just yet.
               It is easy to go back and find them to answer later on.
               You might just find some help in some other test items covering similar information.

     · Sit where you are most comfortable. That said, sitting near the front has a couple of
         advantages:
               You may be less distracted by other students.
               If a classmate comes up with a question for the instructor and there is an important
                  clarification given, you will be better able to hear it and apply it, if needed.

     · Wear ear plugs, if noise distracts you.

     · You do NOT have to start with #1! It you are unsure of it, mark it to come back to later on.

     · Bring water...this helps calm the nerves, for one, and water is also needed for optimum brain
         function.

     · If permitted, get up and stretch (or stretch in your chair) from time to time to relieve tension
         and assist the blood to the brain!

     · Remember to employ strategies to reduce test-taking anxiety (covered in the next lesson)

     · If despite all of your best efforts to prepare for a test you just cannot remember the answer to
         a given item for multiple choice, matching, and/or true/false questions, employ one or more
         of the following educated guessing (also known as "educated selection") techniques. By using
         these techniques, you have a better chance of selecting the correct answer.
               It is usually best to avoid selecting an extreme or all-inclusive answer (also known as
                  100% modifiers) such as "always," and "never". Choose, instead, words such as "usually,"
                  "sometimes," etc. (also known as in-between modifiers).

                                                                                                                                                               HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 89
               Although there is some dispute about this, it is still safe to say that choosing "C" is often
                  correct.

               If the answers are numbers, choose one of the middle numbers.
               If you have options such as "all of the above," or "both A and B," make sure each item is

                  true before selecting those options.
               Choose the longest, or most inclusive, answer.
               Make sure to match the grammar of question and answer. For example, if the question

                  indicates a plural answer, look for the plural answer.
               Regarding matching tests: count both sides to be matched. If there are more questions

                  than answers, ask if you can use an answer more than once.
               Pay close attention to items that ask you to choose the "best" answer. This means one

                  answer is better or more inclusive than a similar answer.
               Read all of the response options.

POST-TEST STRATEGIES

In addition to sighing that big sigh of relief, here are a few suggestions to help with future tests.

     · If you don't understand why you did not get an item right, ask the instructor. This is especially
         useful for quizzes that contain information that may be incorporated into more inclusive
         exams such as mid-terms and finals.

     · Analyze your results to help you in the future; for example,
               See if most of your incorrect answers were small things such as failing to include the
                  last step in a math item, or neglecting to double-check for simple errors in a short-
                  answer or essay item.
               See where in the test you made the most errors: beginning, middle, or end. This will
                  help you pay closer attention to those sections in the future.

                                                            UNIT 6, EXERCISE 1.3

           Write a letter of advice to Chen incorporating 10 test-taking tips and strategies you think will
        help him.

           Chen believes he is good at organization, and he usually is-for about the first two weeks of
        classes. He then becomes overwhelmed with all of the handouts and materials and tends to start
        slipping in the organization department. When it comes to tests, he worries that his notes might
        not cover all of the right topics and that he will not be able to remember all of the key terms and
        points-especially for his math class. During tests, he sometimes gets stuck on an item and tends to
        spend too much time there. He also sometimes changes answers but finds out later that his

90 PHYLLIS NISSILA
original selection was correct. Chen is also easily distracted by other students and noises which
makes it hard for him to concentrate sometimes, and, unfortunately, he does admit to occasionally
"cramming" the night before.

                                                                                                                                                   HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 91
LESSON 6.2: HANDLING TEST ANXIETY

Most people experience some form of anxiety when it comes to taking

tests. Sweaty palms, heart palpitations, mental block, and other forms of

normal test anxiety may surface before, during, even after taking tests

(see the end of this lesson for a more complete list).

This entire class is, of course, designed to help alleviate test stress by

offering numerous strategies and perspectives when it comes to general

preparation for and participation in academia. However, there are some

specific helps to subdue the stress as well. NOTE: the type of test anxiety

or stress referenced here is not of a clinical nature requiring medical      "Overcoming Math Anxiety" by
and/or counseling treatment.                                                 wecometolearn is licensed under CC

   To help you come up with your own, customized plan of test stress

reduction, complete the following exercise. The articles cited cover such

essentials as what might be influencing your worry about test taking, methods to help you feel safe

during a test, and what to do in a major anxiety attack.

1. Read "How to Deal With Exam Anxiety".
2. Write about

             what influences you with regard to test anxiety,
             some methods Hodges' presents that you believe would benefit you,
             how you might alleviate a lack of safety around test taking that you might

                experience, and
             some ideas you would like to keep in mind should you ever experience more

                challenging anxiety attacks during tests, especially finals and/or State Board
                exams.

3. Write about 250-300 words or one page.

"How to Deal With Exam Anxiety" offers a long list of normal test taking anxiety symptoms:

   Anxiety is not only an emotional state; it produces physical symptoms that you can identify if you know
   what to look for. If you experience any of the following symptoms when studying or thinking about a test,
   this would be a tell tale sign that you're feeling anxiety.

· Headaches.
· Dry mouth.
· Rapid heartbeat. Usually a heart rate above 100 beats per minute characterizes a rapid heartbeat.
· Sweating.
· Shortness of breath.
· Light-headedness.
· Extreme body temperature, either excessively hot or cold.
· Gastrointestinal discomfort. This can be characterized by nausea, diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal

   pain.

LESSON 6.3: UNDERSTANDING TEST ITEMS

TEST ITEMS

   There are several common kinds of test items. For objective tests,
students answer multiple choice questions, matching items, and fill-
in-the-blank items. The other kind of test items are short-answer
responses and essays. The following are explanations and examples
of these along with tips for educated guessing, if applicable-after all,
sometimes even though we study hard, a bit of test anxiety might
cause a sudden mental block!

MULTIPLE CHOICE TEST ITEMS                                                "Target" by Freeimages9 is in the Public
EXPLANATION:                                                              Domain, CC0

These test items offer several answer choices. The test prompt (or question) is known as the "stem"
for which you choose one or more of the answer options.

   Examples:
   1. A simile is

· a comparison without using "like"
· a comparison using the word "as"
· a comparison using either "like" or "as"
· none of the above

2. Memory devices include

· acronyms
· inference
· acrostics
· associations
· 1, 3, and 4
· all of the above

TIPS

Make sure that all the rules of grammar apply when you match the stem with the option. for example,
in example item number 2, above, notice that them stem directs you to look for a plural answer
because "devices" is plural. Number 5, then, is the correct answer (answers 1, 3, and 4 are all plural).

94 PHYLLIS NISSILA
EDUCATED GUESSING

· Choose "3" or C, which is more often than not the correct answer (as in example item number
   1, above).

· Choose the longest or most inclusive answer, also as in example item number 1, above.

· If the test item is for a math quiz, choose the in-between number, or one of the in-between
   numbers. example: 1) 432, 2) 77, 3) 12, 4)2,098. Your chances are better by choosing either 1
   or 2.

MATCHING TEST ITEMS

EXPLANATION

This kind of test item features two columns, a numbered column and a lettered column. Students are
asked to match the correct answer with the correct stem.

EXAMPLE

1. NASA                        ___organization device
2. headache                   ___acronym
3. graphic organizer          ___symptom of test anxiety

TIPS

Count the number of items in each column. If there are more on one side, ask if an answer can be used
more than once.

FILL-IN-THE-BLANK TEST ITEMS

EXPLANATION

These are items for which you must fill in a word or words.

EXAMPLE

Fill in the ____________ questions are featured frequently on exams.

TIPS

Fill-in-the-blank questions usually expect you to write one word per blank. If more than one word is
expected, there will be more than one blank space or the blank will be long.

SHORT ANSWER TEST ITEMS

EXPLANATION

This type of test item usually involves a short answer of approximately 5-7 sentences. Typical short

                                                                      HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 95
answer items will address only one topic and require only one "task" (see "essay test items," below, for
a test item requiring more than one task).

EXAMPLE

Define the term "mnemonic."

TIPS

Since many short answer test items ask the student to define a term, here are several ways to expand a
definition to achieve the 5-7 sentence desired response (depending upon the course and the teacher's
requirements, that is):

     · the dictionary definition
     · an informal definition (in your own words, for example)
     · give an example of how the term is used
     · give the category in which the term is used, for example, what kind of essays belong in the

         "expository" genre (argument, explanation, cause and effect, etc.)
     · the history (etymology) of the term
     · include antonyms
     · include synonyms
     · tell what the term is not (some terms mean more than one distinct thing, for example, a

         "whatchamacallit is not only a slang term but also a candy bar.

ESSAY TEST ITEMS

EXPLANATION

This type of test is usually a multi-part prompt requiring several paragraphs or pages to answer. You
can make use of writing formulas, for example how to write a basic, five-paragraph essay suitable for
most classes. However, for writing classes the task will be expanded as per the type of writing class
and the level of writing sophistication required.

EXAMPLE

Contrasted with short answer items where usually one task is required to fully answer them (such as
a simple definition), there are typically several tasks required to fully answer an essay prompt. For
example in the following prompt below, I have underlined all of the tasks and decisions required to
fully address the prompt:

   Many people believe Mark Twain's book Huckleberry Finn is racist and should not be included on high
school reading lists. Others believe that Twain correctly portrayed race relations in the Southern part of the
United States in the latter part of the nineteenth century, and, in fact, by telling the story he exposed the negative
racial attitudes existing then. Do you think the book should be kept on reading lists? Explain why or why not in
relation to today's emphasis on "political correctness."

96 PHYLLIS NISSILA
TIPS
     · Review terms often used in essay exams before taking the exam:
               compare-show similarities between items
               contrast-show differences between items
               sometimes both comparing and contrasting is required
               define-give a concise meaning (see how to expand definitions, above)
               describe-recount, characterize, or relate information in narrative form
               discuss-examine, analyze, and present pros and cons regarding the topic. Detail is
                  essential
               enumerate-incorporate (which might require listing or outlining) major points in
                  order
               explain-clarify and interpret the material including explaining how and/or why. Detail
                  is essential
     · Do NOT merely summarize the plot of the work if this is an essay for an English class or a
         literature class.

                                                            UNIT 6, EXERCISE 3.1
           List how many tasks need to be accomplished in order to fully respond to the essay prompt
        below, or another one your instructor will provide for you.
           Select a novel or a play and, focusing on one symbol, write an essay analyzing how that symbol functions
        in the work and what it reveals about the themes of the work as a whole.

     · Watch the video "Best 10 Foods That Help In Enhancing Your Brain Power" and create a
         menu for any combination of meals the day before and/or day of the test. If you are a "foodie,"
         come up with your own dishes. If not, do a search for ideas by using an Internet search engine
         to type in the main ingredients (two or more) and add which meal: breakfast, lunch, snack,
         dinner.

RUBRIC FOR THE TAKE-HOME FINAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT DUE AFTER
COMPLETION OF UNITS 4-6

Here are the requirements for the two Portfolio Projects. One will serve as the take-home mid-term
that covers Units 1-3, and the other will serve as the take-home final that covers Units 4-6.

TASK #1

Write a letter to yourself in which you summarize the tips, strategies, and skills learned in each of
the second three Units that you believe will help you the most in your educational career. The letter
should be typed and double-spaced, approximately 2 pages in length (550-600 words), and cover the
material from the lessons on:

     · Listening
     · Note-taking
     · Memory (models and mnemonics)
     · Memory as we age
     · Test-taking: pre test
     · Test-taking: mid test
     · Teat-taking: post test
     · Handling test anxiety
     · Understanding test items (objective tests, short answer items, and essays)

It will be scored on the basis of thoroughness and details.
   Possible 50 Points

TASK 2

This is the creative response task. Choose from among the options below. Your creation should
feature tips, strategies, and skills you featured in Task #1. It will also be scored on thoroughness and
details.

   Possible 50 Points

     · Choose a different creative response for each Portfolio Project. You can also make your own
         proposal for a creative response and get permission from the instructor. NOTE: for any
         option involving a presentation or performance, be sure to check with me regarding time
         allotments if this is a class setting.

     · Some options are more creative than others; some require specific skills, for example, #s 3 and
         7. Others are more "academic," for example, #19. Some require certain talents or hobby

                                                                                                                                                               HOW TO LEARN LIKE A PRO! 99
         interests, for example, #s 5, 6, and 9.

The hope is that you have an opportunity to exercise your talents and skills a little more and have
some fun while exploring a variety of different ways to apply your learning.

FOR LESSON 2.2 GRAPHIC ORGANIZER FOR NARRATIVE, PROCESS, AND CAUSE
AND EFFECT PAPERS
What is your thesis? What is your topic statement? For a Narrative: 1. Starting on the left-hand side,
begin with the first major detail and add the remaining details (whether four or many more, simply
add squares) in chronological order. For Two Kinds of Cause and Effect Papers: 1. Starting on the
left-hand side, square one is the CAUSE and the remaining squares represent the EFFECTS. 2. If
the paper is organized the opposite way, the first square represents the EFFECT and the remaining
squares represent the CAUSES. 3. If the cause/effect paper is a chain reaction, follow instructions #1
and organize the subsequent effects in chronological order.
