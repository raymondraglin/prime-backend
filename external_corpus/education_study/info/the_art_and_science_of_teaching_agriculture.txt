FOREWORD

Keep Growing: How Inspiring Leaders Grow Themselves, Their
Educators, and Their Learners

A great leader is able to inspire a teacher to grow and develop from being mediocre to good, good to great.
This process requires a leader to be purposeful and intentional in their pedagogy; that's what The Art and
Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic Learning is all about.

As identical twin sisters and colleagues, Marla and I have been fortunate to share experiences in the same
profession of education. That's what we hope for you, too.

Although our areas of leadership have differed somewhat, what we have found is that our outcomes have
been similar due to our connected, culturally competent leadership style. We believe that cultural
competence is foundational to the art and science of teaching.

Becoming culturally competent is a journey. It is not a place where you land and stay. As situations arise you
move back and forth on a continuum. You don't become good at it and that's it. You strive to always grow to
be better.

Being a culturally competent leader means first, as leaders, that we come to the educational environment
with a firm sense of who we are, and that unless we are reflective about our own identity and how it creates a
lens through which we view the world, we will not be able to honor the identities of the learners and educators
we serve.

In order to develop great educators, a leader must listen deeply to those around them. We have found that
being purposefully aware and responsive, and listening to the broader learning community in ways that
ensures all community members feel valued, requires consistent work, but the results are certainly worth it.

In addition, inspiring leaders must (1) have organized goals for their teachers that are visionary, goal-driven,
innovative, and motivational, (2) possess professional skills such as being knowledgeable and communicative
and acknowledging the success of others, and (3) possess personal attributes such as enthusiasm and
integrity and being an active listener, respectful, and approachable. These qualities are no different from
what a leader wants to see in their educators, therefore these traits must be modeled.
x

A great, inspiring leader must keep their educators motivated so they inspire their learners. This is a
teacher's most important role and an essential part of their learners' overall success.

But keeping educators motivated can be challenging. Some suggestions for educational leaders are to:

 1. Respect them. Use positive, respectful language at all times and really listen to their concerns,
      thoughts, and ideas.

 2. Nurture greatness. By giving your teachers new ways to become better at what they do, you are
      constantly reminding them why they entered the profession in the first place. Hold high expectations for
      them and they will perform. Consider investing in more effective professional development to help you
      in this quandary.

 3. Give them a voice.The easiest way for teachers to lose motivation is when they have been quieted or not
      allowed to speak at all. Invite teachers to the table whether it be for representing their department or
      subject area at board meetings, or for giving their opinion about proposed strategies and visions. Even
      if they are not directly involved in particular meetings, having an open-door policy just to listen creates
      opportunities for educators to feel like they matter, even if they are not directly involved.

 4. Encourage collaboration. When teachers are given the opportunity to work together, this can
      significantly impact their motivation. More seasoned, experienced teachers may be recognized for their
      most successful teaching strategies. Younger or less experienced teachers can be given validation that
      what they are doing in their learning environments is working.

 5. Be available. Help your educators as much as possible by being available when they have a difficult
      situation or heavier workload.

 6. Say "thank you." Recognize the little things that teachers are doing. Everyone wants to feel valued.
      When we take the time to say "thank you," we are helping teachers stay motivated. You might also want
      to set aside time during staff meetings for other teachers to recognize their peers for recently doing
      something positive.

 7. Let them know you understand the stressful times.Try not to overload educators during those busier
      times of year. Try not to overburden them with new initiatives or professional development during
      report-writing periods, exam periods, preparation for parent-teacher conferences, or preparation for
      community-based events, to list a few examples. If there is any way you can lend a hand during these
      periods, whether it be helping with the county fair exhibit, cafeteria or recess duty, or room setup, then
      try to do so.

 8. Be resourceful. A leader who wants to help their staff become great must be available to offer
      suggestions along with resources. While answers aren't always at your fingertips, you must know how
      to help teachers move from the mediocre stage of teaching to good and even masterful! This requires
      leaders to create and continually develop a plethora of ideas and actual useful tools.

This textbook is one of those tools. The Art and Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic
Learning is written by professors who believe in both the art and the science of teaching. It is written from
hearts who are passionate about the holistic approach to learning environments. It is written by educators
who advocate for students to share partnership in the teaching and learning process. And it is written
by great leaders who combine decades of experience in educational environments in which they have
intentionally and strategically sought to inspire, motivate, and grow toward mastery in their art and science.
We hope you, like us, find yourselves fortunate to thrive in the profession of education.
Enjoy The Art and Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic Learning.

INTRODUCTION

The Art and Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic Learning is a collection of thoughts, best
practices, strategies, and techniques assembled from among the best teaching professors in agricultural
communication, education, and leadership in America. The editors have assembled the authors' mastery
work as a way for all of us to assist our aspiring teachers in grasping the fundamentals of solid, basic,
time-tested formal and nonformal teaching. Four Keys to Dynamic Learning simply means that we believe
there are four keys to teaching that must be present in the learning environment for learners to achieve at
their highest levels: Laying the Foundation, Connecting with Students, Designing Instruction, and Applying
Learning. Embedded within these dimensions are the unique aspects of both the art and the science of
teaching that are necessary for engaging learners in the teaching and learning process.

The Art and Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic Learning is brought to life in this book
by the selfless contributions of these authors, who, as researchers, have studied the teaching and learning
process, have implemented what they have learned, have modified their planning, delivery, and assessment,
and who are continuing their quest for mastery in their formal and nonformal learning environments.

Historically, across the country, preservice teacher education in the agricultural sciences has shared
common foundational principles. Traditionally, these shared principles have been, in part, perpetuated
through a common textbook used in many preservice teacher education methods courses in higher
education. Therefore, an objective of The Art and Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic
Learning is to provide a multiperspective resource for educators to use in preparing those who seek to teach
others. The goal is to positively influence the caliber of methods of instruction globally.

The text is organized around Four Keys that need to be considered when preparing educators to plan, deliver,
and assess learning: Laying the Foundation, Connecting with Students, Designing Instruction, and Applying
Learning.

Role of the Editors

We, the editors, combined our collective more than 100 years in education to read drafts, offer insights,
and challenge authors to think beyond traditional classrooms and into both formal and nonformal learning
environments. Therefore, it was important to us that the book's use in education not be limited to traditional
preservice classroom teacher preparation. One approach to accomplishing this was choosing verbiage such
as learning environments, educators, and learners to capture our spirit and intent in speaking to both formal
and nonformal education. We also read authors' examples through a lens of reaching our formal and
nonformal audiences so that all educators using the book would find examples for use in workshops,
seminars, field experiences, laboratories and other environments in which learners learn.
                                                                                                                                                       xiii

Throughout the process we stayed connected to each other as the chapters evolved. We read the document
holistically to assure one voice for the book, while maintaining the unique, individual voices that constitute
the heart of The Art and Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic Learning. We also read through
the drafts looking for three elements woven through the fabric of the chapters: diversity and inclusion,
assessment, and effective teaching.

Finally, to aid in our quest for a broad use of the book across formal and nonformal education, students
in a graduate teacher education program created sample personas of people they believed would be the
audience for the book. The personas served as a resource to assist the authors in focusing their writing and
messaging. Examples included but were not limited to the following personas.

Who Are the Authors?

We were purposeful and deliberate in our selection of the authors. We invited authors who were known
across the country as being excellent in their ability to plan, deliver, and assess teaching and learning. We
invited authors who were, at the time of invitation, nontenured, new assistant, or associate professors in
universities across the country. We intentionally combined coauthor teams across disciplines, backgrounds,
and areas of expertise. Finally, we sought authors who had achieved an earned recognition for the content
we were asking them to espouse in their chapter.

Unique Framing of the Chapters

As context for users of this book, our guidelines to authors, in an overly simplified approach, was for them to
capture on paper "the best class session you have ever taught on the topic you are capturing in your chapter."
Our ask, therefore, included:

   A practical scenario to which the intended audiences could relate, thereby aiding in setting the context
      for learning the content of the chapter.

   A clear objective for the outcome of learning the content, thereby providing clarity of expectation for
      the learner.

   A science- and theory-based grounding, thereby providing evidence of rigorous scrutiny of the content
      prior to adoption, but not with the intensity in writing of a journal publication. Instead, nonformal,
      relatable writing was sought.

   An application of the content, thereby offering learners opportunities for active engagement with the
      material.

   An assessment of the achievement of the objective, thereby giving learners and educators a reflective
      process for deciding the level of content attainment.

In addition, the editors asked the authors to use theory as a framework and to provide anecdotes from
personal experiences. The authors were asked to close each chapter with reflective questions for the
learner. These reflections are meant to be broader than the scope of the objectives to offer more holistic
reflection over the content of the chapter. We also asked the authors to include a glossary as well as a list of
commonly used resources for the audience to use in their teaching.

Finally, we asked the authors to weave every chapter through the tapestry of the following elements:

   Diversity and Inclusion
   Evaluation
   Effective Teaching
xvi

The Chapters

Part 1: Laying the Foundation

         1. The Discipline of Agricultural Education

         "The Discipline of Agricultural Education" provides a foundation for learning throughout the textbook
         by exploring what agricultural education is, why it exists, who it serves, and how it is delivered.

         2. Psychology of Learning

         "Psychology of Learning" digs into how learning occurs by introducing some essential learning
         theories and how teachers can apply these learning theories to help students who have unique
         learning styles and needs against the backdrop of societal norms in the United States. Theories tackle
         students' identities. Diversity and inclusion are discussed, alongside theories of learning.

         3. Principles of Teaching and Learning

         "Principles of Teaching and Learning" examines evidence-based concepts related to how students
         bring in and process information and explores foundational truths about teaching that can help
         students grasp new information, think critically, and retain content.

Part 2: Connecting with Students

         4. Learning as Problem Solving

         "Learning as Problem Solving" lays out problem-based instructional strategies that can help create
         unique opportunities to connect our content back to issues and problems in our local communities as
         well as statewide, nationwide, and worldwide.

         5. Inclusive Teaching

         "Inclusive Teaching" is intended to help educators begin the process of purposefully planning courses,

Summary

The Art and Science of Teaching Agriculture: Four Keys to Dynamic Learning is more than a book; it is a
collaboration of highly skilled and respected teaching professors sharing their thoughts, best practices,
strategies, and techniques about a topic they love. The book offers educators a solid foundation for building
confidence in planning, delivering, and assessing the depths of the variables inherent in a learning
environment. The editors wish for readers the ability to teach dynamically by designing and managing
learning environments using what we believe to be four keys to good teaching: Laying the Foundation,
Connecting with Students, Designing Instruction, and Applying Learning.

Keep teaching well!

1. THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL
EDUCATION

Wendy Warner and Aaron J. McKim

Setting the Stage

As a primer for this chapter, let's discuss why agricultural educators are essential. The following excerpt,
shared by a former student during their agriculture teacher's retirement celebration, helps illuminate the
importance of agricultural educators.

         "Before taking Ag classes, high school was uninspiring. I remember my first class, `Fundamentals of
         Agriscience,' it was so different from every other class at school. The more you let me experience,
         however, the more I felt at home in the ag room. Sure, the ideas and concepts you taught were interesting
         and important, but the way you treated me is what I remember the most. Somehow, you created a culture
         where I could be authentically myself at school. In your classes, I found my passion for animals, plants,
         and the environment. With every new FFA experience you pushed me toward, I became more prepared
         to lead. As my SAE expanded, so did my confidence that a career in agriculture was right for me. As I
         look back on everything you have done for me, every experience you provided, I know you changed my life
         for the better. You led me to my passion for agriculture and gave me tools to be successful in life. I am
         forever grateful for everything you have done for me and for all the students you impacted throughout
         your career."

Before reading on, take a moment to reflect on the legacy we hope to achieve as agricultural educators. As
we reflect on these goals, write down the impact we want to make throughout our careers.

Being agricultural educators gives us a platform to positively transform the lives of our students, the
communities in which we work, and various agricultural systems. We hope this book helps us discover
the impact we can have and empowers us with the skills and knowledge to achieve our desired legacy as
agricultural educators.
2 | THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

     Objectives

     The purpose of this chapter is to introduce our readers to agricultural education. More specifically, the
     objectives are to:

          Discuss the role of instruction, Future Farmers of America (FFA), and Supervised Agricultural Experience
             (SAE) in agricultural education.

          Distinguish between different types of agricultural education.
          Explore various perspectives as to why agricultural education exists.
          Consider who is served by agricultural education.
          Explain how agricultural education is delivered.
          Provide an overview of the textbook.

Introduction

This chapter lays the foundation for the textbook by providing an overview of agricultural education and
prompts consideration of what agricultural education is, why it exists, who it serves, and how it is delivered.
Throughout the remainder of the textbook, we will learn about and reflect on the four keys to a dynamic
learning environment. In part 1 of the textbook, we will be encouraged to think about how both the psychology
and the principles of teaching and learning influence how agricultural education is delivered. In part 2,
"Connecting with Students," we will consider how the use of problem solving, inclusive strategies, and the
classroom environment allows for a connection with our learners. As we progress through part 3, the focus
will be on "Designing Instruction" through intentional planning, delivery, and evaluation. We highlight
"Applying Learning" in part 4 when describing the inclusion of leadership development opportunities through
the FFA, the promotion of experiential and work-based learning through SAE, and the reinforcement of
research and inquiry-based learning in the various laboratories found in agricultural education.

Overview of the Discipline of Agricultural Education

What is Agricultural Education?

Instruction

Instruction in each school-based agricultural education (SBAE) program has uniquely adapted to meet the
needs of learners, the community, and local agricultural systems. These adaptations yield a rich variety
of SBAE programs throughout the country, in each state, and within different regions of each state. Two
examples of this diversity can be found in Michigan and North Carolina. SBAE instruction in the northern part
of Michigan, including the Upper Peninsula and the northern part of the Lower Peninsula, focuses on natural
resource management and forestry. For programs located in the southern half of the state, SBAE instruction
focuses more broadly on animal science, plant science, agribusiness, and leadership. In North Carolina, new
curricula have been developed and implemented to meet the interests and needs of a changing student
demographic as have the opportunities available across different parts of the state, especially with the
growth of agricultural programs in suburban and urban areas. Recently, courses in sustainable agricultural
production were introduced with a focus on the increasingly complex world of producing enough food and
fiber to meet the growing world demand and at the same time maintaining ecological balance and conserving
our natural resources (North Carolina Career and Technical Education, 2020).

Diversity in SBAE instruction, however, is not reserved for geographic differences. In fact, when we look
at the historical evolution of SBAE, we see differences in SBAE instruction due to changes in the learners,
communities, and agricultural systems. A 2017 publication by McKim et al. organized the history of
agricultural education in the United States into three categories, starting with the "Early Years of Agricultural
Education." This first phase included agricultural education occurring in the United States before the Smith-
Hughes Act, which formalized school-based agricultural education. Agricultural education in this time period
was primarily done through father-son apprenticeships with some private schools teaching agriculture. One
school emerging during this time was the Tuskegee Normal and Industrial School, opened in 1881 by Booker
T. Washington, which provided former slaves or descendants of slaves with a combination of academic,
social, and industrial training (Croom, 2007). The Hatch Act, which catalyzed experiment stations, shifted
instruction in SBAE to focus on the distribution of scientific agricultural knowledge being gained at
experiment stations to rural communities throughout the country. Instruction during the "Early Years of
Agricultural Education" was a unique blend of scientific agriculture and vocational (i.e., career) preparation.
4 | THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

The second phase of agricultural education in the United States was named the "Smith-Hughes Years of
Vocational Agriculture." This phase started in 1917 with the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act. During this
time period, agricultural education instruction was characterized by SBAE teachers preparing learners for
careers in farming. As education continued to evolve, tracking learners into either academic or vocational
routes became the norm, further distinguishing SBAE as a space for vocational preparation. Further, societal
changes encouraged SBAE instruction to prepare learners for a broader range of careers beyond farming,
including mechanics, horticulture, and natural resource management. SBAE instruction during the "Smith-
Hughes Years of Vocational Agriculture" was, as the name would suggest, vocational in nature.

The third phase of agricultural education has been named the "Current Focus on Agricultural Science."
This phase started in 1988 with the publication of A Nation at Risk: The Imperative for Educational Reform
and Understanding Agriculture: New Directions for Education. Noting additional core academic credits being
required for graduation from public high schools, the Understanding Agriculture publication suggested a
shift from vocational preparation to agricultural science to provide learners taking SBAE coursework with
science credit. Since 1988, SBAE instruction has trended toward the illumination of science concepts within
agriculture, food, and natural resources. Further, growing emphasis on science, technology, engineering,
and mathematics (i.e., STEM education) has expanded the interdisciplinary nature of SBAE. The "Current
Focus on Agricultural Science" phase, therefore, is defined by an emphasis on core subject (e.g., science)
illumination while maintaining a foothold in vocational preparation through Career and Technical Education.

The diversity of SBAE instruction found geographically and historically illustrates a discipline defined by
adaptation and evolution. As we look to the future, the nature of instruction within SBAE is uncertain;
however, we can be sure that instruction will continue to evolve to meet the needs of learners, communities,
and agricultural systems. As future agricultural educators, we will be in the driver's seat as the discipline
navigates change and continues to move forward toward a better tomorrow.

FFA

What do you think our lives might have been like if we lived in the early 1900s? In 1911, more than 80 percent of
children lived in the country, so chances are we too would have lived in a rural area. How might that be similar
or different from where we currently live? How might our schooling have been different? The importance of
agriculture could have influenced some of our coursework with a primary focus on learning specific skills for
farming such as planting and harvesting crops or raising livestock.

Consider some of the extracurricular clubs we participated in during high school. Were we members of the
student council or robotics club? Perhaps we were involved in the math club or drama club? However, if we
lived at the turn of the century, we may have found ourselves participating in a corn club or a tomato club at
our schools. Just like the student clubs we were a part of, these clubs brought youth together with a common
interest to participate in activities and competitions.
                                                                                 THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 5

You might be asking yourself, "What initiated the start of corn clubs?" A lack of adult interest in farmers'
institutes in Macoupin County, Illinois, spurred the president of the county institute, W. B. Otwell, to
distribute corn to 500 boys who grew it and competed for prizes at the following institute in 1900. This type
of exhibition grew so quickly in popularity, that the following year, 1,500 farmer boys submitted entries and
a statewide exhibit in 1904 drew participation from 8,000 boys (True, 1929). Agricultural clubs, such as corn
clubs, also grew in popularity amongst rural schools as a way to encourage the study of agriculture (Davis,
1912). In 1902, A. B. Graham, who was school superintendent of rural schools in Springfield, Ohio, started what
was known as a "boys' and girls' experiment club" (Reck, 1951, p. 12). Graham introduced learners to scientific
concepts and agricultural skills such as soil testing, ropework, and using a microscope. Over time, Graham
continued to develop and implement programs related to corn production, vegetable gardens, and flower
gardens (Reck, 1951). By 1909, there were more than 10,000 boys enrolled in the competitive corn contests,
and in 1910, over 46,000 boys were connected with corn clubs (True, 1929).

In 1909, Marie Cromer, a young rural schoolteacher in South Carolina, learned of the influence of corn clubs on
crop yields. She proclaimed the need for a similar opportunity for farm girls and by the next year had initiated
a girls' tomato club (Engelhardt, 2009). As part of the club's activities, girls were expected to plant one-tenth
of an acre of tomatoes and provide all the effort during the growth and the canning of the crop (Evans et al.,
1916; Pound & Moore, 2012).

The passage of the Smith-Hughes Act in 1917 led to the development of student organizations for rural
youth that had an emphasis on agricultural production but also provided opportunities for personal growth
and development (Croom, 2008). Walter S. Newman, who served as the State Supervisor of Agricultural
Education in Virginia, grew concerned that farm boys were becoming disinterested in farming and eventually
deciding to leave the farm. In an effort to give the boys a "shot in the arm," he suggested the idea of
starting an organization for boys studying agriculture (Yeatts, 1954). During a meeting in September 1925 with
Harry Sanders, Edmund Magill, and Henry Groseclose, Newman expressed his concern about the feelings of
inferiority often experienced by farm boys. In response, he suggested forming an organization that would
allow rural youth the opportunity to "develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are
farm boys" (Yeatts, 1954, p. 18). Around a wooden table at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the Future Farmers
of Virginia was born. A couple of years later, in May 1927, the New Farmers of Virginia was started at Virginia
State College under the guidance of Dr. H. O. Sargent and G. W. Owens. This organization, which was similar
to the Future Farmers of Virginia, served African American agricultural learners (Simmons, 1940).
6 | THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

These early agricultural clubs paved the way for the development of the Future Farmers of America. In 1928,
the Future Farmers of America was established during the first National FFA Convention in Kansas City,
Missouri. The national organization for the New Farmers of America (NFA) was created on August 4, 1935.
Throughout the 1960s, the civil rights movement took a prominent position in our nation's history. As schools
desegregated during this time, many FFA and NFA chapters merged at the local level. The passage of the Civil
Rights Act in 1964 prompted both organizations to discuss the formation of one unified national organization
(IUPUI University Library, 2016). On July 1, 1965, membership in the FFA was opened to all agriculture learners
regardless of race, color, or national origin (Wakefield & Talbert, 2000). In 1969, after several failed attempts
to amend the constitution, females finally gained the right to be members of the FFA (Moore, 2019).

SAE (Supervised Agricultural Experience)

It is thought that supervised experience was the earliest component of the agricultural education model as
youth engaged in apprenticeships or received informal education at home (Croom, 2008). Rufus W. Stimson
was credited with developing the project method of teaching in response to concerns about how agriculture
was taught. He felt the instruction consisted of too much lecture and manual labor that did not actively
engage learners. The project method proposed by Stimson allowed learners to transfer learning from the
classroom to projects implemented at their home farms (Moore, 1988). The Smith-Hughes Act of 1917
proposed that learners should engage in directed or supervised practice in agriculture for at least six months
during the year. Over time, this emphasis on meaningful and relevant applied learning has evolved into what
it now known as Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE). In 2017, the definition was updated to include
that SAE is a "student-led, instructor supervised, work-based learning experience that results in measurable
outcomes within a predefined, agreed upon set of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (AFNR) Technical
Standards and Career Ready Practices aligned to a career plan of study" (The National Council for Agricultural
Education, 2017, p. 2).

Types of Agricultural Education

In this textbook, we foreground agricultural education which occurs in a school setting (e.g., a high school
agricultural classroom). This type of agricultural education is often termed "school-based agricultural
education" or SBAE; however, there are other types of agricultural education. For example, county extension
agents teaching community members improved farming practices is agricultural education. A director of
an urban garden discussing pest management strategies with gardeners is also agricultural education.
Agricultural education which occurs outside the scope of a school-centered program is referred to as
"nonformal" or "community-based" agricultural education. Much like school-based agricultural education,
agricultural education occurring outside the context of a school is critical to fostering learning and
engagement in agriculture. While some of this textbook will focus exclusively on school-based, or "formal,"
agricultural education, most of the content will be applicable for those envisioning educating in either space.
                                                                                 THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 7

Why Does Agricultural Education Exist?

Now that we have detailed the elements that compose agricultural education, we must situate why
agricultural education exists. Agricultural education programs fall within the broader umbrella of Career and
Technical Education (CTE). The objective of CTE programs is to prepare learners with the knowledge and
skills needed for employment or further education in a corresponding field (e.g., business, health science,
information technology). For agricultural education, exploration of and preparation for careers in agriculture,
food, and natural resources are the foci. Our focus on vocational preparation has its roots in the Smith-
Hughes Act of 1917, which established agricultural education as a vocational education program. Throughout
its history, agricultural education has maintained an ethos of vocational preparation; however, other answers
to the why of agricultural education have emerged, which we will consider in concert with the vocational aim.

Acknowledging the diversity of careers individuals enrolled in agricultural education courses have an interest
in pursuing, agricultural education has evolved to develop agricultural literacy. Agricultural literacy entails
knowledge and understanding within the discipline of agriculture (Clemons et al., 2018). Developing
agricultural literacy among all learners, including those who do not plan to pursue agricultural careers,
is important to create a society of citizens who are informed about issues that exist within agriculture,
food, and natural resources. When possessing content literacy, citizens are more likely to make informed
choices when voting, shopping, and communicating. Therefore, agricultural education exists to empower
members of society with knowledge and understanding so they can improve their lives and the lives of
others. Importantly, this literacy does not mean the role of agricultural education is to develop advocates for
agriculture. Certainly, literacy often results in advocating; however, literacy can also yield critical thinking
about how to continually improve agriculture for the present and future.

Agricultural education also exists to develop systems thinking among learners. Climate change, soil
degradation, and water access are just a few of the complex problems which relate directly to agriculture,
food, and natural resources. Agricultural education, therefore, must play a role in empowering individuals
to understand and address these complex challenges (Pauley et al., 2019). Problem solving has long been a
staple of agricultural education curriculum (Parr & Edwards, 2004). Building upon the traditions of problem-
solving instruction, educators must seek opportunities to foster systems thinking and interdisciplinary
mindsets through their curriculum. Systems thinking refers to identifying the multitude of relationships that
exist among social, technological, and ecological factors within a given problem or phenomenon (McKim &
McKendree, 2020). Systems thinking is imperative to identifying factors that influence a problem and factors
influenced by potential solutions. Related to systems thinking, educators should seek to illuminate the
content of multiple disciplines (e.g., science, technology, engineering, and mathematics [STEM]) within their
instruction as these interdisciplinary learning experiences mirror the diverse mindsets needed to address
complex problems. Building upon the need for interdisciplinary learning within agricultural education, there
exists a timely opportunity for agricultural educators to highlight STEM career pathways for all learners. This
opportunity is especially salient for populations underrepresented within STEM fields.
8 | THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

Leveraging the interdisciplinary nature of agriculture, many states and programs provide credit in core
academic areas for learners engaging in agricultural education coursework. Offering agriculture courses
which count for core academic credits positions agricultural education as a valuable option for learners
to efficiently complete high school graduation requirements while reaping the myriad additional benefits
of agricultural education programs. Further, some agricultural education programs have established
articulation agreements with colleges and universities whereby experiences in agricultural education (e.g.,
individual courses, obtaining a state degree, and program completion) count for postsecondary credits,
extending the value of agricultural education.

In addition to vocational preparation, content literacy development, problem solving, and credit obtainment,
agricultural education exists to ignite learners' passion for continuing to learn. For many, the careers we
envisioned as middle school and high school learners differs from what we actually end up doing. Therefore,
agricultural education exists to "plant the seed"--to promote lifelong learning by illustrating the importance,
complexity, and diversity of agriculture, food, and natural resource systems. As one's future unfolds, the
passion sparked for agriculture during coursework could illuminate a new path within the disciplines of
agriculture, food, and natural resources. While this answer to why agricultural education exists is the least
clear, it can also be the most exciting! Engaging in agricultural education has the potential to impact learners
far beyond their days of learning in high school, getting their first job, or picking a college major. The impact
of agricultural education persists throughout one's life. Therefore, as agricultural educators we may not
realize the extent of our impact on a life, community, or the world.

Who Does Agricultural Education Serve?

When looking around our classrooms on the first day of school, we are going to be surrounded by learners
who all have different motivations for signing up for agricultural education. Some learners may have family
members who are involved or employed in the agricultural industry. Their parents or grandparents might
be farmers or ranchers, an aunt or uncle might work in an agriculture business, a cousin might be a food
scientist, or a sibling might work in construction or metal fabrication. Another learner may have cultivated an
interest in agriculture through personal interests or future career aspirations. It is common for learners who
dream of one day becoming a veterinarian to enroll in an agriculture class. Likely, a couple of your learners
will have no idea why they are in your classroom. The class may have just appeared on their schedule, or a
guidance counselor may have encouraged them to take the course for a variety of reasons.
                                                                                 THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 9

The content and delivery methods common to agricultural education might also attract learners to your
classroom. Learners might find that the integration and reinforcement of numerous scientific concepts, as
well as contextual teaching and learning, serves their needs and interests. The Hatch Act of 1887 provided
the impetus for the first agriscience programs in the United States. As experiment stations were developed,
district agricultural schools were also established to provide secondary instruction in agriculture and home
economics. The schools delivered practical instruction in agriculture, while the experiment stations
emphasized scientific application and research. Over time, agricultural education became more vocational
in nature and focused more on training and less on academic instruction (Hillison, 1996).

However, in 1988, the need for the integration of scientific concepts in agriculture instruction was raised
again by the National Research Council. Legislation, such as the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied
Technology Act of 1990, the School-to-Work Opportunities Act of 1994, and the Carl D. Perkins CTE
Improvement Act, has repeatedly called for the integration of core content academics into Career and
Technical Education (Threeton, 2007). Educators have embraced this opportunity to reinforce scientific
concepts in their classroom and curricula has changed leading to course offerings such as agriculture
biotechnology, food science, agriculture biology, agriculture chemistry, earth science in agriculture, and
animal and plant sciences. In some states, several of these courses can be used to fulfill science
requirements needed for admission to four-year institutions. Calculating feed rations, determining genetic
probabilities, profit and loss margins, accurate measurements, and timber cruising are few topics in which
learners can apply mathematical concepts Additionally, educators commonly use pedagogical strategies
such as inquiry-based learning, experiential learning, and problem-based learning which support learners'
scientific reasoning and contribute to student achievement in mathematics. Beyond the traditional
academic content, learners can gain a lasting appreciation or even academic course credit in the visual arts
when completing a unit or course in floral design.

Other learners may have had family members or friends who were in the FFA, so they may be counting down
the days until they can have an FFA jacket of their own. Several factors have been identified as contributing
to FFA participation such as encouragement from others, the positive impact of teachers on their learners,
and opportunities to develop professional and personal skills that look favorable on college applications
or rsums. Learners also seek participation in the social aspects of the FFA organization and engage in
activities beyond the classroom, such as field trips and community engagement (Phelps et al., 2012).

Even with numerous opportunities and benefits associated with the FFA, some learners may be reluctant to
become members. As agriculture teachers look to support and offer options for all learners, they must also
be cognizant of the student population they may not be serving. Learners might have negative perceptions
or misconceptions about learners involved in the organization or may just be apathetic toward involvement
in extracurriculars. There could also be challenges with schedules, both during school and after school.
Learners may not have time to include an agriculture class in their class schedule or might feel like they do
not have any extra time outside of school to participate in FFA events (Phelps et al., 2012).
10 | THE DISCIPLINE OF AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

How is Agricultural Education Delivered?

School-based agricultural education comprises three interrelated components: classroom and laboratory
instruction; experiences in Career and Technical Student Organizations such as the National FFA
Organization (FFA), the National Post-Secondary Agricultural Student Organization (PAS), or the National
Young Farmer Educational Association; and experiential-, service-, and/or work-based learning through
the initiation and continuation of a Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) program. The classroom and
laboratory component consists of the planning and delivery of instruction and assessment of student
learning. While content knowledge remains consistent across the country, there is variation in the
curriculum guides/blueprints/frameworks, instructional materials and resources, and tests and
performance assessments that are used in agricultural education.

The goal of Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) is to provide learners individualized opportunities
to apply principles in the classroom and laboratory to a real-world context. SAE can also promote career
exploration, support the acquisition of technical skills, and develop dispositions contributing to the college
and career readiness of learners (The National Council for Agricultural Education, 2017). When starting SAE
programs, learners are encouraged to complete a Foundational SAE. This allows learners to discover the
broad scope of the agricultural industry, develop personalized interests in agriculture, and identify possible
career opportunities. From the completion of a Foundational SAE, learners can expand their SAE with
an Immersion SAE. There are five types of Immersion SAEs: Placement/Internship, Ownership/
Entrepreneurship, Research, School-Based Enterprise, and Service Learning. Financial literacy, workplace
safety, and key employability skills are also reinforced throughout the completion of SAE (The National
Council for Agricultural Education, 2017). Agricultural educators play an important role by helping their
learners develop plans and set goals, providing ongoing supervision, encouraging continual reflection and
growth, and incorporating and reinforcing record keeping skills.

The FFA is an intracurricular student organization that complements both classroom instruction and SAE
(Croom, 2008) and offers a variety of career and leadership development events, leadership conferences,
award programs, and scholarships. The numerous opportunities allow for the development of key leadership
skills and encourage personal growth among members. The National FFA Organization also promotes the
importance of service engagement in local communities through community service and service-learning
projects. Additionally, the opportunity to travel, both domestically and internationally, can provide FFA
members a chance to experience new places, differing perspectives, and other cultures. For example, FFA
members in North Carolina were able to host Future Farmers of Japan members from Tokyo Metropolitan
Engei High School. A FFA chapter in Ohio traveled to Brazil and the Dominican Republic. The North Huron
FFA in Michigan sends a few members to Uganda each year as an outreach opportunity and personal growth
experience. While travel may not always be feasible, FFA chapters can also connect and engage through
various social media outlets and video conferencing.

Numerous groups and entities contribute to the effective delivery of agricultural education. In 1983, the
National Council for Agricultural Education was established to provide leadership and identified important
opportunities and needed initiatives to support the ongoing development and direction for agricultural
education (The National Council for Agricultural Education, 2012). Additionally, at the national level and
throughout many states, Team Ag Ed provides a collaborative effort among secondary and postsecondary
educators to improve student achievement. At the national level, organizations contributing to Team Ag Ed
include the National Council for Agricultural Education, US Department of Education, National Association
of Agricultural Educators (NAAE), National Association of Supervisors of Agricultural Education (NASAE),
American Association for Agricultural Education (AAAE), Association for Career and Technical Education,
National Farm and Ranch Business Management Education Association, Inc., National Young Farmer
Education Association, and National Professional Agricultural Student Organization (PAS). Individual states
may create their own Team Ag with state-specific representatives along with participation from additional
groups such as Farm Bureau, the Department of Agriculture, FFA Alumni Association, FFA Foundation, and
the agricultural industry.

     Learning Confirmation

     As we presented, the aim of this chapter was to introduce you to agricultural education. As we wrap up
     the chapter, we want to challenge you to take the content you have learned and create a personal vision
     statement for your career in agricultural education. Within this vision statement, identify what your career in
     agricultural education will look like; specifically, describe your vision for facilitating instruction, FFA, and SAE. In
     addition, address (a) why your work in agricultural education will be important, (b) who you envision educating
     throughout your career, and (c) how you envision delivering your agricultural education program. To prepare
     you for writing this vision statement, we recommend you take a moment to first complete the ten reflection
     questions provided at the end of this chapter. Finally, because this vision statement is personal to you, we
     recommend crafting the vision statement in a format that aligns to you as an individual. Example formats could
     include a video, a written paper, a podcast, personal website, or a picture or painting. Once you have crafted your
     vision statement, we encourage you to keep a copy and continually revisit and revise your vision throughout
     your experiences in agricultural education.

Setting the Stage

As your first year of teaching draws to a close, you find yourself reflecting on the year. You were hired as one
of three agriculture teachers to teach floral design, vet science, and welding. Of the 1,500 students in the
school, you begin to think about the students who walked into your class each day. While a majority achieved
a passing grade, what did they really learn in your courses? As you consider the makeup of your classes, you
realize that one in five students were from underrepresented groups and two out of five students did not
have an agricultural background. You question whether you have adequately met the needs of these students
especially as they were not the ones who won awards or competed in career development or judging events.
It leaves you wondering if they learned what you expected them to learn in your courses. You begin to reflect
on several important questions: Are there changes you could make to your instructional approach to better
excite all your students, regardless of their background? Is there research about learning to help you design
strategies to ensure your teaching results in meaningful learning outcomes for all students?
18 | PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING

     Objectives

     This chapter serves to highlight what we know about how learning occurs including some of the theories that
     have been proposed by scholars about the principles and processes that influence learning. There are a vast
     amount of learning theories and we will not attempt to review all theories in this chapter (for a more complete
     list, see Schunk, 2012). Instead, we will focus on those theories that are applied versus basic theories of learning
     and most applicable to educators throughout agricultural education programs. Furthermore, we will review
     theories that help situate the environment of learning, including the identities of learners and diversity and
     inclusion aspects of learning. It is our intent that this chapter can be used to help explore beliefs and assumptions
     about learning that will help guide teaching efforts in the classroom and beyond and enable you to align your
     instructional strategies to create a dynamic learning environment for your learners.

          Discuss the definition of learning and overview of foundational learning theories.
          Describe specific learning theories that have implications for building dynamic teaching practices for high

             school agriculture programs.
          Discuss how identities of learners impact their learning in the classroom including diversity and inclusion

             aspects in learning.
          Recognize ways to apply theories and frameworks of learning in your classroom.

Introduction

Research on learning should ultimately contribute to improved teaching. While teaching and learning
complement one another, good teaching and good learning are not sufficient to ensure one another's
success. Educators play a critical role in creating effective learning environments that assist in completing
cognitive activities necessary to develop and demonstrate certain skills and abilities (Schunk, 2012). But
your actions may not always result in learning by your participants. Many factors influence whether learning
occurs or not, and thus it is important to have a deeper understanding of what learning is and how it
happens. So, let's go a little deeper into a definition of learning to help better understand how learning
happens. Does learning involve an increase in knowledge? Does learning involve a change in behavior? Does
learning require reflection? Does learning require that you demonstrate some type of activity? Does learning
involve a change in beliefs and attitudes? Does learning happen better through social interactions? While
researchers, practitioners, and theorists have not reached an agreement on a universal definition of learning
(Schuell, 1986), Schunck (2012) defines learning as "an enduring change in behavior, or in the capacity to
behave in a given fashion, which results from practice or other forms of experience" (p. 3). Three criteria for
learning include: (1) learning involves change, (2) learning endures over time, and (3) learning occurs through
experience.

Just as there is no universal definition of learning, there is also debate on how learning occurs (processes)
and factors that impact learning. Older theories of learning center on behavioral views, meaning learning
is explained through observable behaviors. For instance, if you were an educator who believed learning
occurred this way, you would arrange the environment so that individuals would respond to certain features.
For example, you give a time-out to learners who need to restore their attention to your class. A cognitive
approach situates learning as an internal mental phenomenon that you can infer from what people say
and do. An implication for teachers as a result of cognitive theories would mean teachers should make
learning meaningful and take into account learners' perceptions of themselves (their identity) and their
environment. The constructivist perspective of learning contends that individuals learn by constructing or
forming their knowledge. It focuses more on human factors that explain how learning occurs. Most modern
learning theories are based on the tenets of cognitive and constructivist theories so in this chapter, our
focus will be on the cognitive and constructivist aspects of learning.

Though many of the learning theories differ in how they distinguish the processes and factors of learning,
we know learning is not just about the instructional factors (Pintrich et al., 1986). Of critical importance
is what learners do with the information and how they process this information (Schunk, 2012). We also
know educators cannot ignore the differences among individual learners including their thoughts, beliefs,
attitudes, and values. These factors influence the learning process.

Motivation impacts how individuals learn. In this chapter, we will also explore some theories that offer
explanations for what motivates learners. How people approach and construct learning is impacted by their
identities (e.g., perceptions, values, goals, beliefs, and attitudes). The identity exploration framework offers
a model to consider as we think about how to engage and motivate learners.

Learning and the Brain

How does understanding the function and structure of the human brain increase our understanding of being
an effective educator? Understanding brain development and the location of brain functions helps constrain
educational theories and models of behavior (Casey et al., 2000). Human brain development is a complex
event occurring across the life cycle. Through the discoveries of cognitive neuroscience, we learned that
humans receiving, selecting, storing, transforming, developing, and recovering information are all parts
of a continuous development process that happens from birth to early adolescence (Casey et al., 2005).
Human brain development in the temporal and frontal areas have been consistently associated with higher
cognitive abilities (Casey et al., 2005, 2002; Krawczyk, 2018). Research in neuroscientific brain maturation
of cognitive abilities, such as short-term (or working) memory and long-term memory, provides valuable
information that can be applied in teaching and learning. Some distinct findings from cognitive neuroscience
include: (1) Short-term memory has limited capacity and is associated with the focus of attention (Cowan,
1995); (2) Sensory functions, such as visual, short-term memory capacity declines with increasing task
complexity (Alvarez & Cavanagh, 2004); (3) Instead of cramming information in a long and intense learning
session, repeating information in multiple short learning sessions has optimized long-term memory and
improved information retention (Gluckman et al., 2014); (4) Different kinds of memories rely on different
neural correlates and mental processes (Nie et al., 2019), (5) Connecting prior knowledge with new
information promotes comprehension and memory coding performance (Maguire et al., 1999), and (6) Various
instructional approaches stimulate different parts and functions of the human brain that impact short-term
and long-term memory--for example, comparing the repeated practice of solving a mathematics equation to
letting learners create a solution stimulates different patterns of brain activity that help learners use more
short-term memory (Wirebring et al., 2015).
                                                                                                            PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING | 21

Although understanding the function and structure of the human brain shines light on how people learn,
learning is a far more complicated process than simply understanding neuroscientific brain maturation of
cognitive abilities. A more recent and dominant learning perspective in the discipline of learning sciences
is the 4E Cognition model. 4E Cognition contends that learning is enacted, embodied, embedded, and
extended (Steier et al., 2019). 4E Cognition is a tool for understanding the complicated notion of cognition
(or learning). The premise of the 4E Cognition model is that learning involves more than just the brain;
our bodies, the situation, and interactions within the environment also contribute to learning. The enacted
part of the model implies that thinking involves interaction with others, the immediate context, and various
other items like language and culture. Embodied implies that learning is in relation to our actions. Our
actions imply learning. The embodied mind cannot function in isolation from the physical, social, and cultural
environment because the environment in which the mind exists is part of the mind. Embedded has to do
with the environment including physical elements, cultural-historical structures, and social characteristics
like interpersonal relationships and interactions. The unique features of an environment provide unique
affordances for cognition. For learning to be effective, environmental resources should be taken into account
(Pouw et al., 2014). To help you think about the idea of 4E Cognition, consider this example. Think about the
context of baseball and specifically an outfielder catching a fly ball. Before the batter steps to the plate,
the coach might be able to speculate where the outfielder should stand based on past performance and
experience with that particular batter. But, when it comes time for the outfielder to catch the ball, they must
react in the moment and adjust according to where the ball is actually hit.

Overview of Learning Theories

Behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism play an important role in the development of contemporary
educational psychology theories. In the early twentieth century, behaviorism emphasized using instructional
reinforcement (both positive and negative) to structure a learning environment, and behaviorists evaluated
observable behavior and performance to measure success of learning (Skinner, 1976). Although receiving
many criticisms, behaviorism has proven as an effective instructional strategy when a teacher uses
memorized educational materials and instructions (Woollard, 2010). For example, when an educator gives
immediate and direct feedback to praise learners who correctly answered a pop quiz (factual questions), it
is generally recognized as a behaviorist's teaching strategy. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a shift from
behaviorism to cognitivism, where instructional design was focused more on thought processes and mental
activities but less on changing behaviors (Wittrock, 1986).

Cognitive psychologists believe that learning occurs through internal mental processing of information and
that learners' thoughts, beliefs, and attitude play important roles in their learning process (Winne, 1985).
Cognitivism stresses that learning is an active and goal-oriented process (Shuell, 1986), and cognitivism
utilizes external tools as an instructional strategy to provoke learners' internal mental activities to learn
efficiently. For example, when an educator asks learners to keep an agriscience journal to reflect on what
they have learned, this is a cognitive learning strategy that helps learners organize their learning based on
how the human brain processes information internally.
22 | PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING

On the other hand, constructivism is a learning theory that highlights how learners construct knowledge
by developing personal meaning out of experiences rather than passively receiving information. Learning
involves the reconstruction of existing knowledge to include the newly encountered experience, and existing
knowledge has a contextualized meaning that is aligned with the experience (Haglud et al., 2012; Piaget,
1970). In a classroom, constructivists believe an educator needs to help learners retrieve their existing
knowledge and provide opportunities for learners to reconstruct their existing knowledge with external
experiences. Additionally, from the social constructivist viewpoints, social interactions play an important
role in learning (Vygotsky, 1978). Learners construct their knowledge through conversation, discussion, and
interaction with their peers and with educators. For example, instead of asking factual questions, an
educator asks "why" questions to elicit learners' prior knowledge and continually facilitates conversations
with learners. The educator attempts to structure a learning environment that allows learners of different
backgrounds and experiences to share their thoughts and construct knowledge depending upon their needs.
Table 2.1 summarizes the three dominant paradigms of learning theories, behaviorism, cognitivism, and
constructivism.

Table 2.1: Summary of behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism.

There are many educational psychology theories that are rooted in behaviorism, cognitivism, and
constructivism. In this chapter, we go particularly deep into information processing theory (an extension of
cognitivism) and some theories that are associated with motivation and learning, such as social cognitive
theory and the identity exploration framework.

Selected Learning Theories

Information Processing Theory

Why do learners recall some information but not other information? Information processing theory (IPT)
explains how the brain works to learn, store, and use information. The theory attempts to explain the path
of how information is encoded into the memory system. Some scholars use an analogy to compare IPT
with computer coding and analyzing information. Four factors--stimulation or stimuli, sensory registers,
short-term memory, and long-term memory--are involved in the IPT. When we receive environmental stimuli
through our senses (sensory input), we try to make meaning of them. In human brains, each sense has its own
register to make meaning of the sensory input. Sensory information catches our attention, and the sensory
registers progress the information to the short-term memory. However, only the information that is deemed
relevant or is familiar to previously stored information will be transferred from sensory registers to short-
term memory. The screening process is very selective. In other words, if there are many stimuli, we only
respond to certain stimuli that catch our attention. Unless novel information is transferred from short-term
memory to long-term memory, learning has not occurred. Our brains need to encode (elaborating processes
in transferring) the information before we can store them into long-term memory. During encoding, our
brains try to integrate the new information with the knowledge already stored in long-term memory and
try to organize the information into a meaningful way. Retrieving existing knowledge and integrating newly
encountered information with existing knowledge is critical in helping information transfer from short-term
memory to long-term memory. Piaget (1970) provided a different perspective through the lens of educational
psychology to explain this process. Piaget suggested two ways individuals use to construct knowledge:
accommodation, in which individuals try to develop a new schema (as building blocks of our memories to help
us understand how things work) to cope with a new experience, or assimilation, in which individuals try to
balance and adapt the existing schema to a new experience. When experiences do not fit into an existing
schema, individuals seek equilibration. Individuals take actions, such as asking questions, repeating the
new experience, or seeking more information, to find equilibration to make sense of the newly encountered
experience (Piaget, 1970).

Cognitive Load Theory

Another widely accepted learning theory based on human brain information processing and storing is
cognitive load theory (Sweller et al., 1998). Cognitive load theory contends given that working memory is
limited to processing novel information, working memory load is affected by the complexity of the task
(intrinsic cognitive load), the relationship between the learning goal and design of instructional materials
(extraneous cognitive load), and degree of integration of new information with prior knowledge that is stored
in the long-term memory (germane cognitive load) (Schunk, 2012; Sweller, 1994). Therefore, when designing
instruction, an educator should remember not to "overload" students with too much new or unfamiliar
material, teach in a context with minimized distractions, and break complex learning into smaller chunks to
not overwhelm cognitive load.
24 | PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING

Motivation and Learning

Motivation is the study of why individuals behave the way they do. Educators are often challenged to figure
out how to motivate their learners and interest them in being engaged in their learning and completion of
tasks in a learning environment, such as a classroom or laboratory. While there are still many unanswered
questions about motivation and little rigorous and systematic research on the interventions of the
constructs of motivation, there are some tenets of motivation that are useful to apply in in formal and
nonformal learning environments (Graham & Weiner, 2012). Motivation is a driving force that leads to goal-
directed behavior to achieve an objective or a certain level of performance. Educators are driven by
increasing learners' motivation and their excitement to learn. What inspires people to learn and achieve the
educational goals set for them? How can educators promote learners' engagement and motivation to learn?

Broadly speaking, there are two types of motivation: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation refers to
when a person is moved to act for their interests, satisfaction, and enjoyment. Extrinsic motivation means
a person is moved to act for external rewards, such as money, praise, or to avoid punishments. In this
section, we introduce social cognitive theory, outcome expectations and goal setting theory, self-efficacy,
and identity exploration framework and provide examples of how these theories could be used to promote
learners' motivation and performance.

Social Cognitive Theory

Social cognitive theory (SCT) is one of the landmark theories developed by psychologist Albert Bandura
(1986). The theory stresses dynamic and reciprocal influences of behavior, environment, and individual
cognitive factors. Learning through observation, outcome expectations, and self-efficacy are considered as
the three individual cognitive factors that are affected by the environment to shape individuals' behavior.
Learning can occur by observing and watching others, which also is known as modeling, imitating, or
mirroring (Meltzoff, 1990). Studies have shown observational learning involves both behavioral and
neurophysiological reactions (e.g, mirror neuron system) to social environments (Csibra, 2007; Rizzolatti,
2005). Observers take note of others' behavior, comprehend the meaning of the behavior, and imitate the
behavior. For example, children might pick up on their parents being afraid of bugs, and then they also
exhibit fear of insects. Specific to a learning environment, apprenticeship is one of the most representative
samples of learning through observation. Apprenticeship, where an experienced master-mentor trains the
newcomers to acquire skills and knowledge, is a common and effective way that health care, manufacturing,
construction, and engineering are used to structure on-the-job training or classroom learning. In education,
student teaching and early field observation are common practices of apprenticeship.

Outcome Expectations and Goal Setting Theory

Outcome expectation is one of the critical factors in SCT. Outcome expectation is defined as anticipated
consequences (positive or negative) of a person's behavior (Bandura, 1986). Outcome expectations highly
connect with setting a goal and taking actions toward behavior change. Having learners set goals for
themselves is one of the most effective ways to stay motivated. Locke and Latham (1990, 2002) proposed five
principles of effective goal setting: clarity, challenge, commitment, feedback, and task complexity. Setting
up a specific, clear, and challenging goal is better than a general, vague, and easy goal. For example, instead
of setting up a goal like "I want to improve my overall course grade," a specific and clear goal could be "I
want to improve my overall course grade from C to B." In the goal setting process, a learner should also
put deliberate effort into achieving this goal. For example, "I want to improve my course grade from C to
B. Especially, I want to increase crop and weed science by fifty points. To meet this goal, I will study the
textbook for two hours a week." Receiving immediate feedback is a key component for goal setting. An
educator's role is providing regular feedback throughout the process and helping learners to keep track of
their progress. Additionally, if the goal is too complex, an educator could help break down the process into
subgoals or give feedback on setting up a realistic timeline. For example, an educator's feedback could be
"I suggest you also put more details about what you will study in the textbook. For example, in week one
and week two, you could focus on genetics. Then, in week three and four, you can move onto studying plant
breeding and biotechnology." Goal setting theory is highly associated with self-efficacy.

Self-efficacy

Bandura discusses the essential role that self-efficacy plays in social learning theory (Bandura, 1977, 1986).
Self-efficacy refers to an individual's belief in their own capacity to accomplish goals, which influences
academic motivation, learning, and achievement (Bandura, 1986). Self-efficacy is task specific, and it is a
strong predictor of task performance (Wood & Bandura, 1989). Learners who are more efficacious may have
higher expectations for themselves and will set up higher level goals than those learners with less efficacy.
Learners who are more efficacious are also more committed to achieving goals and respond more positively
to failures (Locke & Latham, 1990). Bandura (1977) suggests four sources to increase self-efficacy: mastery
experiences, vicarious experiences, verbal feedback and persuasion, and emotional and physiological states.
To help learners master their learning, an educator can create a positive learning environment through
reinforcing positive behaviors, using high-energy interactive instruction, and nurturing positive
relationships to help learners value what they do. Educators can help learners know that although challenges
and failures are inevitable, they have abilities, confidence, and desire to achieve their goals. Educators
should also seek out various opportunities for learners to see successful role models. When seeing people
with similar backgrounds, knowledge, and skills have successful experiences, learners increase their
confidence and belief that they will experience similar success. When educators provide positive feedback
to learners, it can lead to higher perceptions of self-efficacy and enhance learner success. Additionally, the
emotional and psychological well-being of a person can influence how they feel about their capacities in a
particular task.
26 | PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING

Identity Exploration Framework

Much of the recent motivational research is focused on awareness and acknowledgment of individual
differences and categorization of individuals as being either mastery or performance oriented, intrinsically
or extrinsically motivated, and high or low in self-efficacy and self-regulation. In regard to the individuality
of learners, educators must recognize that individual attributes of learners are important to how they learn
(Graham & Weiner, 2012). Researchers, policy makers, teachers, parents, and learners themselves recognize
that developing personal and interpersonal attributes in today's changing world requires educators to focus
on promoting learners' agency and figuring out who they are and who they will become, the formation of
their identities. Identity exploration has been defined as "deliberate internal or external action of seeking
and processing information in relation to the self [where the outcome is], the creation of self-relevant
meaning with an integrative effect and the facilitation of development" (Flum & Kaplan, 2006, p. 100). It
is recommended that an educator's role in identity exploration "is to organize academic experiences and
opportunities that would encourage learners to question their self-aspects and investigate and consider
alternative perceptions, values and goals" (Sinai et al., 2012, p. 197). Examples of pedagogical practices
educators can engage in to promote identity exploration include posing complex personal problems that
encourage learners to think about strengths and limits to alternative solutions, exposing learners to others
who are experiencing identity exploration, using writing activities that encourage self-reflection, and
creating focused activities around decision-making and critical thinking in the curriculum (Waterman, 1989).

The Identity Exploration Framework (Flum & Kaplan, 2006) is a central mechanism for identity formation
associated with intense engagement, positive coping, openness to change, flexible cognition, and
meaningful learning. Identity is considered an individual's perceptions, values, beliefs, attitudes, and goals,
is crucial to becoming, and is focused on adaptive motivation for learning the academic material. Some
principles that have been identified for promoting adaptive identity exploration within the school curriculum
(Kaplan et al., 2014) include:

 1. Promoting relevance
 2. Triggering exploration
 3. Facilitating a sense of safety
 4. Scaffolding exploratory actions

Promoting relevance. Promoting relevance involves helping learners connect academic content to self-
aspects such as abilities, attributes, goals, values, behaviors, and emotions. It is important to note that
perceived relevance is subjective in that it depends on the learner's current self-constructions, concerns,
interests, background, and experiences. One strategy for promoting relevance is to ask the learners to
make connections between the academic content and aspects of their lives. For example, as a high school
agriculture educator, one place where promoting relevance to learners may be natural is through
opportunities like Future Farmers of America (FFA) and participating in Supervised Agricultural Experiences
(SAE) events. This is where learners' individual identities and interests could be illuminated. This strategy
can be useful in increasing success of learners by triggering exploration, facilitating a sense of safety, and
scaffolding exploratory actions.

Triggering exploration. Triggering exploration involves the questioning and examining of self-aspects that
become apparent to learners through relevance. Exploration triggers are subjective experiences that are
different from the current identifications or identity commitments (self-perceptions, values, goals, social
roles, and relationships) of learners. Because learners differ in their concerns, cultural backgrounds, and
openness to identity exploration, the same event may be an exploration trigger for one learner but not for
another. Designing experiences that trigger exploration are reliant on the educator's familiarity with the
learners. Exploration triggers may also provoke a sense of conflict and threat including threats to self-worth
that lead to struggle and resistance. Educators should be mindful of ensuring a safe learning environment to
reduce threats associated with exploration triggers.

Facilitating a sense of safety. Exploration trigger experiences that are perceived as threats, are
disappointments to significant others, or are at odds with one's internalized sense of self can lead to learners
feeling anxious and defensive and may require educators to establish a sense of safety in order for learners
to engage in exploration. Like the previous two principles, learners may differ in what they perceive as being
safe. Educators should engage in strategies that promote belonging, establish norms of mutual respect, and
legitimize the perspectives and emotions of learners.

Scaffolding exploratory actions. Once learners perceive relevance of academic content to the self,
experience a "relevant different" to trigger their identity exploration, and feel safe to engage in this
exploration, they still need to have the knowledge in effective exploration strategies. Examples of scaffolding
identity exploration activities include reflective questions for personal and interpersonal consideration, role-
playing exercises, reflective writing activities, and peer modeling.
28 | PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING
Educators should recognize the unique aspects of learners, especially in regard to the multicultural aspects
of learners. Educators should continue to assess the psychological state of learners as they design activities:
Are the learners perceiving self-relevance of the content? Are learners experiencing a "relevant difference"
from identity aspects? Do learners feel safe? Are learners engaging in adaptive exploration strategies?
Reviewing answers to these questions can assist educators in deciding which actions they should take to
further learners' identity exploration in relation to the academic material. Likewise, it is suggested that
educators may not be prepared to engage in identity exploration because they do not hold this approach to
teaching. Educators may ask themselves the same questions, but with the emphasis being on themselves
instead of the learner (Kaplan et al., 2014).

In summary, there are many theories and research on learning that attempt to explain how learning occurs.
While many theories exist (for a more comprehensive list, see Schunk, 2012), we have described some of
the theories most relevant to agricultural education. The three dominant paradigms of learning theories are
behaviorism, cognitivism, and constructivism. Within these paradigms are more specific theories like social
cognitive theory. Motivation and self-efficacy are important factors for learning and should be accounted for
when designing programs that maximize student learning in your classroom. Finally, the identity exploration
framework is a model for educators to use in helping learners with identity exploration since identity and
individual attributes of learners has been found to affect learning (Graham & Weiner, 2012).

Applying the Content

In this chapter, we have attempted to provide an overview of several theories of learning most relevant
to agricultural education. While you may not always think about the specific theories as you teach, these
theories and research on learning can be applied and are already being applied in pragmatic ways throughout
an agricultural education program. For example, with the three-circle model used in high school and middle
school agricultural programs, learners have more advantages than traditional learners to "learn" (chapter 3)
through being in the FFA program (chapter 10) and through their SAEs (chapter 11). We want to highlight a few
applications of learning theory (experiential learning, discovery learning, and project-based learning) that are
prevalent within agricultural programs.

Experiential learning has been recognized as a critical component of a comprehensive agricultural education
(Baker et al., 2012). As an application of constructivist learning theory, experiential learning involves learners
experiencing something and then reflecting on this experience to make meaning of the experience. It is important
to note that for learning to occur, agricultural educators must be present and purposeful through all program
components and ask reflection questions throughout the process (Baker et al., 2012). Learners in high school
agricultural education programs have many opportunities to learn through experiences including their
instructional labs, SAE projects, and FFA events. Experiential learning will be expanded on in future chapters.

Another application of constructivist theory is discovery learning. Discovery learning is simply the process of
obtaining knowledge for oneself. It is also a type of problem-solving, is experiential, and uses inquiry learning.
Teaching through discovery learning involves presenting questions without readily available answers, problems
with no solutions, or challenging situations that encourage learners to create a best-guess answer. Discovery
learning works best when learners have some prior experience or background information (Schunk, 2012). More
information about discovery learning through labs in high school agriculture programs can be found in chapter
12.

Project-based learning (PBL) is an application of constructivist learning theory. It allows learners to learn
by doing, applying ideas, and solving problems. Research on PBL indicates classrooms that use this learning
result in better learning outcomes than traditional classrooms. SAEs that consist of research can serve as a
type of PBL. PBL involves active construction, situated learning, social interactions, and cognitive tools. To use
PBL in the classroom, educators would have learners construct meaning based on their learners' experiences
and interactions in the world. Learning can occur in real-world contexts (situated learning). In school-based
agricultural education (SBAE) educators, learners, and community members work together for shared
understanding (social interactions). Finally, learners make use of cognitive tools which are things like graphs and
other visualization and data analysis tools to contribute to their understanding of patterns in data.
30 | PSYCHOLOGY OF LEARNING

     Experiential learning, discovery learning, and project-based learning are but three applications of learning
     theories and can also be considered as pedagogies used in educating learners at all levels. There are other
     effective pedagogies, such as inquiry-based and problem-based learning, that are developed based on learning
     theories and are widely used by educators. As you design your instruction for powerful and dynamic learning
     within your programs, consider how you can make the environment conducive to learning. Keep in mind the
     individual characteristics of your learners, their motivations and goals, their past experiences, their self-efficacy
     toward the content, and how you can facilitate not just memorization of content, but deep, transformative
     learning that translates into more meaningful outcomes in the future. As an educator, you have the power and
     ability to design your programs to maximize learning for your learners.

     Reflective Questions

         1. Think about a subject you will be teaching in the near future. What information from this chapter could
             assist you in structuring the content to create a dynamic learning environment?

        2. What do you believe about learning? How will this guide your teaching strategies?
        3. Which theories of learning have you seen demonstrated in yourself and in others?

3. PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Kasee L. Smith

Setting the Stage

Carmen set out to evaluate three teachers in her school. As a new vice principal, her job was to examine
the quality of teaching for educators in her building. She walked into three classrooms that morning and
observed the following:

   Mr. Patterson had his lesson plans completed and organized by date, time, and course. He worked to
      ensure that everyone he instructed was presented with opportunities to learn. He had an interesting
      lesson opening, and made sure learners knew the objectives for the day before they begin. Learners
      were guided through carefully planned lessons which included opportunities to demonstrate
      knowledge, relearn information, and work toward stated goals.

   Ms. Diaz loves her content area and is consistently enthusiastic about the things she expects others to
      learn. She worked to make sure she clearly described concepts and occasionally used humor to lighten
      the mood and create a positive learning environment. She integrated new learning activities into her
      instruction and provided opportunities for learners to receive positive reinforcement for completing
      tasks and learning concepts. While enthusiastic, she made sure her learners remained on task and
      worked through the material they should be completing.

   Ms. Novak centered learners in her approach to instruction. She focused on motivating learners to
      want to learn. She developed and delivered engaging lessons that allowed learners to connect with
      the content on a deeper level. Her focus was on creating instruction which helped learners retain
      information and apply content to other situations.
36 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

     Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to:
          Define teaching and learning.
          Explain the purpose for following principles of teaching and learning.
          Describe principles for effectively organizing content.
          Describe principles for effectively delivering content.
          Describe principles related to learning.
          Share principles of teaching and learning in practical scenarios.

Introduction

Learners naturally make appraisals of the quality of educators. Most people can list the characteristics we
use when describing good and bad educators, which invites the question: what makes someone a good
educator? Which of the teachers Carmen observed would you choose to learn from? Do you think these
educators are good at their job? What characteristics do they exhibit that indicate their potential for success
in the classroom?

Now, think for a moment about the best educator you have ever had ... it might be from elementary school,
high school, a college professor, or someone who taught you a specific hobby or life skill in an informal
setting. Next, think about what they did that made them a good educator from your perspective. Were they
passionate about the content? Did they encourage you personally or academically? Did they care about you
as an individual? Make a mental list of their teaching characteristics or jot them down on a piece of paper.

Is the best educator you've ever had similar or different from the three educators we examined at the opening
of the chapter? What commonalities exist between the three educators in the scenarios and your ideal
educator? The simple truth is, there are many ways to be a good educator. Every learner is different, and each
learner has different learning needs. Every educator is different too. One of the challenges to becoming an
educator is knowing that there are people who do the job well. You might be thinking, "I don't think I could
be like the educators in my scenario, and I don't think I'll ever be as good as the best educator I've ever had."
That's okay. Our role as developing educators is to find our own path and to develop a set of teaching skills
that are uniquely matched to us.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 37

The principles of teaching and learning are the foundation upon which great educators are built. These
concepts relate to organizing content for learners, delivering instruction, and understanding how learners
learn. In our original scenarios Mr. Patterson focused on the principles of teaching related to organizing
content, Ms. Diaz focused on the principles of teaching related to delivering instruction, and Ms. Novak
focused on the principles of student learning. In this chapter, we will examine the principles of teaching and
learning and discuss where they came from, how they function in a learning environment, and why they are
important.

Overview of the Principles of Teaching and Learning

Educational researchers have been working to define the principles of teaching and learning for decades.
In fact, many of the earliest philosophical conversations in most cultures were related to determining how
information should be taught and how people should learn. So, before we can discuss the principles of
teaching and learning, let's pause to define both teaching and learning. Teaching is the process of mutual
exchange and/or relationship among an educator, learners, and curriculum or society (Dewey, 1938). Learning
is the process of acquiring and transforming information into knowledge which can be assimilated,
transformed, and processed by the learner (Sousa, 2010).

Darling-Hammond and Bransford (2007) suggested that to have a working ability to teach, a novice educator
must be able to understand learners, curriculum content, and how to teach. While there are many ways to
think about teaching and learning, the core principles of teaching and learning are the same. For the purpose
of this chapter, we will examine the principles of teaching and learning in three contexts:

   Principles of Organizing Content. These principles deal with how educators transform information in
      the world into curriculum that is ready to be shared with learners.

   Principles of Delivering Instruction. These principles provide insight for educators related to how they
      interact with learners in the learning environment.

   Principles of Student Learning. These principles are related to learners perceiving instructional cues,
      receiving information, and assimilating new learning into their current knowledge base.

Organizing Content

Have you ever encountered educators who made you wonder if they were organized and ready to teach? Did
you ever worry that an educator was ill-prepared to deliver content? The first step in preparing to educate
learners is to organize the content you will teach. We will discuss processes for organizing content in detail
in chapter 7, "Planning for Effective Instruction." From a broader perspective, there are important principles
of teaching that can help guide thoughts around preparing content for learners.
38 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Principle 1: Subject matter should be organized in a sequence and logically
from simple to more complex.

Organizing content is best done when we meet learners at their current level of knowledge, then increase the
complexity of concepts, while making sure to tie new information to what learners already know. Organizing
the content means first organizing the subject matter by listing the items learners are expected to know at
the end of the course. These learning outcomes, often called objectives, should be sequenced to present
learners with more foundational concepts first. This can allow learner knowledge to build based on the
information they have already acquired in the class. This concept is typically referred to as scaffolding, which
makes sense if you think for a moment about the way a scaffold works. To reach higher levels on a scaffold,
we need to climb up each layer below. The same concepts are true with learning. Learners should learn more
basic concepts first, then they can increase their level of cognition and build upon their new knowledge. A
large-scale example of the concept of scaffolding is learning to read. Before someone can read, they first
need to be able to recognize each letter, once letters are recognizable, the sound each letter makes can be
added to the knowledge, once sounds are understood for each letter, small strings of letters can be added to
form short words. Gradually, as understanding of letter combinations and phonics rules increase, someone
can scaffold their knowledge to read complicated words.

Knowing student knowledge level and prior experiences is critical to successfully integrating principle 1.
How can we discover what learners already know? A good first step is to ask those who know the learning
environment and background of the learners what the knowledge strengths are for the group of learners.
Becoming an excellent educator means understanding our learners, their interests, and the prior
experiences they might have. With this knowledge of learners comes a clarity in the level of knowledge they
already possess. A possible strategy for gathering learners' knowledge is a preassessment of knowledge and
experiences. Conducting a preassessment can provide the needed information for the educator to know
where the scaffold should begin. Perceptive educators also gain skills to interpret learner understanding and
level of knowledge based on the questions learners ask and the responses they give during instruction.

How do we sequence instruction once we have background information on learner content knowledge? An
important question to ask is are there sections of the content which will require learners to know knowledge
from another section of the content? Some instruction includes knowledge that learners need to build on
to grasp more complicated concepts. The foundational concepts should therefore be instructed before the
more complicated components. The same is true for objectives for a lesson plan or a series of learning
sessions.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 39

While learning is the most important consideration for sequencing instruction, there may be other items to
consider in planning a series of instructional lessons. Thinking about how the content aligns with seasons
or other local, state, or national events can provide more opportunities for learners. For example, it makes
sense to align instruction on transplanting in a greenhouse with the actual greenhouse transplanting
schedule or to plan instruction in public speaking to align with a local or state competition. Planning long-
term instruction is something that can give learners a foundation upon which to build their content
knowledge.

The sequence of instruction should not be a secret to learners. Sharing the sequence with learners allows
them to create a visual roadmap of where the instruction will go next and allows them the opportunity to look
back on the knowledge they have gained. Giving learners access to the sequence for both the entire series of
instruction and within smaller instructional units can provide the clarity learners need to stay focused on the
objectives of the instruction.

What does Principle 1 look like in action?

   In a greenhouse management session: Delivering a unit on parts of the plant before a unit on asexual
      propagation where parts of the plant will be referenced.

   In an animal science session: Ensuring learners know what the types of injections are before a lab on
      giving injections.

   In a leadership workshop: Discussing the components of a speech prior to having learners compose a
      speech of their own.

Once we know the flow and sequence of instruction, we can begin to organize individual learning sessions.
Each learning session should be organized in a way that allows learners to fully engage with the content and
demonstrate their understanding. Principles 2 through 8 are involved with each step of instruction. These
principles are built upon the nine events of instruction as developed by Robert Gagne in 1965. Those nine
events are:

   Gain attention
   Stimulate recall of prior knowledge
   Inform learners of objectives
   Present stimulus
   Provide learner guidance
   Elicit performance
   Provide feedback
   Assess performance
   Enhance retention and transfer

Let's examine the principles behind each of these events of instruction and how organizing content can be
accomplished by paying attention to the intent of each of these steps.
40 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Principle 2: Learners will not learn unless they find interest in the subject
matter; they learn more when they understand why the content is important
to their life.

Imagine this scene: You are sitting in the back of a traditional high school classroom when learners come
into class. Several are talking to each other, a few more are paying attention to their phones, and a couple
even come into the room and put their heads down on the desk. The bell rings and the teacher says, "Start
by reading the handout on genetics, then we will discuss." The educator has obviously planned for the day,
but are learners engaged and ready to learn? Without learners shifting their focus to the learning session and
topic, very little the educator does will stimulate learning. Learners must be attentive to the educator and to
the content for learning to occur.

How can we gain learners' attention? There are many ways to ensure learners pay attention to the content.
Activities designed to stimulate learner attention at the beginning of a learning session are commonly
called interest approaches, though they can also be called anticipatory sets, warm-ups, start tasks, or bell
ringers. These attention-stimulating activities are designed to help learners engage with the content and
the educator. Interest approaches can be designed to simply gain student attention but can also extend into
allowing learners to connect their prior experience to the current content or compel them to want to learn
more about the topic. Interest must be gained at the beginning of each learning session and at the transition
between units of instruction. Gaining content-specific attention is key for learners to be able to engage with
the content and to be ready to learn.

You might recall being in a class and thinking, "When will I ever use this?" Being able to answer this question
for learners is a core component of instruction. Learners pay more attention to things that matter to their
lives currently and in the future. Master educators look for opportunities to tie the content to the lives of
their learners through examples or explanations that are relevant. The goal for educators is to create a need.
This switch for a learner is the difference between learning content to complete a session or get a score and
learning content because it matters in the real world. Our content provides many opportunities for learners
to reach this felt need to learn real-world content. The educator's role is to explain why each subject in the
curriculum is important to learners' lives.

What does Principle 2 look like in action?

   In a water quality workshop: Sharing stories of waterborne illnesses at the opening of a session
      designed to help learners know how to properly test drinking water.

   In a small engines session: Showing learners an engine that is running poorly and asking learners what
      they think might be wrong at the beginning of a lesson on troubleshooting.

   In a biology session: Showing learners highly magnified images of animal cells dividing before a lesson
      on mitosis, then telling learners that understanding this process can help them better understand how
      both regular growth and cancer works.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 41

Principle 3: Learners learn best when they can tie new knowledge to prior
knowledge and experiences.

Can you recall the last time a song made you think of an experience? One of the most remarkable things about
humans is our ability to tie new knowledge to things we already know, like a song. The process of learning new
information requires that we incorporate new information into that which we already know, a process called
assimilation. For assimilation to be most effective, the prior knowledge or experience should be brought
back to mind prior to being exposed to new information.

Educators can help learners assimilate new knowledge by asking learners questions to recall information
they already know. This questioning process may be as simple as asking learners to recall what was done
in class the prior day or as complicated as asking learners to recall an adjacent concept then drawing an
analogy to the new content to be learned. When learners recall prior knowledge, they make their brain more
ready to receive new information. Recalling prior knowledge allows learners to anchor new knowledge to
concepts they already know and can recall. It is similar to pulling a file folder out of a filing cabinet before
putting a new paper in it; when a new paper is added to the folder, it is stored with all the other related
concepts. In most instances, this method of learning is more effective than learning through repetition or
rote memorization because it helps develop neural pathways that can be retained. The more times learners
recall information, the more likely they are to be able to retain the information for long periods of time (Rock,
1957).

What does Principle 3 look like in action?

   In a floral design workshop: Posting a slide as learners arrive for a second class with the prompt, "Please
      list all of the color schemes you remember from yesterday's lesson."

   In a metal fabrication shop: Asking learners to share times when they have seen or built something that
      was not square. Holding a group discussion about the implications of a project not being square.

   In a leadership session: Asking learners to recall times when conflict occurred on a team and the
      outcome of the conflict prior to discussing methods for conflict resolution.
42 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Principle 4: Learners best gain knowledge when they know what they are
expected to learn.

Do you know the most asked question in all K-12 classes in the United States? Believe it or not, the most
commonly asked question is, "What are we going to do today?" Why is this the most asked question? Learners
are curious and wanting to know what they will learn comes naturally to them. Being able to satisfy curiosity
is a good reason to let learners know what they will learn, but sharing learning outcomes with learners is so
much more than that.

Of course, for learners to know what they are expected to learn, the educator needs to know what they expect
learners to learn. Understanding the objectives of your instruction is a critical component to organizing
content and must be the starting point when planning long-term or short-term instruction (Darling-
Hammond & Bransford, 2007). Most often, the expectations for learning are called the objectives when the
educator is planning and become less formal when presented to learners as a learning outcome. Whether
formal or informal, learning expectations should be stated explicitly in measurable terms. An example of an
objective and learning outcome include:

   Objective: Learners will be able to explain the importance of personal protective equipment (PPE) when
      working in a laboratory environment.

   Learning Outcome: You will explain why we wear PPE in the lab.

We might wonder, "If the educator knows what the learners will be learning, isn't a simple agenda of what
they will do enough?" The answer from educational researchers is a resounding no. When a learner knows
what they are expected to learn, it has implications for the way content is organized and delivered. One of
the biggest benefits to sharing the learning objectives with learners is that they can store new information
along with information they already know (Gagne, 1965). To go back our example, when the educator shares
with learners they will be learning about PPE, their minds automatically recall their previous experiences
and knowledge about PPE. This recall process prepares the brain to create neural networks to the new
information. Those networks are critical in learners being able to recall new information later (Sousa, 2010).

As educators, wouldn't it be nice to have a room full of learners pushing toward learning what we expected
them to learn? Another reason for sharing objectives and learning outcomes with learners is that it gives
learners more control and responsibility for their own learning (Darling-Hammond & Bransford, 2007). When
learners know what they should be able to do, they are more likely to remain on task, ask more questions,
and help guide the pace of instruction (Gagne, 1965). Sharing objectives with learners also allows them to
self-evaluate their knowledge. Master educators share objectives at the beginning of each instructional
session, then they revisit the objectives at the end of the session to assess learner progress. Gathering
evidence related to the objectives allows educators to determine if content is mastered, if there are
misunderstandings, or if learners need more guidance to grasp the concepts.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 43

We might wonder, what do educators do for classes where learners are working on project-based learning
assignments? Even in laboratory settings or with self-paced work, learners can benefit from knowing what
they are expected to learn for the day. In a highly individualized setting, this might mean letting learners
set their own learning objectives, and assessing their performance based on their own goals. Regardless
of the type of learning environment, sharing learning outcomes with learners is perhaps the principle that
is easiest to implement and that yields the biggest result for learning. The concept is so important that
many evaluation tools include a rating for educators regarding their ability to share learning outcomes with
learners.

What does Principle 4 look like in action?

   In a wildlife management workshop: Asking learners to copy down what they should be able to do by
      the end of class, then at the end of class, asking learners to check off the objectives they feel like they
      accomplished.

   In a mechanics laboratory: Having each learner write what they plan to learn during lab time on a sticky
      note and placing on the door on the way to the lab. At the end of class, have learners collect their sticky
      note and write how they accomplished their objective on the sticky note to turn in for work points.
44 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Principle 5: The method best suited to the content must be used to
maximize learning.

There are many different instructional methods educators use to stimulate learning. From lecture to field
trips to inquiry-based learning methods, educators must help learners gather knowledge. This process is
referred to by Gagne (1965) as "presenting the stimulus." Sometimes, instructional methods are referred to
as "teacher-centered" or "learner-centered" and there are many different opinions for which method to use
(Norman & Spohrer, 1996). Master educators have a wide variety of knowledge of instructional methods, and
they present information to learners in the format that is best for learners.

There is more than one correct way to present the learning stimulus. How do educators choose an
instructional strategy to match the content? The first question to ask is "What are the objectives?" Each
objective should be written in a way that helps the educator envision how learners will be assessed. For
example, if the objective is for learners to describe the influence of light intensity on plants, it might be
appropriate for learners to inquire into the concept by designing an experiment to test light intensity. If, by
contrast, the objective is to list the types of greenhouse lighting, an experiment is not logical, as the outcome
is simply to list. In this case, another instructional strategy (like lecture, or collaborative learning) might be
more appropriate.

The next question to ask when determining how to present the stimulus to learners is "How can we maximize
learner engagement?" Many can recall being bored in a class. Most likely, boredom stems from not being
given enough opportunity to engage during the instruction. Learners better grasp information when they
have the opportunity to play an active role in the learning, which will be discussed in more depth in principle
15. Other considerations for presenting the learning stimulus to learners are how learners in the class prefer
to interact with the subject matter and each other, how much time is allotted for learning the content, and
the comfort level of the educator in using varying instructional strategies.

What does Principle 5 look like in action?

   In a floral design workshop: Giving each student a different description of a color scheme and asking
      them to find an example from a magazine to share with the class. Once they have found their examples,
      learners can share their findings with others who collect the information about the color schemes in
      their notes.

   In a plant science session: Having learners set up an inquiry-based learning experiment to determine
      the influence of different light intensities on plants. Learners keep detailed observations and, at the end
      of the experiment, share their findings and collaborate with others to develop an understanding of light
      intensity.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 45

Principle 6: Learners must be given opportunities to practice and to receive
feedback to clarify their understanding.

Have you ever thought you understood something, only to find out later your knowledge was missing a
key component? Imagine this scenario: A educator demonstrates a fillet weld to a group of learners. They
then give each learner two pieces of metal and tell them to go complete the weld. Learners are scored on
their first attempt. What is wrong in this scenario? If you wonder why the educator in this scenario did not
allow learners the opportunity to practice and improve, you are well on your way to understanding our next
principle.

The next principle of teaching related to organizing content is the process of allowing learners to identify and
fill in the gaps in their understanding prior to the final (summative) assessment of their knowledge or skills.
Learners should be prompted to demonstrate their knowledge under the guidance of the educator, who
can provide additional information or correction while the student is still forming their full understanding
of the content. This process is repeated as a loop which includes providing learning guidance, eliciting
performance from the student, and then providing feedback. The process is also referred to as formative
assessment because it happens when the knowledge is still forming in the student's mind (Harlen & James,
1997).

One of the most important parts of formative assessment is allowing learners to self-assess performance.
Learners should be asked questions to recall their knowledge in order for the feedback to be most effective.
If a student brings an educator a project and asks if the project is good, master educators will most often ask
the learner questions about the project in a process which can lead to the learner assessing the work on their
own. For example, rather than telling a learner their travel speed was incorrect on a weld, a master educator
might point out a section and ask the student, "What do you think about the travel speed here?"

Completing the feedback process helps educators make decisions about when to move on to a new concept
or where common misunderstandings might still exist. By asking learners to demonstrate their
understanding before the final assessment, learners are given more opportunities to recall information,
which can lead to both a deeper understanding of the subject and higher retention for the concepts in the
future.

What does Principle 6 look like in action?

   In a beginning welding session: Allowing learners to practice a weld and receive feedback from the
      instructor between attempts before completing a final weld for a grade.

   In a session on teamwork: Allowing learners to struggle to find common ground on a topic, then asking
      them to discuss as a group why common ground was difficult to find.
46 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

   In an agribusiness workshop: After teaching learners about interest rates, giving learners a worksheet
      that includes questions on calculating interest rate. After learners complete the worksheet, the
      educator notices that many learners failed to correctly convert percentages. The educator hands back
      worksheets with comments and reteaches how to convert percentages to the class the next day.

Principle 7: Educators must assess student knowledge to acquire evidence
of understanding.

An important component of organizing content is to know what learners are expected to know at the end
of the learning session. Another important component of organizing content is to know how you will gather
evidence that learners can meet those expectations. Without assessment, there is a lack of formal evidence
that learning took place.

Providing feedback as discussed in principle 6 allows learners to complete formative assessment, but
learners should also be asked to demonstrate their knowledge after all the learning within an instructional
unit is complete. This demonstration of knowledge is called a summative assessment. A summative
assessment is a record of learning that allows educators to make decisions about moving on with the
sequence of instruction or continuing to provide guidance to students. Because learning is sequenced to
build on itself, completing an assessment is a way of ensuring learners are ready for the next content area.

Summative assessments can take many forms depending on the objectives. For performance-based learning
objectives, learners may be assessed using a rubric designed to allow the educator to assign a score based
on performance. Knowledge-based objectives might be assessed using a traditional exam, or through a
project, paper, or other activity. In agricultural education, both knowledge and performance skills can be
assessed through integrating Leadership Development Events (LDEs) or Career Development Events (CDEs)
into the learning as an authentic assessment of knowledge and/or skills. For example, if your food science
class includes objectives related to developing a product label, your assessment could mirror the National
FFA Food Science CDE Rubric and learners could attend a district, area, or even state event as their
summative assessment.

What does Principle 7 look like in action?

   In an introduction to agricultural mechanics session: Giving learners an exam which allows them to
      identify hand tools after learning about hand tools.

   In a food science class: Using the National FFA Food Science CDE Rubric to assess student ability to
      develop a food nutrition label.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 47

Principle 8: For learners to retain information, they must be repeatedly
prompted to recall concepts.

If a student cannot remember what they learned, the learning process is not complete. Retention is the
most difficult part of learning, as it requires information to be stored in a way that allows recall (Rock, 1957).
Some of the principles we have already discussed (recall of prior knowledge and informing learners of the
objectives) are important to storing information for retention (Rock, 1957), but there are other considerations
to think through as well.

For a learner to be able to retain information, the information must be recalled. Each time a learner is asked
to recall information, they are more likely to retain the information for a longer period of time (Tinto, 1990).
Educators can help this process by looking for opportunities to recall information from prior lessons, units or
even courses. Educators can also help this process by allowing learners to recall information in other content
areas and relate it to their agricultural education classes.

What does Principle 8 look like in action?

   In a meat science workshop: Asking learners to list the bones inside meat cuts and which other bones
      they connect to in a complete carcass, then asking them to identify the bones on the live animal.

   In a greenhouse session: While pinching plants in the greenhouse, quizzing learners on the
      identifications of the plants growing to help with plant ID recall.
48 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Delivering Instruction

Being a good educator means more than just having lesson plans ready to go, it means being prepared to
deliver instruction in a way that allows learners to connect. While well-organized content is the foundation
of any class session, if the educator cannot make a connection with learners, even the best-prepared lesson
might not result in student learning. There are several principles of teaching that are not related to how
content is delivered but are more closely related to how the educator presents themselves and the content
to learners.

What are the characteristics that make an educator good at delivering instruction? If you think back to your
favorite educator, you will likely be able to identify some of the same characteristics educational researchers
have identified. One of the most widely recognized studies on educator characteristics and the relationship
to student achievement is the seminal 1971 study of the relationship between teacher behaviors and student
achievement conducted by Rosenshine and Furst. These researchers conducted a meta-analysis of
numerous studies which examined characteristics of classroom teachers and organized the behaviors into
a set of best practices for educators. There were eleven educator characteristics which were found to
correlate with student achievement, including:

   Clarity
   Variability
   Enthusiasm
   Task-oriented and/or businesslike behaviors
   Criticism
   Student opportunity to learn criterion material
   Use of student ideas and general indirectness
   Use of structuring comments
   Types of questions
   Probing
   Level of difficulty of instruction

The next set of principles of teaching are directly related to the five most prevalent educator characteristics
identified by Rosenshine and Furst (1971) which are: clarity, variability, enthusiasm, task-oriented and/or
businesslike behaviors, and student opportunity to learn criterion material.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 49

Principle 9: Learners learn only when the educator provides clarity in their
instructions, their content, and their expectations.

Rosenshine and Furst (1971) found that the single most prevalent classroom teacher characteristic related
to student achievement was the ability of a teacher to teach with clarity. Clarity is the concept that learners
can comprehend what the educator intends them to know, do, or think. It is not enough for educators to
understand the content, we must also be able to translate our own knowledge into a language learners can
grasp. We must then assemble instructional strategies, practice giving directions to activities, and choose
assessments that are also clear to learners.

Educators that strive for clarity spend less time answering questions from learners related to interpreting
what the educator wants them to do. Educators who demonstrate clarity are more likely to use a linear path
for describing content and assignments, and they understand the content well enough to answer questions
in a straightforward manner. Educators who possess clarity are also more likely to be organized and prepared
for class.

There are several ways educators can improve clarity. First is to prepare a detailed plan for each lesson.
Writing a detailed plan provides time to think through not only the content, but how the educator will move
through the flow of the lesson. Including details in the plan such as how learners will move into groups or
where assignments will be turned in are indicators that the logistics of a lesson are well-conceived and will
be delivered with clarity. Other options for improving clarity as an educator include practicing the lesson
and receiving feedback from a mentor before delivering the lesson; establishing and following classroom
procedures for housekeeping tasks like turning in papers or moving into groups; and providing instructions
at the top of each handout or worksheet.

What does Principle 9 look like in action?

   In a mechanics workshop: Educator highlights places where learners often make mistakes when
      describing a step-by-step plan to change the wire spool in a MIG welder. Learners have a handout which
      they can follow along and read the steps in order to the educator during the demonstration. When asked
      a question, the educator clearly and correctly explains the answer.

   In a learning environment: Educator refers to their plan when breaking learners into groups for a review.
      The instructions for moving into groups were planned out in the lesson plan and the educator clearly
      explains the rules to learners before the review.
50 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Principle 10: Each student learns differently; good instruction has enough
variability to maximize learning opportunities for all learners.

Variability, at its core, addresses inclusivity in a learning environment. Varying our delivery and our
assessment as educators helps ensure every student is included in every learning session. All learners learn
differently. Varying our behaviors as educators provides the opportunity to align some aspect of the learning
environment to the learners' preferences for bringing in or transforming information. In addition, by varying
instruction, educators can prevent learners from becoming bored and losing interest or motivation toward
the content. Variability means using different instructional strategies, types of assessment, instructional
materials, and active learning strategies in every learning environment. As mentioned in principle 5, there
are many ways to present information to learners. Having variability means using many of these strategies
with the same group of learners.

Educators who strive for variability typically have more engaged learners and can reach learners with diverse
learning needs. The more variation you can integrate, the more likely you will be to instruct classes that
align with student learning preferences, giving every student a chance to succeed. Some options to increase
variability as an educator include implementing a new instructional strategy, type of formative assessment,
instructional technology, or type of questions on tests; varying the learning environment by hanging different
instructional aides in the classroom or occasionally changing the flow of your class sessions; and bringing in
a guest speaker to vary the person delivering the information to learners.

What does Principle 10 look like in action?

   In an animal science workshop: Asking learners to create clay models of digestive systems, the next day,
      allowing learners to complete a dissection of a ruminant digestive tract, and the following day, allowing
      them to research digestive disorders on the internet to share with the class.

   In a sustainability workshop: Putting students in groups for discussion, then having them create Venn
      diagrams of the discussion, then allowing them to hear from a specialist in the area of sustainable
      production.

   In a biology session: After playing one online game for reviewing content all year, switching platforms
      and asking learners to use a new game for the review.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 51

Principle 11: Enthusiasm toward a content area is contagious. When the
educator is excited to teach content, learners are more likely to be excited
about learning the content.

Have you ever watched someone teach something they were really excited about? Enthusiasm is contagious.
If educators are passionate and excited about what they are teaching, researchers have found that learners
will increase their engagement, pay closer attention to the topic, and achieve more than when educators
display less passionate about a subject (Keller et al., 2013).

How will our learners know we are excited about a topic? Movement, gestures, and changes in voice can
signal enthusiasm, as can the number of personal stories and facts shared on a topic. By raising our energy
level learners notice our enthusiasm about the topic. You might be thinking, "But what if I'm NOT enthusiastic
about the subject matter?" Consider utilizing a guest speaker who is passionate about the topic or finding a
video, story, or news article that paints the topic in an engaging or exciting light.

What does Principle 11 look like in action?

   In a horse management workshop: Educator shows pictures of hoof deformities, goes into depth on
      the types of corrective shoeing, and shares numerous examples of the importance of hoof care as a
      component of equine health management.

   In a landscape design session: Educator develops numerous ways for learners to remember each plant,
      has learners collect plant samples, and shares stories of what each plant is used for in a landscape.
52 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Principle 12: Learners learn best when educators are businesslike and
approach teaching as a profession.

Educators who are task-oriented or businesslike remember that the goal of teaching is for learners to
understand content. Educators with this characteristic follow a code for professionalism which includes
maintaining high expectations, setting clear behavioral guidelines for the learning environment, and
challenging learners to work to their full potential. By setting an expectation that learners will behave and
challenge themselves, most learners will work to meet those expectations. Being businesslike does not
necessarily mean that educators should not allow fun or enjoyment in the learning environment, it simply
means that student learning is the task at hand. Educators who are informal and playful can still meet a
businesslike principle if the main focus of their work is helping learners grasp concepts.

Businesslike or task-oriented educators work to ensure that transition time (time between learning
activities) is well managed. Task-oriented teachers also follow a schedule for the instructional session which
allows them to meet the objectives in the time allotted. These educators often model laboratory points
after real-life work situations and look for opportunities to incorporate critical thinking and application of
knowledge.

What does Principle 12 look like in action?

   In a fabrication session: Educator provides positive reinforcement to learners who complete their
      cleanup work by following the cleanup chart to meet the expected requirements.

   In a food science workshop: Educator ensures students are learning about the molecular structure of
      foods. While eating the food they make, learners are assessed on their knowledge gain before returning
      to the food lab.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 53

Principle 13: Learners can learn only when they are given opportunities to
practice knowledge and receive immediate assessment.

The amount of time a learners spend practicing and reinforcing knowledge has a direct influence on their
level of achievement. Practice opportunities, followed by immediate feedback, directly aligned to objectives
are critical. Educators need to provide learners with as many opportunities to learn material related to the
objectives as possible. To maximize the opportunity for learners to learn, educators can structure their
class to minimize unneeded information and off-task time. The first thing educators can do to provide
opportunities to learners is to create a structured learning environment. When a learning environment has
procedures for completing logistic tasks (e.g., how to begin a session, roll call, picking up and turning in
papers, using a hall pass, getting supplies), the time available for learners to practice is increased.

Educators can also increase student opportunities by providing supplemental or required learning that
happens outside of the learning session. This might include sending reading material or application practice
home with learners to complete as homework. In a laboratory-based class, this may include extending open
lab hours when learners can work on projects outside of the structured session.

What does Principle 13 look like in action?

   In a natural resources class: Learners will be assessed on their ability to determine water pH. The
      educator gives each student a handout with instructions, test strips, and a practice worksheet that
      allows them to test water at five locations of their choice, then tests the samples to see how close the
      student was to the actual result. Learners are given scores before the test.

   In an agricultural structures class: Learners will be assessed on their ability to measure and cut pieces
      for a project. The educator has learners cut boards at different lengths as a practice and measures each
      board to see how close the student was to the correct length. Learners are individually coached about
      how to adjust measurements if needed.

Student Learning

Knowing what it takes to organize and deliver instruction is just one part of being able to understand how
learning occurs. Each of the previous thirteen principles focus on the role of educators in the learning
process, but there is another side to the learning equation: the learner. Learners are unique individuals, what
works to teach one may not work for another. To help you think about how learners learn, there are a few more
principles of learning to share.

Principle 14: Every learner is unique and has unique learning needs.

No two learners are the same, and no two educators are the same. That means for every student and
every educator combination, the relationship is different. Most classroom teachers and many educators in
nonformal learning environments will encounter learners who have Individualized Education Plans (IEPs) or
other accommodations under a Section 504 designation. In these situations, educators are legally bound to
be flexible and allow learners an opportunity to succeed. Even outside IEP and 504 situations, learners learn
best when educators acknowledge and accommodate students' unique learning preferences and develop
an individualized plan for learning. It may seem farfetched to think that each student should have a slightly
different experience in the learning environment, but it is the mark of a master educator to treat each learner
according to their needs. The process of varying instruction for individual learners is called differentiation.

How can we accommodate every learner? First, masterful educators make the effort to know their learners
as people. By understanding what learners like and dislike and what they believe their talents and
shortcomings are, educators are better able to motivate learners. From an instructional standpoint,
educators create differences in content, process of learning, or assessments for learners based on their
readiness to learn, interests, and individual learning preferences. Some learners move more quickly through
the content because of prior knowledge or increased cognitive ability while some may require more
intervention. How an educator plan for unique differences matters for learner achievement.

When educators are working toward differentiation, instruction is flexible. Educators make decisions for
what learners need based on an ongoing assessment of progress and careful attention to changes in learner
knowledge and behavior. Variability, as mentioned in principle 10, is critical to differentiating instruction.

What does Principle 14 look like in action?

   In a veterinary medicine class: The educator has one student with a 504 requiring modifications on
      time and level of content and another student who is very gifted enjoys video creation. The educator
      modifies most assignments for the student with the 504 to allow the student to do only lower cognitive
      level tasks. The gifted student often finishes assignments and project early, and the educator has
      commissioned the student to create videos of the Veterinary Science CDE practicums to use in their
      practical lab procedure unit.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 55

Principle 15: Learners must be motivated to learn.

If you ask most high school students what they would like to do with their time, very few would respond
that they would prefer to be in school five days a week. Although school and learning are critical for brain
development and social development, many learners would prefer not to spend their time in a formalized
learning environment. Educators serve as the motivators for learning in both formal and informal settings.
Motivated learners take the initiative to learn content, complete assignments, and assess their own progress
toward learning objectives. Motivation is also an important predictor of knowledge and overall achievement.
Learners who are more motivated to learn persist through challenges, put in more effort, are more likely to
engage with the content, and perform better in classes and on standardized tests.

There are two main classifications of student motivation, intrinsic and extrinsic (Rotter, 1966). Intrinsic
motivation comes from the satisfaction of the activity itself rather than an outside reward. This type of
motivation is more likely to persist across content areas and directly correlates with increased effort.
Extrinsic motivation is driven by an external reward like grades. Both types of motivation play a role in
learning.

How can educators motivate learners? There are several things successful educators use to motivate
learners:

   Give positive reinforcement of learning
   Set goals for learning and celebrate accomplishment
   Be excited about student performance
   Give learners choices about the content/topic
   Variability
   Relate topics to student life
   Help learners see their progress
   External rewards (e.g., praise, progress charts, tangible items) (Rotter, 1966)

What does Principle 15 look like in action?

   In a youth STEM workshop: Learners are given the opportunity to choose their topic for a science fair
      project. The educator knows a student is passionate about plants and suggests the student use the
      school greenhouse to complete the project, then informs the class that the top scoring project in each
      category will advance to a district-level event.
56 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

Principle 16: Learners learn more rapidly when they receive detailed
feedback for their efforts immediately after demonstrating their knowledge.

How do we feel when someone tells us did the right thing? Positive reinforcement is one of the best ways
to motivate people (Walker & Buckley, 1968). Providing positive feedback to learners can help motivate
additional learning and stimulate desire to continue learning the subject matter. Providing developmental
feedback can help learners correct errors in their knowledge or skill before those misunderstandings are
firmly rooted in their mind.

What are the best tips for providing feedback to learners? To begin, researchers recommend being as
specific as possible about the actions that led to the feedback. Giving learners the comment "Great job!" is
not nearly as effective as saying "You did a wonderful job creating balance and form in this floral design."
The more specific feedback is to learners, the more likely it is that they will repeat the positive behavior.
Keeping developmental feedback focused on the learning objectives ensures that we are avoiding criticism
that could be taken personally. The next tip is to give feedback as quickly as possible, which has a direct
influence on increasing the effectiveness of the feedback. Learners are also more likely to receive feedback
from an educator if they have already self-assessed their performance and know how their current actions
impact a larger goal.

What does Principle 16 look like in action?

   In an electricity workshop: Educator builds excitement in the learners about seeing their lightbulbs light
      when creating a lighting board. Every time a student's light comes on, they give a standing ovation to the
      student then asks the student to complete a self-assessment worksheet on their own performance.
                                                                                       PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 57

Principle 17: Learners learn better when they think about how they learn.

What is the best location for you to study? Do you prefer complete silence, or is background music more
helpful to you? The ability to think about our own thinking is called metacognition. Learners with
metacognitive abilities achieve at higher levels (McCormick, 2003). As learners increase awareness of how
they acquire knowledge, learners can learn to regulate their behavior to optimize learning. They begin to
see how their strengths and weaknesses affect how they perform and are more likely to play a role in their
own self-assessment of knowledge (Zimmerman & Schunk, 2001). Metacognition can also play a role in
learners becoming reflective about other areas of their lives. Researchers cite correlations between higher
metacognitive abilities and increased self-awareness in social settings, increased ability to understand
differences in others, and increased intrinsic motivation.

With so many benefits to metacognition, we might be wondering how educators can help learners improve
their metacognitive abilities. Most importantly, educators can help learners recognize that their minds are
programmed for growth. Teaching learners growth mindset concepts can increase their academic and social
achievements (Dweck, 2006). Educators can also provide additional practice for concepts learners struggle
with, prompt learners to reflect on coursework and their understanding of concepts, and increase the
cognitive level of assessments, which allows learners to deepen their knowledge of a subject.

What does Principle 17 look like in action?

   In an agricultural biology class: Educator asks learners to complete an exit ticket which responds to
      three prompts: (1) What was the easiest concept for me to understand? Why? (2) What was the most
      challenging concept for me to understand? Why? (3) What strategies will work best for me when I study
      for the genetics exam?

Putting It All Together

Becoming a masterful educator is about more than just organizing curriculum and delivering instruction, it
also requires an understanding of the core principles that help guide instructional decisions. Think back to
your favorite educator. Which of the principles of teaching and learning could you identify in the way they
taught? Incorporating all the principles in this chapter into daily instruction and action as an educator can
take time. As we develop our skills as educators, these principles can help guide the way we think about
teaching and learning. By taking time to align what we do to these principles, we are taking the first step
toward becoming the educators that someone will reflect on one day as their favorite.

Still wondering how these lessons look in practice? The best way to become proficient at integrating these
principles is to practice. Some practice tips for principles of teaching and learning in each area are as
follows:

   Principles of Organizing Content
         Practice planning out a scope and sequence for a course over a school year. Begin by determining
            the course objectives and then break down the things learners should know or do into a logical
            sequence of events.
         Practice writing lessons that include all the nine events of instruction.
         Have a peer, mentor educator, or educator education faculty review your unit plans and daily lesson
            plans. Their expertise can help you identify areas of strength and areas for improvement.
         Teach your lessons! Sometimes the best way to find the errors in organizing content is to present
            your lessons to learners. Reflect at the end of the lesson and think about which principles were or
            were not embedded or shared with learners.

   Principles of Delivering Instruction
         Spend some time thinking about your own progress toward each of the characteristics of an
            effective educator as set forth by Rosenshine and Furst. Which of the characteristics come
            naturally to you? Which will you need to spend some time focusing on integrating? This reflective
            process can allow you to pinpoint areas for continued improvement. Some of the best educators
            honed their skills through careful reflection and continual improvement, and you can too.
         Video yourself teaching. Sometimes watching a video of your own instruction can be a powerful
            glimpse at what learners see when you are teaching. Take the time to identify places where you
            demonstrated principles of delivering instruction and make a note of principles that were not
            evident. As a bonus, you can see what university supervisors and administrators get to see when
            you are evaluated on your teaching abilities. Find the rubric they will use to evaluate you and
            complete your own self-assessment.

   Principles of Student Learning
         Review your lesson plans and make sure you have taken into consideration differentiation in
            instruction, student motivation, how you will provide feedback, and how you will help learners learn
            about their learning.
                                                                                  PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING | 59
    Take advantage of every opportunity to learn from each student how to be a better educator. Make

       a note of what works for learners and make every effort to replicate things that have worked in the
       past.

Learning Confirmation

   1. Define the following terms:
           a. Teaching
           b. Learning

   2. Explain why teachers should incorporate principles of teaching and learning in their instruction.
   3. Describe the differences between Principles of Organizing Content, Principles of Delivering Instruction, and

        Principles of Student Learning.
   4. Watch a recording of a teacher in action. Identify the principles of teaching and learning you can see

        exhibited in the lesson.
   5. Make a plan for integrating each of the principles of teaching and learning within a lesson. How will you

        make sure to address each component?

Applying the Content

You are teaching a plant science lesson in a secondary-school-based agricultural program. Your lesson is on the
parts of a plant and their functions. You know that your administrator will be coming in to observe your teaching
and expects to see all the principles of teaching and learning on display. How will you develop a lesson that
incorporates all the principles of teaching and learning? Outline how you will integrate the principles for planning
instruction, delivering instruction, and facilitating student learning into this lesson.
60 | PRINCIPLES OF TEACHING AND LEARNING

     Reflective Questions

         1. Are there some principles that you feel more aligned with? Consider how you will use your personal
             strengths to use these principles to your advantage.

        2. Are there some principles that you feel more disconnected from? Knowing how to integrate the principles
             you aren't as comfortable with can help you strengthen potential deficits in your teaching.

        3. How do the principles of teaching and learning change based on the personalities of students or the
             teacher?

       Glossary of Terms
             teaching: The process of mutual exchange and/or relationship among an educator, learners, and
                curriculum or society
             learning: The process of acquiring and transforming information into knowledge which can be
                assimilated, transformed, and processed by the learner

4. LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING

Carla Jagger

Setting the Stage

We all face countless problems each and every day, whether it is deciding what to wear based on key factors
about our day or trying to solve an issue at work. While these seem like rather insignificant problems, we still
go through the same processes for these problems as we do for the more complex and challenging issues we
inevitably face. When we look at our agriculture programs, we encounter and present problems constantly
through our curriculum and even through the basic operations of our classroom. Let's consider the following
situation together:

         Your students start noticing that the classroom pet is not eating all their food and they have not needed
         to fill the pet's water as frequently either. They are growing concerned and are unsure of how to address
         the situation or determine the potential causes of the pet's new behavior.
When students bring this issue forward, it might be easy for us to offer possible causes and answers to their
questions based on our knowledge of the pet. However, more in depth learning can take place if we help
facilitate and lead the students through an investigation of their own to determine possible solutions.

     Objectives

     Within teaching and learning, problem-solving is a key method for us to utilize so we can help our learners
     practice and master the process of solving complex issues as they arise. You will also see, as we unpack this
     method of teaching, that the learning process is placed on the students with our guidance, making it a student-
     centered approach to teaching. By the conclusion of the chapter, you should be able to:

          Define the problem-solving approach.
          Identify best practices for executing the problem-solving approach.
          Utilize problem-solving as a teaching strategy.
64 | LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING

Introduction

Problem-solving is not a new concept in Career and Technical Education and agricultural education. Many
individuals have contributed to our knowledge of problem-solving in teaching and learning within the
agricultural setting over the decades. This list includes Krebs (1967), Crunkilton & Krebs (1982), Gubitz (1984),
and Hedges (1996), many of whom link their work back to the foundations of problem-solving laid out by John
Dewey.

Overview

If we look back at Dewey's foundational work, we see him place importance on the social nature of learning.
He stressed a means of problem-solving that focused on the social role of people and stressed that our
society benefits from the broader community and by making connections across cultures. Tanner (1997)
evaluated Dewey's Laboratory School and the concepts that educators should still consider when developing
our teaching and learning approach, which includes educating students in the problems of living together. In
our agricultural education programs, we have a unique opportunity to connect our content back to issues in
our local communities as well as statewide, nationwide, and worldwide. Additionally, there is an opportunity
to foster service-involved thinking and social sensitivity and to create socially and civically responsible
individuals through our programs. Problem-solving and other heuristic approaches (i.e., inquiry learning,
discovery learning) to teaching and learning are a means by which we can achieve some of our internal goals
of creating well-rounded, civically engaged students.

While there are many variations when defining problem-solving as a teaching approach, for this chapter, we
will use Moore's (2015) working definition of problem-solving as "the intentional elimination of uncertainty
through direct experiences and under supervision" (p. 353)--in other words, creating space for learners to
generate new knowledge using problem-solving strategies with guidance. These problems can be planned
and prepared for or spontaneous, occurring on their own. The key points of this definition are "direct
experiences" and "under supervision." Problem-solving is an active teaching approach and is student-
centered, which means students will be directly involved with the creation of knowledge regarding the
problem at hand. Additionally, "under supervision" should not be forgotten as a part of this definition.
Although students will encounter problems on their own to work through, we should still provide supervision,
guidance, and advice in all situations that are part of our curriculum. As we begin to unpack the problem-
solving approach, you will see there is a systematic approach to this teaching technique.
                                                                                                   LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING | 65

Executing the Problem-Solving Approach

Within our various teaching spaces in agricultural education, we will typically plan for problems and issues
we want our students to solve. We do this through creating Units of Instruction and laying out problem areas
within the content. Embedding problem areas within our Units of Instruction helps to bring focus to the
content and should be connected to other areas of instruction to help with students' transfer of learning. If
we do not properly identify the problem area, our approach may not be as effective. Without proper planning,
we could have a problem that is too narrow, which will limit the analysis we can lead our students through,
or we could plan for a problem that is too broad, which could result in confusion. Additionally, while planning
our overall program of study, it is important to line up our Units of Instruction and problem areas using a
seasonal approach based on your regional area and community needs (e.g., developing an integrated pest
management plan around the specific plants being grown in your school's greenhouse, identifying how to
protect against common diseases based on the crops currently growing in your area).

While we should plan for problem-solving, we also cannot discount the "teachable moments," the problems
and issues that just naturally arise in our program that can be solved. It is important to involve your students
in the generation of solutions and use the problem as a learning experience when possible. If we plan for
the problem-solving approach and build our ability to execute this method, it will become natural for us to
include students in those other issues that come up on their own (e.g., sick animals, equipment breaking, an
immediate school or community need).

Steps to the Problem-Solving Approach

Hopefully by this point you are wondering how to execute this strategy within your teaching. The problem-
solving approach includes five basic steps, which you'll see vary from source to source. In general, these
include:

 1. Identify the problem
 2. Analyze the problem and gather information
 3. Generate potential solutions
 4. Select and test solutions
 5. Evaluate the results

Identify the problem. One of the most challenging elements of problem-solving as a teaching approach is
clearly defining the problem to be addressed. The problem itself should not be too narrow or too board as
both can lead to confusion. Unless a problem naturally arises, we must plan for the problem and clearly
present it to our learners. In addition to identifying the problem, we also need to create interest and motivate
our learners to want to explore solutions to the problem. Motivating our learners is ultimately the hidden
step to the problem-solving approach, but this substep should not go unaddressed. Refer to the Principles of
Teaching and Learning related to motivation for good teaching actions for motivating your learners.
66 | LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING

Analyze the problem and gather information. Once the problem has been clearly presented, students should
move into the next step to explore the problem. As with most behaviors, you will probably need to spend a
little time training your learners how to efficiently analyze the problem. Train them on how to track down
credible sources, how to critically analyze information, how to look at all possible angles, and how to
synthesize the information gathered, just to name a few approaches. Once you help with the collection and
analysis of information a few times, you should be able to take a more hands-off approach with that same
group of learners as you continue to facilitate more problem-based instruction. The analysis of the problem
should help lead to the next step of generating possible solutions.

Generate potential solutions. During this step you should let your learners share all potential solutions no
matter the expenses associated or how crazy the idea might sound. Encourage your students to justify their
solution based on the information gathered to help keep them on track. Depending on how you design the
activity, invite all learners to share potential solutions. For example, if you are solving the problem as a
whole class make it an assignment for each student to generate their own solution(s). Or if you have small
cooperative groups working on the problem, put in safeguards like assigning student group moderators who
will ensure all students have a voice in the process (see the section on group teaching techniques in chapter
8 for more ideas). Do your best not to limit creative thought since you will begin to collectively identify the
better solution(s) to test as you move into the fourth step.

Select and test solutions. As you can see this is a two-step action of the problem-solving approach. You will
begin this step by evaluating the list of possible solutions based on feasibility as a class. Since students were
not limited in their thinking during the previous step, you will need to have the conversation now about what
you can test based on your resources. You could start by asking your students to identify any of the solutions
that might be too extreme in terms of costs, time, resources, and so on. Once you have narrowed down your
list, it will be easier to identify the better solutions to test. If you have multiple feasible and testable solutions,
consider splitting up the class to test the possible solutions, or you can test them out together one-by-one
as a whole class.

Evaluate the results. Once you have successfully tested your solution(s) have your students evaluate the
results. Was the solution successful in addressing the problem? If so, how could the solution be improved
to better address the problem? If it was not successful, how could you modify parts of the solution to
test it again? These are just a few questions you could have your students address as they reflect on the
solution(s) tested. As you know, we can learn a lot from failures during the problem-solving process so do not
discount failed solutions, make them a learning opportunity. Even if your first tested solution is successful,
have students evaluate the process to identify if a more effective and efficient approach could exist. At a
minimum, make sure you evaluate the results as a whole class. If cooperative groups were used during the
process, consider having each group share their results so everyone can learn from one another.

Good Practices while Executing the Problem-Solving Approach

Earlier you were introduced to the Principles of Teaching and Learning in chapter 3; you'll therefore be able
to identify several of these principles through the good practices laid out below. In other words, as you
incorporate the Principles of Teaching and Learning into your lessons you will also be using these good
practices and vice versa. While utilizing problem-solving techniques, there are several actions that we can
incorporate which will help make our students' learning meaningful (Krebs, 1967).

 1. Help students connect the parts of the problem situation to the broader issue. Typically, our students
      hold novice knowledge on topics we cover. As novice learners, students need guidance in making
      connections between topics and identifying larger issues that may play a role in the problem.

 2. Incorporate the immediate use of knowledge. We know this is an important step for all learning; if
      immediate action is not taken with a problem situation, students may fail to see the problem's relevance
      and importance.

 3. Make the objectives of the problem-solving approach clear. There are several approaches described
      later in this chapter that can be used when laying out a problem situation for students. All the described
      techniques will help give the problem situation structure and clarity when presenting the problem to
      your learners.

 4. Build in transfer of knowledge connections. Each problem situation we present will typically be very
      specific, so we should aim at building in additional opportunities for students to use the problem-solving
      techniques in other situations.

 5. Use a variety of activities within the learning situation. Using a variety of learning activities can reach
      learners in different ways. With the steps of problem-solving laid out earlier, we can utilize a variety
      of individual and group teaching techniques to help accomplish the objectives of the problem-solving
      approach.

 6. Connect the problem situation to the students' personal lives to make the learning more meaningful.
      Additionally, build in opportunities for your students to set their own problems and inquiry ideas.

 7. Incorporate cooperative learning. We learn from each other with problem-solving so work on making the
      activity a collective effort.

 8. Allow students to succeed. We know that success is a strong motivating force. Students who experience
      failure often will tend to shut down in the learning environment. When we start to practice problem-
      solving with students, we should build in opportunities for our students to be successful in discovering
      solutions as we train them through the approach.

Pitfalls to Avoid when Executing the Problem-Solving Approach

In addition to the good practices above, there are several pitfalls we should avoid with a problem-solving
teaching approach. As we reflect on each problem-solving teaching experience, we begin to recognize these
pitfalls that lead to confusion and frustration for both us and our students. Naming these pitfalls in advance
and building in supports to avoid them will help with the effectiveness and efficiency of the problem-solving
teaching strategy.

 1. Unsuitable unit or problem area. Make sure the unit and problem has relevance to the students and your
      community. This also ties back to taking a seasonal approach to problem-based learning.

 2. Inadequate teacher analysis of the situation related to the problem area. When planning for the problem
      situations, we should do our own research of the problem and have a general direction in mind for
      possible solutions before the students start walking through the steps of problem-solving on their own.

 3. Inadequate teacher objectives. Not introducing appropriate objectives can lead to confusion of the
      problem situation and execution of the techniques you have tried to plan.

 4. Omission of the interest approach or allowing the interest approach to become the problem-solving
      situation. Omitting the interest approach may lead to a lack of student motivation in solving the issue.
      We know that learning is not passive; without motivation there will be no drive for the students to
      participate in the learning.

 5. Poor discussion-leading technique. We should use appropriate prompting and probing questions during
      discussion to help facilitate learning while also giving students creative freedom. If we are not careful,
      we could be too leading in our prompts or completely give away potential solutions which tends to defeat
      the purpose of the problem-solving approach.

 6. Lack of orientation at the start and the end of the class period. As with any content or approach to
      teaching we need to include appropriate lesson introductions and summaries that can help students see
      the larger picture and make cognitive connections.

Overall, there is a lot of variation you can add to all these steps when executing the problem-solving
approach. Keeping the basic steps in mind, along with the best practices and pitfalls to avoid, will help to
provide overall structure to the activity. In addition to problem-solving, there are several other heuristic
teaching strategies we can incorporate in our teaching, including inquiry-based instruction, discovery
learning, and experimentation.
                                     LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING | 69

Other Heuristic Teaching Strategies

While these approaches are very similar to problem-based instruction, there are differences in the purpose
and structure. Moore (2015) lays out each of these additional methods including discovery, inquiry, and
project-based learning methods. Discovery learning in essence is a formal approach to problem-solving
using the scientific method. The steps involved with discovery learning are nearly identical to the five steps
already established for problem-solving. With this approach you would identify a problem, develop possible
solutions, collect data, analyze and interpret data, and test conclusions. As you work through this strategy,
the steps will ultimately lead to the need for revised solutions or provide supporting evidence for the chosen
solution.

Inquiry learning is another problem-solving strategy, where emphasis is typically placed on the process of
determining a solution rather than finding a solution for the problem. This approach would be very useful
when trying to work through more of a hypothetical problem when you may not have all the resources needed
to test possible solutions. There are multiple approaches to inquiry-based instruction (Moore, 2015) including
a three-step procedure (identify the problem, work toward solutions, and establish solutions) and the five-E
inquiry sequence (engage, explore, explain, elaborate, and evaluate).

Additionally, project-based instruction, although not always tied to a problem situation, can at times have
a natural connection to the problem-solving depending on your approach to student engagement with the
problem. For instance, you may decide on a specific product the students need to create as they determine
solutions such as case studies, surveys, models, and so on. With all these strategies, you typically have
options on how structured or flexible you want to make the active learning for your students.

Encouraging Individual Problem-Solving

In addition to working through problem situations collectively, our learners are also engaged in problem-
solving through their Supervised Agricultural Experiences (SAE), in which they will need to solve problems on
their own. Problem-solving is a skill which needs to be developed and practiced like any other skill, adding
to the value of us incorporating problem-solving to our classroom learning so students can solve their own
problems successfully. Gubitz (1984) identified several questions that can be proposed for learners to engage
in problem-solving on their own, including:

 1. What is the specific problem?
 2. What really is the source of irritation?
 3. Why is it so bothersome?
 4. Who is involved?
 5. When did it start?
 6. How is the problem "ours" to do something about?
70 | LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING

While these questions are somewhat broad, we can tailor them for our students and their situations. We
know that students will face many problem situations while carrying out their SAE projects and it is
important that we help facilitate their identification of solutions instead of just providing them with a
solution. Most of us have the goal of learners becoming independent and being able to establish knowledge
on their own, but this ability comes with practice. Several methods for providing practice to learners are laid
out in the following section.

How Problem-Solving Looks in Agricultural Education

There are many ways to set up a problem-solving situation for your students. Hedges (1996) created a
resource for Career and Technical Education (CTE) that lays out several of these approaches along with
lesson vignettes from in-service CTE teachers. All the example approaches explained here are summarized
versions of the original work laid out by Hedges and the contributing teachers (1996).

The first technique for laying out a problem is key steps, used when there are specific steps required for the
successful completion of a task. Typically, the Key Steps technique will be partnered with a demonstration of
the needed steps. This technique is extremely useful for objectives centered around using and maintaining
equipment. No matter which curriculum we are using, nearly all courses have equipment of some kind that
require the set of steps to use it properly.

The second technique is the forked-road approach, where there are two choices for the problem solution,
and you need to consider the advantages and disadvantages of both options. Looking at an example from
animal sciences, you may choose to use this technique when asking students to decide when to keep or cull
a cow from the herd, or from veterinary science, when deciding to use euthanasia in determining whether
treatment is possible with a sick animal. When carrying out this technique you want to make sure you identify
the decision that needs to be made as well as lay out all key factors that should be considered in making
an informed decision. As students reach their decision between the two options, it is good practice to have
each student justify their choice.

The possibilities-factors technique sets up a problem with more than one solution when several factors
must be considered to select the most appropriate solution. You might plan for this approach when asking
students to choose the most appropriate harvesting or transplanting method for a specific plant. For this
technique, you will want to clearly present the problem statement and have your learners list all the possible
choices (this step is also great for review of previously learned content). Once all the possibilities have been
listed, you would ask the students to discuss all the factors that should be considered before making their
decision.
                                                                                                    LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING | 71

The situation-to-be-improved approach can be used when specific characteristics or requirements should
be considered for a situation. Students are presented with important information about the situation such
as the requirements needed for the successful execution of the situation, and they would then give
recommendations for improvements. This technique could be used in a natural resources unit when
examining the interdependence of an ecosystem. For example, you might present students with the issue
that a local landfill will reach its maximum capacity soon, so how can you make it last longer? After the issue
is presented, the students would then discuss characteristics to be considered and possibly layout the "ideal"
situation. Once that information is identified, they would determine the what and why for all characteristics
to help them arrive at recommendations for improvement of the situation.

A fifth approach is the effect-cause technique, where causes of an issue would be evaluated to determine
appropriate options for action. For this technique, we can consider an example from landscape or turfgrass
management: a mower is not cutting evenly when used on a putting green, what is the cause of the problem?
To help students determine the cause, additional information would need to be presented; this information
could potentially be presented in a case study format or given more simply, such as by adding that the mower
leaves an incline with every pass and the operator has already checked the air in the tires as well as the height
of the deck and both were fine. These additional details will help students make a more informed decision
when trying to determine the cause of the issue.

Finally, problems could be presented using the four-question interest approach. Four questions should all
be considered by the learners:

 1. How important is ...?
 2. What problems have we had with ...?
 3. What do we need to know or be able to do to correct or prevent these problems?
 4. What related information are we lacking?

Using this technique can help motivate students by involving them in the planning and execution of the
lesson. Through their responses to the four questions, as an interest approach, they will develop ownership
for the direction and success of the lesson and provide a foundation for critical thinking and selecting
which additional problem-solving techniques should be used. An example of this technique would be, if you
had a group that has limited knowledge of identifying and interpreting nonverbal messages, the specific
questions you would ask the learners would then be: How important is it to be able to recognize and interpret
nonverbal communication? What problems are associated with reading nonverbal messages? And what do
we need to know and/or be able to do in order to solve and/or prevent these problems? The students would
provide answers to all these questions within the interest approach of the lesson, and then you would be
able to use additional problem-solving techniques as you move through the actual lesson content. The fourth
question--What specific information are we lacking concerning what we said we need to know and/or be able
to do?--is more of a lead-in question to begin teaching around the issue or specific skill.
72 | LEARNING AS PROBLEM SOLVING

     Learning Confirmation

         1. Identify a problem situation you will present to your learners and layout which problem-solving technique
             you will use for the situation. Make sure you name the technique and establish how you will facilitate each
             step of the problem-solving approach.

        2. Using a Venn diagram, compare and contrast two problem-solving techniques of your choice and consider
             the characteristics of the technique and when each technique would be used and why.

     Applying the Content

         1. Prepare or adapt a technical lesson that can be taught in a local context utilizing one of the problem-
             solving techniques.

        2. Utilize one of the problem-solving techniques to create an interest approach for an existing lesson.
        3. Use one of the problem-solving approaches to create a nonformal lesson with a leadership topic.

     Reflective Questions

         1. What are the five steps of the problem-solving approach?
        2. What are similar teaching techniques to problem-solving?
        3. Which problem-solving technique would be best when trying to make a decision between two options?
        4. What specific supports will you put into place when designing a problem-solving activity to conduct with

             your learners?

5. INCLUSIVE TEACHING

Stacy K. Vincent and Donna Westfall-Rudd

Setting the Stage

In the early 1970s, Dr. Henry Schmitt asked, "Will middle-class White Anglo-Saxon Protestant vocational
agriculture teachers accept minority youth and adults enrolled in vocational education in agriculture?" (1971).
Schmitt posed this question to agricultural education institutions soon after the desegregation of public
schools, the creation of consolidated school districts, and the merger of the New Farmers of America
(NFA) and the Future Farmers of America (FFA). His corresponding study focused on designing "professional
experiences that will prepare teachers for urban and rural minority children, youth, and adults" (p. 20).
The chapter is grounded in the multicultural education literature (Banks, 2008) that coincidentally began
to emerge at the same time Dr. Schmitt published his dissertation. Since Schmitt's study, secondary and
postsecondary agricultural educators have had sporadic discussions about the learning needs and
experiences of underrepresented minority students in local programs. Still today, we, as educators, face the
challenges of including all students in local agricultural education experiences.

Objectives

The purpose of this chapter is to provide readers with the opportunity to:
     Discover the importance of developing knowledge of individual cultures and identities to support and
        engage students in agricultural education.
     Investigate how to connect intersecting student and teacher identities within agricultural education
        courses to obtain multicultural autonomy.
     Apply multicultural and inclusive teaching practices in an agricultural education classroom.

Introduction

Unfortunately, society constructs an identity about an individual without ever getting to know them. For
some individuals, this may be a positive construction of identity; however, it may never reflect who one truly
is, nor how they want to be known. Social identifiers, as listed in table 5.1, are dispositions that are integrated
into one's identity and therefore dictate their interactions with other individuals. On the other hand, personal
identifiers are distinguished characteristics for which the individual personally recognizes who they are and
whom they associate with based on commonalities.

Overview

Addressing the needs of all students can seem like a daunting task for early-career educators. This chapter
is intended to help educators begin the process of purposefully planning courses, FFA opportunities, and
Supervised Agricultural Experiences (SAEs) to be inclusive of all student cultures and identities that may be
present in the local program. While this may initially seem too big of a challenge, this chapter intends to offer
a foundation of knowledge and recommended practices to support the implementation of multicultural and
inclusive teaching practices.

Multicultural Autonomy

Are we good teachers? Of course, we want to be good teachers and desire to make a positive difference
for students. But what does it take to make a positive difference in the lives of students? Though perhaps
surprising to our noneducation friends, we would all agree that simply providing the details for learning a
particular task does not reflect a methodology that inherently creates a positive life-long connection.

When examining our reason for considering the profession of educating others about agriculture, our
inspiration comes from a myriad of approaches, such as respect toward a previous instructor, a passion for
helping youth, or our deep inquiry within the content area. Coincidentally, whichever approach, our vision of
who we will deliver the content to is skewed by what we know. To simplify this understanding, let's examine
your palette. Let's say that your entire life, the only meal you had consumed and visually recognized was pizza;
how could you envision, understand, and relate to the taste, smell, and visual of sushi? It cannot happen. The
same visualization for our attempt to educate others is biased toward only what we have seen, experienced,
and exposed ourselves to.

This process is called the Apprenticeship of Observation (Lortie, 1975). We gain efficacy in our ability (in
this context, teaching) based on our observations and experiences in the past. Therefore, it is difficult to
identify what our classroom, and who the students we will educate, will become if we have never exposed
ourselves to anything different. While the diversification of exposure does not predict your ability to be a
quality educator, it limits the overall volume and diversification of whom you positively impact.

But what if we were knowledgeable in the pizza community as well as the sushi community? And what if
the more we expand in the pizza and sushi community, our awareness, knowledge, and attitude grow and
expand? Now we have the ability to connect the two communities so they can find ways to work together.
Similarly, a teacher can gain students' trust from various cultural backgrounds without letting go of their
own identity. In doing so, we must immerse ourselves in the different cultural communities to expand our
competence levels. When an individual can competently work and communicate with multiple cultural
groups and be accepted within the groups, we call this ability multicultural autonomy (Vincent & Westfall-
Rudd, 2022). The individual would not have to change their core identity to fully obtain multicultural
autonomy. An individual cannot simply wake up and determine that they have multicultural autonomy. This
concept takes work and patience and is ongoing. To reach the point that autonomy is possible, a teacher
must begin with self-reflection of (a) awareness, (b) attitude, and (c) skills. For a visual of multicultural
autonomy, see figure 5.1.
78 | INCLUSIVE TEACHING

      Figure 5.1: Multicultural autonomy growth model. Figure description.

Self-Awareness

Harris (2001) recognized that a lot goes into the identity of self. We are labeled and identify ourselves,
whether it is correct or not, by social identity (i.e., race/ethnicity, language/dialect, religion, age, sexual
orientation, educational level, body type, socioeconomics, ability, family structure, geographic location,
etc.). Social identifiers can be helpful and harmful in the perceptions of those around us. One of this chapter's
authors, Stacy, recalls a time social identifiers impacted him:

         "I recall, as a child, on a weekend trip out of my home state, my parents sent me to get extra towels
         from the hotel staff. The hostess loved my accent, and when she discovered I was from Kentucky, she
         looked over the counter and said, "Wow, you have shoes!" My social identity, in this instance, personified
         a negative stereotype."
However, our self-identity also encapsulates an area many individuals never see or value if it is not
recognized in our workplace, also known as personal identity. Our identity (i.e., talents, likes, peculiarities,
personality, political beliefs, ways of doing things, introversion/extroversion, skills, uniqueness, etc.) also
plays a major role in defining who we are.
Before we can ever have more than a minimal impact in our classroom, we must become aware of who we
are. While our lives continue to experience memories and our interactions diversify, so should our continued
reflection and awareness, which inadvertently changes our self-identity.
                                                                                                                     INCLUSIVE TEACHING | 79

As teenagers, we grew in our self-awareness, but it didn't keep adults from telling us to check our attitude.
It is good advice (although probably not in the tone or format they were referring to). Gay and Kirkland (2003)
believe it is crucial to self-reflect on our attitude during critical cultural moments. These critical moments
often occur in the presence of major global events that may be happening. Although we may ignore many
of the issues, we must take a second to reflect on our attitude as to why we are choosing to ignore it.
The same reflection must occur when we are experiencing anger, sadness, excitement, happiness, and
disappointment (Vincent & Drape, 2019). It is very important to note that the reflection of these attitudes is
explicit and should not be confused with implicit attitudes (Benaji & Greenwald, 2013). Still, this chapter will
not be expanding into it.

Self-Attitude

As Stacy was entering high school, the rapper (at that time, now better known as an actor) Ice Cube, released
a song titled "Check Yo Self," and one of the lines that always stuck with him in the song was So come on and
chickity check yo self before you wreck yo self. Cube (as Stacy refers to him, because they're buds) understood
self-identify's second construct: self-attitude. In this area, we begin to examine our attitudes.

It is not difficult to determine our attitude by simply taking a stroll through our social media outlets and
examining what we like, share, post, read, and follow when a topic of controversy comes across our feed.
Now, we may not follow a lot on social media, but we do speak with colleagues on occasional topics or
read articles regarding the mishandling of particular issues. In these instances, do you ever find yourself
reading the comments that some brave souls posted? During your read, you will find yourself shocked by the
ludicrous statements or nodding your head to the realization that someone else believes the same thing. At
that instant, we should begin to restate, reflect upon, or simply rap Ice Cube's lyrics and simply "check yo self."

Attitude is crucial in how others perceive us and how we interpret someone else's attitude. Of course, we all
have our peeves, but by not keeping your attitude in check, you begin to "wreck yo self." Let's go through an
example together.

Silvia is having a difficult day on her way to school. There are relationship issues between her and her
boyfriend, and her mother just told her that she could not stay after school due to parental assistance needed
once she returns home to her adolescent siblings. At the same time, you are having a difficult day as well. You
arrived a few minutes late and spilled coffee on your pants a few minutes before class began. In expressing
herself only as she understands, Silvia walks into your classroom, slams her books on her desk, and storms
out, muttering explicit words (also from an Ice Cube song).
80 | INCLUSIVE TEACHING
How do you react? Do you go after her, express your feelings toward her methods, and ask that she share her
feelings with the school principal? Do you take a second to realize that you (a) have a coffee-stained pair of
pants and (b) are not in the right attitude to come to grips with how her day is crumbling? Most of us have
seen how option one plays out. The teacher and the student go into an embarrassing shouting match where
the student, the student's guardian, and the student's siblings will have a very bad day, and you end up on a
video blasted on social media. Did you win? Maybe you got a shot in the ego arm, but you gained nothing in
your ability to examine your self-attitude and continued to make impulse decisions no matter the spirit of
your attitude. Honestly, attitude can be an endangering or a strengthening tool.

Self-Skill

Before having a classroom of our own, we determine the teaching style that works best for us and the
students we are teaching. How do we know, though? Of course, our peers tell us it was a great lesson, but
they have had similar classes from the same professors and received the information exactly like you did.
The students to whom we provided the lessons may have seemed engaged, but were they from the best
practicum of classes with students who are passionate about the content? Even our professor could inform
us that it was structurally a sound lesson, but they are now removed from the culture in the classroom that
you are about to enter. Bottom line, the group that we have provided lessons to thus far reflects very similar
awareness levels, attitudes, and cultural beliefs to those that we have; therefore, we have to ask ourselves
"does our pedagogical skill work in a classroom of students who think, look, and behave differently than
those coming from the cultures to which we have ourselves been exposed?" Sometimes, we never fathom
the extent of this question until we enter our classroom.

Creating a Multicultural Agricultural Classroom

There are multiple approaches that a teacher considers as they craft their lessons for the upcoming school
year. One of the most important approaches is developing a curriculum that encompasses a multicultural
path. Banks (2008) introduced four levels to approaching a multicultural curriculum (see figure 5.2) that can
provide a scaffolding on which teachers can build their pedagogical skills and knowledge when creating a
multicultural classroom and agricultural education program.

               Figure 5.2: Approaches to multicultural curriculum reform. Figure description.
                                                                                                                     INCLUSIVE TEACHING | 81

Throughout the country, schools and classrooms are finding methods to integrate cultural differences inside
and outside the community. One of the approaches, level 1, the contribution approach, occurs when teachers
integrate holidays and cultural celebrations into the course activities, such as African American History
Month, Cinco de Mayo, Women's History Week, and Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage Month.
The contribution approach is an initial step that compliments the other three strategies, primarily focusing
on heroes, holidays, and discrete cultural elements. In the agricultural education curriculum, teachers can
incorporate these cultural items into many of the courses in a local program. (See table 5.2.)

Subject  Level 1 Implementation

Floriculture Introduce cultural holidays and images of floral designs seen in cultural holidays.

Animal   Identify the geographic origins of livestock breeds.
Science

Food     Develop a bulletin board displaying the production and processing of foods specifically for various
Science  cultural markets to meet the diversity of cultural food traditions of holidays.

Table 5.2: Contribution approaches in agricultural education.
82 | INCLUSIVE TEACHING

Educators are also beginning to frequently use practices that reflect level 2, the additive approach (table
5.3). At this level, teachers add cultural content, concepts, and perspectives without implementing
structural changes or adding a large amount of effort to the curriculum revision. Banks says, "The additive
approach is often accomplished by adding a book, a unit, or a course to the curriculum without changing the
framework" (p. 47). Although level 1 and level 2 are approaches that compliment effort, they do not challenge

Subject       Level 2 Implementation

Introduction   Integrate the history of agricultural practices of Native American cultures, including the origin of
to            crop rotation and intercropping practices.
Agriculture    Integrate the history and movement of corn by Native communities from what is now called Central
              to North America.
               Identify the history of crops originating in West Africa, including watermelon and peanuts. Break
              down the assumptions that only European settlers had the knowledge and skills to begin farming in
              North America.

Animal         Have a discussion of enslaved West Africans chosen based on their animal husbandry experiences.
Science        Have a discussion of animal husbandry practices from West Africa.

Food           Examine the cuisine as it relates to global topography and geography--for example, the proximity of
Science       spicy food to the Equator.
               Discuss how new food processing and preparation approaches were brought to the United States
              from West Africa. Dishes coined as Southern culinary cuisine, such as fried chicken, jambalaya, and
              barbecue, were first prepared by enslaved people.
               Discuss how delicacies differ across the United States and the world. For example, "Cui," or a Guinea
              pig, is a meat served on special occasions in Ecuador.
               Examine the food processing requirements of different religions.

Leadership  Encourage students to present speeches in their first language.

Level 3 fundamentally differs from the first two levels as it contains objectives that shift paradigms and
question basic assumptions. By doing so, the curriculum allows students to see, hear, and comprehend
different points of view. The level 3 transformation approach entails a structural change in the curriculum
so that students are enabled to understand information from the perspective of diverse groups. Specifically,
the aim of level 3 is to assist students in thinking critically and develop a skill set that empowers them to
construct, document, and support their conclusions and generalizations. Table 5.4 provides examples of
level 3 interaction in agricultural education.

Subject       Level 3 Implementation

Landscape     Examine socioeconomic opinions by discussing "Which individuals desire a landscaped home?" Taking
Architecture  a community trip and visiting various neighborhoods of different socioeconomic levels allows students
              to see that similar care is put forth, but that financial earnings play a role in what is on display.
              Nevertheless, some plants, regardless of income level, have value or meaning to the owner; thus,
              landscaping is important to all income levels.

Animal        When exploring countries of origin, lead students to determining why an animal was brought to the
Science       United States. Which ethnic group decided the animal that would inhabit America? What diseases did
              it bring to the land and whom did these diseases affect? Which religion supported the movement of
              these animals?

Floriculture  During a floral identification lesson, engage students in identifying the country of origin for each of the
              major flowers sold in the United States. Use research and discussion to encourage students to
              determine the cost of each flower sold during its peak season and what an individual is paid to grow
              and harvest the flowers in the country of origin (e.g., roses grown in Ecuador).

Table 5.4: Transformation approaches to agricultural education.

NOTE: As the curriculum moves into the transformation phase, the lesson becomes embedded and is fluid
with what is being taught rather than a hard break to the curriculum.
84 | INCLUSIVE TEACHING

When students begin to make decisions on important social issues by responding with action to help solve
the problem, then the teacher has met level 4, the social action approach. We have the perfect opportunity
for social action within agricultural education as our students are responsible for obtaining and managing
an SAE project. In addition, agricultural education youth have the potential to be enrolled in our classes for
multiple years, where social action can be built upon as students grow in their civic responsibility within
their community. When the agriculture curriculum is being delivered in the social action approach (table 5.5),
learning occurs, and proud moments are celebrated.

Subject       Level 4 Implementation

General to Students develop a comprehensive list of agricultural magazines from various ethnic backgrounds for
the program the school library to purchase and display.

Teaching Practices for Multicultural and Inclusive Agricultural
Education Classrooms

Changing teaching practices to create inclusive teaching strategies requires us to reflect on our current
practices and classroom environment intentionally. Then, considering what we see and understand about
our teaching and the spaces in which we teach, we can try new ideas. Once implemented, we must be
courageous and ask our students for feedback on our changes.

Planning

   Review all IEP and 504 plans early to embed student needs within the curriculum rather than making
      targeted accommodations that can "single out" students.

   Identify English Language Learner students and their level of proficiency. Place them near the front of
      the room so targeted communication can occur.

   Designate a "Food Drawer" for students whose hunger needs are not being met.
   Develop a predetermined seating chart to assist and encourage student interaction and engagement

      rather than targeting disciplinary control.
   Obtain flags from the country of origin of your students and display them throughout the classroom.
   Develop bulletin boards that display the interests of every student and deliver a message that the

      classroom embraces a SafeSpace environment.
   Identify religious holidays during the school year and add them to your calendar as a reminder to bring

      attention to them.

As teachers, we all know that what things we say and how we say them matters. Students see us as leaders
and role models in our classrooms. Therefore, to have positive and appropriate communication in our
classrooms, we must ensure we do our part to make it happen.
86 | INCLUSIVE TEACHING

Communicating with Students

   As part of activities on the first day of class, ask students to respond to the following questions on a
      worksheet you provide or an electronic format appropriate to the course:
         What name would you prefer we call you?
         What is something about yourself that you are proud of?
         What would you like me to know about you?
         What concerns you most about this class?
         What is your favorite music genre?

   Always use a student's preferred pronouns and apologize when you misspeak.
   Post your preferred pronouns.
   Ensure classroom images and resources include representation of diverse cultures, races, ethnicities,

      genders, and abilities.
   Learn the cultural communication practices of the students in your program.
   Engage students in cocreating the classroom expectations.
   Ensure materials are ADA compliant.

Building relationships with students and their families through home visits has been a tradition in
agricultural education. Over time, in many communities, teacher visits for SAE project supervision have been
diminished or removed. As most of us agree, this is not a desirable change. We recommend renewing our
efforts to make home or job site visits to strengthen the connections between our students' families and our
agricultural education programs.

Building Relationships with Families

   Be an advocate for the student and bring parent requests to the attention of committee members during
      a 504 planning meeting.

   Constitute student praise calls rather than calls regarding demerits.
   Develop a bilingual monthly email to parents that discusses previous successes and upcoming events.
   Invite families to events and trips.
   Obtain funding for meal function events that alleviates the cost of attending (e.g., banquet tickets).
   Provide childcare opportunities for parents who desire to meet with you or attend a school event for your

      student.

Learning Confirmation

What would you do? Work with a colleague or a team of colleagues to discuss the following two case studies.
How do you respond to the questions? Remember to provide a discussion that allows everyone to speak openly
and be sure that to implement listening skills.

Case Study #1

A student wants to join the livestock team, has worked intently in class, and is passionate about the subject.
They find out that practices are held after school, and if practices are missed more than once, it would result
in the removal from the team. Unfortunately, the student cannot attend most practices because of their
responsibilities. Living with only one parent, they must ride the bus with their younger siblings and watch them
until their mom arrives.

Behind the scenes, the teacher is known to only allow teams of two males and two females OR four students
all of one gender due to a philosophy of money "wasted" on hotel rooms that would only hold one person.
Unfortunately, there are already three students of the opposite gender on the team, and while the student's
talent is just as good, if not better than the current team members, they choose not to inform the teacher of their
interest.

   1. Does the student have a chance of making the team?
   2. What amendments can be made to assist the (a) teacher, (b) student, (c) student's family, and (d) team

        members?

Case Study #2

A student (male, Muslim, and visually colorblind student) at the school has a very hectic schedule and enrolled in
a floriculture course after hearing that it was a good class for students who needed a break from bookwork and
desired a course where you could work with their hands.

It is the middle of the Ramadan holiday, and the subject is learning color patterns. On this particular day, the color
wheel was the focus of the learning objectives, and the teacher began by saying, "All right ladies, using icing,
food coloring, and sugar cookies; whoever correctly displays the color wheel will receive a pass on the next daily
quiz." Unfortunately, the bottles of food coloring were not labeled, and once the student was midway through
the assignment, the teacher approached and said, "Are you even trying?"

Once the class is finished and the assignments are graded, the teacher allows the students to eat their colorful
cookies. The student offered their cookie to someone else and the teacher asked why they would give away
something so delicious. Once the student tells the teacher their belief, the teacher simply says, "Oh, one cookie
won't hurt you."

         1. What were the three comments that could have created a microaggression?
        2. How could the three comments have been avoided?
        3. How will you ensure that you, and your classroom, are accepting of a student in a similar situation?

     Applying the Content

     Use the following questions to guide your development in establishing a more inclusive agricultural education
     program. Check them off when you have completed.

         1. Do you know which students have an IEP and/or 504 plan?
        2. Are your members comfortable attending an overnight trip with a student who identifies themselves in

             the LGBTQ+ community?
        3. Does the program have an activity to participate in the community during Martin Luther King Jr. Day?
        4. Does the officer team reflect the demographics of the school and agriculture education program?
        5. Would your community be supportive of the program if the chapter president was an ethnic minority?
        6. Do quiet students have a place in the program?
         7. Would a vegan student feel comfortable talking to you?
        8. Do you have a plan to help students who cannot read?
        9. What will be the out-of-pocket cost for students to attend your most expensive trip?
       10. Do you have alternative seating in your classroom for an obese student? Where will it be located?
        11. What percent of your events will be outside the school day?
       12. What percent of your students rely on bus transportation?
       13. Do you have a liaison to assist you in the pronunciation of your students' names?
       14. What music will you allow to be played in your classroom?
       15. Have you set your calendar to recognize international holidays?
       16. Have you created a "wish list" of places to visit, or list of places already attended, on every continent? Do

             you already know where to add your experience or "wish list" to the curriculum being taught?
        17. Do you have a safe and secure area for students to maintain an SAE?
       18. Can you identify a student who needs shoes and find the resources to provide?
       19. Besides the school community, do you know of ethnic restaurants to expose your students to during a

             school trip?

6. DYNAMICS OF TEACHING

Tobin Redwine

Setting the Stage

On a hot and humid day in northern Uganda, I prepared my lesson plans and thought about the content I would
soon be delivering to a group of agriculture teachers. As I sat in a modest classroom envisioning how the
day's training would go, it began to rain. Normally, rain would not even register on my radar as an element to
consider for effective teaching, but that day it was an absolute disruptor of my planned activities. As the rain
beat down on the tin roof above my head, each drop clanged and slapped, echoing against the stone walls
of the room. The increasingly loud drum beat pelted the room with a wall of sound. There was no way I could
attempt to talk over the noise of the rain, so I immediately began to consider alternative locations for the
day's activities.

I surveyed the area and available rooms, and I found that all the locations had the same challenge; so
much noise would be a severe distraction for my teaching that day. Then, one of the participating teachers
suggested moving to an outside area, underneath a canvas covering. The canvas muted the sounds of falling
rain but presented other challenges. With no walls, nor electricity, I would need to reconsider my methods
and approaches. I would have to change my strategy due to the environment, for my learners' attention and
for my own abilities. Thankfully, we were able to pivot toward a new plan, including more hands-on interaction
and discussion that engaged our learners, and met our objectives for the day. Now, every time it rains, I
remember the noise in that classroom and the joyful session I had with teachers as we deeply discussed
instructional strategies under a canvas, backed by the soft and gentle rain falling around us. I remember the
effectiveness of change in a learning strategy and system.

Change is an essential and necessary element of effective teaching. Each classroom, each topic, each
lesson, and each learner presents different characteristics that influence an instructor's approach. And just
as each of these elements are fluid, effective instructors must also be fluid.
94 | DYNAMICS OF TEACHING

     Objectives

     The art of implementing change (whether planned proactively or adopted reactively) while teaching is called
     dynamics of teaching. In this chapter, you will explore a conceptual model designed to identify determinants
     (elements, or causal factors) that influence effective teaching and enhance your classroom dynamics. After
     completing this chapter, you will be able to meet the following learning objectives:

          Explain determinants that influence classroom environments, learner behaviors, and instructor qualities.
          Explain influence of relationships in establishing a dynamic classroom setting.

Introduction

To begin exploring the role of dynamics in teaching, consider the following Oxford Languages (n.d.)
definition:

         Dynamics: the forces or properties which stimulate growth, development, or change within a system or
         process

To fully understand effective teaching, teachers must recognize the forces that are at play in their learning
environments and respond to them in appropriate and meaningful ways. What features and facets in your
classroom, your school, your system, and yourself influence the strategies you deploy? Do those factors
influence what your learners find interesting? To attempt to answer how features in a system make learning
interesting, we can look to an analogy provided by celebrated American author Kurt Vonnegut. He viewed
stories as a tool to teach and offered insight into what makes a story interesting: their shape (Comberg,
2010).

Vonnegut described stories as having a shape. Imagine a graph. Picture an x axis that displays time from
beginning to end of a story. Envision a y axis that portrays a continuum of good fortune at the top to bad
fortune at the bottom. Each character's position on the graph changes--some move from good fortune to
bad, some from bad to worse, some from good to better--as the story propels toward its end. These changes
constitute a shape in a story. A character with a successful business or relationship at the beginning of a
story might make a mistake and see their success turn to turmoil (causing a falling line on the graph), only to
solve a problem and have their position on the continuum climb back toward the top. Vonnegut called that
shape "man in a hole." Some stories involve an underdog, down on their luck, beginning their graph at the low
end of the y axis, who climbs toward a happy ending as the story unfolds. That shape might be called "uphill
climb."
                                                                                                                DYNAMICS OF TEACHING | 95

Vonnegut's point was that stories become interesting when their shape changes. A straight horizontal line
would imply a story with no challenge, no success, no change. That's an awfully boring story. Stories become
interesting, celebrated, or beloved when their characters create dynamic shapes. Just as good stories need
dynamics to be interesting, good teachers need dynamics to be effective. Teachers face a complex system of
variables that influence successes and challenges in a classroom; this requires a dynamic, changing solution.

Overview of Theory and Practice

We have long known that changing one part of a system can cause change in another part of a system.
Stanford psychologist Albert Bandura famously sought to describe whether it was "nature" or "nurture" that
dictated a person's potential and performance. Instead of finding one or the other, his work led to the
creation of a model that identified three determinants, or variables that can be changed to elicit a response.
As we know, dynamics of teaching rely on understanding how changes affect teaching strategies. Bandura's
model shows how these changes create cause-and-effect relationships. (See figure 6.1.)

First called Social Learning Theory and now known  Figure 6.1: Determinants in the Social Cognitive Theory
as Social Cognitive Theory, Bandura's model        model. Figure description.
suggests that learning happens as a result of
dynamic interaction of three determinants in a
social exchange: environment, personal factors,
and behavior (Bandura, 1989). Each determinant
influences the other two determinants, and each
determinant is influenced by the other two
determinants. Introducing a change in one
determinant will lead to changes in the others.
Therefore, Social Cognitive Theory explains how
dynamics in teaching happen; it happens by
introducing change and expecting an effect in
another part of the system.

Let's unpack each determinant of Bandura's model in a teaching context. In an education setting, consider
the environment. The location, the physical space, the learning materials, and the orientation to peer
learners all play key roles in characterizing the environment. The comfort (or lack thereof) of chairs upon
which learners sit, the geography of the locations, the season of the year, the temperature of the space,
the decorations, the navigability of the hallways, and countless other elements constitute the educational
environment.

Personal factors describe preferences, personality traits, cognitive processes, and other intangible
elements that make people who we are. Our values, expectations, identity, priorities, thoughts, emotions,
beliefs, and knowledge base, among a myriad of other elements, constitute this determinant.
96 | DYNAMICS OF TEACHING
Finally, behaviors play an integral role in Bandura's model--both instructor and student behaviors. Actions,
protocols, and other steps individuals take constitute our behaviors. The things we do and say define this
determinant.
In summary, each determinant relies on and influences the other determinants.

   Where you are influences what you do and who you are.
   Who you are influences where you are and what you do.
   What you do influences who you are and where you are.

Social Cognitive Theory provides an excellent lens in examining the dynamics of teaching. The cause-and-
effect model implies that change leads to change, and dynamics are all about change. If instructors want
to see a change in our behavior, changing our environment will support or inhibit changed behavior. If
instructors want to change students' perceptions, values, or personal factors, our behaviors must be
crucially examined.

     Learning Confirmation

     Respond to the following items:
         1. Define dynamics of teaching.
        2. List the three determinants in Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory.
        3. Characterize features in your own future teaching for each determinant.

     Alternate assessment options:
         1. Observe an instructor during a learning session. Describe elements of each determinant during the session
             (environment, instructor and learner personal factors, instructor and learner behaviors).
        2. Prepare a learning session to deliver to peers that specifically introduces a change in behavior or
             environment as a tool for dynamics of teaching.

Applying the Content

After reading about the three-way influence of determinants, and how dynamics of teaching enhance
educational activities, we are ready to put it all together. Make your own Bandurian map. Replicate the model
from figure 6.1. Then, complete a personal inventory to show how determinants fit together. The suggestions
below might inspire your application and reflection.

                             Figure 6.2: Social cognitive theory model (blank).

Environment
Describe an ideal learning environment in which you would like to teach. What are the physical characteristics?
What are the spaces available and features? Compare that against an actual learning environment you have
observed or learned in. Pay attention to elements in the environment that were helpful or were distracting as
they each influenced the other determinants.
Behavior
Divide your behavior section of your map into two categories: learner and instructor. What behaviors do you
expect from your learners? What behaviors do you expect of yourself? What behaviors are likely to occur? How
can you measure or observe these behaviors to support assessment?
98 | DYNAMICS OF TEACHING

     Personal Factors
     List your strengths. If you aren't sure, begin by listing adjectives that you use to describe yourself. Ask a peer
     or someone you trust for additional adjectives. Then, list your interests and hobbies. Each of these contribute to
     a toolkit of strengths that you likely embrace as an instructor. Then take it further. What are your core values?
     What inspires you? What experiences or principles drive you the most?
     Dynamic Strategies
     Now, take a few moments to reflect on the map you created. How do items in each determinant influence each
     other? Based on what you know about the determinants in your context, generate a list of ideas that you can use
     to introduce change in each determinant. Perhaps we can rearrange our classrooms to change our environments,
     or maybe we can change the volume or tone of our voices to change our instructional behavior. The ideas we
     create here will be our toolkit for dynamics of teaching. Consider adding activities or breakout groups, games or
     exercises, discussion topics, and questions that can be used in support of dynamics of teaching.

     Reflective Questions

         1. Consider an instructor you believe to be an effective educator. What dynamics of teaching do they do
             well? Which of their strategies would you use in your own teaching and why? What strategies would be
             a challenge for you and why?

        2. From your personal experience, list three potential pitfalls in a learning session. Consider ways to change a
             determinant to address each challenge.

        3. Now that you have explained dynamics of teaching and determinants, what questions have we
             generated? Prepare a list of lingering questions. Use your list of questions as a catalyst for reaching out
             to a mentor, educator, or peer to engage in meaningful conversations and to pursue further resources for
             ongoing professional development.

7. PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION

Amber H. Rice and Matt Mars

Setting the Stage

Robin looked around the classroom. They had just received their keys to the new agriculture program and
they were overwhelmed by the piles of papers, textbooks, and equipment. The last agriculture teacher had
taught in the school for over twenty years and was beloved by the entire district. Robin felt excited to embark
on this new professional journey mixed with pressure to live up to the expectations of the students, school,
parents, and community. As they opened the computer, Robin found no lessons plans, curriculum maps, or
reference materials from the previous teacher. They thought,

         I am not sure I am prepared for this. I have to teach a course on animal science, plant science, and
         agricultural engineering. I have some content knowledge in animal science, but I don't know enough
         about plant science or agricultural engineering to create lessons from scratch. How can I create
         curriculum for three courses with the school year starting in just three weeks? I don't even know where
         to start!
Robin's excitement for their new position quickly devolved into panic as they viewed the first blank document
to appear on their screen. They became overwhelmed and disheartened by the enormity of the task at hand:
creating curriculum for their students.

     Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to:
          Explain the purpose of curriculum planning.
          Discuss the role of sociological and pedagogical theory on instructional design.
          Develop measurable learning objectives to guide instruction.
          Design curriculum maps for agriculture courses.
          Create comprehensive lesson plans.
102 | PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION

Introduction

As experienced by Robin, knowing where to start when planning for effective instruction can sometimes be
overwhelming. There are many factors to consider when crafting curriculum to meet the unique needs of
your program and the students it serves. As you read through the chapter, we encourage you to begin with
the end in mind. What skills, understanding, abilities, and behaviors do we intend for your students to gain
at the conclusion of your class session, course, and agriculture program? How can we create curriculum that
will lead to these outcomes and serve as the roadmap for highly effective instruction? What sociocultural
and pedagogical factors influence how we go about the planning process? This chapter will address these
important questions, and in doing so, provide a working guide for instructional planning.

What is Curriculum?

Curriculum planning is a vital and potentially daunting task. It first involves carefully thinking through what
we need (and want) to teach as well as the best strategies for implementation. Second, it involves creating
meaningful assessments that demonstrate student mastery of the content. Planning lessons is a critical
component to being an effective educator. These instructional decisions inform and lead to what we call our
curriculum.

Curriculum is defined as the sum of educational experiences in a course or series of courses (Merriam
Webster, n.d.). It involves both the three-thousand-foot view of planning (i.e., curriculum maps) and the day-
to-day planning (i.e., lesson plans). Curriculum encompasses all the courses we teach, how these courses
build upon one another, and the content competencies we intend for students to learn. But before we can
delve into the details of curriculum planning, it is important to consider the many factors, both internal and
external, that can influence the decisions we make as educators when designing curriculum for our students.

Primary factors that influence curriculum:

   Disciplinary culture and field-based assumptions
   State and national education standards
   College and career readiness skills
   Employment opportunities and trends
   School and community context
   Facilities and resources
   Learners' age, prior knowledge, and background
   Scope of the course and program
                                                                                       PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION | 103

Many factors influence curricular decisions. To begin, we must carefully consider the disciplinary culture of
our subject area and field-based assumptions. Disciplinary culture can greatly impact not only the content
we teach, but the lens through which we present that content. The section "Theoretical Considerations:
From the Sociological to the Pedagogical," on theory related to planning, will dive more deeply into exploring
the culture of our discipline.

Other relevant factors that influence curriculum include our state and national education standards. Each
state sets standards for content differently. These standards are developed and disseminated at the state
level and often include an outcome assessment to ensure students in every program are developing the
identified competencies. In agricultural education for example, these state education standards may include
technical agriculture content and professional skills or employability standards, and there are often have
direct connections within the standards to leadership skills (FFA) and work-based learning outcomes
(Supervised Agricultural Experience) (see chapters 10 and 11 for more information). In addition to state
education standards, there are national education standards as well. National education standards are
often adapted for use at the state level. These national standards are an excellent starting place if your
state's standards provide less detail and direction than other states. As an example, the National Agriculture,
Food, and Natural Resources (AFNR) Content Standards are divided into career pathways that represent
groups of skills, knowledge, and interests related to an area of industry (The National Council for Agricultural
Education, 2015). In agricultural education, career pathways can include agribusiness systems; animal
systems; biotechnology systems; environmental service systems; food products and processing systems;
natural resources systems; plant systems; and power, structural, and technical systems (The National
Council for Agricultural Education, 2015). These career pathways are most often served through a series of
courses at the secondary level.

In addition to state and national education standards, there is an emphasis in many disciplines on college
and career readiness skills. These skills are embedded throughout curricula with the intent of preparing all
students to graduate from high school ready for college, careers, and life. Emphasis on these skills should
be included throughout the entire curriculum. In addition, your state may have specific metrics for student
attainment of these essential skills. For example, in agricultural education, college and career readiness skill
attainment includes employment opportunities that match trends within the agricultural industry from a
national, state, and local community perspective.

As educators, we also need to carefully consider our community context. Curricular decisions are influenced
by the specific community in which an education program is located. It is important to develop an awareness
of the unique characteristics in our communities, such as employment, history, and the influence of relevant
stakeholder groups. Creating a curriculum group is one way to seek input from the community, industry
professionals, leaders, and stakeholders unique to your specific location. We also need to consider our
school context. School context includes the type of school in which we are employed (e.g., public, private,
or charter school) and if the school is located in an urban, suburban, or rural environment. Each of these
characteristics plays a role in our curricular decision-making.
104 | PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION

We must also take into account the facilities, equipment, and other resources that are at our disposal
for influencing student learning. While additional resources can sometimes be acquired, taking a careful
inventory of the available items can aid in making purposeful curricular decisions. For example, if your school
has a greenhouse, you may wish to include science content related to seed germination as a means of
encouraging active learning. The facilities and equipment need not dictate the content we choose to teach
but can serve as important factors in how we deliver content to our students in meaningful ways.

We must also consider the learners themselves. Learners' ages, backgrounds, needs, interests, and prior
knowledge are critical to curriculum development since our students are our audience! The backgrounds
and abilities of our learners can guide how quickly we move from one content topic to another, the depth of
knowledge we desire to teach, and the teaching methods we use to properly align with the developmental
levels of our students. Additionally, we must carefully consider the needs and interests of our learners to
ensure our curriculum is adequately preparing them for their future.

Last, it is imperative that we recognize and remain attentive to who we are as educators and the
perspectives and potential biases our own backgrounds inherently bring to the curriculum planning process.
The role of the educator is to expand the knowledge levels and enhance the capacities of learners to prepare
them to critically think for themselves. Therefore, it is our responsibility to take appropriate measures
in minimizing the influence of our own values and agendas throughout the planning and content delivery
process.

Each of these factors plays an essential role in curricular decision-making. To be effective, educators need
to continually update their knowledge about each of these factors as they change over time, keeping pace
with innovation, cultural, and economic shifts in our profession and in our communities. Keep each of these
influential factors in mind as we further consider with greater specificity the development of curriculum
maps, unit plans, and lesson plans for instruction.

Planning provides a thoughtful blueprint to guide our instruction. However, remember the learning
environment is dynamic and ever-changing. Sometimes the best laid plans must be adapted to meet the
unique and fluid needs of individual learners, specific learning environments, and distinct communities in
real-time. Take planning seriously and with a willingness to deviate from the script when needed.

Background: Theory and Research

Theoretical Considerations: From the Sociological to the Pedagogical

We all bring a range of academic and personal perspectives and biases to our professional practices. We
were socialized to view disciplinary content through field-based lenses that are specific to the programs
of study that prepared us to be educators. Every discipline is anchored in its own culture with consequent
socialization being enacted through established moral orders (Harr, 1983). Moral orders dictate what is
valued and considered to be on one hand acceptable and desirable and on the other hand objectionable and
improper. In the academic context, the moral orders that underpin disciplinary cultures heavily influence
how we as practitioners come to view what is credible knowledge, what worthwhile learning looks like,
and what desirable outcomes are in terms of how students make sense of and apply what is being taught
(Shotter, 1994). These orders are so deeply embedded within disciplines that they are passed on and enacted
as basic assumptions (Schein, 2010)--cultural elements that are taken for granted and, over time, practiced
with little to no awareness. They become the "it's just what we do" of practice. The insidiousness of moral
orders confines the imagination of practitioners to disciplinary-based boundaries of what is acceptable
practice and legitimate positions and viewpoints (Ylijoki, 2000).

Conflicts and disconnects between the disciplinary cultures and moral orders of educators and the
worldviews of learners can compromise productive and meaningful learning. Sometimes obvious and other
times not-so-obvious barriers to learning can arise as learners are forced to reconcile conflicts between
their worldviews and those of their families with those of their educators. The results can be a breakdown in
their learning or complete disengagement from the course and its content.

One approach to proactively minimizing such unintended fallout of moral order bias is to embed routine
reflection and self-discovery in the curriculum planning process. As educators, we often promote the
importance and value of fostering critical thinking among our learners. We, too, should be actively engaged
in critical thinking as a matter of routine practice. Lai (2011) identified the fundamental elements of critical
thinking as "attitudes or habits of mind, [that] include open and fair-mindedness, inquisitiveness, flexibility, a
propensity to seek reason, a desire to be well informed, and a respect for and willingness to entertain diverse
viewpoints" (p. 2). Consistent with this understanding, educators must identify the influence of their own
biases in their curriculum and, through doing so, include strategies for creating constructive spaces in which
students are able to make sense of content relevant to their own worldviews. Such strategies might include
reflective journaling, debate exercises, and diversified readings that make it clear there is rarely one correct
way of seeing and understanding the phenomena being learned. Management and industry consultants often
say culture eats strategy. Indeed, curriculum planning inherently involves strategy. Without considering the
influence of the cultures that shape our worldviews as educators, the strategies we build into our planning
will be incomplete and detrimental to the openness and inclusivity of our learning environments.
106 | PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION

Complementary to the sociological considerations, we must also consider pedagogical theory and how it
applies to our curriculum design. Our own beliefs as educators heavily influence and shape the content
we choose to develop and how we choose to deliver that content (Rice & Kitchel, 2017a). Our integrated
beliefs systems that shape our pedagogical content knowledge (i.e., knowledge for teaching) include our
beliefs about the purpose of our discipline, our beliefs about specific content areas, and our general beliefs
about teaching and learning. These beliefs interact and inform one another, creating our personal integrated
beliefs system (Rice & Kitchel, 2017a, 2018).

Educator beliefs about the purpose of our discipline can include career preparation, college preparation,
literacy, life skills, and learner individualization, which encompasses the other four belief categories (Rice
& Kitchel, 2017b). Educators may hold multiple beliefs about the purpose of their discipline simultaneously.
These beliefs impact a variety of instructional decisions that influence learning outcomes. For example, if
an educator holds the belief that the purpose of their discipline is career preparation, they may incorporate
more manual skill learning outcomes into the curriculum and may emphasize hands-on learning applications.
Conversely, if an educator holds the belief that the purpose of their discipline is literacy development,
they may incorporate more discussions and assignments that focus on developing knowledge for informing
consumers.

Educator beliefs about specific content areas also shapes our planning and practice (Rice & Kitchel, 2017a).
Within plant science education, for example, educators may believe the purpose of a school greenhouse
is to serve as a laboratory for plant science experiments and may treat the greenhouse as an extension
of the classroom to aid in developing science knowledge and skills. Conversely, educators may believe the
purpose of the school greenhouse is a production facility, and consequently, they may focus instruction on
the viability of the plants produced in the greenhouse and may engage in lessons related to marketing and
sales.

Finally, educator beliefs about teaching and learning beyond the scope of a specific disciplinary context
also influences our curriculum development (Rice & Kitchel, 2017a). Educator philosophical beliefs about
teaching and learning in our discipline include believing that it is the educator's responsibility to be a lifelong
learner, believing in the importance of educator reflection on the learning process, believing that students
play a role in determining the content to be delivered, and believing that students learn best through real-
life applications of concepts (Rice & Kitchel, 2017a). As educators, we must engage in meaningful reflection
about our beliefs as they have the power to shape curriculum planning and instruction at the micro and macro
levels.

Cognitive Levels and Bloom's Taxonomy

Bloom's Taxonomy is a common educational framework that guides curriculum development through the
creation of measurable learning objectives relevant to hierarchical levels of thinking (Anderson & Krathwohl,
2001; Bloom & Krathwohl, 1956). Bloom's Taxonomy focuses on the cognitive or knowledge-based learning
domain and contains the following levels of cognition, beginning with the least complex and scaffolding
upward: remember, understand, apply, analyze, evaluate, and create (Anderson & Krathwohl, 2001). Each
level can be associated with various action verbs to guide measurable development of learning objectives
and the subsequent pedagogical approaches and techniques. In addition to the cognitive domain, education
theorists have also outlined levels for the affective or emotion-based learning domain and the psychomotor
or action-based learning domain (Bloom & Krathwohl, 1956; Harrow, 1972; Krathwohl et al., 1964). All three
domains of learning (cognitive, affective, and psychomotor) are equally important in curricular development.
We will focus on the cognitive domain as we delve into writing learning objectives.

Writing Measurable Learning Objectives

The first step in curriculum planning is crafting measurable learning objectives to guide instruction. These
learning objectives provide direction for the educational process and the standards by which learner
performance (i.e., competence) can be assessed (i.e., evaluated). Heinrich et al.'s (1996) model for writing
learning objectives provides a concrete process for creating each component (A, B, C, D) of an objective.

"A" is the audience in the ABCD learning objective model. The "A" component answers the question "Who
is the learner?" All learning objectives are learner-centered as your desired outcome is the for the learner
to be able to accomplish the objective. Whether explicitly written in the learning objective or not, all our
objectives should begin with "The learner will be able to ..." In addition to guiding your curriculum planning as
the educator, objectives should be shared with students as they are your audience.

"B" is the behavior in the ABCD learning objective model. The "B" component answers the question "What
should the learner be able to do?" All learning objectives provide a clear and concise statement of the
performance required of the learner. This aligns with the competency or expected outcome of the lesson.
The behavior is written as a measurable action verb. Example action verbs include describe, identify, explain,
differentiate, synthesize, calculate, and create. These verbs are chosen to align with the cognitive levels of
Bloom's Taxonomy.
108 | PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION

"C" is the condition in the ABCD learning objective model. The "C" component answers the question "Under
what conditions do you want the learner to be able to do it?" The condition contains the settings or
circumstances within which the learner is to perform or demonstrate the behavior. Example conditions
include information that the learners may be provided that will direct the action; the environment in which
the performance must be demonstrated; or the equipment, supplies, or materials which the learner is
provided. The chosen conditions directly align with our teaching methods used to deliver the content.

"D" is the degree in the ABCD learning objective model. The "D" component answers the question "How well
must it be done?" The degree indicates the basis upon which the performance will be evaluated and is used
to assess how well the learner must perform to be judged as competent. Example degrees include percent
accuracy, maximum number of errors, standards for excellence, reference to other materials (e.g., rubrics)
which identify specific criteria, or a combination of multiple factors.

Some example objectives that contain all four components of the ABCD objective model for a lesson on soil
texture include:

   Following the lecture, learners will be able to identify the three sizes of soil particles, with 100 percent
      accuracy.

   Following the discussion, learners will be able to describe the importance of soil texture, including all
      four factors.

   Given the soil texture triangle, learners will be able to calculate the soil type, with 90 percent accuracy.
   Following the demonstration, learners will be able to demonstrate the soil ribbon test, including all

      components on the teacher provided checklist.

Clear, concise, and measurable learning objectives are the cornerstone for efficient and effective planning.
Think of learning objectives as the road map for curriculum design.

Mapping Curriculum: Overview

When mapping curriculum, the order in which content flows from one topic to the next is important. We
must think about our curriculum from a variety of perspectives including across our total program (i.e.,
multiple courses) and across a single course (i.e., units of instruction). If you are employed in a single
teacher program, this may be largely an individual effort at the program level. If you are employed in a multi-
teacher program, you must collaborate with other educators in your program to ensure the curriculum flows
from course to course. Finally, if you are engaging heavily with other content areas within your learning
environment (e.g., biology or mathematics) you will be collaborating with those educators when designing
curriculum.
                                                                                       PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION | 109

From the program perspective, it is important that your courses build upon one another. For example, we
may have an introductory level course geared toward novice learners that introduces a variety of content.
From there, we may offer a course that is geared toward intermediate learners, or we may have various
specialty courses open to students across learning levels. The course scope and sequence are school,
program, and learning environment dependent. For example, you may consider the career pathways for AFNR
(National Council for Agricultural Education, 2015) when creating courses and paying attention to the content
topics that are included in each specific course. We may decide to introduce some content topics in one
course and build upon those topics in subsequent courses. Depending on the size of our programs and the
number of educators collaborating, we may offer a variety of courses in which learners can engage. Keep in
mind, each of the highlighted factors are influential when making programmatic curricular decisions.

Mapping Curriculum: Across a Single Course

For each course we teach, we will create a curriculum map that outlines the following components of the
course: individual units of instruction, individual lessons for each unit, time frame for each unit, and time
frame for each lesson and topic. Our curriculum maps are our guide to instruction for that specific course.
We create a curriculum map before designing individual units of instruction or lessons plans.

Units of instruction are the building blocks for our curriculum map. These units encompass various content
topics that hang together and will lead us to individual lesson plan creation. Using content standards as
a guide, consider the broad areas of instruction you would introduce within an individual course to meet
course goals. For example, in an animal science course, we may have units of instruction that include, but
are not limited to, introduction to animal science, animal science careers, animal breeds, animal anatomy,
animal nutrition, animal husbandry and behavior, animal health and diseases, and animal reproduction.

After deciding the broad units of instruction to include in the course, we will outline the time frame for
each unit. Consult supervisory personnel for length of time expected per course when making curriculum
decisions. Units of instruction can span various lengths of time, but two to six weeks in length is common.
The length of a unit depends on the overall time we have to teach within the course as a whole, how in-depth
we plan to go with content topics, the prior knowledge of our learners, and the learning objectives we must
accomplish within that unit.

For each unit of instruction, create a unit outline illustrating the individual lessons that encompass the unit.
A single unit will consist of a varying number of individual lessons. For example, within an animal anatomy
unit, we may include lessons on external anatomy, circulatory system, endocrine system, nervous system,
and skeletal system. For each of these lessons we will create learning objectives to guide the lesson plan
creation.

In addition to the previous considerations, we must also account for additional time factors within our
instruction. We may have ongoing activities that span various units of instruction, time allotted to utilize
facilities like a land lab or greenhouse, field trips planned within the course, large projects with authentic
110 | PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION
assessments, or time for traditional assessments. It is easy to overestimate the instructional time needed if
we do not take into consideration the time it requires to incorporate these activities. We should also consult
necessary calendars for dates, such as holidays or other events, that can impact time for instruction.

Curriculum Map Template

Context and Time Length for Lessons

For each lesson plan created, we must consider the context of that lesson and the length of time needed
for delivery. These curricular decisions are guided by our curriculum map, unit outline, and the learning
objectives we have outlined for each lesson. Some lessons will be fully taught within a single session, while
others may last multiple sessions. Within each lesson, consider how the content connects to previous and
future lessons. Facilitate students making connections between content topics from lesson to lesson and
from unit to unit to establish meaning and relevancy. Content should build within and between lessons, units,
and courses.

Utilizing Lesson Planning Resources

Utilizing our resources effectively is vital when developing curriculum. It is likely that another educator has
already developed a lesson for the content we are preparing. Take advantage of existing resources to avoid
recreating the wheel. Lesson planning resources can include textbooks, human resources, digital resources,
curriculum groups, national organizations, educators in various disciplines, and social media groups, to
name a few. For example, in agricultural education, communities like the National Association of Agricultural
Educators (NAAE) facilitate the sharing of lesson plans and activities between agriculture educators at the
national level through communities of practice (NAAE, 2021).

There are also curriculum packages available in most disciplines. For example, in agricultural education,
there are curriculum packages available within iCEV and Curriculum for Agricultural Science Education
(CASE) (CASE, 2021; iCEV, 2021). Curriculum packages can be excellent resources when creating curriculum.
For each curriculum resource we utilize, carefully consider the validity of the information presented. Do
not assume the information is accurate and current just because it is made available or created by another
educator. Adapt any resources utilized to meet the needs of your specific learning environments.

Creating the Lesson Plan

When creating lesson plans, it is important to include key components that will appear in every lesson
we deliver. Use a lesson plan template to organize instruction (see table 7.2). In the following section, we
share common components of a lesson plan template and provide an example template that can be adapted
for individual use. Keep in mind, many learning environments may provide a unique required lesson plan
template.

Lesson Plan Components

The first component of the lesson plan template is the background information. This includes the educator's
name, the course or session title, the unit of instruction title, the lesson plan title, the audience served, the
number of learners served, and the estimated time allotted for the lesson.

The second component of the lesson template is the standards connections. Where applicable, connect the
content of the lesson to any oversight standards. This may include a state's disciplinary-specific content
standards, professional skills or employability standards, or other core content standards beyond the
discipline (e.g., biology, mathematics, economics, social studies, and English). When adding standards
connections to a lesson plan, be sure that the lesson is addressing the specific standards outlined. If at first
it appears that no standards apply to the lesson content, we may need to rethink the content depending on
our content oversight agency. Some lessons may connect to multiple content standards.

The third component of the lesson plan template is the enabling objectives. This is where we outline the
objectives we have created for the lesson, using the ABCD format discussed previously in the chapter
(see "Writing Measurable Objectives"). Enabling objectives will build upon one another, be written for the
audience, and scaffold across various levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Enabling objectives serve as the roadmap
for our content delivery throughout the lesson.

The fourth component of the lesson plan template is the materials and references. This is where we identify
all materials, tools, supplies, and equipment needed for the lesson. We will also list all handouts or digital
materials needed for the lesson. Creating the list of materials will assist in organizing the needed supplies
for successful delivery of the lesson. Use this list to prepare for the session by purchasing materials, making
copies, and uploading digital resources. Within this section, identify all sources of information used to
create the lesson. This includes, but is not limited to, websites, lesson plans from other sources, curriculum
packages, and textbooks. By outlining sources of information in a reference list we can easily return back to
the original source at a later date to ensure current and accurate information for content delivery.

The fifth component of the lesson plan template is the key terms. This is where we identify all vocabulary
terms and their definitions as they appear in the lesson. Incorporating vocabulary within the lesson is an
important consideration as we prepare learners to correctly use common terminology related to the content.

The sixth component of the lesson plan template is the accommodations. This is where we outline any
accommodations that will be made to serve learners. This can include changes that will be made during the
lesson for students with IEPs, 504s, as well as any needed accommodations for all learners. Completing this
section while carefully considering the needs of your unique learners is a critical component of the lesson
planning process.
                                                                                       PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION | 115

The seventh component of the lesson plan template is the bell work (commonly referred to as a bellringer and
various other names). This is where educators outline a short engagement activity for learners to complete
prior to the formal start of the session. Bell work can be in the form of review questions, questions to elicit
prior knowledge, quotes to respond to, or additional ideas. The purpose of bell work is to activate learners'
minds immediately upon entering the learning environment. Providing learners with bell work also allows
educators the necessary time to take attendance or attend to other required tasks. Bell work is typically five
minutes or less of the total instructional time.

The eighth component of the lesson plan template is the interest approach. This is the formal start to the
lesson. The purpose of an interest approach is to create in our learners a felt need to learn the content. A
typical interest approach will hook the learner, establish motivation for learning the content, and transition
learners' minds to the content, and it often ends with an overview of the enabling objectives. Interest
approaches are typically five minutes in length but may vary depending on the lesson and the interest
approach content. Designing interest approaches after our lesson content is planned allows for effective
connections between the interest approach and the rest of the lesson.

The ninth component of the lesson plan template is the content. This is where we describe the outline of our
lesson content that corresponds to each enabling objective. In the example template (see table 7.2), each
content section is listed with a place to enter the enabling objective and an estimated time for completion.
The template is divided into two columns. The left-hand column is for the educator to outline any directions,
materials, and procedures. Educators should identify the teaching method being used to deliver the content
and the formative assessment being used to check for understanding at the end of the content delivery for
each objective (see the twelfth component of the lesson plan template related to assessment). The right-
hand column is for the educator to outline the content delivered. Educators should include visual slides,
questions to be asked of learners, and directions for learning activities. At the end of each content outline,
we surface an idea to review the content taught for that objective. The content section of our lesson plan
template will contribute to the bulk of the lesson plan. We encourage educators to carefully think through
the content, method(s) used for delivery, visual aids, engaging questions and activities, assessments, and
reviews of the content for each enabling objective.

The tenth component of the lesson plan template is the application. This is where educators design
instructional activities for learners to apply the content that has been taught. This is not a stand-alone
section on the lesson plan template, but instead should be incorporated into each content section
corresponding to the enabling objectives. Students learn best when they have an opportunity to practice
and apply content, so designing meaningful applications throughout our lessons encourages students to
move past "remember" (in Bloom's Taxonomy) to reach higher cognitive levels. Facilities such as land labs or
greenhouses may be utilized to purposefully apply content but are not required for quality instruction. For in-
depth lab application integration, see the additional lesson plan considerations section on lab applications.
116 | PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION

The eleventh component of the lesson plan template is the summary/conclusion. This is where we wrap-up
the lesson and engage learners in meaningful reflection on the content. The summary/conclusion should
review the most salient points of instruction and allow for learners to process the content. Discussions and
short journal reflections are strategies we can use to engage learners in summarizing the content. Effective
summary/conclusions tie directly back to the interest approach that was used to introduce the session.

The twelfth component of the lesson plan template is the formative and summative assessments. Formative
assessments are designed to check for understanding of the content as the lesson unfolds. We include a
formative assessment at the conclusion of each enabling objective. Formative assessments allow us as the
educator to determine learners' comprehension of the content in real time, so we can make adjustments or
reteach as necessary. Formative assessments include peer discussion, mini-reflection papers, learners' self-
rating procedures, polling, discussions, and example problems, to name a few. Summative assessments are
designed to measure comprehension at the end of the lesson or unit, across multiple enabling objectives.
Summative assessments can include projects, papers, presentations, skill demonstrations, exams, and case
studies, to name a few. Assessments must be chosen based on content being delivered, needs of learners,
and oversight agency requirements. Assessments can be traditional, in the form of quizzes and exams, or
authentic, in the form of projects, presentations, and applications of learning. Finally, we engage students in
a summative assessment of an entire course through an engaging capstone-type item.

Additional Lesson Plan Considerations

   Integrating FFA and SAE (see chapters 10 and 11 for further information)
   Lab applications (see chapter 12 for further information)
   Universal design considerations

Specifically for agricultural education, it is important to consider connections to FFA (i.e., leadership) and
SAE (i.e., experiential or work-based learning) directly within the lesson plan. FFA connections can include
lessons specifically on FFA content (e.g., history, emblem, official dress, and the FFA Creed) and the
incorporation of FFA components through career development events (CDEs) and leadership applications
(e.g., conflict management, teamwork, and parliamentary procedure). See chapter 10 for more information
on FFA and its role in our discipline.

SAE connections can include lessons specifically on SAE content (e.g., areas of SAE, proficiency awards,
purposeful selection of SAE projects) and the incorporation of SAE components (e.g., record keeping,
budgeting and finance, workplace employability skills, agricultural literacy, careers in the industry, and
workplace safety) (see The National Council for Agricultural Education, 2017). See chapter 11 for more
information on SAE and its role in our discipline. By incorporating FFA and SAE directly into lesson plan
development we can maintain the intracurricular nature of the three-component model of agricultural
education that sets it apart from other education disciplines.
                                                                                       PLANNING FOR EFFECTIVE INSTRUCTION | 117

When creating dynamic, application-driven curriculum, educators often incorporate laboratory instruction
and technical skill development. To facilitate this within our lesson plans, we utilize a lab application guide
as a supplemental handout to the lesson plan. The lab application guide contains step-by-step how-to
instructions for performing the lab or skill. Lab application guides can be useful in the learning environment
to provide learners with key aspects of the lab. The lab application guide will contain materials needed, steps
to complete, key points to emphasize, safety considerations (if applicable), and illustrations to illuminate
complex steps. We recommend surfacing the use of the lab application guide directly in the lesson plan
content and then attaching the guide as a supplemental document to support the lesson. Lab application
guides can support a variety of long-term projects, skills, or labs that require multiple steps to complete.

Within each of our lessons, educators need to incorporate universal design practices. This involves making
thoughtful design choices to incorporate inclusive practices in our instruction to serve all learners. Universal
design is simply the design of products, environments, and communication to be usable by all learners
without the need for individualized adaptation (Center for Universal Design, 1997). Universal design benefits
learners of all ages and abilities and can include both physical and nonphysical features of the lesson. An
example of universal design includes using captions or subtitles on recorded videos that will be shown to
learners. Captioning assists learners with hearing impairments, but can also support learners with language
barriers, those who are learning new content and vocabulary, those who are learning in a room with
distractions or competing noises, and those who are taking comprehensive notes. Adding captions or
subtitles is a small change that can benefit every learner. Universal design saves time because educators are
making fewer individual modifications to serve specific learners.

The seven key principles of universal design, as articulated in the professional literature, are equitable use,
flexibility in use, simple and intuitive use, perceptible information, tolerance for error, low physical effort, and
size and space for approach and use (Center for Universal Design, 1997). To attend to each of the principles
we ask ourselves the following questions as we design curriculum.

   Did I design with all potential groups and motivations in mind?
   Does my design work for learners who may need to approach things differently than I would?
   Is my design easy to use regardless of socioeconomic status, culture, and experience?
   Did my design communicate necessary information effectively, in a way that considers sensory issues

      and the environment?
   Did I design in a way that minimizes or allows accidental learner error?
   Did I design in a way that advantages the able bodied?
   Is my design appropriate for the environment and learners' mobility?

By implementing universal design, educators can better serve learners through practices that promote
accessibility and inclusion for all.

8. DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

OP McCubbins and Annie Specht

Setting the Stage

It's mid-March, and your students are preparing for spring break. As you send them out the door on Friday,
backpacks laden with homework and textbooks, the local news is abuzz with stories about a deadly virus
currently spreading throughout the United States. Within twenty-four hours, the superintendent has
announced that your school has been closed for the remainder of the term. You can't hold any in-person
classes or club activities. The spring musical is canceled, and sports are delayed indefinitely.
Your students don't return from their break, and you're left with no option but to teach online with only a few
days' notice.
This scenario sounds like a horror film written by a high school science teacher, but it's the reality that
many K-12 educators experienced in the spring of 2020. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, instructors from
preschool to postgraduate were forced to pivot to online instruction. Even in a time when flipped, hybrid,
and entirely online classes aren't novel, teaching with technology presented new challenges--and
opportunities--for educators across the globe.

     Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, learners will be able to:
          Understand how technology can be used for content delivery, classroom management, and student
             assessment.
          Evaluate platforms and their suitability for different instructional situations.
          Design learning opportunities that utilize technology for content delivery, classroom management, and
             assessment.
124 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

Introduction

In this chapter, we'll discuss some of the basic tenets of content delivery and incorporating technology in
your classroom. According to the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation (CAEP), preservice
teachers should be able to use technology in content delivery, classroom management, and student
assessment. We'll explore how to apply those three goals to a variety of technologies and platforms.

Overview

Using technology for the sake of using technology is no longer an option. Educators must routinely evaluate
how technology can assist them in delivering content, engaging diverse learners, supporting and assessing
student learning, and empowering students to connect and collaborate in a hyperconnected world. While
many frameworks for technology integration exist, TPACK (see Koehler & Mishra, 2009) is a robust framework
that focuses on the types of knowledge a teacher must possess to integrate technology efficiently and
effectively.

Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge

Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) is a conceptual model that seeks to identify the
complexities of knowledge required by teachers integrating technology. The three primary forms of
knowledge include Content Knowledge (CK), Pedagogical Knowledge (PK), and Technological Knowledge
(TK). The types of knowledge where each of those forms intersect include Pedagogical Content Knowledge
(PCK), Technological Content Knowledge (TCK), Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK), and
Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) (see figure 8.1). These relationships are complex,
dynamic, and transactional. "Individual teachers, grade-level, school-specific factors, demographics,
culture, and other factors ensure that every situation is unique, and no single combination of content,
technology, and pedagogy will apply for every teacher, every course, or every view of teaching" (Koehler, 2012,
para. 3).

Content Delivery
Teaching Techniques/Instructional Methods

After establishing learning objectives, educators must determine the teaching technique(s)--essentially,
how we choose to deliver the planned content (as discussed in the previous chapter)--that will be most
appropriate for ensuring students achieve the objectives.
There are many factors to consider when selecting the teaching techniques, materials, and resources that
you will need to teach effectively and efficiently. This chapter focuses on specific teaching techniques and
provides an overview of the types of technology that you should be familiar with to plan and deliver content.
We also recommend reviewing the chapters in this textbook on diversity, equity, and inclusion and inclusive
teaching before you continue!
126 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

When selecting teaching techniques and technologies to be integrated into your learning environment,
it is important to consider the context in which you will be teaching as well as student preferences and
capacities. Will you be teaching in the classroom or in an applied learning laboratory (i.e., greenhouse, land
lab, ag mech shop)? What type of access do you have in each of the contexts that you may teach in as an
agriculture instructor? What resources can our learners access where we teach?

When we choose instructional methods, we have to consider a number of factors, including our learners'
characteristics.

   Learner characteristics
         Gender, ethnicity, age, motivations, interests
         Cognitive development readiness

   Teacher-centered or student-centered instructional strategies
   Selection of materials and resources

         Technology and media
         Access to technology in specific teaching contexts

Teaching Techniques

As your instructional circumstances vary, so too must your teaching techniques. There are two broad
categories of teaching techniques that we will discuss in this chapter: group teaching techniques and
individual teaching techniques. As an educator, it will be important for you to choose the appropriate
technique(s) for a given lesson. You must consider the subject matter to be taught, the objectives to be
achieved, learner preferences, teacher preferences, and resources available. As you ponder each of these,
there will likely be obvious teaching techniques that best fit your situation. We will explore each of the
categories and define specific techniques within each in more detail below.

Group Teaching Techniques

Group teaching techniques are useful when providing instruction to learners in the same setting. If your
learning environment is conducive for group teaching techniques, you can maximize your efforts in
instructing students that have common needs. Group teaching techniques are appropriate when considering
the limited time educators have with learners and when considering that often in educational settings,
learners should all have some common factual information for progressing through a lesson. Group teaching
techniques are also useful in managing the potential lack of resources available. For example, if a learning
environment is short on student reference materials or electronic devices, group teaching may be the most
efficient method for educators to teach learners the information needed for a given lesson.
                                                    DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 127

Basic Group Teaching Techniques

Seven commonly used group teaching techniques are:

1. Lecture
2. Discussion
3. Demonstrations
4. Field trips
5. Role-play
6. Resource people
7. Cooperative learning

Each technique will be explained in further detail. Table 8.1 provides a brief description of each technique
and how an educator may incorporate technology.

Lecture

The lecture is the most used group teaching technique and is useful for sharing factual information. It may
often have negative connotations as teachers often fail to plan for lectures that adequately engage learners.
Organized lectures with appropriate summaries and clear conclusions are vital for student learning. Visuals
are also a useful tool to help learners develop mental images that help provide important frames of reference.
Lack of enthusiasm is a major hurdle that educators must overcome when using lectures. How can you
effectively use lectures with your learners? Planning is crucial. You should develop a thorough outline of the
content to be taught and important concepts to highlight. The organization should be clear and concise and
make use of appropriate visuals to help students create mental images. You may choose to organize your
lecture outline in any of several orders, such as

 Chronological
 Spatial
 Cause to effect or effect to cause
 Problems and solutions (problems, possible solutions to each, conclusions for each)
 Topical

As you present your lecture, you should be enthusiastic and avoid distracting mannerisms. Leverage visuals
to aid in illustrating the major points and provide summaries throughout the lecture and again at the end. The
end of the lecture should often present very clear and specific conclusions.
128 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

Discussion

Discussions are often used when the educator wishes to serve as a facilitator while learners develop critical
thinking and argumentation skills. Discussions require careful planning as leading questions are often the
driver of this teaching technique. The important categories of information to include in a discussion plan are:

 1. Sequence
 2. Important subject matter and key points to highlight
 3. Leading questions
 4. Teacher directions

As you prepare your discussion plan, the sequence of events is critical to ensure it has a logical flow, thereby
making it easier for students to follow. Failure to include the important subject matter or key points to
highlight will likely result in the omission of that information. Having the important points documented in
your plan serves as a reminder to emphasize the information during the discussion. For new and beginning
educators, questioning can be a difficult teaching skill. You will want to spend time developing questions to
help your learners think critically about the subject matter being learned. Teacher directions serve as a guide
for specific examples that you want to share with your learners during the discussion. For example, you may
include a note to share a specific example to help clarify a point during the discussion. Altogether, these four
categories of information can help ensure you facilitate an effective and engaging discussion.

Another important aspect to consider when planning discussions is the specific format you will use. Common
formats include whole class, brainstorming, buzz groups, and pair-share.

Whole Class

Leading questions are posed, and learners offer answers. This process continues until the major points to be
covered are clearly explained. The educator serves as the facilitator of the discussion to ensure it stays on
track and progresses appropriately.

Brainstorming

You can also provide the whole class or small groups of learners with a specific problem or topic and ask
them to develop as many ideas, answers, or solutions as they are able to. Quantity versus quality is usually
desired when utilizing the brainstorming discussion method. As such, it is important to not hamper creativity
or judge student responses. Once the list of responses has been gathered, they can be evaluated and pared
down as needed to meet the objectives of the lesson.
             DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 129

Buzz Groups

Buzz groups are small groups of three to seven learners that discuss a specific problem or topic and develop
the best possible solution or answers. In contrast to brainstorming, which is concerned with quantity, buzz
groups are more focused and purposeful. After the individual groups have finished the discussion, the
educator facilitates reporting out to the whole class.

Pair-Share

Pair-Share is a quick and effective discussion method that tasks learners with developing their own idea or
opinion to a question or problem before pairing with another learning and sharing. The two learners discuss
and try to formulate the best solution collaboratively.

Discussion can be intimidating to learners for myriad reasons. Topic selection, fear of ridicule, or ambiguous
questions are just a few examples. A skillful educator will plan discussions in such a way that learners feel
comfortable engaging with their peers.

Demonstrations

The psychomotor domain is developed through hands-on application. Agriculture, with its many
psychomotor skills that need to be practiced, is bursting with opportunities for demonstrations. Simply
talking about a skill will not translate to the learner acquiring the ability. Learners need to see and practice to
gain specific psychomotor skills. As the teacher, it is your responsibility to produce a step-by-step procedure
that learners can follow. You must be prepared with explanations, illustrations, and provide the learners
with an opportunity to practice. When planning to use demonstration, you must determine what you wish to
accomplish, which must align with what is possible. This means the teaching objective must be able to be
demonstrated, have an appropriate scope, and be appropriately challenging.
130 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

While spontaneous demonstrations can arise in a learning situation, most should be planned. Once you have
selected a skill that would be best taught via demonstration, develop the step-by-step instructions to follow.
Be sure to indicate the key points to share for each step. Then you should create a list of the necessary
materials for each step in the demonstration. This is crucial and helps avoid oversight during the initial and
succeeding demonstrations. As you prepare to teach the selected skill, following these simple steps will
ensure a successful demonstration:

 1. Assemble materials
 2. Establish the "What's in it for me?" on the part of the learner
 3. Provide an overview of the process you will be demonstrating
 4. Present each step
 5. Repeat challenging steps as necessary
 6. Repeat the entire process
 7. Allow learners to practice

The range of skills that an agricultural educator may want to demonstrate is vast. To ensure a successful
demonstration, you must possess a certain level of mastery for the skill being demonstrated. This may
require practice on your part or the selection of a different teaching technique. Total mastery on your part
may cause you to omit certain steps that a novice may need to be successful. You must think about where
your learners are at and plan accordingly. Another concern is class size. Large class sizes can be a hindering
factor in demonstrations as some learners may not be able to see or hear you walking them through the
steps. Supervision of learners practicing is also a factor you need to plan for. You may need to develop a
rotation procedure to allow learners an opportunity to practice the skill. Safety should always be considered.

Field Trips

A field trip is a great way to provide students with opportunities to observe and participate in real-world
situations. While your program may not have the facilities or resources to accompany instruction in
agriculture subject matter, you can make use of field trips to provide concrete frames of reference for
students. Field trips are a great way to vary your instruction and provide an enriching learning experience for
students. Field trips can be used to create interest at the beginning of a unit, to provide closure and reinforce
the relevance of the content at the end of a unit, and for deeper exploration of what is being learned anytime
in between.
                                                                                    DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 131

Effective field trips require careful planning. Failure to plan will certainly lead to a less than desirable
experience for all involved. Follow these steps to ensure your field trip is successful.

 1. Establish the goals for the field trip.
       a. Determine the specific learning objectives that the trip will address.

 2. Select an appropriate site for the field trip.
       a. Consider the quality of the experience to be seen, a site's willingness to host learners, the distance
            to the site, and the cost.

 3. Secure approval from your administrator
       a. Follow your local policies and procedures for requesting field trips. Some school districts may
            require advance notice of a month or more.

 4. Make specific arrangements for the field trip.
       a. Select a date and time, create an outline of what the learners need to see and do to align with the
            goals and objectives of the trip, and always check on the parking situation (especially if you are
            traveling by bus).

 5. Prepare students for the field trip.
       a. Work with your learners to develop a set of questions to be answered by the field trip. Communicate
            the objectives of the experience to the learners so they know what to expect when they return.
            Discuss proper conduct, expectations for attire, eating arrangements, and any money needed for
            the trip.

 6. Conduct the field trip.
       a. Ensure you have all the necessary documentation based on local policy and procedures. Provide the
            host site with a courtesy reminder about your arrival time. Manage student behavior.

 7. Summarize and reflect on the field trip experience.
       a. The field trip should not end upon departure from the field trip site. You should facilitate a summary
            and reflection exercise with the learners to develop conclusions to be drawn from the experience.
            Challenge your learners to develop plans for applying what they have learned.

Role-play

Providing learners an opportunity to practice specific skills or abilities in an approximated real-world
scenario can be a powerful experience. As you consider the skills that learners need for competing in society,
using the role-playing teaching technique may provide them with an edge. Role-playing involves having those
in the learning environment play or portray a given role. The experience of playing the role and the analysis
of the situation help learners develop the skills or information needed for the subject being learned. Do you
want your learners to master basic agricultural sales skills? Should they know how to properly introduce
strangers or conduct a phone conversation with important stakeholders? This is where role-playing shines.
It is most effective for topics relating to human relations, leadership, and sales skills.
132 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

When deciding to use role-playing, ensure the situation and assessment are aligned to the objectives.
Meaningful closure should be provided to capture the key learnings to be gleaned from the role-play. Since
the role-play experience will involve lots of student-student interaction, you should be explicit in laying out
your expectations. Communicate the purpose of the role-play with your learners and the importance of
supporting each other. Being teased or ridiculed often becomes a barrier to learning.

Resource People

Resource people are incredibly useful in teaching agriculture. You are likely not an expert in all subjects you
may teach, but as an effective educator, you know how to ensure your learners are getting the knowledge
they need to be successful. Resource people are often experts and can help deliver needed information
or provide a different perspective on a topic. Using resource people helps build connections between your
learners and key individuals in the community--those that may help your learners make decisions in the
future. To be most effective, resource people should be more than guest speakers. Resource people may
supplement what is being learned, help add relevance to the topic, or endorse a specific process or practice.

Resource people are akin to consultants to the agricultural educator. As such, you should ensure that you
provide the individual with information about your learners and the specific objectives for what is being
taught. Work with your learners prior to introducing the resource person to develop questions to maximize
the effectiveness of this teaching technique. You should be actively involved in any interaction between the
resource people and your learners. For example, you may need to promote the raising of questions from
learners or provide clarity on the information presented by the resource person. You want resource people
to have a positive experience with your learners, so you need to communicate expectations and encourage
appropriate behavior for interaction.

Cooperative Learning

Cooperative learning is a teaching technique that empowers students to assume more responsibility for
their own learning. Cooperative learning promotes the development of group processing and social skills,
which are important college and/or career readiness skills. Learners, in groups of three to five, work together
toward a common learning goal. The groups are often intentionally selected, and the learners assign roles
once they begin working together. Depending on the situation, these cooperative groups may work together
for one lesson or several weeks. Learners help hold each other accountable and provide support as they work
toward the learning goal.

Table 8.1: Group teaching techniques.

Individualized Teaching Techniques

Every learner has their own unique needs. In an ideal situation, the teacher would establish specific goals
for each course and every learner could work to achieve those goals consistent with their own unique needs
and abilities. Each learner would have the needed materials, approaches, and support to assist them on their
learning journey. In formal settings, this ideal situation can be difficult. However, a quality educator remains
committed to supporting every learner and can do so by leveraging individualized teaching techniques.
Great educators will use a variety of group teaching techniques and individualized teaching techniques. This
provides variety to the learning activities. As you consider individualized teaching techniques, you must be
aware of the needs of your learners. These techniques not only allow you to individualize the learning, but
they can also help learners develop the ability to inquire into subject matter. Learners no longer need to
wait for someone to tell them what they need to know, as they are actively seeking information. This helps
them become independent problem solvers. Through the selection of appropriate individualized teaching
techniques, learners begin to critically evaluate and apply information. Leveraging individualized teaching
techniques can empower learners to take ownership of their learning journey.
134 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

Basic Individualized Teaching Techniques

Five commonly used individualized teaching techniques are:

 1. Supervised study
 2. Experiments
 3. Independent study
 4. Student notebooks
 5. Information sheets, assignment sheets, skill sheets

Each technique will be explained in further detail. Table 8.3 provides a brief description of each technique
and how an educator may incorporate technology.

Supervised Study

Supervised study is a technique that allows learners to use basic reference materials to find answers for
themselves. The learners do not have to depend on the teacher to provide the information and can obtain
specific information that they need independently from what other learners may need. Supervised study
also allows the teacher to work with individuals that may need additional support. As with any teaching
technique, planning is crucial. You should determine the desired outcome of the supervised study, decide on
the resources to be used, and plan how the learners will conduct the supervised study. There are six basic
types of supervised study which include:

 1. All learners study the same problem using the same reference materials.
 2. All learners study the same problem using different reference materials.
 3. Small groups study the same problem using the same reference materials.
 4. Small groups study the same problem using different reference materials.
 5. Small groups study different problems using the same reference materials.
 6. Small groups study different problems using different reference materials.

The decision on which type of supervised study is based on the reference materials available and the desired
outcomes of the technique. It is important that prior to implementing supervised study, you clearly define
the problem, communicate what information the learners need to discover, and provide direction to meet the
desired outcomes.
              DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 135

Experiments

Experiments create a high level of learner involvement, which often translates to increased interest.
Experiments challenge students to use their minds and to be physically involved in setting up the experiment,
making observations, collecting data, and developing conclusions. Experiments allow for concepts, theories,
or approved practices to be graphically illustrated. This teaching technique helps promote systematic
thinking. You must emphasize the importance of being systematic, clear, and thorough throughout the
experiment. In drawing conclusions, learners learn that all the facts must be considered.

As you consider using this technique, you can identify an appropriate experiment or work with your learners
to design an experiment to solve a problem. Once the experiment is identified, outline the procedures
to follow, how to collect and record data, and a list of supplies and materials needed. If you design an
experiment for learners to conduct to solve a problem, it is recommended that you also have an idea of the
basic findings and conclusions the experiment is intended to reveal. At the conclusion of the experiment,
the whole group should benefit from the knowledge gained, which is generally achieved through a report.
You should work with your learners to standardize reporting procedures. Table 8.2 offers a list of ideas for
experiments. Though not exhaustive, it is intended to help you begin thinking of other ideas for experiments.

              throughout the morning?
               How does exposure to natural light versus artificial light affect overall mood?

Table 8.2: Ideas for experiments by subject area.

Independent Study

Independent study is any form of study that is conducted by an individual learner. Supervised study and
experiments, if completed by individual learners, are considered independent studies. However, the
independent study can be leveraged beyond those examples. The main goal of independent study is to meet
the needs on individual learners. You may encounter a situation where a learner can't physically complete a
planned learning activity. Therefore, independent study can provide a meaningful alternative. Independent
study can be reading, self-paced instructional units, computer-assisted instruction, or many other formats.
136 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

During independent study, you take on a facilitator role. The learner assumes responsibility for their own
learning. This technique can add variety to your instruction, but it also promotes learner independence. You
may need to teach learners how to study independently for this technique to be successful. Additionally,
you should work with your learners to apply what is learned from the independent study so that it is not a
meaningless exercise. Independent study can occur during class or lab or outside of traditional instructional
time. While the format for each learner's independent study will vary, some structure is still needed to help
them progress. A sample structure is below.

Sample Independent Study Structure

   What is the problem to be solved?
   What are the questions that must be answered?
   What references will I use?
   What steps will I follow in conducting my independent study?
   What will I learn from my study (a summary)?

Notebooks

Notebooks are a great way for learners to organize and accumulate their knowledge and can serve as a
constant reminder of what was learned and how all the pieces fit together within a unit or course. Notebooks
can also be a great reference for future problems or studying for quizzes or tests. Good note keeping
promotes learning. High-quality notebooks require a commitment from the educator. You have to teach
your learners how to set up their notebooks and the expectations for adding to the notebook as learning
progresses. You can provide learners with a recommended note-taking format to keep everything uniform.
You should continually remind learners of the importance of a high-quality notebook and evaluate the
notebooks periodically. The format, electronic or hard copy, can be based on your preference or the needs of
your learners.

Study Sheets

Another way to individualize learning is to use specific study sheets that are designed to guide a learning
experience. Information sheets, assignment sheets, and skill sheets are the common study sheets used and
are most often associated with laboratory learning. These study sheets allow learners to learn at their own
pace and to progress when they are ready to do so. The study sheets are narrow in scope and should be
developed to be suitable for the majority of the learners.

Information Sheets

Information sheets are short handouts that include basic information (the what, why, and how) a learner
needs in order to perform a specific skill or job. While they can be used to introduce learners to information
for the first time, they are also useful in providing a synopsis or summary of previously covered material.
                                                             DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 137

Assignment Sheets

An assignment sheet details an assignment that learners should complete, how to complete it, and how to
check the assignment for completeness.

Skill Sheets

Skill sheets are similar to assignment sheets but are more limited in scope. Skill sheets focus on a specific
skill and provide guidance to the learner in developing and mastering the skill. Step-by-step instructions with
illustrations help learners visualize the specific skill.

Many factors go into considering the teaching techniques to be used. For individualized teaching techniques,
it is imperative that you consider the readiness of the learner. In order for a learner to pursue independent
study, they must be able to organize thoughts, read, manage personal behavior, and synthesize information.
You may have some learners that will never fully meet these conditions while others may thrive. This
highlights the importance of knowing the needs, skills, abilities, and interests of your learners. Variety is
important and with the range of group and individual teaching techniques discussed, you can maintain
student interest while working toward the desired outcomes of your program.

Incorporating Technology in Instruction

Technology has transformed many aspects of our lives. It has the potential to do the same for teaching and
learning. As educators, we should embrace and leverage the transformative power of technology to create
exciting and engaging learning opportunities, or risk leaving our students at a competitive disadvantage in
the technologically advanced workforce. Technology integration requires careful planning and appropriate
pedagogical practices to be successful.

Common forms of technology we incorporate into our learning environments include productivity software,
learning management systems, content delivery platforms, and assessment tools. Generally speaking, we
will likely use technology to plan, create, and deliver content; assess learning; and empower students as
creators.

Examples of technology used to plan, create, and deliver content and to assess learning may include:

Digital Divide, Access, and Accessibility

Although technology has impacted many aspects of our daily lives, its full potential remains out of reach
to millions of people. The term "digital divide" refers to the gap between individuals who have access to
computers and the internet and those who don't.

It is important to analyze our specific situations to know what is and isn't appropriate in our local
communities. Access to broadband internet remains a privilege with very limited access to individuals in
rural areas. According to the Federal Communications Commission, a quarter of rural Americans and
Americans who live in Tribal lands lack access to reliable and affordable high-speed internet. Lower-income
families are less likely to own personal computers or tablets. Many learners rely on school programs to
provide devices for educational use.

As we prepare for instruction, we should consider what we already have. What technology resources are
available in our learning environments, our schools, our communities? What access do our learners have and
what access do they need? Develop a short survey asking about learners' technology access and use. Develop
opportunities for learners of all access levels. For example, post instructional materials online, but also have
physical copies for learners without access.

There are also many governmental and nongovernmental programs to help fund technology-assisted
learning. The United States Office of Educational Technology, part of the US Department of Education,
offers grants and funds to support remote learning and connectivity (for more information, visit
https://tech.ed.gov/funding/). We can also leverage other creative solutions, such as crowdsourcing and
fundraising, to support technology in our learning environments.

Accessibility and Assistive Technology

Accessibility is a broad concept that applies to content, devices, and digital tools. Accessible technology
removes barriers for students with varying cognitive and physical abilities. As educators, we have a moral
and legal obligation to ensure that we provide our learners with accessible materials, including content and
technological tools.

Some forms of technology have been specifically created to help learners fully integrate into a learning
environment. Assistive technology is equipment or software that helps learners navigate their environments
while managing challenges with learning, communication, or mobility. Assistive technology includes high-
tech tools like augmentative communication devices or accessibility features on devices such as text to
speech, word prediction, and optical character recognition. The term can also apply to physical parts of the
learning environment, including furniture and peripheral tools like keyboards.
140 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

Examples of accessible content may include closed captions for videos, alt-text that describes an image,
text-to-speech functionality, or screen magnifiers. Most technological tools have built-in accessibility
checkers and can provide recommendations for changes that can make content more accessible.
Additionally, we can work with resource personnel to ensure the technology we use or the content we
create is accessible to all learners, regardless of abilities. For more information, visit https://www.w3.org/
TR/WCAG20/.

Specific Examples of Technology Integration

Learning Management Systems

A learning management system (LMS) is a set of software that centralizes the administration, tracking,
and reporting of educational activities. An LMS allows instructors to develop a course schedule, register
students, and assess their learning outcomes in one platform (Ninoriya et al., 2011). LMSs are used for a
variety of administrative and teaching tasks, including tracking student attendance, delivering content, and
recording assessments.

The list of enterprise (paid) and free LMS options are always evolving. At the time of this printing, the
top three enterprise LMSs used in the United States are Blackboard, Canvas, and Moodle (Edutechnica,
2020). Google Classroom is a free alternative that integrates email, calendars, and document sharing within
the Google app suite; by 2017, it was used by half of K-12 students in the United States (Singer, 2017).
Schoology incorporates elements of social media and gamification--applying elements of game playing, like
competition and scoring points--to educational activities in its interface, making it well suited for all learners
(Fenton, 2017).

Learning management systems have many benefits. They are portable, often accessible from a host of
mobile devices, and scalable, meaning they can be implemented in both small and large groups of learners.
They can be integrated into hybrid instruction, or teaching that includes elements of both in-person and
distance learning (Whiteside, Dikkers, & Lewis, 2017), allowing instructors to move from a physical learning
environment into the digital space.

At the same time, it's important to recognize LMS platforms' drawbacks: They can be expensive to license,
especially if they're not supported by a school system, though free options exist. They require technology
inputs, including stable internet connections and hardware like laptops or tablets. There is also something of
a training learning curve for instructors, especially as technologies and platforms are constantly changing.
Care must also be taken to ensure that the LMS and its tools and operations are accessible to users with
physical or cognitive challenges.
                                                                                    DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 141

Strategies and Best Practices for Teaching, Management, and Assessment with an LMS

When teaching with an LMS, you must remember that it is not itself a teaching tool; rather, it's a means of
organizing and sharing information and activities with learners. There are a number of web tools available
that can be incorporated into and deployed by an LMS, but we shouldn't rely on the LMS alone to deliver
content.

When developing content to share via LMS, remember to take advantage of multimedia features. For
example, a lecture captured on video may be more engaging than a list of slides for students to review.
Many LMS platforms allow learners to upload responses in audiovisual format, turning them from multimedia
consumers into content creators.

From a management standpoint, it's important to set expectations for learner and instructor activities in the
LMS. Before we begin a session, we should explain how our LMS works, and how we will use it in our learning
environments. Make sure learners are comfortable with the format and functions before turning them loose.

LMS platforms allow us to assess learning and gather feedback through quizzes, surveys, and polls. These
assessments let instructors choose from a variety of question types, set time limits and deadlines, and
ease their workload through automatic grading of multiple-choice, matching, or true/false items where
applicable. Learners can also be prompted to upload portions of an assessment--for example, a schematic
they've drawn or calculations they've attempted.

Teaching Techniques Reimagined

Virtual Field Trips

Firsthand experiences like field trips are important parts of an educational experience. However, visiting
locations such as farms, production facilities, and factories is becoming increasingly difficult due to
tightening biosecurity, health, and safety restrictions. In addition, in-person visits require funding and
instructor time to coordinate schedules, acquire approvals, and arrange transportation. Virtual field trips
(VFTs) offer an alternative for getting learners into off-limits or geographically distant spaces.

Like in-person field trips, VFTs help learners understand and connect with a profession by placing them
in the field with experts--the key difference being that VFTs rely on technology, like prerecorded videos,
360-degree viewers, and teleconferencing software, to make the "visit" happen. VFTs may be synchronous,
meaning that learners and hosts interact with each other live via web cameras and microphones, or
asynchronous, meaning that the virtual tour or visit is recorded in advance and shared in an online platform
like YouTube or an organization website.
142 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

VFT Best Practices

When we're considering participating in or creating a VFT, there are several elements to consider. It's
important to introduce our students to the subject of the experience before engaging in the virtual trip.
These pre-VFT materials could include readings, pretests, and in-class activities. As with any learning
endeavor, we should also be prepared to assess student engagement and learning after the experience.
Posttests, surveys, or debrief discussions can help reinforce key takeaways. We can incorporate a VFT into
a project that uses information gained in the field trip, or even assign students to plan and host their own
virtual trips with instructor support.
Preparation is key to a successful virtual field trip. Hosts in the field and instructors in the class should all test
their equipment, including cameras, microphones, and internet connections, in advance of the experience.
If the VFT is synchronous, ask learners to prepare questions for the speaker or host in advance. Though new
questions will almost certainly arise as the VFT ensues, this will prevent any pauses or disruptions to the flow
of conversation. If we're planning or organizing a VFT, recording and archiving these experiences, so that
learners can refer back to them, is also helpful.

Immersive Technology

Immersive technology is a term used to describe technology that replaces or extends the physical
environment. Examples include augmented and virtual reality. Augmented reality (AR) is when digital
artifacts are overlaid into a real environment on a screen (e.g., smartphone). Virtual reality (VR) is typically
defined as a fully immersive experience where the environment is completely replaced with a digital
environment, usually via a headset (see figure 8.2).

Figure 8.2: Tethered, stand-alone, and mobile VR headsets. Figure description.
                 DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 143

Virtual Reality

Originally, fully immersive VR experiences required a powerful VR-ready computer and a tethered VR
headset. Now, stand-alone VR headsets that don't require a costly computer are readily available. Costly
computer equipment can be a barrier for many schools. The power of VR is still within reach through mobile
VR experiences. Mobile VR utilizes smartphones to deliver limited-capability VR experiences. These
experiences are most often in the form of 360-degree videos that can be used with or without a mobile VR
viewer.

Augmented Reality

Augmented reality brings abstract concepts to life via a smartphone or tablet. Students can now hold a
strand of DNA or rapidly prototype and see their creations as a digital artifact before production. AR can also
provide information on objects that can enhance and extend learning.

Immersive experiences are well supported with several pedagogical theories. Such theories that support
immersive tech and VR use include situated learning, experiential learning, embodied interaction. (For more
information about pedagogical theories see chapter 3, "Principles of Teaching and Learning.")

Much like VFTs, immersive technology applications can mitigate safety and security hazards that are
associated with agricultural occupations. You can use immersive experiences to train students, to gamify
content, or to connect students to experts in other parts of the world. Immersive experiences can eliminate
time, place, space, and financial constraints.

We have used immersive experiences to help train students on shop safety, candling eggs, proper cattle
handling, veterinary skills training, and animal waste management.

Virtual Simulations

Simulations have long been a staple in educational settings. Simulations put students into situations that
mimic the real world in order to create a real-feel experience. Many professions rely on simulations as they
offer lifelike experiences for beginners and experienced individuals alike. Depending on the complexity and
the technology readily available in your classroom or school, simulations can be used for an entire class,
groups of students, or as an individual activity.

Consuming versus Creating

Many immersive applications exist that can be used in your program, but to take learning to the next level,
you can shift students from consumers of those experiences to creators of those experiences. For instance,
you can have students create their own virtual tours or immersive training content with 360-degree cameras
(or a smartphone application) and readily available software.
144 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

Example Checklist for Creating Virtual Tours

   Identify the purpose of the virtual tour.
         How does the virtual tour help students achieve the objectives?
         What do you want the students to gain from the virtual tour?

   Create a storyboard.
         Sketch out the scenes or develop a list of scenes that contain what you want students to
            experience.
         Include points of interest that you want students to notice in each scene.
         Write out instructions for each scene.

   Visit the site to take 360 photos (or use existing 360 photos).
         Using a 360 camera, or existing 360 photos, collect all the needed assets.

   Create the virtual tour.
         Using your preferred virtual tour platform, construct the virtual tour based on your storyboard.

Many agricultural communications programs create publications, public relations campaigns, and other
communications artifacts as projects in advanced courses that can be shared with a wide audience. They
assume roles (remember role-playing?) as staff members for a magazine or communications firm, utilize
their skills, and produce materials that they can distribute to clients, readers, or other stakeholders.
Publications like newsletters and magazines can be easily shared with inexpensive tools such as Issuu,
an online publishing platform. Educators can get free licenses for tools like Adobe Express, which allows
students to create social media posts, interactive web pages, and videos using tablets or smartphones.
Students at Ohio State University have created many great examples of this type of project. To see their
work, visit https://u.osu.edu/agrinaturalist/.

Generative Artificial Intelligence

Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a subset of artificial intelligence that leverages machine learning
models to generate content. These models are trained on large language data sets, learning to create
similar outputs based on the patterns and structures they've learned. This includes creating anything from
articles and reports to poems, music, and even realistic images. Generative AI has grown in popularity and is
becoming ubiquitous across many industries, including education.

Pros of Generative AI in Education

One of the most powerful uses of generative AI in education is the potential for personalized learning.
By analyzing a student's learning patterns, comprehension level, and areas of strength and weaknesses,
generative AI can create customized educational content tailored specifically to that student's needs. This
enhances the learning experience and can lead to improved academic performance.
                                                                                    DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY | 145

Generative AI also has immense potential in making education more accessible. For instance, it can be
used to generate learning materials in multiple languages or create synthesized speech for visually impaired
students.

Furthermore, generative AI can help educators by automating some of their workload. It can generate
quizzes, assignments, and tests based on a given syllabus or learning material, freeing up time for educators
to focus on instruction and student engagement.

Finally, generative AI can be used as a creative tool in the classroom. Students could use it to generate
ideas for essays, stories, or art projects. It's a great way to introduce students to AI technology and inspire
creativity.

Cons of Generative AI in Education

While generative AI holds great potential, it's essential to be aware of its limitations and challenges. One of
the biggest concerns is the quality and accuracy of generated content. Without careful oversight, AI can
produce content that is misleading or inaccurate.

Generative AI also presents ethical considerations. These systems could potentially be used to create
plagiarized work or disinformation, so educators must instill ethical usage principles in their students.

Furthermore, there's the risk of over-reliance on AI in the learning process. Generative AI should not replace
the role of educators but rather serve as a tool to supplement and enrich the educational experience.

Examples of Generative AI in the Classroom

Chatbots powered by generative AI can simulate conversations with students, answering queries and
providing explanations about a particular topic. Generative AI can be used in storytelling or creative writing
classes, where a model like GPT-4 can generate story prompts or continue a narrative based on student
input. This can be an exciting tool to stimulate creative thinking and improve writing skills.

As you promote inquiry among your learners, generative AI can be leveraged to help brainstorm and refine
research questions for projects or experiments. It can even be used to provide suggestions for
methodologies or sources of information.

While exploring history, generative AI can create simulations or scenarios based on historical events,
providing students with a more immersive and engaging way to learn about the past.
146 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

While generative AI offers numerous exciting opportunities for teaching and learning, it's important to
understand its limitations and employ it responsibly. The efficacy of using generative AI in education is when
it's used as a tool to supplement, rather than replace, traditional teaching methods. The future of education
is likely to be a blend of human and AI-driven teaching methods, offering a more personalized, engaging, and
effective learning experience.

Sample Prompts for Generative AI

   "Can you describe what a career in environmental science might look like?"
   "Develop a fifty-minute lesson plan for ninth graders on the basics of floral design. Include an interest

      approach, two different teaching techniques, and a check for understanding."

Other Topics to Consider

   Copyright. Copyright is a form of intellectual property protection for authors of published and
      unpublished works. As an educator, you have a legal and ethical obligation to respect copyrighted
      material. You serve as a model for your students in doing so.

   Fair Use. Fair use is a legal doctrine and framework for making a determination on whether or not
      using certain material is a copyright infringement. Fair use is commonly cited for nonprofit educational
      purposes.

   Acceptable Use. Set of rules established by the owner of a computer or network that defines the
      guidelines as to how it should be used.

1. Define the following key terms.

        a. TPACK
        b. Digital divide
        c. Accessibility
        d. Learning management system
        e. Hybrid instruction
        f. Synchronous instruction
        g. Asynchronous instruction

2. Develop a technology matrix with ten different tools/platforms. In your matrix, provide a brief description
    of the tool and identify how you would use it for content delivery, classroom management, or student
    assessment.

3. Your travel budget has been limited for the second year in a row. How could you offer your learners an

148 | DELIVERING CONTENT WITH TECHNOLOGY

     Applying the Content

     You are teaching in a secondary school-based agricultural education (SBAE) program in an urban area in a state
     known for its production of eggs and poultry. As you plan an animal sciences unit related to poultry production,
     you begin to outline a field trip to a farm where chickens are raised. This facility hatches chicks and raises them
     to a certain size before they are sent to a different location to finish growing.
     You soon realize that the field trip may not be possible. Your state has strict biosecurity guidelines, or procedures
     required to prevent diseases from being introduced to and spread within flocks, for poultry producers, including
     protocols that require visitors to shower before and after they visit a farm. In addition, you realize that your
     program is located several hours from the farm you want to visit, so you would have to arrange for learners to
     miss most of a day of instruction.
     As you ponder what to do, you consider creating some type of technology-enhanced lesson. You know that
     agricultural organizations in your state have partnered with producers to plan such experiences. Learners in your
     program are given tablets to use for instruction and assignments, and your space is equipped with a classroom
     webcam and a projector.
     You find the contact information for the farm's manager and begin to brainstorm.
     The above scenario sets the scene for planning a virtual experience for the learners in your program. Using the
     information provided, create a lesson plan and a checklist (refer back to the Example Checklist for Creating Virtual
     Tours) for the experience.
     As you plan, answer the following questions:

         1. What platform and format will you choose? How will your lesson plan shape or be shaped by the delivery
             method?

        2. What opportunities does the virtual experience offer that learners may not get from an in-person visit?
        3. What potential barriers (technological, logistic, or pedagogical) may you encounter as you implement a

             virtual experience?

Reflective Questions

1. What teaching techniques might lend themselves to teaching agriscience? Which ones might be less
     applicable?

2. What technology do you expect to have access to in your future learning environment?

9. ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

Tiffany Drape

Setting the Stage

The end of the unit is nearly here, and we must provide progress reporting. A stack of papers sits on our
desk, more documents are on our computer, and the wall is lined with projects we've had our learners working
on. We think, "Don't forget all of the SAE projects that are off school grounds and CDE contest results."
Immediate feelings of dread and being overwhelmed, not knowing where to start, and wondering how to even
grade all of this overcome us. "Forget it, everyone gets an A," we think. The easy way seems like the path
of least resistance so we can prepare for the next day and leave school at a reasonable hour. But we know
our building principal will be observing us and asking us to provide examples of learner work, lesson plans,
and how they were assessed so they can track our progress and report to the School Board and accrediting
bodies. We go down the hall and ask another teacher what they do and how they grade. They email some
rubrics. We scour the internet for assessments that are like the content we've been teaching hoping to find
some fast help.

I can vividly recall this scenario my first year of teaching. No one taught me how to manage all the
responsibilities I'd be tasked with, let alone how to then manage assessment, progress reports, and
Individualized Educational Plan (IEP) accommodations, and then do a good job of reporting it to provide
evidence of scholarly achievement. It was a watershed moment for me, and it will be for you too. Everything
is new and unfamiliar, everything feels immediate, but much of it won't lead to providing evidence of
assessment.

     Objectives

     The purpose of this chapter is to introduce our readers to assessing agricultural education. More specifically, the
     objectives are to:

          Briefly review testing and assessment in the United States.
          Explore the use of formative assessment as a tool to evaluate agricultural education to support its

             importance in secondary education.
          Investigate backward design as one way to provide evidence as a form of assessment.

Introduction

Understanding that every program is different and agricultural education is not a static program across
states, regions, territories, or countries, this chapter aims to help us understand what assessment is, what
counts as evidence, who determines this, and how we can use these to provide evidence of learning and
career skill development for twenty-first century agricultural education. What I propose is formative, longer-
term assessment, not the once-per-year test that our education system is currently built on. To provide
evidence to our stakeholders, community members, and other folks who will want to know how we're training
learners, formative assessment can drive home the importance and perhaps even necessity of agriculture
education and Career and Technical Education (CTE) as an integral part of public education.

Overview of Assessing Agricultural Education

This overview provides a brief history of education standards at the state and national levels. Standards
Based Education (SBE) rose to become mainstream in the 1970s and 1980s. Before this, most jobs in the
United States required only an eighth-grade proficiency. With the rise of international trade and outsourcing
of labor and manufacturing, the United States soon realized that it needed employees with higher-level skills
and an eighth-grade education was no longer sufficient for these jobs.
                                                                                         ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 155

Governors took initiative with drafting and implementing standards for their respective states and
territories. By 1989, the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics published "Curriculum and Evaluation
Standards for School Mathematics." In 1990, President Bush announced a set of education goals for the
nation and the governors followed suit, forming a task force to monitor each state's goals. As the 1990s
progressed, all but one of the states and territories developed their own unique statewide standards, and
most either bought off-the-shelf tests for statewide use or created their own. Most states and territories
worked with commercial testing companies to produce custom tests, frequently of much the same design as
the most popular off-the-shelf tests. The tests satisfied the need of the accountability wing of the standards
movement for an instrument that could be used to hold teachers accountable. In doing so, the tests fell far
short of the kind of assessment tool that would provide incentives that fostered problem solving and critical
thinking in the schools.

Note that standards vary on tribal, Indigenous, and other sovereign lands. The Bureau of Indian Education
works as part of the US government to provide direction and management of all education functions,
including the formation of policies and procedures, the supervision of all program activities, and the approval
of the expenditure of funds appropriated for education on Indigenous lands. This encompasses 183 schools
among 64 reservations in 23 states and 26 tribal colleges and universities.

As the twentieth century ended, the accountability movement came to dominate the standards movement
in most states. States began building out comparison charts showing how schools compared to one another
and to the state standards on the state tests. School districts everywhere began to find themselves under
pressure to improve student performance based on the tests. This pressure was, of course, passed down to
the schools and teachers. Many of the state tests were narrowly focused on facts and skills, rather than on a
real understanding of the subject, critical thinking, and problem solving. Because of this, teachers focused
almost wholly on test preparation and narrowed the curriculum. This depressed the achievement of many
learners who would have achieved at higher levels if there had been no accountability system. Many teachers
felt that the new tests and the accountability system that went with them were destroying effective teaching.
156 | ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

       How did this narrow the curriculum?

       The National Research Council (2011) concluded that the emphasis on testing yielded little learning progress
       but caused significant harm to both learners and teachers. Teachers who succumbed to the pressure were
       forced to only cover what would appear on the test, teach in less inclusive ways, and conform their teaching
       methods to the multiple-choice format that many tests are designed for, and many were driven out of the
       profession.

       Narrowing the curriculum undermined student engagement, discouraged inclusive education, and harmed
       learners from low-income and underrepresented minority (URM) backgrounds, English language learners,
       and learners with disabilities. Children from white, middle- and upper-income backgrounds were more likely
       to be placed in "gifted and talented" or college preparatory programs where they are challenged to read,
       explore, investigate, think and progress rapidly while their less privileged peers often lagged even farther
       behind.

       Missing from this standards-based model, but part of other educational assessment and curriculum delivery
       models, were: (1) high standards that incorporate a "thinking curriculum," like critical thinking; (2)
       assessments that teachers would like to teach to; (3) authority for the school principals and others who bear
       the burden of accountability to enact changes when necessary; (4) clear curriculum frameworks that would
       make it possible to build fully aligned instructional systems; and (5) investments in the tools and training the
       people would need to do the job.

       In 2002, No Child Left Behind (NCLB) expanded, booming the high-stakes testing industry and becoming
       one of the major drivers in school performance determination. The impact of this law proved to be wide
       reaching, affecting every single school in some way. One of the major aspects of NCLB was the provision that
       required states adopt a system of accountability whereby learners, teachers, administrators, and schools are
       evaluated annually based on learners' standardized test performance and that consequences follow when
       student scores are low or annual gains in school achievement are not made.

       Negative consequences include narrowing the curriculum, teaching to the test, pushing learners out of
       school, driving teachers out of the profession, and undermining student engagement and school climate.

       Learners from low-income and minority-group backgrounds, English language learners, and learners with
       disabilities, are more likely to be denied diplomas, retained in grade, placed in a lower track, or unnecessarily
       put in remedial education programs. They are more likely to receive a "dumbed-down" curriculum, based
       heavily on rote drill and test practice. This ensures they will fall further and further behind their peers. Many
       drop out, some ending up in the "school-to-prison pipeline." On the other hand, children from white, middle-
       and upper-income backgrounds are more likely to be placed in "gifted and talented" or college preparatory
       programs where they are challenged to read, explore, investigate, think, and progress rapidly.
                                                                                         ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 157

       As a result, teachers and administrators feel enormous pressure to ensure that test scores consistently rise.
       Schools narrow and manipulate the curriculum to match the test, while teachers tend to cover only what
       is likely to be on the next exam. Methods of teaching conform to the multiple-choice format. Education
       increasingly resembles test prep. It is easy to see why this could happen in low-scoring districts. But some
       high-scoring schools and districts, striving to keep their top rank, also succumb. The pressure is so great that
       a growing number of administrators and teachers have engaged in various kinds of cheating to boost scores.

High-Stakes Testing

We can't talk about learning standards without talking about high-stakes testing. Since its inception, it's
grown into a billion-dollar business. SAT, ACT, LSAT, GRE, and MCAT are a few of the acronyms we might be
familiar with and perhaps have even had to take yourself. High-stakes testing has arguments both for and
against them and the debates about costs, equity, and access continue. Whether we like them or not, our
learners will have to take them or have taken them already. Understanding their role in public education and
how we can use them as part of our agriculture programming can be helpful in providing evidence to our
stakeholders in our school district.

These tests are not only used to assess student aptitude and achievements, but also to inform how funding
is funneled, assess curriculum and instruction, and help make predictions about how successful a student
will be after they graduate. Most folks never take the time to investigate how these tests came to be adopted
en masse or if they are in fact valid and reliable tools at determining aptitude and achievement of learners or
a school. We know that high-stakes testing is not the panacea but the education system we may work in will
use these tests as input to make decisions each year.

We know that high-stakes testing affects things like a student passing to the next grade level and choosing
a school or moving within a district and schools being able to receive funding for special services and IEP
accommodations. The list is endless. In some schools, learners will take as many as 113 standardized high-
stakes test from K-12.

Most Americans trust that these tests were crafted with the utmost care and accurately report on student
achievement in a reliable and valid way. For the most part, these tests have been integrated into the current
education system. Most citizens don't question the information generated from these tests and how they are
used.
158 | ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

Opportunity for Agricultural Education

This is the opportunity for agricultural education to lead on the reimagining of what the future of standards
might look like. Compulsory education is one of the longest running experiments in our country and
agricultural education should continue to be part of this basic education that school-aged children deserve.
Creating compelling, reliable methods to formatively assess learners is one way to ensure that the
importance of agricultural education does not get lost. We can teach learners how to critically think, problem
solve, and provide long-term evidence of learning. Agricultural education can adapt with these changes.
Many agricultural education teachers are already dual certified, offer college level courses to empower
learners with inclusive education, and can be asked to teach one or more classes outside of their
certification area, depending on their state/territory certification policies. With the wide variety of
agricultural education classes, dual enrollment, college credit, and the integration of Future Farmers of
America (FFA) and Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE), agricultural education has expanded the
narrow curriculum in a manageable and actionable way. Now the field needs to prove why it works and model
how it can work while working with and respecting NCLB, SBE, and high-stakes testing.

Agricultural education and CTE offer valuable skills, but they can be hard to justify without evidence. Not all
administrators view evidence the same way. A ribbon with a county fair SAE project or win at a Leadership
Development Event (LDE) is not always considered assessment. As budgets shrink, test scores continue to
drive funding, and resources continue to be stretched, agricultural education must take advantage of the
work it's currently doing to create the program we envision. Whether we're a veteran teacher in that school
or it's our first job, the goal of assessment should be to leave it better than we found it. What "better" means
is up for interpretation.

In every education setting we'll work in, both formal and informal, there will always be the trend or the popular
thing at the time. Word walls, learning objectives, book clubs, and a host of other district mandated teaching
strategies will be employed by administrators, and we'll be expected to conform to these things. How can
we design assessment to endure long past the newest trend? How do we incorporate the new trend without
feeling like we need to start from scratch?
                                                                                         ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 159

We're Not Grading, We're Collecting Evidence

Let's reframe our thinking first. We're not grading assignments. We're collecting evidence to determine
student progress and pointing them toward their next steps. The mental switch alone will provide us the time,
space, and permission to figure out if we want to prioritize assessment. When we think of it as providing
feedback and pointing in the next direction, it no longer turns into this "thing we have to do" but will hopefully
make it the thing we need to inform the learners, ourselves, and other interested stakeholders. We don't
have to collect all the evidence by ourselves either. Expanding the relationship with our learners to engage
them in their own progress through keeping records, actively reflecting, exhibiting incremental progress,
and sharing those things with us will help take some of the burden from us. Providing feedback is not a one-
way conversation, it should be reciprocal.

What Counts as Evidence?

Almost anything can count as evidence. Let's start with existing evidence. New teachers rarely look at
what already exists regarding assessment and with learners who may have taken prior coursework in that
program. Other existing data can be student records, IEP plans, and prior results from FFA and SAE work.
This can serve as baseline evidence and gives us and the learners a place to begin identifying what
milestones or progress they can work toward.

Some say that any assessment framework and any assessment model that tracks progress against
individual learning intentions and targets counts as evidence. This operates under the assumption that these
models and frameworks exist, which they may not be the case during our first year or three of teaching.
Evidence comes from two principal sources: direct observation and the examination of artifacts.

If we need a nonexhaustive list of what could count as evidence:

   Images, still and moving
   Audio evidence
   Interviews, in audio or transcribed form
   Group discussions, in audio or transcribed form (check school policies on recording)
   Documents
   Observations
   Field notes
   Data from think-aloud protocols
   Anecdotes
   Answers to questionnaires
   Record books
   Results from CDE's or other leadership events
160 | ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

We also need to consider what counts as evidence for teacher evaluations. The two are intimately linked. We
may want to inquire about this with our mentors, colleagues, and building principal to help us understand the
evaluation itself and what's being evaluated. The task then becomes figuring out what to do with it, how to
assess it, and then how to package and communicate it to the various stakeholder groups.

Formative and Summative Assessment

While there are many kinds of evidence from the list above, how we organize and report evidence falls in
one of two camps: formative or summative assessment. We can put a play on words to help us remember
the difference between formative and summative. Summative assessment refers to a summary at the end.
Summative assessment, which is what high-stakes testing is, is the one time, one test that determines a
multitude of aspects of a student, their teachers, their school, and their performance across that class or
grade.

Formative refers to assessment that is formed along the way or incrementally. Instead of one test to
determine the success or failure of a student, I'm proposing we take a formative approach to assessment.

Here's why: Agricultural education is an evolving industry, and an evolving curriculum goes with it. The
curriculum is always adapting, improving, learning new things that add to our collective education. As the
agriculture industry changes, we must adapt as well. Formative assessment gives us the autonomy to adapt
without losing the rigor and evidence-based collection.

What would happen if we could collect that evidence incrementally instead of waiting until the end of the
marking period or term and then panicking because grades are due? As we look back at the pile of "work" or
evidence, many teachers look at it and say or think "What did I even do with these kids the past X number of
weeks?" Some are more organized, but new or young teachers are often so overwhelmed by everything that
they forget that the evidence they provide informs decisions about their learners, their own employment, the
school, and the community. There are so many aspects to be mindful of when starting out, assessment often
falls by the wayside until it doesn't, and the principal or team leader needs that evidence for reporting.

We may be asking ourselves several questions: How do we do this? Collect intentional evidence to provide
formative evidence?

Let's think about it backward. At the end, what do we want our learners to know, or what skills should they
have acquired, and what evidence do we want to be able to provide to prove incremental progress?

Learning Confirmation

Let's use this sample objective to help guide us:

     Goal for the learner: Learners will be more proficient public speakers.
     Objectives: Understand, describe, and report on agricultural issues.
     Task: Apply information to design and develop a prepared public speech for a contest.

Backward Design: A Primer

What if we designed our formative assessments using a backward design? Thinking about what we want the
student to understand, explain, and expand at the end of that course can help us work from the end back to
day one (figure 9.1). Along the way, we can collect the incremental pieces that will account for the evidence we'll
use in the formative assessment of the learners. Since evidence is broadly defined, we can move away from that
"traditional test" we've been taught and expand what we might want to collect that counts as evidence. Instead
of one recording of the student presenting their speech at the end of the course, recording at several points
during the class will create a trail of evidence that we can use to assess student progress and with stakeholders
to show incremental progress over time. We may find that sometimes those "traditional tests" are still useful, but
they're not the only or best way to provide evidence of student progress toward that objective at the end of the
course. What other pieces of evidence could we collect to provide concrete progress in our learners throughout
the course?

Figure 9.1: Backward design. Figure description.
162 | ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

     We can start planning with the final outcome in mind to guide the class, account for changes along the way, and
     offer places for us as the teacher to make adjustments. We can ask ourselves several questions to help frame
     our thinking. Start with the "need to know" questions first: What do learners need to understand at the end
     of the unit or course? What skills will they acquire through completing the unit or course? At what points will
     feedback be important to give so learners can keep moving forward? How are we ensuring this is inclusive and
     will accommodate learners who may need more time to grasp concepts or have other needs?
     Move onto what might be "nice to know" questions: What might be nice to include if we have space? What can
     be removed if something happens that hinders the progress?
     Finally, "what do we need" questions: What do we need to learn to teach our learners? What resources do we
     need to teach the content? Where can we find the information and resources we'll need?
     Laying the answers out on note cards or organizing using a visual aid can help refine and prioritize what we
     might teach. As an example, if lessons are taking longer than anticipated, we can go back to our design and
     decide which activities and pieces of evidence will provide the information we need and what can be changed,
     edited, or cut. It will not change the goals or objectives of the class; it will only adjust and adapt the formative
     evidence we collect along the way. (See figure 9.2.)

     Figure 9.2: Backward course design. Figure description.

     When we think about the end first, it can help us make decisions about what we can do, what we have time for,
     and identify points along the way where formative evidence should be collected. This is also something we can
     provide for our own teacher evaluations with specific points for the supervisor that can be used to gauge our
     progress and set our own incremental goals as an educator.
                      ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 163

Applying the Content

Questions to ask:

   1. What do we want learners to understand at the end of the unit/course? What evidence do we need to
        exhibit that proficiency or skill?

   2. Next, what steps or skills do learners need to learn to meet objective one?
   3. What pieces of evidence from class activities do we need to collect to provide incremental progress to

        meet objective one?

Deliberately asking ourselves these questions can help us distill what's important for a student to be competent
in versus what's less important. It can then inform our decision-making process on what we'll count as evidence,
at what point(s) it will be collected, and how it will be assessed. In short:

   1. Identify the desired results (big ideas and skills).
   2. Determine acceptable levels of evidence that support that the desired results have occurred

        (culminating assessment tasks).
   3. Design activities that will make desired results happen (learning events).

Secondary questions after we've made this initial list or document could include how much time these activities
take, what will count as evidence, what supplies/materials we need, and what considerations exist for students
with IEP/special needs.

Assessing the Learning Activities

Let's be honest, there is no right or perfect way. Looking for a panacea will not be found. What we're sharing
are some basic guiding tenants to begin thinking about, practicing, and implementing to help us begin our
teaching career. Our teaching style, the community we work in, and the learners we serve are a few components
that will inform how we assess learners. First know that we can (and should consider) using existing rubrics
to assess learner work. Returning to the example of a public speaking course, the MANRRS Public Speaking
Contest, National FFA Public Speaking Contest, or any related guidelines can be used and adapted to fit our
student's needs. We don't need to reinvent the wheel and we can make changes to adapt preexisting models
to our learners and their work. We can use the same rubric over the life of the public speaking class or unit and
document student progress over time. This will show areas of improvement for both us and the learner and
provide a long-term evidence trail over the life of the class or unit.
164 | ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION

     Formative assessment not only means collecting incremental evidence as a process over time but giving specific
     feedback to learners that is then turned into student action, assessing regularly, sometimes even daily, and
     taking the data to modify the learning plan and instruction for the learners. Rapid feedback loops must be
     incorporated to offer learners regular feedback. Feedback can be given in multiple ways and doesn't have to be
     long. It could be as simple as figuring out how to get a learner to stop using filler words (e.g., um, like) and can
     be documented through recordings that the student then reviews and works to alleviate their use. Having those
     recordings will provide incremental evidence that the student did improve their public speaking skills.
     Formative assessment allows for the student to participate as well. When we look for progress over time, the
     learner can actively participate in deciding what they deem as progress. Using fewer filler words, being able to
     reflect on class activities, and making adjustments should involve the learners so they can not only participate in
     their own learning, but also participate in their progress to achieve that learning.

          What would our backward design look like using the example of the public speaking course?
          What changes or edits are needed?
          What pieces of evidence would we collect to show as evidence?
     Using Formative Assessment for Teacher Evaluations
     We'll collect a lot of small pieces of incremental evidence from our learners. We may have audio recordings of
     speeches, drafts of speeches with edits, and perhaps even a result from the CDE contest with a picture of that
     learner presenting in the contest. Our learners can help with this as well, providing drafts, reflective feedback,
     and organizing any of the evidence. All these together can tell a compelling story that can be used to evaluate
     our progress as a teacher.
     It's one thing to be able to report that we had a successful student at the contest, but if our class had more than
     one student, we should consider including their evidence since it likely showed improvement from day one to
     the end of the class. That collection of audio files, speech drafts, and self-reported feedback from the learners
     puts together a compelling set of evidence that can speak to our effectiveness as an educator and provide data
     for our evaluations (see figure 9.3).

            Figure 9.3: What counts as evidence for teacher evaluations. Figure description.
                                                                                    ASSESSING AGRICULTURAL EDUCATION | 165

Peer review/exchange, a type of assessment: Take this existing curriculum and work through it. Does it meet the
learning objectives set forth? Please provide at least two pieces of evidence in the curriculum that meet those
objectives and identify them. Exchange with your peer(s) and work through their work. What agreement did
you have? Where did you find different evidence to support the learning objectives? In what ways is curriculum
subjective? When we interpret, what should we be mindful of when working with learners? What should we be
mindful of when working with administrators and other stakeholders?

Reflective Questions

In Summation and Reflection
We can only handle so much during our first year of teaching. Instead of trying to "do it all," decide on one or two
places to begin evaluating and amending the assessment plan. It will take practice and multiple iterations. We'll
learn as much, if not more, than our learners.
If we go back to our introduction of the teacher with piles of work but no way to assess, what might they do to
triage the situation? Since this could be us soon, know that it is common, it takes practice, and it's OK to ask for
help and guidance.
What do we want agricultural education to look like in the future? What steps might we need to undertake
related to assessment to get to that vision shared?

10. APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT
THROUGH FFA

Laura L. Greenhaw and Paula Faulkner

Setting the Stage

Sherry and Jose teach agriculture in a high school with a student population of approximately six hundred.
Nearly half of the students in the school are enrolled in at least one agricultural education course. Sherry
recently submitted a purchase order for program affiliation FFA membership so all students enrolled in an
agricultural education course will be members of the FFA. Although their FFA chapter has utilized program
affiliation membership previously, the new principal questions the purchase order, stating that students in
other clubs must pay their own dues to participate in extracurricular activities. Sherry and Jose schedule
a meeting with their new administrator to explain how FFA is an intracurricular component of the holistic
agricultural education program. They prepare several examples that demonstrate FFA is fundamental for
teaching and learning in agricultural education.

170 | APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA

Introduction

FFA is a national organization that prepares members for premier leadership, personal growth, and career
success through school-based agricultural education. The official name is the National FFA Organization.
The letters "FFA" stand for Future Farmers of America, an important part of our history and heritage.

FFA develops youth with career and leadership development and helps them discover their talent through
hands-on, minds-on experiences, giving them the tools for future success.

Former FFA members are teachers, scientists, veterinarians, government leaders, entrepreneurs, financial
professionals, international business leaders, and professionals in many fields (National FFA Organization,
2021).

Overview

In 1988, the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Agricultural Education in Secondary Schools
published Understanding Agriculture: New Directions for Education. Authors described secondary vocational
agriculture programs as consisting of three parts, including "classroom and laboratory instruction,
supervised occupational experiences (SOEs), and membership in the National FFA" (p. 2). More than three
decades later, we continue to reference these three components, albeit with slightly modified language.
Today, school-based agricultural education (SBAE) is grounded in a three-circle model that includes the
classroom and laboratory, Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE), and FFA (figure 10.1). FFA, the student
organization, is a unique component of the three-circle model designed to teach and develop learners'
"premier leadership, personal growth, and career success" (The National FFA Organization, 2021). Through
a variety of events, competitions, awards programs, conferences, degrees, and other methods, the FFA
infuses value in all learners' education. When combined with classroom and laboratory instruction and SAE
projects, FFA connects, reinforces, and extends learning through simultaneous practice of leadership and
technical agricultural knowledge, skills, and abilities.

In this chapter, we will discuss how FFA is an intracurricular component of a comprehensive SBAE program,
describe the structure and components of FFA, identify competencies taught through FFA, illustrate
diversity and inclusion efforts and opportunities in FFA, and demonstrate how to utilize FFA as an effective
teaching strategy.

FFA Is Intracurricular

Intracurricular means "within the curriculum." Unlike many other school organizations students can engage
in outside of class, FFA is not an extra component of the educational experience. Rather, it is an equal
contributor to the whole agricultural education program, integrated with classroom and laboratory
instruction and supervised agricultural experience (SAE). Why is FFA different from extracurricular
programs? One important difference is that the federal government recognizes the National FFA
Organization as a crucial component of SBAE.
172 | APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA

The National FFA Organization received a federal charter in 1950 when the US Congress passed Public Law
81-740 (FFA, 2019a). The law established FFA as a vital and inseparable component of SBAE. The charter
was revised in 1998 and again in 2019, being signed into law most recently by President Donald Trump.
Public Law 116-7, the "National FFA Organization's Federal Charter Amendments Act," reiterates that FFA is
an integral component of agricultural education. The National FFA Organization's federal charter clearly and
inextricably links the organization to the US Department of Education, solidifying its critical role as one of
the components in the three-circle model of agricultural education. The National FFA Board of Directors,
National FFA staff, and a team of annually elected student officers lead the National FFA Organization. It
is important to note that the National FFA Board of Directors, who serve as the governing body of the
organization, includes the US secretary of education or the secretary's designee who has experience in
agricultural education, the FFA, or career and technical education (FFA, 2019b). Additionally, the charter
provides federal authority for the US Department of Education and the US Department of Agriculture to
work cooperatively in ensuring the sustainability of our nation's agriculture industry. In the most recently
passed iteration of the charter, the first purpose of the FFA is "to be an integral component of instruction in
agricultural education, including instruction relating to agriculture, food, and natural resources" (FFA Federal
Charter, 2019, p. 1). The charter makes it clear that FFA is fundamental to teaching and learning in agricultural
education programs and that all learners enrolled in agricultural education courses should have access to
and be engaged through FFA learning experiences and opportunities.

School-based agricultural education should directly support and advance the agriculture, food, and natural
resources industry (FFA Federal Charter, 2019). This requires each teaching component (classroom/
laboratory, SAE, and FFA) to be informed by local, state, regional, and national industry needs. Let's consider
an example.

       Keisha teaches in a small public school in a rural area in the Southwest in the United States. Much of the
       local agriculture industry is traditional beef cattle production. The region also supports a significant amount
       of hunting, including several big game outfitters. Appropriately, Keisha has worked with her administration
       and school board to offer classes including science of large agriculture animals, agricultural economics and
       business management, environmental science and natural resources, science of food products and food
       processing, and science of wildlife and forestry management. She collaborates with local stakeholders to
       develop and support SAE opportunities for her students, such as ownership SAEs in beef and alfalfa
       production, placement SAEs at meat processing and taxidermy businesses, and research SAEs on controlled
       burns and wildlife management strategies.
                                                                       APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA | 173

       Finally, Keisha incorporates FFA competitions and events into her curriculum. Students compete in several
       career and leadership development events, apply for proficiency awards, attend conferences and
       conventions, and develop an annual program of activities that reflects the culture of the area and the
       developmental interests of the students. How do we know that Keisha is using FFA to teach her students?
       Each of the FFA activities compliments and supports the classroom/laboratory instruction and SAE
       opportunities. Keisha's students compete in livestock evaluation, meats evaluation and technology, farm
       and agribusiness management, environmental and natural resources, agricultural sales, and agricultural
       technology and mechanical systems Career Development Events. They apply for proficiency awards
       corresponding to their SAEs, and several students conduct and present agriscience fair projects developed
       from assessing and addressing local industry needs. Keisha works hard to ensure students experience a
       comprehensive education in her program, through a combination of classroom/laboratory instruction, SAE,
       and FFA.

FFA Is Experiential Learning

John Dewey believed that knowledge was constructed through real-life experiences in the social
environment. Teachers are responsible for facilitating learning experiences and organizing the content to
be learned within those real-life experiences. The social environment learning occurs in is paramount,
according to Dewey, and social interactions should be carefully planned to facilitate the development of
relationships, particularly those between adults and youth (Roberts, 2003). Dewey also believed that learners
should acquire knowledge through their own personal experiences rather than have it dictated to them from
outside sources such as textbooks or experts. Knowledge gained from past experiences, then, is used to
teach about the present. Equally important is the organization of content for the learner. Subjects should
not be isolated but integrated so that the learner makes connections between the content and real life
where knowledge and skills are used simultaneously. For example, in real life, interpersonal skills are used
simultaneously with technical skills by Extension agents working with farmers and ranchers to improve their
crop yield.

Like Dewey, Kolb (1984) defines learning as "the process whereby knowledge is created through the
transformation of experience" (p. 41). According to Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory, learners progress
through a four-part cycle to transform experience into knowledge. First, learners encounter new experiences
or reinterpret past experiences. Then, they reflect on their experience, particularly how it may differ from
their previous understanding. Abstract conceptualization follows, resulting in a new or modified idea or
understanding. Finally, a learner actively experiments with their new idea or concept. (See figure 10.2.)
174 | APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA

             Figure 10.2: Kolb's experiential learning model diagram. Figure description.

Experiential learning has been a foundational tenant of agricultural education since its inception (Baker et
al., 2012). FFA provides a wide variety of experiential learning opportunities to engage learners at varying
levels of readiness. The teacher should select experiences that situate learning in the context of local, state,
regional, and national agriculture, food, and natural resources systems so learners can draw from their own
experiences to build and expand knowledge and skills.
Moreover, as a student organization, FFA provides the social environment Dewey believed was so critical to
learning. Although intracurricular, FFA activities often occur outside the classroom and can involve external
stakeholders, thus fostering positive adult-youth relationships. Finally, these experiences demand learners
use knowledge from multiple subjects at the same time, applying technical content coupled with leadership
and interpersonal knowledge and skills.
Although FFA provides a well-built vehicle for learning in agricultural education, the burden of keeping the
vehicle on the road to learning lies with the teacher. "Teachers must be present and mindful throughout the
experiential learning process to guide and direct the learning process" (Baker et al., 2012, p. 7). The teacher
is responsible for ensuring experiences are educative, because, as Dewey argued, not all experiences are
(Roberts, 2003). The agricultural educator shoulders two responsibilities in Dewey's experiential learning
model: knowing the subject matter and knowing the learner. Further, a teacher must skillfully guide the
learner through each phase of Kolb's model (Baker et al., 2012). Therefore, planning is essential to creating
worthwhile learning experiences. This requires the teacher to:
                                                                       APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA | 175

   Understand learners' current knowledge,
   Determine appropriate learning environments,
   Allow the correct amount of learner autonomy,
   Accurately estimate learner readiness such that educational experiences are not beyond the scope of

      learners' current ordinary life experiences,
   Organize learning experiences toward a specific end or outcome,
   Facilitate learners' full extraction of meaning from experiences so they can apply the knowledge to

      future situations, and
   Guide educational experiences in a way that fosters students' life-long learning capabilities (Roberts,

      2003).

In the following sections, we will explore specific FFA learning experiences teachers can use to plan and
guide learners through the experiential learning process. We begin with the structure of the FFA.

The FFA Organizational Structure

The National FFA Organization is structured on three levels (FFA, 2021). Learners can engage in activities and
experiences through their local FFA chapter, their state association, and at the national level. The National
FFA Organization staff work with a board of directors, six student national officers, national convention
delegates, and agricultural education stakeholders to serve and support over 760,000 student members. All
fifty states as well as Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands have state associations that charter local FFA
chapters. As of 2020, nearly nine thousand local FFA charters had been granted.

While all three levels function under the National FFA Organization's constitution and bylaws, state
associations are led by their annually elected student officers and advised by the state supervisor of
agricultural education. State associations have the autonomy to create unique learning opportunities that
best fit their state's needs, including competitions, awards, programs, and leadership structures within the
bounds of the National constitution and bylaws. Likewise, local FFA chapters are led by annually elected
chapter officers and are advised by the agriculture teacher. Each local chapter creates its own unique
program of activities (POA) to serve and support its learners' developmental needs. The three-tiered
organizational structure's flexibility supports local agricultural educators as they plan relevant educational
experiences for their unique learners (Dewey, 1938; Roberts, 2003). To learn more about the National FFA
Organization, its constitution and bylaws, and how local FFA chapters are chartered, please visit the National
FFA Organization website https://www.ffa.org.
176 | APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA

Competencies Taught through FFA

The National FFA Organization promotes premier leadership, personal growth, and career success. Learners
acquire and apply technical knowledge combined with leadership and interpersonal knowledge and skills
through FFA activities. Agricultural educators are responsible for organizing learning experiences relevant
to the local, regional, state, and national industry needs, which provides learners with technical content.
Technical content may be food science, urban agriculture, animal production, agricultural mechanics, or a
multitude of other topics relevant to food, agriculture, and natural resources. Leadership and interpersonal
competencies are integrated into the learning and practice.

Examples of leadership and interpersonal competencies include but are not limited to oral and written
communication, critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, personal responsibility, meeting facilitation,
conflict management, recording keeping, innovation, creativity, goal setting, collaboration, relationship
building, and others. Learners practice technical skills simultaneously with leadership and interpersonal
skills just as they occur in real life. For example, students applying for a proficiency award in agriscience
research not only demonstrate technical competence on their research topic, but they also demonstrate
recording keeping, communication, and other leadership and interpersonal skills.

Students competing in the forestry career development event (CDE) must call upon their technical
knowledge about forestry while simultaneously practicing teamwork, communication, time management,
and other leadership and interpersonal competencies. Local chapter officers and members apply proper
parliamentary procedure to conduct the work of their organization in meetings but also to practice
collaboration, meeting facilitation, relationship building, and other leadership and interpersonal skills as the
work is carried out in accordance with their program of activities.

FFA Learning Experiences

Membership and Degrees

The National FFA Organization provides a broad structure within which agriculture teachers can plan and
organize learning experiences. All FFA experiences begin with learners enrolling in an agricultural education
course and securing membership in the FFA organization. Most often, this requires the school to have a
chartered local FFA chapter. However, some state associations and local chapters may allow students to
join FFA chapters in neighboring school districts if their school does not have an FFA chapter. Although
FFA is considered an integral and inseparable component of the agricultural education program, annual
membership dues are still required. Membership dues are levied at the national level and may include
additional charges from the state association and local chapter.
                                                                      APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA | 177

Currently, there are two ways to become a member. In some chapters, dues are paid for each individual
student who wishes to join the organization. Students themselves may pay their dues or the chapter may
utilize fundraising or other means of financial assistance to pay dues for students who wish to become FFA
members. Other local chapters pay program affiliation fees that provide FFA membership for all learners
enrolled in one or more agricultural education courses, based on a progressive fee structure. This allows
all students enrolled in agricultural education courses to be FFA members, regardless of their ability or
willingness to pay an individual annual membership fee. All membership dues and program affiliation fees
are established by a majority vote of eligible voting delegates at each level of the organization: national
voting delegates at the National FFA Convention, state voting delegates at the state convention, and eligible
members at a regular local chapter meeting.

Membership provides the first and most basic teaching opportunity. FFA members are eligible to progress
through five degrees of membership based on individual achievement (FFA, 2021). Each degree of
membership advances from the previous as the learner achieves the minimum qualifications and applies
for each degree. In order, membership degrees are Discovery, Greenhand, Chapter, State, and American. It
should be noted that Discovery degrees are intended for state associations and local chapters that offer
membership to middle school students. Teachers can use degrees of membership to organize educational
content as learners acquire knowledge through experience. Since each degree builds upon achievements
from the previous degree, the learning is naturally situated within the learner's realm of understanding and
linked to each learner's unique previous experience (Dewey, 1938; Roberts, 2003). Moreover, learners pursue
each degree's qualifications in a context of their choosing, further ensuring that knowledge is built from their
personal experiences.

Let's consider another example.

       Sarah is enrolled in an agribusiness course at her high school. She is an active FFA member and, with her
       teacher's guidance, has developed an SAE. Last year, as a freshman, she earned the Greenhand degree by
       successfully meeting the National FFA constitution's requirements and submitting a written application to
       her local chapter. One of the requirements was to develop a satisfactory plan for an SAE. Sarah discussed her
       interests and experiences with her teacher and after conducting research with her teacher's guidance, she
       decided she was most interested in beekeeping. Her teacher introduced her to a local beekeeper, who offered
       Sarah an opportunity to work with him and learn more about his business.

       This year, Sarah plans to apply for her Chapter FFA degree. She enrolled in the agribusiness course to learn
       more about owning and operating her own business. In addition, she works with the local beekeeper a few
       hours a week, earning a little money and gaining a lot of experience. She attends the local farmer's market
       with the beekeeper, where she assists with teaching the public about honeybees.
178 | APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA

       She plans to use the money she earns to purchase her own hive and rent some space from the local
       beekeeper to keep her hive with his. With her teacher's help, she has laid out a four-year plan to advance
       through the degrees of FFA membership, eventually earning her American FFA degree.

Competitive Events and Awards

The National FFA Organization offers a robust program of awards and competitive events that can be
implemented at all three levels (local, state, and national). Competitions and awards are available for
individuals, teams, and chapters. Competitive events are generally separated into Career Development
Events (CDE) and Leadership Development Events (LDE).

As previously stated, the National FFA constitution and bylaws allow for some autonomy at the state and
local levels to develop and offer competitive events and awards that reflect both the industry's and learners'
unique needs. A current list of national competitive events and awards can be found on the National FFA
Organization website, www.ffa.org. Teachers should contact their state association for a current list of state
competitive events and awards. Some examples of unique events offered by state associations include the
Quartet contest in Alabama, citrus evaluation in Florida, tractor troubleshooting in Vermont, milk quality
evaluation in North Carolina, meat evaluation in Pennsylvania, and cotton judging in Texas.

Competitive events provide incentive and require students to combine technical knowledge and skill with
leadership and interpersonal knowledge and skill. Some competitions require a team, while others are for
individuals. Competitive events expand learners' social environment as FFA members may receive coaching
from community members who are industry experts and travel to various locations to compete and interact
with FFA members and advisers from other chapters. Furthermore, competitive events are directly related
to classroom and laboratory instruction, thus providing a natural extension of learning through educative
experiences in a social environment different from the traditional classroom.

A good example might be as follows:

       A group of students who are enrolled in a food science course compete in the food science and technology
       CDE. Students learn technical content from their agriscience teacher in their course, meet once a week with a
       community member who is familiar with the event and works as a food safety specialist at the local chicken
       processing plant, and then travel to FFA competitions around the state where they compete against and
       interact with students from other FFA chapters.
                                                                      APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA | 179

Awards also incentivize learners to set and achieve developmental goals. In addition, they provide structure
for teachers to organize learners' educational experiences. Like degrees of membership, awards are often
earned by accomplishing a complementary set of tasks that draw on technical knowledge and skills as
well as on leadership and interpersonal knowledge and skills. This is true for individual, team, and chapter
awards. Some examples of awards include National Chapter Awards (awarded at the state and national
levels), Agricultural Proficiency Awards (awarded at the local, state, and national levels), and Star Awards
(awarded at the local, state, and national levels). Competitive events and awards can be unique and
nontraditional educative experiences, but the teacher must plan diligently to achieve the desired student
learning outcomes.

Conduct of chapter meetings is a common CDE offered by state associations and the national organization.
The contest requires a team of students to conduct a meeting completing a specific list of tasks, according
to prescribed parliamentary procedure. Conducting a meeting using parliamentary procedure is a valuable
skill that requires a combination of technical knowledge and interpersonal skills to successfully accomplish
the group's business. A teacher can utilize the conduct of chapter meetings contest to teach students
correct parliamentary procedure through application and practice (experience). Learners apply their
knowledge not only in the contest but also as FFA members directing the business of their local chapter and
ultimately in adulthood as they engage in professional or civic organizations.

Events and Conferences

Events and conferences offer unique educational experiences. The National FFA Organization hosts
numerous events and conferences. Some conferences are hosted by state associations with support from
the National Organization. The National FFA Organization website and your state associations keep a current
list of events and conferences offered. Examples include the National FFA Convention, Washington
Leadership Conference (WLC), state or regional greenhand leadership camps, and many others.

Conferences offer another social environment in which teachers can organize student learning. FFA
conferences are frequently focused on leadership and interpersonal skill development, though some may
also focus on specific technical content. Learners return from conference experiences prepared with
knowledge and skills to operate their local chapter. In this way, learners' knowledge and skills continue to
build through personal and relevant experiences. For example, if a local chapter officer engaged in team-
building workshops at a conference, they can apply that knowledge and skill to facilitate team-building
activities that build cohesion and camaraderie among their chapter members. Alternatively, local FFA
members may attend a conference where they learn about civil discourse and building consensus in group
decision-making. They apply that knowledge to productively contribute to the development of their chapter's
program of activities (POA). FFA conferences may last a few hours or several days. Each conference has
specific learning outcomes for participants and incorporates a variety of activities and experiences to help
learners achieve those outcomes. With careful planning, teachers can organize educational experiences that
extend all learners' growth and development beyond the conference or event.
180 | APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA

Diversity and Inclusion Efforts and Opportunities in FFA

FFA is intracurricular, which means it should be as accessible as its complementary components of the
three-circle model (Classroom and Laboratory, Supervised Agricultural Experience, FFA). The teacher is
responsible for ensuring efforts are made toward diversity and inclusion. FFA programs and activities can
include all learners. The National FFA Organization continues to pursue diversity, inclusion, and equity
throughout the organization as demonstrated through the National FFA Value Statements ratified by the
delegates at the 2021 National FFA Convention.

Ratified FFA Value Statements

   We respect and embrace every individual's culture and experiences.
   We welcome every individual's contribution to advance our communities and the industry of agriculture.
   We cultivate an environment that allows every individual to recognize and explore their differences.
   We create leadership opportunities for every individual to enhance their personal and professional

      endeavors.

Additional efforts and ideas to increase accessibility are outlined in this section.

Affiliate program fees, paid by the chapter instead of by individuals, can reduce socioeconomic barriers to
participation in FFA learning activities. Students' freedom to select from official dress options can reduce
potential gender and cultural barriers. The National FFA Organization provides CDE and LDE resources
in Spanish and offers a Spanish version of the Creed Speaking contest. Local chapters and agricultural
classrooms should welcome and provide opportunities for all learners and strive to represent the
demographics of the local school system and community.

FFA's history of supporting diversity and inclusion has evolved over the years from membership to leaders to
policies and practices. The first female members were admitted in 1969. The first African American national
leader was elected in 1994, and the first Latino national leader elected in 2002. In 2017, the first African
American female national president was elected. The 2019 National Convention featured the first opening
ceremonies ever conducted in Spanish. The National FFA Organization provides educator resources for
teachers who wish to incorporate lessons on diversity and inclusion as well. You can find those resources on
the National FFA Organization's website, www.ffa.org.

Teaching with FFA Educational Experiences

Teachers must intentionally plan and organize educational experiences. In SBAE, this includes FFA
experiences. As illustrated by the three-circle model, classroom and laboratory instruction, SAE, and FFA are
integrated and overlapping. Educational experiences can and should be organized to incorporate all three.
Some examples of how teachers can integrate FFA into their teaching are presented below.
                                                               APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA | 181

Mr. Brown is a SBAE teacher. He begins an instructional unit by requiring students to attend their local school
board meeting to observe parliamentary procedure. Students then learn about proper meeting conduct
through a series of lessons in class. Students compete in the conduct of chapter meeting CDE, gaining
additional practice. Finally, students apply appropriate parliamentary procedure as they engage in the work
of their local FFA chapter. Mr. Brown's approach illustrates one way teachers can use FFA to extend and
deepen students' learning.

Josh has been enrolled in agricultural education courses since he was in middle school, where he earned
the Discovery degree. One requirement of the Discovery degree was researching agricultural careers. Josh
took a particular interest in landscape and horticulture careers. In high school, Josh enrolled in the plant
science course, where he continued to learn more about horticulture. Josh earned his Greenhand degree and
developed a plan for an SAE that continued to expand his interest in plants, horticulture, and landscape. He
earned a spot on his chapter's plant identification CDE team and has started practicing for the floral CDE.
Josh has a placement SAE delivering floral arrangements for the local flower shop. He enjoys interacting with
customers in the shop and teaching them about the different plants and flowers. Josh's teacher has also
asked him to comanage the school greenhouse and he serves on the annual plant sale committee for his local
FFA chapter. Josh's SBAE experience exemplifies fully integrated classroom and laboratory instruction, SAE,
and FFA.

The adviser of the Newberry FFA Chapter utilizes the POA to plan, organize and facilitate student learning
experiences through FFA. Each year, the chapter officers lead members in developing a POA. The POA
defines chapter goals and outlines plans to meet those goals. It is organized into three divisions: Growing
Leaders, Building Communities, and Strengthening Agriculture. Each division contains five quality standards
which allow for student committees to plan, prepare, and deliver activities in each area. Newberry FFA's
POA is informed by community and local industry needs, considers the planned classroom and laboratory
instruction, and addresses students' interests and needs. Students learn and practice a multitude of skills
while developing the POA and while completing the planned activities throughout the year. Newberry
FFA's approach to developing and carrying out a program of activities demonstrates how FFA, as a crucial
component of the three-circle model, provides experiential education in SBAE programs. (For more
information on Program of Activities, please see the resource guide on the National FFA website,
www.ffa.org.)

Summary

 1. Explain FFA as an intracurricular component of the complete agricultural education model.
 2. Describe the structure and components of FFA.
 3. Identify competencies taught through FFA activities.
 4. Illustrate efforts and opportunities for diversity and inclusion in FFA.
 5. Utilize FFA programs and activities as experiential learning opportunities for learners.

This chapter has described how FFA is an intracurricular component of a complete school-based agricultural
education program thanks to its federal charter. FFA provides a three-tier structure and a multitude of
activities and opportunities that support agriculture educators as they organize educative experiences for
learners. These experiences allow learners to build upon their current knowledge and experience in a variety
of social contexts, foster valuable adult-youth relationships, and challenge learners to integrate technical
knowledge and skills with leadership and interpersonal knowledge and skills. Teachers must be intentional in
selecting and organizing experiences that compliment and extend learning from the other two components
of the three-circle model, classroom and laboratory instruction and SAE. In addition, teachers must continue
to champion diversity and inclusion efforts, making SBAE accessible to all learners. Ultimately, when FFA
is fully integrated with classroom/laboratory instruction and SAE, students received a robust and complete
agricultural education that simultaneously supports the food, agriculture, and natural resources industry.

     Learning Confirmation

         1. Draw the three-circle model of agricultural education. Identify learning activities that exist in the center
             of the diagram where all three circles overlap as well as activities that exist where two of the three
             components overlap.

        2. Outline an example program of activities. Explain how the FFA activities included support, extend, and
             enhance learning in the classroom and laboratory.

        3. Identify a Career Development Event of your choice. List personal development and leadership
             competencies learners will practice simultaneously with the required technical content knowledge.
                      APPLIED LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT THROUGH FFA | 183

Applying the Content

1. Identify three Career Development Events that can be used in a local context to prepare FFA members for
    future careers in their community.

2. Identify three Leadership Development Events that can be used in a local context to teach leadership skills
    that FFA members can use in their community.

3. Prepare an introductory lesson to teach about FFA opportunities to new agricultural education students.

Reflective Questions

   1. What challenges or barriers might teachers have to overcome to fully integrate FFA in their teaching?
   2. How can agriculture teachers involve stakeholders, especially those in the community, to strengthen the

        connection between the classroom and laboratory, SAE, and FFA learning?
   3. FFA offers a broad range of activities for teachers to incorporate. How can teachers identify the most

        effective and appropriate learning experiences for learners?

11. SUPERVISED AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES

Eric Rubenstein

Setting the Stage

As we look to examine the final ring of the three-circle model in school-based agricultural education (SBAE),
take a few moments to read this teacher's story about engaging students in Supervised Agricultural
Experience (SAE) programs:

         Every year it seems to get harder and harder. My students seem to be further removed from the ag
         industry and have little knowledge about how their food is produced. When I start my lessons on SAE at
         the beginning of each course, I continually worry about how I am going to find a meaningful program for
         each of my students. This past summer I had an opportunity to sit down and have an open and honest
         conversation with several other ag teachers and a teacher educator about my struggles with SAE in my
         classroom. Over the next hour, I learned that I was not alone but that each of us had different things
         that worked to engage some students. As I prepare to introduce SAE to a new group of students in a few
         weeks, I am excited for the first time to try something new.

Take some time to reflect on the story shared by this twenty-two-year veteran agriculture teacher and how
she has continued to push herself to learn and try new ideas regardless of the struggles she has had in the
past. While SAE can seem overwhelming, being an agriculture teacher is about providing experiences for
students to grow and develop. If we never lose sight of this goal, there are no challenges that we cannot
overcome in the classroom. Take a few moments before you continue to write down a few ways that you
plan to overcome challenges and work to keep a positive outlook on your tenure in the agricultural education
profession.

     Objectives

     The purpose of this chapter is to introduce our readers to Supervised Agricultural Experience (SAE) programs.
     More specifically, the objectives are to:

          Discuss the purpose of SAE in SBAE.
          Discuss the struggles and concerns that exist within SAE development and implementation.
          Develop SAE programs for all students in SBAE.
          Discuss a model for SAE program development and implementation.
          Implement all components of SAE.

Introduction

As we begin to explore one of the experiential learning opportunities that students engage in while enrolled
in a school-based agricultural education program, we must begin to investigate why students might benefit
from these programs and how we as teachers can facilitate a learning environment where students feel
safe to talk about the failures they experience. As teachers and members of society, we know that some
of our most impactful learning experiences came from failures or struggles that we faced. One of the best
ways we can authentically engage students in their own learning is through a project that is tailored to
their personal interests and desires. Supervised Agricultural Experience programs provide students with
authentic learning experiences that connect with personal interest areas with the vast agriculture, food, and
natural resources system. Through this chapter, we will explore the history, benefits, struggles, and learning
applications of Supervised Agricultural Experience programs within school-based agricultural education.

Overview of the Supervised Agricultural Experience Programs

What is SAE?

Agricultural educators across the United States utilize the principles of Supervised Agricultural Experience
(SAE) programs to enhance the education quality and rigor of their programs. SAE is one of the core
components of the three-circle agricultural education model that is used as the backbone of school-based
agricultural education (SBAE). SAE is defined as "a planned and supervised program of experience-based
learning activities that extend school-based instruction and enhance knowledge, skills, and awareness in
agriculture and natural resources" (Barrick & Estepp, 2011). However, SAE participation has been continually
decreasing over the past 50 years. To better understand the causes for this decrease, we must begin with
how this teaching method came to be and the changes that have occurred over the past 110 years.

In 1908, Rufus Stimson was hired to serve as the director of Smith's Agricultural School in Massachusetts,
where he was responsible for the educational program and operation of the school's farm (Stimson, 1915).
During his time engaging with students, Stimson realized that there was a disconnect between the content
being taught at the school and on the school farm and the student being able to transfer this knowledge to
real-world issues taking place on their home farms. This phenomenon led Mr. Stimson to develop what he
titled the project method, in which students engage in supervised programs of educational quality on their
home farms to apply the content being taught in their classroom in real-world conditions. Over the years,
the name of the program has been changed and renamed to meet the needs of the agricultural education
profession, with the most recent name being Supervised Agricultural Experience. Due to the innovative
nature of this teaching method, Stimson's approach was incorporated in the passage of the Smith Hughes
Act of 1917, requiring all students enrolled in agricultural education to conduct an SAE program as part of
their instruction. Students were required to have a "directed or supervised practice of agriculture either on a
farm provided for by the school or other farm, for at least six months per year" (US House of Representatives,
1917). The federal legislation required teachers to provide supervision of these projects and submit annual
reports, while on a twelve-month employment contact (US House of Representatives, 1917).

Since then, several other pieces of federal legislation have been passed and adopted, starting with the
Vocational Education Act of 1963. This federal legislation removed the mandate for students to engage in an
SAE and changed the wording that SAE may be provided to all students as a part of their SBAE instruction.
Finally, in 1968 an amendment was passed to the Vocational Education Act that stripped all language related
to SAE from federal legislation. Since this time, the removal of the federal requirement has decreased the
utilization of SAE within SBAE programs across the United States. Until recently, many states did not have
legislation related to agricultural education.
192 | SUPERVISED AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES

However, some states have begun passing legislation requiring students to be engaged in all three circles
of the agricultural education three-circle model. For example, in April 2018, Georgia governor Nathan Deal
signed into law the Green Agricultural Education Act, also known as Senate Bill 330. This act required that
all students enrolled in an agricultural education course must be a member of the National FFA Organization
and have an active SAE program as integral components of the course.

In addition to federal and state legislation, The National Council for Agricultural Education began an initiative
in 2010 to rejuvenate SAE. The rejuvenation project was originally led by Dr. Kirby Barrick and examined the
current status of SAE and suggestions for improvement to help SAE move into the twenty-first century. At
the end of the initial work, lead to the development of sixteen tenants to SAE instruction and implementation
(Barrick & Estepp, 2011). In 2018, this work led to the development of a new instructional strategy for SAE,
SAE for All. Since 2018, this instructional technique has been slowly implemented across the United States.

SAE Development and Implementation

To help facilitate the growth of SAE in agricultural education, research has been conducted to examine
the factors needed to develop and implement high-quality SAE programs for students regardless of their
community demographics. Therefore, the following model was developed to help illustrate the necessary
factors needed to ensure that SAE program development and implementation is successful. Five major
factors emerged as essential components of the development and implementation process: (1) student-
centered SAE programs, (2) committed teachers, (3) supporting surrounding "community," (4) shared
experiences, and (5) joint supervision (figure 11.1).
                                                                                    SUPERVISED AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES | 193

Student-Centered SAE Programs

When developing student SAE programs, teachers must always work with students to develop their areas of
interest and career paths rather than focusing on the resources the student has access to at home or school.
Once you have identified the student's interest or career path, develop an idea for an SAE program that
meets their goals and interests. Research has shown that this will increase a student's engagement in SAE
(Rubenstein, 2014). Student interest can be related to something that they are already engaged in at home
or school, or it can be related to a new idea that needs to be fully developed from the ground up. Regardless
of the student's previous experience in agriculture, teachers have an opportunity to increase a student's
interest and literacy in the agriculture industry by developing a student's SAE program on their interest rather
than on their resources. Once the program is developed, a teacher should work with the individual students
to help them secure resources available at school or through connections with community members around
the community. Community involvement in the agriculture program and FFA chapter will increase by
developing the SAE program in conjunction with the student, their parents, community members, and the
teacher. This team approach to SAE development will lead to greater successes and additional resources
being secured for all students in the program.

Within the classroom, teachers must be focused on student learning and ensuring that instructional time is
addressing state instructional standards. SAE should be no different, students should actively be engaged in
an SAE program that promotes learning for that student. Therefore, we must realize that all SAE programs
must be developed to meet the specific needs of an individual student, not multiple students. By developing
an SAE program specifically for one student, we can also use a variety of external influences to help build
student engagement. One external influence that can increase student engagement in SAE is the use of the
FFA degree and awards structure. While all SAE programs will not and should not fit a proficiency award
area, their potential learning and engagement in SAE can help them grow within the FFA degree structure.
By keeping a student's SAE program focused on the student, teachers can greatly influence a student's
engagement and success within their chosen SAE program.

Committed Teachers

For SAE to be successful in any program, the agriculture teacher must be committed to using SAE within
their classrooms. This begins by requiring all students to be engaged and ensuring that their SAE program
is graded as part of their final grade in the course. While there is not an exact percentage that an SAE
program should account for in the overall course grade, it has been found to be important that there are
graded components and that participation is tracked by the teacher. Furthermore, a teacher's instruction in
SAE must begin within the first two weeks of the course to ensure that students begin the development and
implementation process as early in the course as possible.
                                                                                    SUPERVISED AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES | 195

During this instruction, teachers should ensure that students have adequate time to complete the graded
portions and needed hours of engagement before the end of the course. During the development phase,
teachers should encourage students to talk to their parents, community members, local employers, and
extended family members to help in the generation of an SAE program topic. When developing an SAE
topic and program, teachers should utilize a team approach to ensure that the student has a large support
network. Many teachers have shared that having periodic check-ins throughout the course helps students
remain accountable for their engagement in SAE. During each of these check-ins, teachers need to remain
actively involved in the students SAE programs by giving feedback to their SAE assignments, journal entries,
and student involvement in their respective SAE programs. By remaining actively engaged in the students
SAE program, teachers can provide the needed support to community members, parents, employers, and
the students who are involved in the SAE development and implementation team.

Supportive Surrounding "Community"

As discussed in the last section, a supportive team or "community" is essential to the development of an
exemplary SAE program. This team consists of the agriculture teacher(s), student, parents, community
members, employer, and any other individuals who have had a significant role in assisting the student with
the SAE program. One of the most important individuals in this process is the parent. Many parents want
to be actively involved in the student's education experience; however, this sometimes is very difficult due
to a lack of information provided to parents from teachers. Therefore, agriculture teachers must find a
way to provide valuable SAE information to parents, so they are aware of the requirements of a student's
SAE program. To facilitate active parental involvement, teachers should host an SAE night or send home a
packet of information that describes the SAE program and gives ways for parents to support the program
from home. This information packet or presentation should include the basics but not be overwhelming to
the parent. Furthermore, community members should be actively engaged in the SAE program. Through
personal connections with various community members, teachers can have informal conversations with
many of these individuals to ensure that they are aware of the requirements and fully understand their role
in the program. Be sure to set clear expectations with community members so they do not overtake the SAE
program. As a team, the student and their support system should develop a set of program goals that they
will utilize to move the program forward each year. These goals should be achievable by the student and
appropriate for the given SAE program.
196 | SUPERVISED AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES

Shared Expectations

In some situations, students may have had a sibling or parent that was actively involved in agricultural
education and may have a preestablished SAE program that will meet the class and program expectations.
Students who have this type of opportunity can typically build on what was completed prior to their
enrollment in the SBAE program and continually improve the SAE program over time. In the best-case
scenario, siblings can work together in their SAE program to share ideas and make joint decisions that
will benefit their SAE program and learning. Beyond the students, teachers must work to ensure that the
school administration has a firm understanding of what SAE is, which helps to ensure their support of this
fundamental portion of SBAE. To do this, teachers should demonstrate how students learn, make essential
decisions, apply classroom knowledge, and continually build an exemplary SAE program that enhances
their engagement in the agriculture curriculum. For example: students can give a presentation to school
administration about the SAE programs, administrators can come to the agriculture classroom during SAE
workdays to learn more about student programs, or even have administrators accompany the agriculture
teacher on supervisory visits to students SAE programs. These activities have been found to increase
administrators support of SAE programs within their schools.

Finally, a teacher must develop a "culture" for SAE within the SBAE program. A culture for SAE is not
developed overnight and will be difficult to build from the ground up. Teachers must establish a firm
expectation that all students will engage in an SAE and that there are no exceptions. Agriculture teachers
who have established a "culture" for SAE have found that student engagement in SAE has increased
significantly and that students know before they enroll in an SBAE course that they will be required to
complete an SAE program as a portion of the agriculture course. Teachers have reported that this can take
up to five years to establish (Rubenstein, 2014); however, once this has been successfully implemented,
student engagement in SAE was established much quicker in the agriculture course. SAE culture is possibly
the most important factor that influences the development and implementation of exemplary SAE programs
and the completion of these programs by all students enrolled in the agriculture course.

Joint Supervision

There are two forms of supervision in SAE programs: on-site supervision and in-class supervision. Both
forms of supervision are accepted and needed to ensure that all students engage in an SAE program. Over
the past fifty years, an agriculture teachers' time has become stretched thinner and thinner so that they
can accomplish more tasks than ever before, but in the same amount of time. Therefore, it is not expected
that the same supervisory expectations for a teacher who taught fifty total students can be expected for
a teacher who can now teach up to two hundred. Supervisory roles have changed, and need to continue to
change and evolve, to meet the needs of both the student and the teacher. Therefore, it is recommended
that all students receive in-class supervision through SAE workdays. These workdays should be completed at
least every other week for approximately fifteen minutes to ensure that students are updating their records
and that they have time to share concerns or issues about their SAE programs with their peers or teacher.
                                                                                    SUPERVISED AGRICULTURAL EXPERIENCES | 197
During this time, the teacher should try to talk with students about their SAE program and to help answer
any questions or concerns they may have to ensure their continued success. For situations where a simple
answer will not suffice or the teacher does not have enough information to answer the question, an on-
site supervisory visit is needed. An on-site supervisory visit should be scheduled with the student and
their parents and/or employer prior to the teacher's arrival. During the visit, the teacher should observe
the student engaging in their SAE and then have adequate time to ask questions and provide the needed
advice. This should also include time for the teacher to explain more about an SAE program with parents or
employers to ensure they are adequately prepared to support the student in this vital learning environment.

Developing Student SAE Programs

When developing an SAE program, students must develop a program that fits their interests. While
resources to conduct the SAE program are important, a student's interest in the program content is vital
for the longevity of the program. As a part of the development process, parents and teachers must play an
active role to help students create a program that is applicable and manageable. Students can have high
or low aspirations when it comes to an SAE program; therefore, it is vital that the decision is not made
solely by the student without any counsel from other adults. To assist students in the development process,
Rubenstein and Thoron (2013) developed the SAE Dichotomous Key to help students think more about their
personal interests in agricultural content areas, rather than their available resources. Rubenstein et al.
(2022) redeveloped the instrument to meet the growing needs of the SAE for All program categories (see
figures 11.2a-g).

Figure 11.2g: The SAE Dichotomous Key (part 7). Figure description.
Teachers should have students complete the dichotomous key independently. Unlike a traditional
dichotomous key, there are multiple correct answers for a student on the SAE Dichotomous Key. Students
should move through each possible question to determine whether they have a possible interest in each of
the potential SAE programmatic categories. Once a student has selected all the programmatic categories of
interest, students should begin to look at examples of different SAE programs that fit with in that SAE area.
This activity can help many students develop a personalized SAE program that meets both their interests
and available resources.

Fundamental SAE Components

SAE programs have withstood the test of time since it is the one area where agricultural education
differentiates itself from other content areas with Career and Technical Education and core subject areas.
When developing student SAE programs, teachers must ensure that the following fundamental components
have been incorporated into every student's SAE program:

 1. Ag Related: This might be one of the most controversial topics when it comes to SAE program
      development. The definition of ag related SAE programs varies from person to person. However, SAE
      programs must have students engaged in developing or enhancing a skill through direct interaction with
      a facet of the agricultural industry. For example, babysitting a farmer's children is NOT an SAE program
      whereas working in the local grocery store would be an SAE program.

 2. Interest Related: As discussed earlier in the chapter, all SAE programs must be based on the student's
      interest in the topic to ensure the student's continual engagement in the SAE program. Even if the
      student isn't planning to pursue an agricultural career, students will have interests in different sectors
      of the agricultural industry. Teachers should work to assist students in finding their personal interests
      in agriculture.

 3. Necessary Resources: To properly conduct an SAE program, various resources will need to be secured
      by the student. Teachers should work diligently to develop a network of supports to help facilitate
      students' ability to acquire the necessary resources to successfully engage in their SAE program. While
      it is not the sole responsibility of the parent or teacher to identify and locate each of the necessary
      resources, each program partner should work together to help as needed in the process.

 4. Financial Management: Most SAE programs will involve a monetary component to purchase needed
      resources or financial gains. As a part of the SAE program, the student must be able to keep records
      of all financial management decisions. Teachers should help students identify the best financial
      management system for a student's program.

 5. SAE Decisions: Most important of all, students must keep records on the decisions they make during
      their SAE programs. These decisions include purchasing new equipment for an enterprise, selling an
      animal, hiring a new employee, firing an employee, adding more homes to a lawn care business, and so
      forth. This must be recorded in a place that can be easily accessible to the student.

SAE Program Categories

Based on what a student is doing in their SAE program, they will need to select an SAE program category
for their SAE program. Each program area will have different record keeping needs. For example: financial
records will need to be kept for an entrepreneurship, placement, research, and school-based enterprise
program, but financial records would not be necessary in a service-learning SAE program. Based on the
student's program, teachers must help the student identify the correct category to ensure that they have
all the necessary records for their SAE program, particularly if the student decides to apply for a degree or
proficiency award within the National FFA Organization. Depending on the state in which you reside, different
SAE program categories may be accepted by your State FFA staff. Below each of the SAE program categories
in SAE for All will be described.

 Entrepreneurship: Students who conduct an entrepreneurship SAE own and operate their own
   business enterprise (this also includes show animals). Students will be responsible for acquiring the
   appropriate resources to operate their business and should provide the teacher with a business plan.
   The business plan should include the goods or services the student will provide to customers, a
   projected budget, and a marketing plan to solicit business. Teachers and parents will provide most of
   the supervision in this program.

 Placement: Students who conduct a placement SAE are engaged in some form of employment (paid or
   unpaid). During a placement SAE program, students will be given a list of job responsibilities, from the
   employer, that they must complete. These tasks should be agreed upon by the student and the employer,
   normally the teacher will only receive a list of the responsibilities from the student. Teachers and the
   employer should provide supervision, while the employer would provide all performance evaluations.

 Research: Students who conduct a research SAE program will utilize the scientific process to
   investigate phenomena within the agricultural industry. Students will typically work closely with their
   agriculture teacher, a college professor, or a specialist within their research area. Most times, students
   will need to secure lab space at the school to conduct their experiments and record their scientific data.
   During this SAE, the teacher and/or supervisor will provide much of the supervision.

 School-Based Enterprise: Students who conduct a school-based enterprise SAE program will engage
   in operating a business from the school. In many cases, school-based enterprises will require multiple
   students to work together on this SAE. Teachers should select one student to have a supervisory role,
   the supervisor should have experience working in this SAE and work closely with the agriculture teacher
   to make decisions regarding the enterprise. During this SAE the teacher will provide the supervision.

 Service Learning: Students who conduct a service-learning SAE program will work as an individual or
   with other students to conduct service projects the benefit local organizations or community. Teachers
   should be able to share names of possible organizations that may have service project needs within the
   local community. Teachers will provide much of the supervision for this SAE category.

SAE Supervision

The supervision of SAE programs historically fell solely on the agriculture teacher, which was mandated
through the Smith Hughes Act of 1917. However, since the passage of the Vocational Education Act of 1963
and the subsequent amendment in 1968, supervision responsibilities have fallen on individuals other than
the agricultural education teacher. These individuals include, but are not limited to, parents, community
members, extension agents, employers, and even extended family members. Due to this shift in supervision
responsibilities, it is important for the agriculture teacher to provide detailed instructions on the role of a
supervisor in a student's SAE program. This information can be shared with supervisors through a written
document or an in-person or online training session. Each agriculture teacher should determine the best
approach for their individual communities.

Supervision of SAE can be conducted through two means: in person or in class. In-person supervision can
be conducted by any program partner working with the student on their SAE program. During an in-person
SAE visit, the supervisor should do the following things to help ensure the SAE is operating smoothly: watch
the student engage in their SAE program, take pictures of the student engaged in their SAE, meet with the
student and parent to answer questions, provide details to the parent about the SAE program requirements,
and provide advice to the student regarding the progress of their SAE. When planning for an in-person
supervisory visit, the teacher or program partner should always schedule a time with the student and their
parents, a supervisory visit should never be a surprise. Most supervisory visits last forty-five minutes to an
hour to ensure that the supervisor has adequate time to work with the student and their parents on their
SAE program. Finally, any advice that is given to the student should always be based on science and previous
experience. Teachers and program partners that do not have experience in the specific content area of the
SAE should refrain from providing advice that will adversely affect the outcome of the SAE program, as this
may lead to issues between the student or parent and the agricultural education program.

The second form of SAE supervision is in-class supervision. As noted earlier in the chapter, in-class
supervision should be conducted during SAE work times that are provided to students on a biweekly basis.
During these supervisory visits, students should be permitted to engage in conversation with other students
who have similar SAE programs. During these conversations, the agriculture teacher should be readily
available to answer questions and provide advice regarding specific issues that are occurring in a student's
SAE program. From these supervisory visits, agriculture teachers can make informed decisions regarding
which students require on-site supervisory visits. Use this time with students wisely to have them update
records, prepare FFA applications, and engage in meaningful conversation regarding the progress or issues
occurring within their chosen SAE programs.

Grading SAE Programs

All SAE programs should have a graded component to them, as they are an essential part of the three-circle
model of school-based agricultural education. While there is not prescribed way as to how often an SAE
program should be evaluated or what requirements should be examined, the agriculture teachers should
create a plan and rubric that sets clear expectations for students within the SBAE program. This plan and
rubric should be shared with students at the beginning of school and SAE programs should be evaluated
more than one time through the course. The weight of this grade varies by teacher and should be agreed
upon all teachers in an SBAE program. If teaching in a multiteacher program, all agriculture teachers in the
SBAE program should meet each year to determine how SAE programs are going to be evaluated to ensure
that all students have a similar experience and requirement regardless of who their teacher is that school
year. These similar expectations and experiences will lead to a development of an SAE culture within the
school and directly affect a student's willingness to participate in an SAE program in future years.

Connection to FFA

While an award in FFA should never be the primary way that an SAE is introduced to students, it can support
the rationale as to why engagement in an SAE program is vital for all students in an SBAE program. Within
the National FFA Organization, there are several ways that an SAE program can benefit a member. First,
students must have a high-quality SAE program in order to earn the various degrees that are awarded
through the organization. Each degree increases the SAE engagement requirements, encouraging students
to engage in their SAE at a higher level each year that they are enrolled in the SBAE program. Furthermore,
for students with exemplary SAE programs, the National FFA Proficiency Award Program allows for students
to be recognized for their outstanding accomplishments within their SAE program. These awards are given in
nearly fifty areas each year to recognize the specialized skills students have developed through involvement
in their SAE program (National FFA Organization, 2023). As stated earlier, the National FFA awards programs
or degrees should not be the sole reason for a student to engage in or design a specific SAE program;
however, these opportunities can and should provide additional incentive for students to become actively
engaged in their SAE programs.

     Learning Confirmation

     Throughout this chapter, we discussed the current status of SAE within SBAE programs across the nation.
     To address the concerns and struggles that teachers face with developing and implementing SAE programs,
     we explained practices that can be used to assist in engaging all students in these specialized programs and
     helping students develop a passion and interest in the Agriculture, Food, and Natural Resource Industry. As
     we wrap up this chapter, take some time to develop an implementation plan for how you will engage all
     students in your classrooms in an SAE program. As you develop your plan, take into consideration each of
     the five major factors needed to effectively develop and implement SAE programs and the community that
     you will be teaching in either during your student teaching experience or your first year teaching. To help you
     develop this implementation plan, take some time to practice using the SAE Dichotomous Key and to develop
     SAE plans or goals for the mock students listed below and complete the reflection questions at the end of the
     chapter. These two exercises will help you develop your knowledge about SAE, the SAE for All initiative, and the
     current struggles and concerns that are being faced by teachers in SBAE classrooms. When you complete the
     development of an SAE implementation plan be sure to keep a copy that you continue to adapt and improve as
     you grow and develop as a teacher and learn more about your community and changing students.

     Application of Content

     One of the most challenging parts of incorporating SAE programs for teachers is the development of
     individualized SAE programs for all students. To help in this process, use the following mock students and the
     SAE Dichotomous Key to practice developing an SAE program for each mock student.

12. EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AGRICULTURE
LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT TO SUPPORT
STUDENT LEARNING

Hannah H. Scherer

Setting the Stage

Most agricultural education programs have both classroom and laboratory facilities. Laboratories for
agricultural instruction are not there out of tradition. Rather, laboratories are a crucial site of powerful
teaching and learning in agriculture. Many physical spaces can be considered a laboratory environment; the
defining characteristic is that students are using authentic resources in hands-on approaches. Within this
definition, a traditional classroom can also be considered a laboratory environment if the teacher brings in
materials. Consider the following scenario to help you start thinking about this topic:

Picture yourself as a new teacher getting to know the spaces in your program. You can already see how
you will arrange the desks in your classroom and utilize the technology to support student learning, but you
are really excited to get the students into the laboratory space. Do you have a greenhouse? A land lab? A
woodworking shop? A biotechnology lab? What else? Picture it in your mind. If you need some ideas, see
Appendix 12A for a list of possible in-school laboratory facilities by career pathway.

You know that you want to give the students plenty of hands-on time in the lab, but you also know that
powerful teaching requires intentional planning for student engagement, inclusivity, and assessment. You
start to wonder ... How do I address these elements in the lab? How do I decide when to teach in the lab
and when to teach in the classroom? How does what students do in the lab relate to their learning in the
classroom? How do I ensure that learning is happening when students are in the lab? What other questions
do you have?

     Objectives

     By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:
          Differentiate among principal ways the laboratory environment can be used to support student learning.
          Design units of instruction that effectively utilize the laboratory environment to meet student learning
             objectives.
          Identify unique considerations in planning, delivery of instruction, and assessment in the laboratory
             environment.

Introduction

Just like in the classroom, powerful teaching in the laboratory environment involves backward design.
Teachers must carefully consider the learning goals they have for their students when they make decisions
about how to organize the learning activities in and outside the laboratory environment. While not an
exhaustive list, this chapter presents three principal ways that teachers can use the laboratory environment
to support student learning. Each mode is grounded in a different theoretical perspective on learning and
supports different types of outcomes for students. Each will be appropriate at different times and can be
used in combination when planning a laboratory-based course.

Important Note about Safety, Inclusion, and Laboratory Management!

An essential element of teaching in any laboratory environment is providing for safety instruction and
monitoring students for safe practices throughout any lesson. Every agricultural laboratory has many
dangerous areas and situations. It is crucial that students learn to work in their environment safely and
that safety is considered throughout the planning process. Every facility is different (see Appendix 12A) and
comprehensive coverage of safety and laboratory management is outside of the scope of this textbook. You
will need to learn about safety instruction along with other important topics such as supervising students in
the laboratory, managing tools and equipment, and establishing clean-up routines through working with a
mentor, seeking out industry resources, and/or taking an agricultural laboratory management course. Equally
important is to make every effort to include all students in the laboratory environment when it is safe to
do so. Working with special education professionals in your building to modify activities to accommodate
student needs and increase physical accessibility of your laboratory spaces is important to ensure that you
meet the standard of inclusive learning environments. Staying up to date with current safety standards
will also be part of your ongoing professional learning throughout your career. Potential mentors in this
area include advisory board members, industry professionals, other teachers, and retired teachers. Some
introductory considerations for safety instruction and laboratory management are provided in Appendix 12B.

Along with the design considerations for supporting student learning, it is essential that you ask yourself the
following questions and seek out answers BEFORE any students enter the laboratory environment.

     What safety tests are students required to pass before using the tools and equipment included in this
        unit?

     What are my expectations for student behavior in the laboratory environment? How will I ensure that
        my expectations are clearly communicated and consistently reinforced? Have I adequately accounted
        for cultural differences among my students in setting and communicating my expectations? What are
        the consequences for a student who does not meet these expectations?

     What accommodations are required to ensure that all students have an opportunity to participate
        in the laboratory environment? Can I provide these accommodations, or do I need to seek additional
        support or guidance from a resource teacher? Who should I be collaborating with to meet the needs
        of all of my students?

     What is my plan for monitoring student behavior in the laboratory environment? How will I handle a
        student that poses a safety risk to themselves or others?

     Are there sufficient resources for all students to be doing the same thing, or do I need to plan for
        stations? If there are stations, what will they be and how will I ensure that all students are on task?

     Have I ensured that all of the tools and equipment students will need are in good working order?

Background: Science and Theory

An overview of direct instruction, experiential learning, and discovery learning is presented here as a
foundation for the remainder of the chapter.

Direct Instruction for Technical Skill Development

Within direct instruction , the laboratory is viewed as a place where students learn and practice the technical
skills needed for agricultural occupations. This learning happens through direct instruction (Hunter, 1982;
Dell'Olio & Donk, 2007) that scaffolds psychomotor skill development as students work toward the
independence that they will need to use these skills in the future. This teacher-directed mode is grounded
in information processing and behaviorism, which help the teacher carefully consider how they organize
instruction to best support student development of well-defined skills safely and to industry standards.
When applied to psychomotor learning outcomes in agricultural education, the laboratory environment
enables the teacher to use authentic tools and materials in carefully planned demonstrations to present the
skill, design hands-on opportunities for guided and independent practice, and reinforce the learning through
distributive practice in subsequent activities (Osborne, 1986).

Experiential Learning for Generalized Understanding of Real-World
Processes

Within experiential learning, the laboratory is viewed as the site of authentic experience with real-world
processes in agriculture. These experiences form the basis for experiential learning, which happens through
a process of guided reflection and meaning-making to build toward a more generalized understanding of
what happened that can then be used in subsequent experiences. Over time, this repeated process of
experience, reflection, meaning-making, and applying new understandings (the "learning spiral" [Kolb, 2015])
can lead to a deeper ability to flexibly apply learning in practice. This mode is grounded in Kolb's experiential
learning theory, which helps the teacher consider any experience in the laboratory environment (successful
or not) as having the potential to contribute to student learning. When applied to process-oriented learning
outcomes in agricultural education, the laboratory environment allows the teacher to provide real-world
experiences in agriculture that are not possible in the classroom.
                                               EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AGRICULTURE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT | 221

Discovery Learning for Coconstruction of Solutions to Real-World Problems

Within discovery learning, both the classroom and the laboratory are viewed as integrated resources to
support students as they address real-world questions and problems in agriculture. This happens through
student-centered instructional models grounded in inductive reasoning, such as problem-based learning,
design-based learning, and inquiry-based learning. These models are grounded in social constructivism,
which compels the teacher to design learning experiences in which students work together to address issues
that matter to them so that they can develop their own solutions and explanations (Schunk, 2012). Within the
context of instructional models that support problem solving and the development of higher-order thinking
skills, the laboratory environment provides authentic resources (tools, equipment, spaces, etc.) for students
to use in their efforts. This allows for student discoveries, designs, and solutions to be more realistic and
relatable to the agricultural industry and/or their own lives.

Designing for Powerful Teaching in the Laboratory Environment

Deciding what, how, and when to teach in the laboratory involves decisions at all scales, driven by the
question of "why?" Everything presented in this book about effective teaching, evaluation, and inclusion
apply in the laboratory as much as they do in the classroom, but there are unique characteristics about the
laboratory environment that require additional consideration. In this section, each mode described above
will be illustrated with examples and further guidance for designing instruction within that mode.

       Meet the Carroll County High School Agriculture Department
       Vignettes in this chapter will feature ways in which teachers at Carroll County High School (CCHS) design
       for effective teaching in the laboratory environment. CCHS is a public, comprehensive high school located
       in a rural southwest Virginia. The school comprises grades nine through twelve and has approximately
       1,150 students. Farm production and agriculture are the largest economic sector in Carroll County. CCHS's
       agriculture department has a STEM Lab for Agriculture equipped with the latest biotechnology research
       equipment, a dedicated sixty-five-acre farm, and an agricultural mechanics facility. The agriculture
       department serves students with a diverse range of career and postsecondary educational goals.

Designing Direct Instruction for Technical Skill Development

       Direct Instruction in Action at CCHS
       In her floriculture class, Ms. Sarah Jo Jones often transforms her classroom into a laboratory environment
       to teach floral design principles. She designs hands-on direct instruction lessons that build toward students
       independently designing floral arrangements for local clients. Today, she is teaching about balance in floral
       design. Her objective is for students to be able to construct a vase arrangement that achieves symmetrical
       balance. She has set out vases, stems, and greenery on her table at the front of the room and each student
       has the same materials at their station. There are additional materials at the front of the room. Ms. Jones
       begins the lesson with asking students if they have learned about the concept of balance in other settings,
       such as art class. She then announces that this will be the focus of class today and states the objective.
       She explains the concept of symmetrical balance and why it matters in floral design. Ms. Jones builds an
       arrangement to demonstrate how she uses the materials she has to achieve balance in her arrangement,
       pausing at key stages to have students do the same thing. While students are working, she circulates and
       gives each student feedback. After everyone has an arrangement, she leads a discussion to make sure
       students understand why she made the choices she did and how they can achieve balance in their work. Ms.
       Jones then directs students to gather additional materials from the front of the room and continue to build
       out their arrangement with the goal of maintaining symmetrical balance. Students submit a photo of their
       final arrangement to Ms. Jones for assessment. At the end of class, Ms. Jones reminds students that they will
       be using this concept along with other floral design principles when they work with their wedding client later
       in the semester. Finally, she instructs them to follow standard clean-up procedures before dismissal.

This vignette illustrates how Ms. Jones uses direct instruction in order to support technical skill
development through engaging the students' interest, modeling the technique, and giving students a chance
to practice with close guidance and feedback; they will continue to develop this psychomotor skill through
opportunities for independent practice. Through evaluation, she can determine the level of skill development
for each student and continue to support them through distributed practice of the skill within the context of
real-world application. Considerations for each stage of direct instruction in the laboratory environment are
as follows:

Focus Activity

A brief focus activity should draw students in to the lesson for the day. Safety is an important aspect of
transitioning into the session for the day. Ensuring that students are focused and prepared for entering the
laboratory environment is a daily task and can be supported through establishing routines as described in
Appendix 12B.
                                               EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AGRICULTURE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT | 223

Stating Objectives and Providing Rationale

For psychomotor skill development, performance objectives are most appropriate. Situating the objectives
for the lesson in the context of what students are already able to do and how they will use the new skill
in the future is an important step in direct instruction. Teachers can use Universal Design for Learning to
individualize performance objectives to meet unique needs of students in their classes.

Presenting Content and Modeling

Modeling through a demonstration is the primary mode of content delivery for psychomotor skill
development in the laboratory environment. Typically, the teacher will break down the skill into steps, using
narration to explain how and why they are doing what they are doing. Careful planning for how this
demonstration is sequenced, what the teacher does and says for each step, and how students will be
positioned to best see what the teacher is doing are essential.

Checking for Understanding

Checking for understanding should happen throughout the demonstration. Before moving on to the next
step, ask the class to answer questions related to what was just demonstrated, including any safety
measures that are important to highlight. For safety reasons, making sure that students are able to explain
what they need to do is often an important precursor to hands-on practice.

Guided Practice

Guided practice can be integrated with the demonstration or happen after the demonstration is complete.
In some cases, the demonstration will happen in the classroom and then the class will move to a laboratory
space for guided practice. In other cases, the demonstration will take place in the same space where
students will practice the skill. When it is safe to do so, the teacher can have students follow along with a
demonstration using authentic materials. In this case the teacher pauses at each key step and circulates
to check that students have completed the task accurately before moving on, completing several cycles
of modeling, checking for understanding, and guided practice within a single demonstration. Throughout
guided practice, the teacher circulates, monitoring the individual actions of the students, providing one-
on-one feedback and corrections, and bringing the whole class back together as needed for reteaching to
address common errors or challenges. By the end of guided practice, the teacher is confident that each
student is ready to practice the skill on their own.
224 | EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AGRICULTURE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT

Independent Practice

In this stage, students are given the opportunity to practice the skill on their own. This is important for
psychomotor skills that they will need to use with fluency in subsequent projects or laboratory activities.
Ensuring that each student can perform the skill correctly and safely on their own is an important precursor
to independent practice. Managing student behavior and access to resources during independent practice
requires careful planning (Appendix 12B).

Closure

Through closure, the teacher reinforces the need for the skill that was taught and previews for the students
how they will use it in the future. Following closure of the lesson, students are dismissed to complete clean-
up procedures before leaving the laboratory environment for the day.

Distributed Practice

Teachers of agriculture do not teach psychomotor skills independent of real-world application. Once
students have developed the technical skills they need in a particular area, such as woodworking, they
combine these skills and continue to practice each one as they apply them in the context of authentic
projects and activities in the laboratory environment. Such projects can be designed as summative
assessments of unit-scale transfer goals alongside evaluation of performance objectives related to
individual skills.

Designing Experiential Learning for Generalized Understanding of
Real-World Processes

       Experiential Learning in Action at CCHS
       As part of a grant to test out production methods for extending the growing season, students at Carroll
       County High School work with Dr. Randy Webb to grow raspberries in high tunnel greenhouses on their land
       lab. Yesterday, Dr. Webb's agricultural production class worked in the greenhouses, harvesting ripe berries
       for sale. Each day they are in the greenhouses, students make an entry in their logbook recording what
       they did and observations they made. Today in the classroom, Dr. Webb leads a lesson on the life cycle of
       raspberry plants. His objective is for them to be able to use their knowledge of the life cycle of their type of
       raspberry plants to develop a management plan. He asks students to reflect on what they have noticed so
       far about how the plants have changed since they started working in the greenhouse several months ago.
       Students work in groups to discuss what they have recorded in their log books and develop an idea about
       the stages of the life cycle. Some students have experience growing raspberries with their families at home,
       so they contribute those ideas to the discussion. Each group presents their ideas, and Dr. Webb helps the
       class combine their ideas into a whole-class model. He then connects what they have constructed to the
       scientifically accepted model, helping them deepen their understanding and give names to what they have
       observed. They then use this knowledge to help decide what their next steps will be in the greenhouses after
       the harvest is complete.

This vignette illustrates how Dr. Webb uses experiential learning to support student understanding of
processes and procedures through providing ongoing concrete real-world experiences, guiding students in
reflecting on these experiences, helping them make meaning of their experiences through connecting to
theoretical concepts, and providing opportunities to apply their new understandings in authentic practice.
This ongoing cycle helps him prepare students to be able to flexibly apply their knowledge in the future.
Considerations for utilizing production experiences in the laboratory environment as the basis for
experiential learning are as follows:

Concrete Experience

Agricultural education laboratory environments often mirror the conditions of real-world facilities that
students will encounter in industry. Teachers of agriculture use the laboratory environment to engage their
students in real-world tasks related to production, such as harvesting, processing, and cleaning and
maintenance of facilities. These tasks are often part of long-term, client-facing efforts, such as a plant sale
or timber harvest, that raise funds for the program. These tasks, while aligned with the overall course, are
often ongoing and may or may not be directly tied to planned instruction on a particular day.
226 | EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AGRICULTURE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT

Through these concrete experiences, students make new observations, apply critical thinking and problem-
solving skills in practice, and build up a range of experiences that become a rich foundation for deeper
learning. Designing meaningful agricultural production experiences requires ensuring that the laboratory
environment is accessible and welcoming to all students. Teachers do this through using their knowledge
of the skills and abilities their students have and of the students' prior experience in agriculture as well as
through laboratory management strategies to assign tasks and support students.

Closing the Loop of the Experiential Learning Cycle

As with all experiential learning, the stages of reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active
experimentation are important considerations in instructional design. In reflective observation, students
take notice of what they experienced; they are guided to take a step back from the experience itself and
consider what might be important about what occurred. In abstract conceptualization, students start to
draw more general conclusions from what they have noticed through reflective observation. Through
support from the teacher, they may also make connections between what they experienced and concepts
they have learned in the classroom to help understand what they observed. In active experimentation,
students apply their new understandings in practice. These stages can happen through conversations during
practice in the laboratory environment or more formally in the classroom. In many cases, the active
experimentation stage serves as a new experience to start the cycle over again.

       Check for Understanding
       Review the vignette describing Dr. Webb's agricultural production class. Can you identify how he supported
       experiential learning?

Designing Discovery Learning for Coconstruction of Solutions to Real-World
Problems

       Discovery Learning in Action at CCHS
       In their agricultural biotechnology class, Dr. Randy Webb and Ms. Rachelle Rasco use the design-based
       learning model (Wells, 2021) to engage students in a semester-long capstone project. Teams of students
       choose a real-world problem that relates to their career interests. They use techniques they learn in the
       biotechnology lab and knowledge they gain from field trips and in the classroom in order to design and test
       a solution. Dr. Webb and Ms. Rasco don't know what the answers are, but they are there to support the
       teams along the way, providing guidance and resources as they need them. This semester, one of the teams is
       trying to figure out how you could feed a cow in space for one year! They are experimenting with techniques
       for growing crops in agar to alleviate the need to water them and address the gravity issue by holding the
       plants in place. They are testing out what concentrations of seeds, agar, and fertilizers would work best.
       Their initial solutions failed, but they are rethinking their process and preparing to redesign their solution and
       retest it. Their teachers are there to help them think about what went wrong and ask good questions to help
       them move forward. They also share their progress with the other groups in the class so that they can learn
       from each other. Confident that they will have something interesting to share no matter what happens next,
       the group is planning to write a research report, create a research poster, and present their findings to local
       industry leaders, news media, and school administrators. (Note: This description is excerpted from Webb et
       al., 2020.)

This vignette illustrates how Dr. Webb and Ms. Rasco use design-based learning (Wells, 2021) to engage
students in developing their own solutions to real-world problems. In this process, students deepen their
understanding of course content and practice higher-order thinking skills. The learning and application of
content knowledge is driven by the problem students are trying to solve and the teachers serve as a guide
in the process. Giving students voice and choice in their learning though this mode supports motivation and
connection to identity. Considerations for designing discovery learning in the laboratory environment are as
follows:

Choosing an Instructional Model

Unlike the other two modes discussed in this chapter, there are many potential instructional models that are
grounded in constructivism and promote discovery learning. Design-based learning is one. Other common
models are problem-based learning and the scientific-inquiry learning cycle.
228 | EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AGRICULTURE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT

Problem-based learning originated in the field of medical education as a way to train medical professionals
for the real-world decision-making and problem solving that they would encounter on the job (Barrows &
Tamblyn, 1980), and it has been adopted widely. In this model, students are presented with a real-world
problem and the learning occurs through their attempts to determine a solution and defend their reasoning.
A common form of the scientific-inquiry learning cycle (as described in NRC, 2000) is the BSCS 5E
Instructional Model. This model has five stages (engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and
evaluation) that direct students to answer a scientifically oriented question through hands-on exploration
using authentic scientific practices (NRC, 2012).

Resources in the Laboratory Environment

Leveraging the resources of the laboratory environment in design of discovery learning, either entirely or
as part of the experience, requires careful consideration of how and why students will engage with them.
Typically, this means making a variety of tools and materials available to students to use as their needs
emerge in process. Building in a proposal process in which teachers can review plans and approve the use
of materials and space can help in management. For example, in a scientific-inquiry unit where students are
designing experiments with plants in the greenhouse, groups can submit their proposed methods and list of
materials in advance. This allows the teacher to gather what students need and review any safety concerns
prior to setting up the experiment. In other cases, it may be appropriate to limit the materials and equipment
available to the students. For example, in a woodworking design challenge, the teacher can give each group
a standard set of materials to work with and limit them to using hand tools. Groups would have creativity in
how they meet the design brief, but would also be guided to practice a specific set of skills.

Cooperative Learning

In the laboratory environment, management of group work is particularly important to make sure that
students are engaged and safely using equipment and resources. Cooperative learning strategies are
effective in promoting engagement and mediating potential conflicts due to differing social identities
(Johnson & Johnson, 1999); this aspect of planning is especially important in longer term projects in which
team dynamics can play a big role. Where appropriate, assigning specific roles within a group can help things
run smoothly and can reinforce real-world career options within an industry. For example, one student can be
in charge of procurement of materials, another can serve as project manager, and another can be the safety
officer.

Authentic Assessment

Discovery learning in agricultural education contexts should rely on authentic assessment embedded in
the design of the learning experience from the beginning. The laboratory environment provides endless
possibilities for students to situate their learning in real-world problem solving. Formative assessment
should happen throughout in order to keep groups moving in a productive direction. Summative
assessments should include a product that is consistent with the task assigned and, wherever possible,
should be shared with other stakeholders outside of the classroom community.

       Check for Understanding
       Review the vignette describing Dr. Webb and Ms. Rasco's agricultural biotechnology class. Can you identify
       how they used the laboratory environment, embedded authentic assessment, and connected to student
       interest?

     Learning Confirmation

     To check your understanding of the ideas presented in this chapter, please complete the following:
         1. Compare and contrast the three modes for utilizing the laboratory environment. In your response, consider
             the types of student learning goals, theoretical underpinnings, and the role of the laboratory environment.
        2. Choose a unit that you are excited to teach that includes the laboratory environment and complete the
             following:
                 a. Using the guidance in chapter 7, identify the learning objectives for your unit.
                 b. Determine which mode (or combination of modes) you think best fits your objectives and explain
                      why.
                 c. Develop a sketch outline of your unit plan, making sure it includes the objectives, assessment
                      evidence, and a brief description of how you will structure the learning activities.
                 d. Consider the mode(s) you didn't choose for this unit. Either
                          i. Describe how the unit plan (objectives, assessment evidence, and learning activities) would
                              be different if you utilized these different modes;
                              OR
230 | EFFECTIVE USE OF THE AGRICULTURE LABORATORY ENVIRONMENT

                         ii. Create new sketch unit outlines (objectives, assessment evidence, and learning activities) for
                              your unit using each of the different modes.

        3. Within each of your unit plan ideas from number 2, complete the following:
                 a. Identify potential challenges that might arise when teaching the unit and how you will go about
                      addressing them.
                 b. Describe ways in which you will attend to diversity and inclusion to best meet the needs of all of
                      your students when teaching the unit.
                 c. Reflect on what excites you most about the potential for powerful teaching and learning within the
                      unit.

     For additional practice, consider these additional assessment tasks:
         1. Swap unit plan outlines with a classmate and give them advice for how they could strengthen use of the
             laboratory environment by considering a different mode.
        2. Interview an experienced agriculture teacher about how and why they utilize the laboratory in their
             program. After the interview, identify which mode you think best fits their practice. Defend your answer
             with evidence from the interview.

     Applying the Content

     Your Role as a Designer
     In many fundamental ways, teachers are designers. Working within existing curriculum frameworks and the
     real-world constraints of their educational environments, teachers make design decisions every day as they plan
     for how they will support student learning in powerful ways. Just like other design tasks, there is not a one-
     size-fits-all solution--how a teacher applies the ideas presented in this chapter will depend on their context and
     the laboratory environment(s) available for use. The different modes can be considered as potential solutions to
     instructional design challenges; they are offered as a starting point for decision-making about how and when to
     use the laboratory environment to support student learning. As teachers consider the resources available in the
     laboratory environment and/or new facilities and resources they would like to acquire, student learning is front
     and center. Identifying the learning goals for a course or unit and how these are situated in real-world contexts
     is a great starting point for determining which mode of instruction will be most suitable.

Reflective Questions

1. Laboratory management and safety concerns require the teacher to do a lot of detailed planning and
    careful coordination of the daily activities of students. Why do you think the author of this chapter decided
    to focus instead on modes for teaching in laboratory environments?

2. Recall the laboratory environment that you pictured at the beginning of this chapter. In what ways are you
    thinking about using that space to support student learning that you hadn't considered before you read
    this chapter? What ideas did you have that were reinforced through the ideas presented in this chapter?

3. Throughout this chapter, fundamental ideas that are introduced in other parts of this textbook were
    reinforced or referenced. Revisit your responses to the assessment questions in the chapters in part 3 (7,
    on planning; 8, on delivery; and 9, on evaluation). In what ways did your responses include the laboratory
    environment? In what ways should you expand your responses to make sure that you carefully consider
    the laboratory environment as you design instruction?

APPENDIX 12B: INTRODUCTORY
CONSIDERATIONS FOR LABORATORY SAFETY
AND MANAGEMENT

Providing for Safety Instruction

An essential element of good laboratory management is providing for safety instruction. Every agricultural
laboratory has many dangerous areas and situations. It is crucial that students learn to work in their
environment safely not only for their immediate welfare, but so that they develop the essential safety habits
needed for their future employment in the industry. From the standpoint of teachers, there are at least
three compelling reasons for making sure that their students learn to work safely in the laboratory. First of
all, teachers care about the individual students and certainly would not want to see one injured. Second,
teachers want to get students totally prepared for a successful future. The third reason teachers must be
sure students receive superb safety instruction is to protect their own welfare. The legal climate is such that
teachers who do not provide satisfactory safety instruction and supervision may be found liable for failure to
do so. Thus, teachers must be sure they are adequately covered by reliable professional liability insurance.

The first thing to remember about safety instruction is that safety is largely a question of attitude. Thus,
teachers must use instructional practices that impact not only the psychomotor and cognitive domains but
also impact favorably on the affective domain.

The cornerstone for safety instruction is thorough classroom instruction. Students must be taught the
specific safety practices that will be expected and required in the laboratory in question. Students must also
be taught specific safety practices that pertain to each area of the lab and to specific pieces of equipment
and tools.

Structured classroom instruction with complete note taking is essential. Teachers should use a variety of
techniques that appeal to all five senses when teaching safety principles and practices. Another effective
technique is to bring in people from agribusiness and industry who can relate vivid experiences they have
had or seen and to offer industry specifications on how safety is handled in real-life settings.

Teachers also need to demonstrate and role-model the specifics of safe psychomotor operations. Finally,
students must show "proficiency" on a general safety test, as well as a specific test for each category of tools
and equipment, chemicals and dangerous agents, and specific learning centers. These tests then must be
kept on file as evidence that formal instruction has taken place and that each student has demonstrated
mastery. There are several good commercial sources of safety units, tests, and audiovisual aids.
236 | APPENDIX 12B: INTRODUCTORY CONSIDERATIONS FOR LABORATORY SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT

Then, throughout the duration of the course, students must be reminded of safety. As new problems are
discussed, teachers can reiterate previous cautions.

Once in the laboratory, there needs to be an effective, safety-conscious environment. Teachers must use
state and national recommendations for color-coding, display safety posters and exhibits (many good
materials are available through each state's safety agencies), and guarantee that all guards and other safety
devices on equipment meet state standards. The laboratory must always be neatly arranged, clean, and well
lit.

Each day and throughout each laboratory period students need to be reminded of safety. This can be done
by the teacher, by the laboratory supervisor, and by the safety engineer if one is used. Another important
practice is for teachers to set the example by wearing safe clothing and safety glasses and following the same
rules that they have set forth for their students.

The final element of a good safety program is for the teacher and assigned students to conduct safety
inspections daily. If tools and equipment are found to be in anything other than top operating condition,
appropriate restorative maintenance must be provided. All in all, the goal of a good program of safety
instruction is for students to develop a mind set for safety and practice daily habits of working safely.

Managing Tools and Equipment

Teachers must be sure to manage all tools and equipment, including computers. Without a viable
management system for maintaining and upgrading tools and equipment, there will not be a laboratory to
manage. Tools, equipment, hardware, and software are very expensive, and it is the teacher who is ultimately
responsible for keeping them in good condition or updated. Also, if tools, equipment, and computers are in
disrepair, broken, or missing, the students will be unable to stay productively involved during laboratory, the
consequences of which can be readily predicted.

If students do not learn to properly use and care for tools, equipment, hardware, or software as a part of their
instruction, then they will encounter serious problems when they enter the work force. In essence, students
need to develop acceptable equipment use habits. The dollars involved in industry demand such an attitude.

Many teachers prefer to store or locate tools of all kinds on a display board near the location where they will
be used. Larger tools and pieces of portable equipment should be kept in a logical storage area and checked
in and out using a system that everyone understands. Wherever tools are kept, they should be kept clean and
ready for the function for which they were intended.

This means that every student who uses a tool or piece of equipment returns it cleaned and ready to use to
the place where they found it. At the close of every laboratory period, the supervisor and teacher must be
certain that everything is clean and in its place and, in the case of shared computers, certain that no personal
files are left on hard drives. Otherwise, problems mount.
      APPENDIX 12B: INTRODUCTORY CONSIDERATIONS FOR LABORATORY SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT | 237

Teachers must also provide students with instruction on refitting tools, upgrading software packages, and
fine-tuning equipment. For example, students need to learn to sharpen hoes, shovels, chisels, chain saw
chains, and other tools. They must learn to replace glass or plastic on the green house, readjust gate hinges
in the school barns, sharpen clippers used for dog grooming, and re-adhere PVC pipe on aquaculture tanks.
This is an important part of preparation for work and is vital to the successful management of tools and
equipment.

Procedures for Efficiently Starting and Ending a Laboratory Period

Beginning the laboratory period. If teachers begin laboratories in a businesslike manner, then this mood is
apt to prevail for the rest of the laboratory period. However, if teachers begin laboratories in a disorganized
and confused manner, then the entire laboratory period is apt to be tainted by that approach and attitude
throughout the session.

The first thing to be accomplished in getting the laboratory started is to achieve the proper mental set.
The mental set that is desired is that "we're here to work, we'll accomplish much, and we'll enjoy doing it."
This can be achieved by beginning the laboratory promptly and in a systematic and businesslike fashion,
preferably in the classroom where students can sit in the academic environment and check notebooks for
project timeliness and daily objectives before reporting to the laboratory space.

Students need to report for lab promptly and be dressed and ready for work within a set number of minutes
after being dismissed from the classroom. The roll should then be checked in the laboratory environment
to ensure each student is where they need to be for that day. This can be done by the teacher or by the
laboratory supervisor for that day.

Assignments for the day then need to be given. They may be given on paper, on the chalkboard, or orally.
Each student must know their assignment. The teacher needs to be sure that the students know the goals
or objectives for the lab activities and that they clearly see the relationship of their lab work to their previous
classroom learning.

Prior to allowing students to begin work, the teacher or an appointed student, such as the laboratory
supervisor for that day, needs to double-check to be sure that every student knows what to do and how to
get started. Only then should students be allowed to start work.

If this procedure or a similar one is not followed, then some students begin work, others do not, there is
more opportunity for off task behavior, there is confusion as to who is supposed to do what, and the general
atmosphere of the laboratory is not conductive to learning.
238 | APPENDIX 12B: INTRODUCTORY CONSIDERATIONS FOR LABORATORY SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT

Procedures to follow in ending the laboratory period. Just as the laboratory period needs to be started in
a businesslike manner, it is also imperative that it be ended in such a manner. The following procedures are
suggested:

 1. Signal a time to stop. This may be done by blowing a whistle, ringing a bell, or other procedures that
      can become habitual for students. Upon giving the "stop work" signal, everyone must immediately cease
      work; otherwise, the system does not work. This expectation has to be clearly defined early in the school
      year, reinforced, and practiced.

 2. Student put away their work, tools, and equipment. Students need to clear the laboratory so it can be
      cleaned daily. Projects cannot be left strewn about. Students cannot be allowed to leave tools out,
      reasoning that they'll be needed again tomorrow or by students in another laboratory. Such practice
      leads to a situation in which no one can find anything. If a student is acting as the equipment manager,
      all items used in the laboratory were checked-out by that person and must be checked back in by that
      person.

 3. Everyone joins in to clean the entire laboratory. The only way this works is if everyone has a specific
      duty during clean-up. Teachers ought to demonstrate how they want each clean-up job performed;
      otherwise, perfection will not be attained. These duties need to be rotated since some are much less
      pleasant than others. Many teachers in agriculture mechanics laboratories use a clean-up wheel, which
      can be created for all types of laboratories. All students' names in the class are included in the center
      circle. Then one clean-up duty for each name is listed on the outer circle. The wheel rotates clockwise
      one name each class period.

 4. Once all clean-up duties have been completed, students may clean themselves up and dress for the rest of
      their school day. This prioritizes the clean-up of the collective space first and ensures that it is complete.

 5. Students wait for dismissal from the teacher. Once students are ready to leave the laboratory they must
      wait until the teacher is satisfied, primarily via the laboratory supervisor, that everything is in order.
      The teacher then needs to dismiss the class. The students do not leave until the teacher has dismissed
      them; otherwise, laboratory clean-up may not be completed well.

If the laboratory is not cleaned after every class period, then no system will work. A clean laboratory is an
efficient and productive laboratory and must be a priority item with teachers and students alike.
     APPENDIX 12B: INTRODUCTORY CONSIDERATIONS FOR LABORATORY SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT | 239

Using Learning Centers to Manage Laboratory Tasks with Limited
Materials

Generally, there is not sufficient work, materials, or equipment that all the students in the laboratory can
be doing the same thing. For example, if students need to practice transplanting shrubs, seldom are there
enough shovels or pruners and other equipment to accommodate everyone in the class at the same time. In
the case of an animal care program, a school generally does not have enough aquaria so that each student or
even pair of students can simultaneously master the process of setting up an aquarium. Thus, teachers have
to design what are called learning centers in order to have all of the students productively involved.

Setting up learning centers. A learning center is an area (physically and in terms of subject matter) within
the laboratory where similar (like) work is performed. The specific learning centers in a laboratory during a
given part of the school year are determined by the teacher's course of study. While the ideal of presenting
the basics in the classroom, followed immediately by practice, is never perfectly attained, there must be a
reasonable degree of connection between the development of understandings and the development of skills.

Once learning centers have been identified or chosen, the teacher must plan the specific learning activities
to be completed in each of the learning centers. This should not be construed to mean that every group of
students who work in a learning center completes the same activities. For example, the group that works in
the flower shop one week might make three planters, but the group the next week may not make any. It all
depends on the work that needs to be done during the time students are in the learning center. However, if
the teacher is rotating students through a learning center to learn striking an arc and laying a bead in welding
(initial skill development), then all students who go through that center will complete the same activities
since this is a basic skill development-learning center. This planning is fairly well dictated by the work to be
done and the prior instruction that students have had. Before students can engage in meaningful practice,
they must have a precise idea of what they are to do, what tools and supplies they need in order to do it, and
what procedures they must follow. Once teachers develop assignment sheets for the basic learning center
assignments, this part of planning can be used and reused.

Rotating students through learning centers. If all the students cannot do the same tasks at the same time
and must divide into work groups and work at separate learning centers during lab, then the teacher must
have a viable system to make sure that over a period of time, all students get all of the essential experiences.
This plan is called a rotation system. It is a plan that ensures that each work group of students has a chance
to work through all the learning centers over a period of time. Depending on the nature of the program, this
rotation could be completed once during the school year or could be completed every week or two.
240 | APPENDIX 12B: INTRODUCTORY CONSIDERATIONS FOR LABORATORY SAFETY AND MANAGEMENT

For example, in horticulture a group of students might work in the greenhouse for one day, work in the flower
shop the next, care for a school golf green the third day, prune trees the fourth day, and maintain horticulture
equipment the final day of the week. However, in an agricultural industrial mechanics program a group of
students may work on engine overhaul for an entire grading period. The length of time in a center, the number
of centers, and the frequency of rotation from one center to another depends on the nature of the work being
done and the scope of the work. It takes longer to assemble an aquaculture system than it does to make a
corsage and therein lies the determiner of frequency of rotation.

Rotation is not the easiest way to manage laboratory learning. Typically, the easiest way to manage a
laboratory is to have every student practicing the same skill. Nor is rotation the most preferred way to
manage a laboratory based on educational soundness. Rather it is a necessity. However, rotation is far better
than planning enough lab work for each individual student for one day, and then the next day starting to plan
from scratch all over again. Its primary strength is that it brings an acceptable degree of systematization,
clarity, and structure. It also provides for accountability in that it allows every student to work in every area.

A rotation schedule is planned by grouping work into a number of areas that can accommodate the number
of students in the class in mathematically divisible units. For example, if one has twenty-four students, then
four learning centers that accommodate six students each might be used; or six centers of four each; or two
centers for six students each and four centers for three students each. Another important consideration is
that the learning centers require about the same amount of time or divisible portions thereof. For example,
if there are four centers of six students each, then all four centers need to require the same amount of time
(one week, one month, or whatever is needed). In the case of using two groups of six each and four groups
of three each, the groups of three would have to have twice the number of stations as the groups of six, that
is, groups of six spend one month (or other unit of time) in a center while the groups of three work in two
stations of two weeks each.
