INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING

Introduction

First and foremost microlearning design involves
   (1) reducing the overall volume of learning content in a course
   (2) segmenting recorded learning sessions into bite sized instalments that are easy to digest and access.
   It is a `less is more' approach that aims to reduce unnecessary cognitive load as a major impediment to

learning so that focus can shift to prioritising the most essential skills and knowledge. It makes learning
materials less overwhelming, and as a result more attractive and engaging. It also allows students to manage
their learning at their own pace and at times convenient to them.

   This book extends on microlearning's core approach of information load-reduction, with additional
approaches for increasing engagement, like frequently linking to benefits of the content and designing
activities that aim to be appealing. These also work to further reduce cognitive load.

   This `how to' guidebook is a practical resource for lecturers, teachers, trainers and instructors. It is
aimed at those interested in getting `up and running' with microlearning quickly and easily. It shows how
microlearning design and delivery principles and techniques can be applied to your learning materials and
teaching delivery in ways that are basic and easy to implement, yet powerfully effective. Much of the power
of microlearning come from one of its key design objectives, to simplify the learning process by making
everything as clear and direct: to-the-point as possible.

   Microlearning has become well established, and it is continuing to grow rapidly, gaining ground over
other contemporary pedagogies like Flexible Learning and e-Learning (Alias & Razak, 2024; Olivier, 2021).
Its popularity in universities and in industry training continues to pick up pace (Hogle, 2021; Pandey,
2020). It has accumulated a strong track record as an effective way to increase student engagement and
learning performance, with results often visible in a short time (Corbeil et al., 2021; Kuzminska et al., 2022;
Leary et al., 2020; Mohammed et al., 2018).

   Microlearning has a large body of theoretical literature and branched into many forms (e.g., apps,
software), many being highly specific. However, in this book I confine microlearning to a broadly
applicable approach based on my own development and application of microlearning, which includes the
fields of Public Relations and Communication, along with my interest in what others are doing in other
fields.

   Microlearning utilises widely available digital technologies that allow you to `do it yourself' so I view
it as quite `low tech' because you can apply microlearning without advanced technological knowledge or
specialised technologies. In this book I draw on my research and experience to show how elements of
microlearning can be adopted with modest effort. Adopting it incrementally is the easiest way to get started.
2 | INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING

   This first chapter introduces key principles for understanding how and why microlearning design works.
Microlearning targets above all student engagement, as engagement is a well-established pathway to
learning success. Research consistently shows that increasing engagement leads to increased learning
performance and as such increased completion rates (Kahu et al., 2020; Kamel, 2018; Torgerson, 2021).

   Microlearning's `bit-by-bit' small-form, chunks-of-learning approach also creates a gateway to
engagement with its capacity to generate continued and increasing engagement. As an approach it can
create its own momentum, and getting students engaged from the beginning is a good start for keeping
them engaged.

Learning environment: challenges and trends

Universities today, especially the many now in the online learning space, face challenges. While on one hand
there are more students studying today, with the accessibility of online education being a positive factor,
students are also struggling more than ever before. High non-completion and dropout rates show this.

Why are so many students struggling?

Firstly, study, is by nature hard. It is cognitively demanding, often to the point where it is overwhelming.
In addition to information overload and complexity, motivational strains and challenges of lifeload today
also take a toll, with many now studying part time while also working full or part time and have caring
responsibilities. These factors can be further compounded by factors like financial constraints, disability,
chronic disease and mental health (Nelson et al., 2017). `Time poor' students can become strategic learners
with a focus on efficiency based on working out the minimum they need to do to pass, while many others
become so overwhelmed they fail to complete.

   Traditional course materials and classes appear to lack value for many students today if they are not made
clear, focused and interesting. Students often describe study content as pointless and boring when they
have difficulty in connecting the content to their lives, especially when resources are not made sufficiently
relevant and when sheer volume makes them seem overwhelming. Hence, study can seem alienating and
demotivating, and thus far from empowering.

   An adjustment hurdle for students starting university studies is underestimating the time and effort
study requires. This is another barrier we need to think about and try to manage: `What can we do to ensure
our learners can transition easily into study?' Well - we can make what is required of them explicit and show
them how to achieve what is required in ways that are effective and ethical.

   Our technological and social environment is yet another factor. We are immersed in a digital, online
and social media environment. Digital media along with the demands and pace of life today have increased
pressure on people's attention resources and shortened concentration spans. Conventional long-form
lecture delivery and pages of dense text are no longer effective for many.

   Lack of informatively explicit communication (i.e., lack of full and clear information) is a common
                                                                                                              INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING | 3

barrier to learning. Not making information and meaning explicit enough leaves learners insufficiently
informed and hinders their progress and success in learning.

   (1) Students can spend a lot of time trying to accurately understand information e.g., key concepts, key
instructions leading to a `guessing game' dynamic that adds to cognitive load and impedes effectiveness and
efficiency.

   (2) Students can fail tasks due to misinterpretation or lack of full and clear information.
   It is in this context that we are competing and even struggling for the attention and engagement of many
of our students. What is also important to realise, is that they too are in this struggle.

What can we do?

  · How can we reduce the volume of materials, so they are not overwhelming?
  · How can we make materials easily accessible and more manageable?
  · How can we make content more attractive and appealing?
  · How can we make learning more engaging, enjoyable and empowering?

Microlearning aims is to address these issues. Its first and foremost objective is to reduce cognitive load
by reducing volume to make learning more manageable. Reducing volume and impediments to ease the
demands and difficulties of learning help make the journey more engaging and something students want to
do.

Microlearning design

Microlearning enables the delivery of instructional content in short manageable bursts, at times that are
convenient to learners. It is well matched to how people now access information through small devices,
phones and tablets. These devices themselves now drive people's preferences for sourcing and consuming
information in bite-sized form, making them accustomed to doing things this way.

   Microlearning is multimedia based because it draws on online digital delivery of audio-visual materials,
that are then accompanied by shortened text-based learning resources. Microlearning is regarded as an
online educational design and delivery method. However, learning design and delivery practices in
microlearning are applicable to on-campus as well as online learning, e.g., by designing learning sessions
aimed at being engaging, relevant and interesting.

  · Much of microlearning is based on learning and teaching approaches developed and proven effective
      long before digital technology, e.g., scaffolding learning, incrementally with segments;

  · Many learning resources for on campus learners now reside in the same online Learning
      Management Systems (LMS) used by online learners; and

  · A great deal of on-campus learning now takes place online, e.g., peer-discussion and learning
      activities that students participate in online.
4 | INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING

On-campus study has been blending with online study for some time, on-campus students now expect
recordings of lectures and classes to be recorded and available online. Similarly, many aspects of day-to-day
life have moved online in today's world, like the consumption of many goods and services e.g., booking
travel and accommodation.

   Students today, also have high expectations that courses follow good design logic; they are becoming
more accustomed to frameworks such as universal design for learning (UDL) that provide a more
systematised and coherent learning experience. The need to embrace learning design to successfully engage
students has been increasing and hastened further by COVID (Singh et al., 2022).

   Growing reliance on online technology today is moving higher education teachers toward roles as
content and delivery design specialists and strategists (Corbeil et al., 2021). Microlearning itself is geared
toward designing and engineering content and delivery to increase engagement and optimise learning.

Design fundamentals

While there is a wide range of definitions for microlearning, the following description encapsulates its key
elements:

          The delivery of instructional content in short and focused bursts
          each designed to elicit responses
          each linked to one, or more, specific learning objectives (Kapp & Defelice, 2019).

At its core, microlearning entails (1) reducing content and then (2) segmenting the selected high relevance
material into easily digestible `bite-size` instalments. This makes information more attractive and engaging
and increases absorption and comprehension. It is underpinned by cognitive load theory which focuses
on optimising instructional design (Gobet, 2005; Kamel, 2018; Sweller, 2010). Segmenting materials into
`bite-size` instalments can be achieved with short microlectures and class learning sessions.

   Making course resources and delivery more accessible and attractive, and a more positive experience,
increases success in learning, e.g., course completion, grade performance, skill and knowledge acquisition
and employability.

                                   Microlearning - bite-sized, digestible bits
                                                                                                              INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING | 5

   Microlearning uses a `less is more' principle to reduce unnecessary cognitive overload and associated
stress, as major impediments to learning (Corbeil et al., 2021; Kapp & Defelice, 2019). This makes learning
less daunting and more manageable, and shifts focus onto the most important and relevant content.

   Instructional delivery through short, interlinked, segmented units of learning, designed sequentially is a
central feature. It is a process of incremental learning by building knowledge and skills using step-by-step
instalments. This makes it a scaffolded approach to learning design and reduces cognitive load.

   In this way microlearning seeks to optimise cogitative processes for the transfer of learning from short,
to long term memory (i.e., memory retention), as well as facilitating deeper level understanding and
proficiency. Through this design, learners' abilities to apply skills and knowledge can be significantly
improved (Jomah et al., 2016; Kamel, 2018).

     Micro-hedging: personal insight into breaking a large task
     down

       The importance of this idea of breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable units really
       came home to me in my struggles with trimming a very large hedge. It was a job I dreaded -
       one that would exhaust me physically and mentally. Eventually, I realised that there had to
       be a better way: `pay someone else to carry the burden' maybe? But the solution was to
       break the task down, splitting it up into 15-20 minute sessions, one per day, or every second
       day. This worked. It solved my problem. I was able to complete the whole hedge in good
       time, in as little as a week, even better than expected. Furthermore, this work became more
       of a relaxing activity than a dreaded burden.
       While this example does not capture all there is to microlearning, it helps demonstrate the
       benefits of breaking work (including study tasks), down into smaller, more manageable bits.
       Avoiding overload makes life easier, and study more manageable and more enjoyable. It is a
       key element in the microlearning approach.

Cognitive load and components

Cognitive load theory draws on educational psychology as a brain-memory framework for advancing
instructional design theory with a focus on reducing cognitive load (Sweller, 2010).

   Cognitive Load: an overarching term that refers to the demand on working memory capacity for a task
(Lovel, 2020; Sweller, 2010). The larger or more complex the task or subject matter the greater the demand
on cognitive load. The terms that follow include subset components for the cognitive load framework,
aspects of cognitive load and points where cognitive load can occur. Note, that the term cognitive load is
6 | INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING

often used to refer to cognitive overload even though that is not technically correct (see cognitive overload
definition below).

   - Element/s: content / units of content: anything that needs to be learned e.g., concepts, skills,
processes.

   - Intrinsic (cognitive) load: is the natural difficulty of the content or a subject area. Complexity of
content can vary e.g., low, mid, high. The cognitive load for a complex recipe is higher than for a simple
one as demand on the working memory required increases. Hence, difficulty often increases with volume
of information /or elements.

   Intrinsic load also increases in areas where concepts cannot be understood without an understanding
of related concepts (i.e., constituent concepts) because it increases complexity. This is known as element
interactivity.

   - Working memory: is a person's capacity for information in-take needed for processing i.e., processing
power. Working memory is highly limited and hence a major barrier and limitation in learning, especially if
not managed well. Processing new information requires also retrieving knowledge from long-term memory,
and in doing so places demand on cognitive load.

   - Germane load: refers to the mental resources required to grasp and integrate new information into
long-term memory. It is closely connected to the concept of working memory, and translates to, load
on working memory, or `working memory load'. Hence, germane load is commonly referred to as working
memory. (see working memory).

   - Long term memory: the brain's information storage system. Long term memory is significant
because it is widely accepted that for learning to take place, content must be absorbed into long term
memory. However, its robustness for close-to-permanent storage can be overestimated. Accessing the
information stored not only requires retention but retrieval with both having limitations.

   We depend on retrieval for learning. This is because learning involves drawing on (retrieving) existing
knowledge (which incorporates mental schemas) as a mental framework for interpreting new information
so that it can then be encoded into long term memory. Retrieval is also required for application (ability
to apply in practice) which includes testing for retention and competency e.g., examinations. Storage
retention and retrievability can be strengthened by repetition and practice to fortify neural connections.

   Repetition and active participation in practice-based activities are learning design approaches used to
increase memory retention and retrievability to help ensure knowledge and skills remain memorable for
longer.

   - Extraneous (cognitive) load: arises from how information is presented, the way learning and delivery
are designed (i.e., learning design load). It is an area where lecturers, educators and learning designers can
work to reduce cognitive load through design by reducing volume and extraneous information e.g., unclear
explanations, poorly design graphics.

   - Cognitive overload: occurs when volume and, or, complexity of information exceeds working
memory limits, i.e. exceeds a learner's cognitive load capacity for processing and storing to long term
memory. Segmenting information delivery into units that that can be processed in working memory is one
important way to overcome cognitive overload and ensure learning takes place.

   - Cognitive overload stress: stress brought on by anxiety due to overload and perceptions of overload
                                                                                                              INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING | 7

e.g., "this looks too hard". Overload induced stress creates confusion making comprehension and
processing of information more difficult, and further compounds feelings of being overwhelmed. Stress
impedes learning by adding to cognitive load while also undermining confidence and motivation.

   - Learner load: (a term I have introduced) refers to impacts, stressors and impediments associated
with learners. This includes personal and lifeload factors like the competing demands of work and family
(covered earlier), and includes learning difficulties and emotions learners may bring to learning.

Our aim as learning designers

Our aim as learning designers, is to design learning, (which includes content and delivery), in ways that ease
or lower learning design load (i.e. extraneous load). Approaches and measures covered in this chapter and
those that follow, include:

   - reducing unnecessary, or extraneous content e.g., clear `to-the-point` communication
   - segmenting learning into smaller units
   - designing learning materials, sessions and exercises that aim to appeal to, and actively involve learners:
i.e., using a learner engagement-centred mindset (covered in following topic).
   Cognitive overload depletes learner interest and confidence and occurs when cognitive load exceeds the
capacity of working memory to process and retain information. Reducing content and streamlining design
can increase attentional capacity, interest and motivation for learning (Nelson, et. al., 2017), and thus
increase learning performance.

Microlearning is learner engagement-centred

Breaking learning down into small bites not only makes learning easier to digest, it provides students with
increased opportunities to identify specific pieces or areas of content they see as best serving their individual
interests and needs. Enabling students to engage in learning at times most convenient to them is another
feature that helps them gain more control over their own learning. As you go on you will notice more and
more design features in microlearning that are aimed at better empowering learners.

   Microlearning is well aligned with how the human brain learns and naturally takes in and processes
information (Jomah et al., 2016), allowing learners to seek out specific information on their journeys to
build understanding and skills. In this sense it can be linked to Information Foraging Theory (Khapre
& Basha, 2012). This learning as foraging perspective can help us orient our design of learning in ways
that allow learners to locate and access specific pieces of information around their curiosities and interests,
making learning a more enjoyable and rewarding experience. When combined with learning in digestible
increments, it helps further sustain learner interest, while also, very importantly, keeping stress in check.

   Microlearning is learner engagement-centred in many ways, it is multifaceted in this respect. In its quest
for increasing learner engagement it seeks to identify and subsequently address students' struggle points.
The box below, shows the key barriers to learner engagement to be addressed in chapters that follow and
8 | INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING

are based on research literature (Korstange, et al., 2020; Gutierrez, 2018; Lizzio & Wilson, 2010) and also
my experiences with the feedback I receive from students.

     Barriers to learning and motivation: pain points

       Cognitive overload: feeling overwhelmed by volume and perceived volume; attention
       span limits; competing life and work demands of our age (i.e., life-load)
       Lack of relevance and practical value: When the relevance of material covered is not
       obvious, nor how it can be usefully applied to:

            · employability (e.g., profession specific knowledge competencies)
            · assessments
       Lack of conciseness in presentation information: Attention span limits demand brevity
       and clarity
       Lack of explicitness (full and clear information) can leave learners insufficiently informed
       and hinder learning.
       Lack of appeal and stimulation of interest in materials and learning sessions
       Insufficient sense of involvement: lack of ownership, control in the learning process
       (alienation)
       Lack of sense of belonging and being supported: feelings of learning being impersonal;
       of learner not feeling valued in the learning process (isolation)

What learners desire

Learners want information and learning to appear clear, to the point, relevant and practical while also
interesting to them. This makes sense. We are all learners; this is what we all want.

What learners need

Learners also need information (knowledge) and skills that are aligned to work and employment, to ensure
they are well prepared for success in work, career and in life generally. Learners will derive a sense of purpose
from course content when they can see its value in: helping them understand and develop in their discipline
area; supporting them to build their vocational competence; and personal development and competencies.
We can help here by ensuring the criterion of `relevancy' is tied to industry and job market demand (covered
in Chapter 2). For content to be effective, learners also need, and desire, support, in line with their interests
                                                                                                              INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING | 9

and needs. Incorporating practical activities to assess or gauge learning into information and lesson delivery
is also key to learner engagement (i.e., practice-based learning, below).

   Again, a key aim in microlearning design is to reduce cognitive overload - that is, the high levels of
difficulty and stress many students experience with learning with two core approaches:

  · reducing volume of content (in a course).
  · reducing the length of units of learning (or learning sessions) by segmenting them into shorter, easier

      to manage instalments of learning.

We have touched on the second, which is segmenting delivery. But ideally we should begin with the first,
reducing overall volume of content. This means cutting out unnecessary content to make learning less
daunting, more manageable, and as such more inviting and attractive. This `selective' reduction approach
also helps ensure interest, relevance and value for learners.

                                Microlearning's `less is more'

                                                                More learning

Less volume

     Active practice-based learning

       Microlearning design involves creating short and focused learning experiences that
       incorporate `practice-based' learning through activities designed to elicit participation in
       applying understandings and skills, ideally, through interaction with peers (Kossen & Ooi,
       2021; Leary et al., 2020).
       Microlearning seeks to achieve better transfer of learning from short term to long term
       memory and in doing so improve knowledge retention, as well as deeper level
       understanding and mastery (Kamel, 2018).

Increasing student involvement, with engaging practical exercises, can be challenging, but achievable with
the right blend of encouragement and design measures to make participation attractive and worthwhile for
learners.

   Other key design measures I use, and in the chapters that follow, include:

 1. variance and novelty, e.g. in media, voice and delivery style, fostering positivity, use of humour
 2. lecturer presence and personalisation through promotion and nudging, e.g., weekly lecturer videos

      and weekly messages that include advice and encouragement.

     Key Microlearning Design Features

       Reduce content: prioritise relevance and practical value
       Clear and concise communication: direct, to-the-point (is also a content reduction
       measure)
       Informative and explicit communication: full and precise information and direction to
       ensure students are sufficiently informed for study and assessments
       Segment delivery into small units of learning e.g., recorded audio visual presentations
       Relevance-linking: frequently and explicitly explain relevance and practical value
       Activate and draw on prior learning: use experiences and knowledge; involve learners in
       the development of their own understandings and learning
       Prompts to encourage active participation: performance/practice-based learning,
       designing activities to make participation interesting and rewarding, and also, by providing
       useful feedback
       Nudging to promote interest and personalise support: with lecturer videos and
       supportive written messaging (encouragement and assignment tips, `feeding forward',
       giving advice on common pitfalls to avoid in student work.
       Novelty and variance: in media e.g., podcasts; also vocal dynamics, like using formal and
       conversational styles, strategic use of humour to further stimulate appeal, interest and
       relatability; and by including co-presenters
       Practical and collaborative activities in course design and delivery.

Applying microlearning design

Adopting microlearning is not difficult; it is much easier than people think. It is achievable. While it does
require some effort and change, one way to make it manageable is to make changes incrementally. Doing
so is actually in keeping with microlearning principles. My own case study research with a colleague on
implementing microlearning at a Malaysian university, concluded that microlearning can be implemented
with relative ease, that is, with modest, rather than onerous demands on time and effort for those interested
in implementing (Kossen & Ooi 2021).

   The more you become familiar with microlearning, the more you will notice that it draws heavily on long
established and effective teaching practices. Key among these are: clear and `to the point' information (i.e.
clear and direct); breaking content into bite size units so it is not too mentally demanding; ensuring `high
12 | INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING

relevance' practical content based on industry needs; clear and explicit learning objectives; and developing
interesting activities (e.g., including those that have worked well in your classroom teaching). These points
help show that a great deal of good common teaching practice is transferable to microlearning. It does not
require us to reinvent our style or the essence of our approach.

   So, while the term microlearning is relatively new, a great deal of what constitutes it is based on long-
established and proven learning design and teaching practices. Microlearning from a teacher's perspective
is more about refining and enhancing aspects of one's approaches rather than having to make large scale
changes.

   This guidebook will help guide you through your own journey from someone who has experienced it
personally and with a good deal of success. The recording and segmenting of lectures, or instructional
presentations, may well be the greatest change for many. Even so, this is much more achievable than it may
first seem, even for those like me with virtually no prior technical knowledge.

   I will provide practical guidance and examples illustrating how I navigated my way through the
challenges to provide you with valuable lessons I learned to help you manage the process with greater ease.
Having said this, it is also important not to oversell the idea that it is easy to implement. The extent to
which you decide to apply microlearning will influence the amount of work involved.

Public relations industry presentation on microlearning

The following introductory section of my presentation (below) at a Public Relations Institute of Australia
(now named Communication and Public Relations Australia) Education Committee Seminar, provides
an overview of microlearning. The presentation starts with the proposition, that: learning is, by nature,
inherently difficult; or in other words, cognitively demanding. It is worth noting again here, that
microlearning's focus of identifying key barriers to engagement and learning, has proven to be effective as a
starting point for developing ways to address and reduce them.

Microlearning critiques, considerations and pitfalls

One criticism levelled at microlearning is that its reduction of content and segmenting of learning into
short units `dumbs down' quality in education. Contrary to this, microlearning design aims to facilitate
deeper learning and mastery of high priority knowledge and skills and is well supported with a track-record
of success (Corbeil et al., 2021; Kuzminska et al., 2022; Leary et al., 2020).

   Another misguided assumption is that microlearning is suited only to simple types of learning, but
not more complex learning. This stems from often repeated myths that describe microlearning as learning
                                                                                                            INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING | 13

in 3-to-5 minutes bursts. This is far too restrictive and misrepresents microlearning. Microlearning can
be more accurately understood as optimising length, by taking cognitive processing capacity into
consideration. It is also guided by the nature and complexity of the learning involved.

   Microlearning is well suited to dealing with complex learning because of its design method of building
complexity incrementally through scaffolded segments. Information delivery, and learning session lengths
can extend depending on the nature and complexity of material and the level of learning required.

   While microlearning has proven to be a valuable approach, well worth considering, building up
unrealistic expectations about any method or approach and touting it as a panacea is unwise.

   The need for microlearning approaches is greatest where overcoming learning barriers is most
challenging. Examples are first year courses and those with high attrition or failure rates, often due to
inherent difficulty of the subject area, and at times, poor design (structuring and delivery).

   One pitfall to avoid is overloading courses with too many learning supports and help and `bells and
whistles'. This can undermine the benefits microlearning's `less is more' principle brings. Loading on too
much support, while carried out with good intentions, adds clutter and noise that can overload learners and
undermine positive experiences and outcomes. Even though, it is tempting to squeeze in extra supports,
like `extend your knowledge' readings, and even `handy hints' for assessments can be overdone, creating
noise and clutter.

   The principles of microlearning should be applied to learning resources so that they are carefully selected
i.e., curated. Consideration should be given to the purpose of the support material to target it to the
particular needs of your students, and checked to ensure materials are well-timed and placed, and follow a
`less is more' approach.

Monitoring and interpreting data and results

Features like bite-sized video presentations and interactive online classes are highly appreciated by, and
benefit, many learners. But, as I have learned, there are others who prefer to focus on reading set materials
and go on to perform very well in their assessments. It is often a case of providing for differing learning
styles within a course. It is important we remember that many learners enrol in online learning because it
allows them to learn independently without the need to attend and participate in classes. So while there
may be many learners who seem disengaged, high levels of engagement are revealed later when utilisation
and application of course learning resources become evident in their assessments. Early assessment is a
critical tool, serving as a litmus test to gauge engagement and learning performance early on.

   Measuring engagement by class attendance, frequency of access to resources including recorded classes
and presentations, and responses to course forum activities, can be misleading. That is not to say that these
measures and analytics (e.g., whether resources have been accessed) should not be discounted or have no
importance. But they do need to be interpreted and understood holistically in relation to other indicators
like increases in assignment grades, completion rates and student feedback (e.g., course satisfaction ratings
and accompanying qualitative responses in course satisfaction evaluations).
14 | INTRODUCING MICROLEARNING

Making early engagement a high priority

Again, the first and foremost goal of microlearning is to increase learner engagement, a strategy at the
heart of our quest to increase rates of learning success. The importance of early engagement in achieving
course engagement overall is a point that is obvious to us all. It is especially important for the complex
equity groupings of students typical of regional, rural and remote universities. Positive first encounters
support and help ensure a positive learning experience overall, together with overall well-being, engagement
(Nelson et al., 2017) and sense of belonging (Crawford et. al., 2023).

   Making a `splash' at the beginning should be given high priority. `Welcome to the course' messages and
videos as well as first lectures, tutorials, or classes, warrant special attention in order to set the tempo,
i.e., establish vibrancy, positivity, and sense of purpose and belonging. This also helps establish a sense of
confidence, not only for our students, but for ourselves as well. But again, keep a student-centred mind set,
they are the focus. They the centre and always the `stars of the show'.

   The methods and strategies we can draw on to help ensure our first learning sessions are engaging
are discussed in following chapters. However, an important strategy worth mentioning at this point,
is authenticity at the personal level. This is different for everyone. You achieve it by harnessing your
personality and conviction, the natural strengths that sit within your authentic self. You can make classes
and presentations engaging in your own way, which may not involve being highly animated.

   Finally, it is important to mention here that we should aim to treat students as up and coming
professionals from the outset. For example, we can draw links to the rewarding aspects of a profession
which they can expect to encounter and experience. In this way we can help them develop their own sense
of career identity and overall sense of purpose and belonging. This also helps to sustain them through the
duration of their studies.

Conclusion

Microlearning refers to the delivery of learning content in short and succinct chunks or units.
Microlearning design involves reducing and condensing large quantities of information into bite-sized
units of learning. Its purpose is to reduce learner fatigue, overload and associated stress and thus encourage
greater engagement and knowledge retention, which increases learning performance and resulting rates of
completion.

   The purpose of this book is to provide educators interested in adopting and applying microlearning
with a practical resource to do this. This chapter introduced the rationale for using microlearning and key
tenets for understanding its design, information important for those wanting to apply it in developing and
refining their curriculum.

   It is helpful to think of microlearning as a menu of learning and engagement principles and practices
which can be combined powerfully to enhance teaching and its resulting learning experiences and
outcomes. How you go about choosing and applying these depends on the nature of your subject area,
student cohort, type of curriculum, your teaching style, and the expertise you have when starting.

   As a set of principles rather than a set of technical procedures or rules with precise and specific steps
to be followed, you interpret and apply it using your own judgement, common sense, abilities you have
developed and all you know about teaching. There is no need to adopt and apply all the techniques
available for every lesson; but rather, choose combinations you think may work well for specific situations.

REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

Introduction

The core strategy underpinning microlearning is to increase learner engagement by reducing barriers to
learning. Increasing learner engagement is a proven pathway for increasing learner outcomes and accounts
for microlearning's success (Kamel, 2018; Kapp & Defelice, 2019; Torgerson, 2021).

   Volume overload, and perceptions of high volume are at the forefront of why learners find learning
difficult, (and even the prospect of learning on first encountering materials overwhelming), make learning
look unappealing and demotivating. Lifeload demand pressures, like: part and fulltime work, family and
caring responsibilities etc. also add to the load and overall stress learners have to deal with in learning
(discussed in Chapter 1).

   A central design principle in microlearning is `less is more' - as a mindset to reduce cognitive load
in learning and the anxiety it brings. While cognitive overload is an impediment to information
comprehension, absorption and attracting interest, it also adds to the difficulty of being able to see the value
and relevance of the content being covered, and this can lead to disengagement.

   Microlearning seeks to address these barriers to engagement with its focus on optimising instructional
design to help make learning resources and experiences more attractive and engaging for students by
reducing volume in content based on relevance and practical value.

   Reviewing content to reduce volume in learning materials like written modules (often called course
guides or lecture or notes), along with set readings and video resources, is a good place to make a start. If
you are able, to begin by reviewing course learning objectives, better still. Or, one step further, reviewing
whole degree program objectives, or the objectives of a Major in a program.

   But in all cases, we can use the following kind of question to guide us through our review of materials:

  · Do the learning objectives and content fit current industry and educational requirements?

These content reduction and selection principles are also applicable when developing new courses and
curriculum.

Constructive alignment

Constructive alignment is an approach to learning design that helps ensure consistency between learning
20 | REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

objectives, course content and assessment (Biggs & Tang, 2011). We can also draw on it as an approach to
help us audit courses so that we can remove objectives that are no longer relevant and add new and up-to-
date objectives where needed.

   Auditing learning objectives involves ensuring continued alignment with the current needs and
demands of industry (i.e., industry alignment), as well as Higher Education (HE) e.g., quality compliance.

                                              Constructive alignment

   As a starting point, we can think about constructive alignment by contrasting it with its opposites:
 1. courses with imprecise, unclear or ambiguous learning objectives
 2. content that is not aligned with stated learning objectives and assessment
 3. content that is not industry aligned
Once learning objectives have been bedded down, do not stray, keep content within the stated course
objectives. Keep in mind, our goal is to reduce unnecessary load.
   Reviewing and streamlining content involves running frequent checks to make sure that the content
matches the stated learning objectives. This then follows through to assessments to ensure consistency with
assessments. Quality design means all components are matched and fit together. Course learning objectives
(CLOs) should also be included in assessment instructions and in assessment marking criteria.
   Relevancy or value can also be included in assessment instructions but kept brief and partitioned
to avoid unnecessary overloading and diverting of attention for learners trying to interpret assessment
instructions.
   Having CLOs in Marking Criteria forms, also helps close the loop in constructive alignment in ensuring
consistency and congruency between CLOs, course content, assessment design and instructions, and the
marking criteria used to grade assessments (see Marking Criteria Rubric, below).

Note, marking rubrics often include feedback built-in with detail on level of performance on criteria. In
doing so they provide guidance on areas where further development could strengthen the quality of work.

   Marking and feedback are a `bottom-line' matter, for educators as a measure of learning performance, and
also for students.

   AUDIT QUESTION: Is the design of this assessment appropriate and reliable for assessing knowledge and
abilities as stated in the learning objectives and required for professional performance?

Selection and reduction: relevancy and practical
value

My success in teaching has been based on relevancy and practical value, which has a natural and logical
fit with microlearning. Reduce content with selection based on usefulness to students in relation to value
and practicality for: employability; professional work competencies and for producing quality assessments.
This helps in aligning content, optimising learner relevance and managing cognitive load. It also makes it
easer to answer a student who asks, `Why do I need to know this?`

   We can start reduction of content, module by module, and then follow through to the other learning
resources, like reducing set readings and videos.

Core criteria for retaining and selecting content based on relevance and practical value:
     · Employability: building industry-relevant proficiency: e.g. PR work performance,
        strengthening employability.
     · Assessment: aiding learners to produce high quality assessments in efficient ways.
               REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT | 23

Employability

The criterion of employability divides into subcategories of (a) technical knowledge, including skills
specific to a profession (or discipline), then (b) job specific transferable-based skills and knowledge, these
are transferable to a degree, but also specific to a given industry or profession, and then (c) generic
transferable skills, which are more general and applicable across professions. Employers today prioritise
these competencies to the level `essential' in recruiting and selecting employees. This boosts their relevancy
to curriculum.

   The term `graduate attributes` is also used to refer to transferable skills and knowledge competencies
that are linked to, and aligned with, employability - and used in HE institution quality assurance required
by government. Graduate attributes are largely derived from studies into employability that involve input
from employers and graduates working in industry (Chan et al., 2017; Suleman, 2018).

   Summing up, employability areas can be divided into the follow categories.

 Technical profession-specific: profession-based knowledge and skills
 Transferable job-specific: general skills and knowledge, that are highly specific to a profession
 Transferable generic: general skills and knowledge that are widely applicable across industries

  or employment broadly and for life and career success
 Career and employability curriculum: inclusion of career literacy is increasing

Profession specific technical skills and knowledge

This section outlines technical and transferable skills in the public relations discipline area as an illustration
of the considerations that need to be made when reviewing learning objectives and retaining and selecting
content based on relevance and practical value. In the case of public relations, professional technical
knowledge for public relations includes being able to create written content in ways that are specific to the
profession, for example, writing in styles that are suitably journalistic, (e.g., ordering information according
to its importance), and in styles that are publishable and suited to a variety of specific media (e.g., media
releases, social media posts). Skills and knowledge in being able to use current platforms and applications
for producing outputs are essential, including writing in Word Press and Adobe InDesign in place of
Microsoft Word, and competence in using Adobe Illustrator for graphics. Competency with platforms
required for disseminating outputs is also essential. So is the continuing importance of social media and
keeping up to date with proficient use of social media, so much so, that this is now well embedded
throughout the curriculum in public relations.

   Profession based skills and knowledge also include the theoretical knowledge that employers expect
graduate practitioners to hold. In the case of public relations, theoretical knowledge employers consider
24 | REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

essential includes Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR), and theory on Stakeholder Engagement and
related practices e.g., Two-Way Symmetric Communication and Mutual Benefit decision-making
principles (Eggensperger & Salvatore, 2022; Smith, 2022).

Critical `threshold' content

Critical and threshold are high priority content areas in microlearning design, the knowledge and skill areas
essential for competence in profession and discipline, and, for progressing with study in an area. Formal
writing for assignments, especially, essays and long form writing, is common area of difficulty among my
public relations students. So, I cover essay and long form writing as a priority area of need by presenting
students with the most common pitfalls people encounter when writing essays and how to avoid these by
guiding students through step-by-step planning methods to help them stay on track and write efficiently
(as shown in essay learning design in Chapter 4).

   Microlearning design can also be used in other discipline areas, for example, to address critical
mathematics skills and knowledge, by breaking complex processes down into smaller steps to allow
students to build their capacity and make complex processes more achievable in areas where students
experience more difficulty (Alias & Razak, 2024; Chamorro-Atalaya et al., 2024; Wijaya et al., 2022).

   We can determine these high priority areas in course reviews to identify, and take into account, common
struggle points. We should also look out for, and include where needed, necessary and expected prerequisite
knowledge. We can begin by gathering intelligence in course audits and reviews including from student
feedback and our experiences in running the course.

   Tackling common struggle points or deficits can then be addressed by integrating `support-designed'
content and skill development into courses to help overcome these stumbling blocks and minimise their
flow-on effects. Putting these kinds of measures in place can save lecturers and students a great deal of time
and angst, which makes for a good return on investment.

Profession specific transferable skills and knowledge

Transferable skills and knowledge required for professional competency in public relations include being
able to write well. Dimensions of public relations writing include: writing in informative-story form;
writing clearly, concisely and precisely; writing in ways that is easy to read and understand; writing in
ways that appeal to general and target audiences; and demonstrate mastery of grammar and punctuation.
Then, in addition to these professional-practice based ways of writing, more formal and academic forms of
writing, like essay writing, become useful because they help students build and integrate an array of skills,
such as conducting research, gathering and arranging information, and applying logic for case building,
which are useful for and can be applied in professional work, that is, they have high levels of transferability.

   Many employers of public relations graduates, believe essay writing provides students with valuable
practice and preparation in learning how to write well and to do so in extended forms that are often
required, for example, case building for campaign proposals, evaluation reports, and long-form magazine
style prose for feature articles (Johnston & Glenny, 2021; Macnamara, 2018; Mahoney, 2017).
                                                                                                   REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT | 25

Generic level transferable skills and knowledge

Transferable skills and knowledge at this more general level are given high priority in HE education
program design today. Global employer surveys across all disciplines identify generic transferable skill areas
as critically important (Pennington & Stanford 2019; Quacquarelli Symonds, 2019; World Economic
Forum [WEF], 2018). This is also reflected in graduate job selection criteria where they are commonly
classified as essential. Employers often refer to these as `employability skills'.

   Commonly include:

  · problem-solving

  · critical thinking and analysis

  · adaptability

  · interpersonal skills

  · teamwork (ability to cooperate, negotiate, coordinate, lead and motivate).

My recent research with public relations employers (Kossen et al., 2025) revealed that they rate transferable
skill and knowledge areas more highly than profession specific skills and knowledge. Why is this the case?

   Research also shows that the majority of those employing graduates, (including employers of public
relations graduates), view generic transferable skill areas as more durable i.e., longer lasting, than those
in the technical or profession specific domain, due to the shorter shelf-life of profession specific skills
and knowledge areas (Macnamara, 2018; Olesen et al., 2021). The lifespan of a good deal of specific
professional `know-how' knowledge is shortening at a faster pace as the pace of change continues to
accelerate. Public relations employers involved in my recent graduate employability study stressed that they
themselves found keeping up to date with change a struggle (Kossen et al., 2025).

   Of note, public relations employers identified independent learning (interchangeable terms include life-
long learning, self-directed learning) at the top of their priority list in recruitment decision-making. They
felt that the ability to be able to learn independently gives those entering industry the ability to adapt and
keep up with change. Independent learning is a higher order transferable skill which incorporates subset
transferable skill components, like critical thinking and analysis and problem-solving.

   Public relations employers also viewed emotional skills, especially enthusiasm and eagerness to learn, as
playing a critical role in an employee's capacity for learning, adaptability and keeping pace with change. For
example:

      They can't be expected to come in and know everything, but if they want to learn and grow then that is the most
           important thing of all because skills can be learned by those that have this attitude. That is why it is so
                                            important. (Public Relations Employer)

Employers viewed these traits as ultimately more important than being across all profession specific
26 | REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

knowledge areas, because these can be acquired by employees who have a well instilled willingness to
learn. For these reasons employers of public relations graduates (Kossen et al., n.d.) stressed that it is very
important for educators today to place a great deal of focus on developing these general `transferable'
capacities as a part of the curriculum for meeting industry and employability needs.

   My colleague Michael Howard (University of Southern Queensland) and I provide an overview on
the nature and the role of generic level transferable skills in education in PODCAST EPISODE 4 from
`Communicating for Success` (audio; 6'26"; CC-BY). Public relations work, as a profession example,
involves dealing with and relating to people and communities and this requires interpersonal skills that help
facilitate cooperation, negotiation and managing conflicting priorities between parties tactfully. These skill
areas, often called `people skills', overlap with life skills. People draw on these to manage their lives, e.g.,
to manage personal relationships like friendships. They are transferable, they have high applicability for
professional settings and relationships.

Career and employability learning curriculum (CEL)

Employers today expect graduates to be able to demonstrate the value of their transferable skills with
evidence of their ability to apply these to work-type situations, for example, interpersonal and problem-
solving skills feature strongly in position descriptions and selection criteria. However, many graduates and
job seekers have great difficulty in communicating and demonstrating the value of their achievements and
abilities in relation to these selection criteria within their profession (Bridgstock, 2009; OECD, 2019).
Accordingly, I incorporated Career and Employability Curriculum (CEL) in recent years to further
strengthen employability in public relations teaching. It is an example of microlearning content selection
based on relevance and practical value.

     Case study: The impact of an employability focused curriculum on a final year course

     CEL has proved to be highly and particularly successful in the case of my final-year level course,
     Organisational Communication and Culture, which has a CEL focus on transition to employment.
     CEL curriculum adopted in this course was designed to assist learners in preparing themselves
     to maximise their employability (i.e., attractiveness to employers) with timely and effective
     transition into employment, and ideally, into employment for which they are well-suited. Skill
     and knowledge content incorporated into the course included: how to generate evidence for
     individual employment portfolios, undertaking occupational research and scanning, addressing
     selection criteria as well as professional networking and profile marketing (e.g., LinkedIn
     profiles). These topics and skills areas were built into course assessments to provide students
                                                                                                   REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT | 27

     with opportunities to apply their learning on these topics in relation to their individual
     circumstances and benefit further from constructive feedback provided.
     The course has consistently rated very highly with students since incorporating microlearning
     and the CEL employability initiative in 2019 and was well received by the ten employers
     consulted to evaluate the curriculum (see USQ 2022, Teaching Excellence Showcase Poster link/
     QR code below). Feedback revealed that students were very pleased with the quality of the
     curriculum and valued the curriculum for its opportunity to learn and apply practical skills and
     knowledge which prepares them for a smoother transition into employment.

           It was really helpful having it come from the university, that they wanted to support you with
           that transition rather than just sort of finishing up... then it almost feels like you're being kicked
           out on your bum. (Public Relations Student)

     The CEL employability initiative was supported through obtaining USQ Excellence in Teaching
     grant funding. I have included this case example because it clearly involves microlearning and is
     a good demonstration of what is possible and can be achieved with microlearning. I have used it
     here to demonstrate and inspire, not overwhelm.
     View: Teaching Excellence Showcase Poster 2022.

Assessment

Selecting content based on its usefulness to students for producing quality assignments and assessments
aligned to course objectives is an obvious and effective way to approach not only reduction, but also
increasing and ensuring high relevancy content for learners. Assessments are of utmost importance in
learning. They are the measure we use to determine pedagogical effectiveness and learning performance.
They are very much the `bottom-line' for students and for educators. Assessments are at the centre of both,
providing and assessing professional preparation for students, and hence highly relevant and practical,
in developing professional work competency and future employment. This shows how microlearning
design incorporates constructive alignment principles to ensure assessments meet profession competency
requirements, and how the criterion of employability is used to guide content selection and reduction.

   Relevance linking should also be included in the instruction section for each assessment by providing
explanations that make the practical value of an assessment explicit by in relation the role it plays in
developing valuable and essential skills and competencies for success in given industry or profession/s.

   As mentioned earlier, we should also make these links frequently in course modules as well as in lectures,
classes and presentations. A point to note here, is that while microlearning design is largely about reducing
volume, by removing unnecessary redundancy, e.g., repetition - strategic or well-placed redundancy plays
an important role in keeping learning focused. Relevance linking, is a prime example, linking to relevance
and benefits of material being covered, frequently (yet not too frequently). We use repetition strategically
28 | REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

because it helps learners keep focused and engaged and we rely on our judgement to achieve optimal
balance.

   This video segment from `Microlearning presentation` 2022 (4'00"; CC-BY), discusses reducing volume
in content.

Decluttering

In combination with relevance and practical value, the idea of decluttering is a useful way to think about
and approach reduction. For instance, in helping guide decisions (a) source some shorter reading resources
and (b) dispense with resources that do not seem necessary or of low importance. Reviewing your course
is a great opportunity for decluttering for `spring-cleaning' refreshing.

   It is worth pausing for thought here, the majority of us, as educators, have a tendency to write too much
when writing modules (course notes) and so they become unnecessarily high in volume. While we're trying
to pack in as much value as possible for our students, it is one of the biggest pitfalls in writing learning
content, believing that `more is more'. While the intention is good, we create overload and clutter, and this
reduces value, rather than adding to it. Our own mindfulness and vigilance about this is our best defense
against this common pitfall. This points also helps demonstrates the importance of adopting microlearning
as a `perspective' when developing learning materials. It is a perspective that helps us see that pruning
material is usually necessary, or at least, beneficial.

   Reducing and decluttering involves reviewing module content and learning resources critically and try
to approach them more objectively, with fresh eyes. The questions below are focused on course readings
to help demonstrate a process, the kinds of questions used here can be applied to other learning materials
such as videos.

       These questions can help guide thinking and focusing for decluttering set
       readings:

            · Is this reading necessary?
            · Is it relevant enough? Is it critical, is it valuable enough?
                                                                                                   REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT | 29

            · Would removing this reading reduce course quality and learning needs?
            · Do I need to retain the whole chapter as a reading, or could I just specify which pages

               are relevant?
            · Would summarising key points from a reading be effective?
            · Is there a better reading available? - a clearer, more concise, less unnecessarily

               complex reading available?

Students are much more likely to read set readings if we confine them to one or two short readings.
Content curation plays an important role in our profession as educators. We are always looking out for
stimulating, interesting and highly relevant resources, and the shorter the better, whether they be readings,
videos or podcasts. Sourcing peer assistance or collegial opinion in searching for and deciding on course
resources is worth considering, another could be to invite students to help identify resources, this can also
help increase engagement.

     Criteria for selecting video learning resources

            · Videos that are as short as possible (micro)
            · Attention-attractive (interesting)
            · Relevant and value-adding (with learning objectives in mind)
            · Comprehensible: clear, concise, precise, effective in conveying information (easy to

                understand explanations, demonstrative examples)
            · Provide specific time segments that learners should view when using longer videos

Decluttering: slides

In addition to writing and presenting written modules, we should apply decluttering principles to our
30 | REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

lectures and slides. Reducing, so there are fewer points on any single slide and take opportunities to reduce
text, dot points typically work better than sentences and paragraphs. Also aim to use fewer slides when
planning a presentation, but avoid doing so at the expense overcrowding slides, it is better to spread content
out. Take opportunities to replace or reduce text with graphics, graphs and tables, for example, can be
powerful conveyers of information. Infographics can also convey ideas more effectively and can also be used
to make slides crisp, clear and uncluttered.

Infographics

Graphic visual representations of information, data, or knowledge intended to present information quickly
and clearly. These can improve cognition by utilizing graphics to enhance the human visual system's ability
to see patterns and trends.

        Simple icons (below): Heart (icon) Hand (caring) Clock (time management) Cognitive load

   Infographics and graphics can bring many benefits, e.g., attract attention and add appeal, if we avoid too
many on one slide, otherwise they too become clutter. Graphics can be also used to help break up text, and
large blocks of text. But when overused they become distracting and add to load rather than ease it.

   While not wanting to undermine the power of graphics, they are not always necessary, for example, I
often present with dot points only. However, formatting for visual appeal and for ease of readability, like,
choice of slide styles and backgrounds, choice of type-fonts and line spacing are all important. Managing
these kinds of elements efficiently is often best achieved by keeping things plain and simple. Dot points on
a white background can work well. Simple variance, like changes to backgrounds, can keep presentations
fresh, for little effort.

   Litmus test questions to ask ourselves when we design slides and arrange content include:

  · `Are they easy to read and understand?'
  · `Are they attractive or unattractive?'
  · `Are they cluttered?'
                                                                                                   REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT | 31

Chapter 3 and 4 examine use of graphics as a part of multimedia design in more detail, from those that
decorative to those that are more directly illustrative, such as graphs. These can all be useful, and they can
all be overused. Hence, the self-check questions remain useful when trying to assess whether your graphics
are adding or subtracting from ease of understanding and the learning experience.

Accessibility

  · Logical heading structures - use headings and subheadings sequentially
  · White space - don't overcrowd content
  · Alt-text for images (the description of an image)
  · Clear colour contrast
  · Closed captions and transcriptions for multimedia

Increasing accessibility by adopting accessibility features/or protocols can be kept in mind and added
further down the microlearning design path.

Accessibility: universal design for learning (UDL)

Students expectations of design are increasing, expectations that courses follow good design logic, that they
use frameworks such as universal design for learning (UDL), so that they are provided with a consistent and

well-structured learning journey. Center for Applied Special Technology (CAST) has identified
a series of principles to guide design, development, and delivery in practice:

  · Multiple means of engagement
  · Multiple means of representation
  · Multiple means of action and expression
32 | REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Examples

       Multiple means of engagement
                      Explicitly state learning goals and easy to relate to examples
                      Give opportunities to celebrate
                      Provide opportunities for discussion and reflection

       Multiple means of representation
            · Provide content in multiple ways: such as text, audio cast, video, e.g. short lecturer
               `overview` videos, audio casts and diagrams, in addition to written text

       Multiple means of action and expression

            · Provide access to resources to deepen learning
            · Interactive learning activity: all presentations and classes
            · Include a variety of communication options
            · Provide opportunities to review content or practice skills

Accessibility with modular design

Modular design is already a common practice convention in education where content for courses is
segmented into units of learning called modules. Written content and instruction are organised by topics,
similar in approach to chapter formatting in books. Modules contain key content and guide learners
through sequenced learning resources including a<>ctivities. They are sometimes referred to as lecture
notes. The importance of keeping content volume manageable, which is the topic of this chapter, cannot
be overstated. It is something we need to keep working at. Volume `blow out' is an ever-looming risk. It pays
to keep more is less in mind, always.

   Based on my observations, it has been common to segment courses into about five modules where
students study individual modules over two or three weeks. Segmenting modules into week-by-week units
of learning is better. It provides greater clarity and consistency in contain units of learning and volume.

   Keeping modules as short as possible, a two-to-five-page range is best where practical. Remember, the
                                                                                                   REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT | 33

goal in microlearning design is to increase engagement by increasing appeal. To increase the likelihood of
students reading modules and materials with the appeal of conciseness and ease of reading load.

Conclusion

Volume overload, and perceptions of high volume (volume shock) are at the forefront of reasons why
learners find learning, and the prospect of learning, overwhelming, and as a result unappealing.

   Microlearning content reduction seeks to address cognitive overload and the stress it brings by reducing
volume to make study more manageable, appealing and relevant.

   Reducing volume involves retaining content based on relevance and practical value for (1) work and
employability and (2) successful completion of assessments to support and increase success in study -
as ways to keep learners interested and motivated in their learning. Further reducing volume involves
decluttering by removing overly long or complex explanations. Clear and direct `to-the-point`
communication of information plays an important role in reducing cognitive load.

   Packaging content in smaller, more manageable chunks, makes learning less demanding and as a result
more accessible, and helps alleviate the pressures of the high-volume information world and competing
lifeload demands facing many learners today.

       Key points
       Reduce volume: select/retain content on relevance and practical value, based on:

            · equipping students to meet industry needs (industry alignment)
            · equipping students for success in assessments

       Drawing on constructive alignment to ensure alignment with clear and well-focused
       learning objectives, that are consistent with the design of course content, practice learning
       activities and assessments.
       Relevance linking frequent highlighting of benefits of content and skills being developed.
       This is an important strategy for attracting student engagement and learning effectiveness.
       Decluttering: to further reduce cognitive load and increase engagement

            · Streamlining of content with modular design - by segmenting content into
                manageable modules

            · Review and aim for ease of readability and understanding with direct, clear, concise
34 | REDUCING AND REVIEWING CONTENT

                and focused materials

            · Simplify explanations and remove unnecessary words

            · Review and aim for optimum balance with text and visuals, including presentation-

                slides

Reducing and refining content and ensuring alignment and relevance and practical value, enhances
information assimilation, it provides both educators and learners with a route to enhanced educational
experiences.

PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

Introduction

Microlearning is about designing learning content and delivery in ways that optimise cognitive load.
Chapter 2 focused on reducing overall volume of content. This chapter tackles cognitive load barriers with
emphasis on attentional resources, especially working memory, i.e., processing capacity, with a focus on bite
sizing time-lengths, or durations of learning sessions to try and optimise these. The focus on cognitive load
reduction here turns to ways we can produce and segment learning sessions and recordings of these, e.g.,
lectures and classes, into easy to digest instalments.

   Microlearning draws on multimedia design principles to produce `short form' learning materials that
are compact and interconnected to improve learning by allowing learners to process information more
effectively in small step-by-step units (Alias & Razak 2024; Mayer, 2019; Tufan, 2021). Bite-sizing delivery
into instalments is used to reduce cogitative load in the learning process (Gobet, 2005; Kamel, 2018;
Sweller, 2010), especially helpful for those studying online. Our aim is to make online learning resources,
like recorded lectures, seem less overwhelming and more manageable, and as a result more attractive and
engaging.

Pedagogical and mechanical processes for producing
recordings

Media Production

  · Producing content presentation and learning sessions suitable for recordings
      (recordings which go on to serve as learning resources)

Variety in media

  · Video recorded learning sessions, voiceover slides auto-play format, still slides
  · Demonstration styled videos, animation videos, podcasts
  · Include graphic and visual elements
38 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

Skills and Equipment

  · Production skills required for recording and editing are easily attainable

  · Equipment needed is readily accessible

I think you will find the journey to becoming a media producer of your own teaching and delivery,
rewarding and enjoying, once you get going.

Micro delivery

In designing course home pages, make ease of access to learning materials noticeable from the moment
learners enter, and that they can view and listen to recorded presentations and learning resources in short
bite-sized segments. Presenting learning resources in an attractive and accessible way enhances the appeal
of the learning from the very beginning. It is a strategy that helps address the challenge of students feeling
overwhelmed by lengthy content. It provides a more inviting and appealing learning environment.

   When they arrive at the course homepage learners should be able to immediately see an orderly
sequencing of learning activities e.g., Lecture 1: Part 1 with topic and time length in title. They can switch
onto the recordings at any time of day or night when they have some spare time, whether they're waiting
for a bus, doing some exercise, or have just put their kids to bed. It allows learners to individually plan and
manage their time in ways that suit their circumstances.
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 39

An example of microlearning design in the learning management system (LMS), in this case, Moodle.

Having audiovisual at the centerpiece of delivery by providing easy to access audiovisual learning resources
is an important step in making content appear more appealing accessible and equitable to students.

   In the case of micro-lectures or content presentations, they are primarily informational as the purpose
is to communicate key content knowledge such as concepts, principles, and theories. We can illustrate
concepts and principles by including examples and case studies that demonstrate applicability and
stimulate student interest. Another important strategy is use of clear, to-the-point communication.
Guided by `less is more', means we should always be striving to convey points and information as concisely
and directly as possible to minimise unnecessary and avoidable cognitive load. These are points worth
keeping in mind as we now move to steps involved in producing audiovisual based learning delivery.

   Learning delivery typically commences with a lecture style presentation of a unit of content that is
recorded and segmented into instalments of two to three bite-sized learning resources that are between 5 to
15 minutes in length. If a topic requires a longer time frame and presentation can be kept interesting, e.g.
inherent nature of topic, delivery dynamics) that is justifiable. However, the key point with microlearning
still holds, delivery should more often be in the form of short bite-sized instalments. This is key feature that
marks microlearning as a distinct shift away from the traditional one hour long-form lectures. Bite-sizing
is the way to make online lectures and recordings more attractive and convenient, noting that on campus
students today also expect access to online recordings.

   Because microlearning is learner centred and thus focused on increasing student engagement in the
process of their own learning, it is important that we build in opportunities for learners to engage and
participate with appealing and purposeful activities. Learning activities are an essential component in
40 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

online learning, presentation-based delivery of information, and interactive classes, such as tutorials,
workshops, and labs. (Activities and exercises covered in detail Chapter 4)

Pre-recording content delivery: lectures, presentations

A common method, for producing lectures and presentations is to record voice-overs to accompany slide
presentations. Voice recordings can take place in a work office or at home and the process is relatively
simple, you're probably doing recordings like this already. I continue to use voiceover slides as a main-
stay method because it gives high level control over content including wording and time-lengths for the
learning resource being produced. Once voice-overs are recorded, that can be embedded into slides, and
then converted from slide-show to video-play format.

   However, there can be drawbacks with the recording voice-over for slides option. It can be time
consuming, especially for those who encounter difficulty in adjusting to the seemingly void and unfamiliar
world of voice recording. Then, a common challenge people encounter is being able to deliver an `easy to
listen to' style of voice. This is mainly due to the absence of an audience whose facial and body language
features give instant feedback. I was caught by surprise myself with this, like many others, I found it difficult
to break out of a `robotic' voice. A listenable voice is one that includes fluctuating intonations, stress on
certain words and pacing that creates a rhythm that adds to ease of listening.

   Do not become too surprised or disheartened if you encounter hurdles when starting with voice
recording. There are ways to manage it. Vocal aesthetics are important for attracting and sustaining interest.
Experimentation, with trial and error, is a good way to fast track your search for a natural, relaxed tone the
one that feels authentic to you. You will know when you find it by listening to playbacks. It is important
listen to recordings one minute in, to see if you are satisfied with the way you are sounding and as a check
for any technical glitches e.g. making sure the microphone is correctly. This is a valuable time saving tip, to
avoids frustrations of having to delete and re-record sizable recordings.

             My early experience with recording

                My focus on presentation and delivery was on information content with precision and
                direct and easy to understand explanations. And also, including supporting high
                relevance examples. These hallmarks of microlearning design ticked a lot of boxes in
                what makes for high quality teaching practice. However, after a while I realised that
                by focusing overly on information quality, I was falling short. The missing ingredient
                was vocal dynamics to achieve an easy-to-listen to voice. I wish I would have gotten
                onto this earlier because it makes a big difference. I was also puzzled about the
                difficulty I was having transferring my public speaking ability to recordings.
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 41

You can choose and experiment from tips listed that follow, to find out what works well for you, and try
any others you may think of. Tips and approaches include, but are not limited to, limbering up before
recording or psyching up or imagining a class or audience. Another approach, to consider is inviting a co-
presenter to make contributions or delivering and recording presentations live as it can facilitate
enhancement of your own vocal dynamics and overall dynamics with an additional voice.

     Voice recording tips

            · Sound check recordings one minute in to identify and address any audio issues
                quickly.

            · Voice experimentation use trial and error recording and listening to playbacks.
            · Consider standing, moving, and gesturing during recordings, or even walking while

                speaking. There is a variety of mobile device options available to help with this.
            · Try reading from written scripts, it can make it easier to focus on voice delivery for

                some. Also, teleprompter (free software), but it can take a while to get used to.
            · Try recording using video conferencing applications to record with your image

                displayed. I have found visual cues helpful for overcoming monotonous delivery.
            · Collaborative recording: Invite someone to join in and help you with some vocal

                contributions via video conferencing platform. Voice file recordings can then be used
                for slide presentation. You also have the option of providing them with some
                questions they can ask to prompt responses you can provide.
            · Invite guest speaker, or co-presenter to co-present with you. You can include slides
                and record on video conferencing platform. In this case, it is a good idea to record
                with cameras turned on so students can see presenters while watching the slides.
42 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

The co-presenting option can work very well and segues into the topic that follows `Variation and novelty:
presentation styles and formats' for adding value to delivery and thereby the overall learning experience.

   However, there are some aspects of recordings that do not need to be pristine when considering audio
quality. Background sounds, unless loud or disruptive, or particularly irritating, tend not to impact on lease
of listening, so mild car and traffic sounds and bird calls are usually fine. The key litmus test question for
audio quality is to ask: `Is it easy to listen to?' But if audio quality is poor to the point where it is not easy to
hear or listen to, you may need to re-record. A second option could be using audio enhancement features
in recording software. That aside, a natural and relaxed sounding voice usually works well, this is because
it tends to produce a warm conversational tone, which students prefer because they find it `relatable' and
personal (Kossen & Ooi, 2021).

   Vocalised fillers like ums and aahs are fine as they can add to the conversational style learners find more
relatable, so I leave some of these in. But if they are too frequent, they become distracting and detract from
ease of listening, in which case they should be edited out. Auto removal functions for removing unwanted
sounds like umms and aarrhs are becoming standard in editing software, making their removal easy. It is
worth noting that people generally overlook the power they hold to leverage their own individual voice
qualities and natural aspects of the way they speak as a means for increasing ease of listening and thereby
relatability. However, good presenters tend to be more aware of this.

Variation and novelty: presentation styles and formats

Vocal tone and style

Providing learners with variety and variation in vocal tone and style can play a key role in attracting and
maintaining interest, because it helps breakdown monotony in voice presentations by adding vibrancy
through vocal dynamics. I have also found varying style between formal and informal is one good way to
increase impact through variety. I draw on or include a more formal style for lecture presentations, while
sticking to a more informal, conversational style, for short weekly introduction videos. I recommend using
a conversational style most often because it is an effective way of making information seem more welcoming
and relatable, and it helps create the feeling of lecturers talking directly to learners. It provides an inclusive
tone and sense of a more personal experience, one which helps break down the barriers of psychological
distance between learner and teacher. Nonetheless, keeping some variation between styles, remains effective
in creating impact and interest, largely because it provides learners variety.

Voice contributions for slides

Additional perspective and interest to a slide presentation and can be achieved with voice-overs for as
little as one or two slides. Interspersing guest voice contributions not only adds vitality, but further
increases relatability as well, is a way to add variety and interest to slide presentation is to invite a guest
to independently voice record some slides or sections. Asking a colleague or guest for vocal contributions
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 43

can improve ease of listening by breaking some of the monotony of having only one voice. This is not
something that you need to do for every class. Over time, you can add voice contributions from others in
years that follow. Including student voices is another option to consider and can also be used to create
opportunities for increasing student engagement, but a consent or `permission to use' form is advisable.

   Options for organising and facilitating voice contributions include:

  · providing colleague with word-for-word scripting, or

  · bullet points to indicate what you would like covered in slides chosen, or

  · provide interview style questions ahead of time, or

  · leave the wording of contributions to the discretion of your guest.

Providing colleagues with a script they can work for voicing slides can be an efficient and effective way
to achieve specific and desired impact when aiming for precision with tightly focused messaging, while at
the same time helping to keep demands on colleagues to a minimum. Producing scripts for voicing is a
`high control' approach that can work well when precision, clarity, brevity and impact are being sought.
The trade-off is it limits perspectives and ideas a colleague may be able to bring. However, there is room
for flexibility, you may opt for a combination of word-for-word scripting and guest input, and the added
option of negotiating input. But in any case, providing guidance helps ensure best results.

   The following lecture-type presentations lean more toward formal voice styles and tones because the aim
was to provide a sense of formality. Notice how the guest voice qualities are suited for formal and semi-
formal/conversational styles.

   The following examples demonstrate approaches ranging from formal to conversational presentation
styles.

     Activity: Your evaluation of the voiced recordings

     In this activity, we are focusing on presentation qualities in voice delivery rather than actual
     content. Reviewing the sample recordings provided above

         1. Consider what you feel are strengths and weaknesses of each recording. What elements
             are appealing, and what does not appeal?

         2. Do any of the approaches to voice delivery align the methods you use?
         3. Generate ideas inspired by the samples for future voice delivery strategies.
        4. Create a list of approaches you would like to trial and incorporate in your own recordings

             in the future.

Co-presenting voice recordings for slide presentations

Inviting a guest or colleague to join in and co-present in recording a slide presentation is another way
to add variation and vibrancy to lectures and presentations. It goes a step further than having voice-
over contributions for slides. Content delivery with a co-presenter can be transformative in helping make
presentations `come to life' with even greater synergies of energy and increased perspective. Co-presenting is
a commonly used format, we see it used in broadcast news, especially television, with the use of two news
anchor presenters to add vibrancy and breakdown monotony. It is an approach based on variation and
novelty as a way to maintain interest.

   This video is an example of co-presenting for micro-lecture, `Facilitating group processes for
participation at meetings and workshops' (video; 0'43"; CC-BY).

Co-presenting is a valuable tool in the microlearning toolkit and so I use it frequently. That said, having
variety across a course still works best, that is, having a mix of my voice only presentations, along with some
with guest voice contributions.

Recording live content: lectures, presentations

Recording presentations during live delivery is another good option, if circumstances allow, as many
lectures are recorded live either on campus or online, or a simultaneous combination of both where a
presentation is being delivered live on campus in a room, with access also open to online learners. This kind
of combined learning type context is quite common today, especially for institutions that have large cohorts
online and on campus.

   Live delivery recording helps overcome hurdles commonly encountered with voice-over recording for
slide presentations as we've discussed. This leaves us with the task of segmenting the recorded content into
bite-sized instalments, which will be covered shortly.

Advice on inviting guest contributors and co-presenters

My advice here is to keep microlearning principles in mind, strive to keep tasks easy, keep time and effort
demands as small as possible, and sell these positives to people when approaching them for contributions.
While one can provide co-presenters with fully scripted content, it can be easier to provide key points, or a
basic lesson plan or lesson slides.

   When asking for co-presenter contributions, be clear about what it is that you're wanting and that you
46 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

make the task easy for them. For example, for an in-class guest or co-presenting contribution (whether on
campus or online) you can explain that you are the one who is responsible for taking the lead and managing
the class. Asking for a twenty minute or even shorter appearance is another option.

   Finally, we can use payback principles which is offering `help in return' when we approach others
for contributions. Bonus benefits here, potentially, include spreading microlearning practices among
colleagues and beyond as well as greater collaboration and integration of cross disciplinary and
interdisciplinary curriculum.

   This video `Microlearning Presentation: Engagement: Variety and Novelty - `Co-presenting', (video:
1'05"; CC-BY) from 2022 presentation, covers points for keeping in mind when co-presenting.

Editing

Editing is not all that difficult and can be mastered quite quickly, with easy to use editing software readily
available. Tips for fast tracking getting started with editing, sourcing, and learning software, include seeking
help and guidance from colleagues who are already using editing programs, you can also make a start with
some online searches. You will need software for (1) audio editing (voice recordings for slides) and for (2)
video editing.

Videos can be recorded to screen by the camera built into your computer or can record on phone. I prefer
the computer screen camera for videos which feature me presenting to camera (i.e., `talking head'). If I
am presenting with slides, I use `share screen' so that I can include my physical presence. However, I avoid
slides in `welcome to course' and minimise using them in `introduction to week' recordings to foreground my
presence because this personalises the course experience for students. (covered in Chapter 5)
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 47

Video Production and Editing Software

1. Panopto is a very easy to use platform for editing videos of recorded lectures and classes. You can import
videos e.g., recorded on zoom, you can also record presentations directly to Panopto with computer screen
capture (webcam and microphone). I recommend Panopto because it makes video editing very easy, it also
makes managing and sharing videos to select audiences simple and easy. For example, you can also reuse
videos or sections of video in multiple courses and semesters. A free version can be downloaded if your
organisation is not using it. To preserve original copies and create separate segmented videos, use `Create
Full Copy' under `Manage' in Edit icon. For dividing recordings into three, duplicate three times and apply
section names.

   2. YouCut (free version available) is a user-friendly video editing app primarily for mobile devices. It
provides a range of editing features such as cutting, merging, adding music, filters, and text to videos.
YouCut is popular for its simplicity and accessibility, making it a convenient choice for quick editing tasks
on the go, especially on smartphones and tablets. It can be used to create videos that are easily accessible on
students' devices and an efficient way to produce and edit video recordings using readily available resources,
over highly professional production standards (Ooi, Kossen & Jamal, 2022).

   3. Animaker is a user-friendly animated video creation platform that empowers users to produce
animated videos without animation experience and skills. It includes a variety of templates, characters,
backgrounds, and music options. Animaker can be used to create visually appealing animations for a wide
range of purposes including educational content, marketing videos, and social media posts. It is popular
for its intuitive interface and versatility in making animated content accessible to creators with very little or
no experience. (A free version can be downloaded)

Video lengths and where to make cuts

Enhancing microlearning video production involves a focus on editing recordings to tailor content delivery
into digestible segments that promote engagement and interactivity. A practical initial step is to divide
recordings into manageable parts, deciding where these breaks should occur. This process allows one to
get a quick start, subsequent refinement can then proceed in later iterations with more detailed editing.
Determining ideal lengths for segments and how many segments, involves judgment based on

 1. your knowledge and expertise on content

 2. distinct subtopics covered within

 3. break points, to break-down / scaffold complexity

 4. your awareness of student struggle points.

Having microlearning principles in mind, to reduce cognitive overload and optimise learning and
48 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

information absorption, also help to guide us. Remember, cognitive overload is a major barrier to learning
because people's capacity for learning is constrained by volume, complexity, and attention span over time
durations. Microlearning design can help us reduce or limit the rates at which we exceed the cognitive
limitations of our learners (Clark & Mayer, 2016).

   Complex content often requires increasing scaffolding, for example, breaking down content into smaller
bursts (i.e., shorter instalments) and more detailed planning of sequencing content. Increasing the number
of video instalments here is a solution, rather than a problem. Increasing scaffolding is an effective and
often-used measure, such as, providing learners with more time and processing space to grasp their
understanding of critical concepts and content. Keeping all video segments short is generally best, because
makes them more attractive and reduces cognitive load.

          Having information and learning instruction, in person-like presented forms, available for
       students as video recordings, as resources for learning, is a big advantage for students. It is one that
       students themselves greatly appreciate, recordings have generated a great deal of positive feedback in
       the form of ratings and comments in courses where they have been trialled and used (e.g., Kossen &
       Ooi, 2021).

          Common among these are comments are benefits derived from being able to re-watch sections in
       recordings that deal with concepts and ideas they find difficult to understand. Feedback has shown
       that students benefit from being able to rewind, or track back and re-watch, sections they find more
       difficult to grasp. (Points similar, have also been made in relation to recorded classes).
   Editing plays another important role in microlearning design delivery. We can use reduction editing to
reduce the volume and the length of our recorded lectures and presentations. We can also apply it to live
recordings, as well as pre-recorded slide presentations to reduce excess volume e.g., where explanations are
unnecessarily long or repetition is unnecessary and not helpful. Undertaking this kind of editing work
becomes easy quite quickly, e.g., identifying the best places to make cuts. Microlearning principles of
clear and to the point communication come into play as we have the opportunity to edit out unnecessary
or distracting content. An obvious target is editing out presenters talking themselves through the
technicalities of getting share-screen up and running.
   We use our own judgement to decide which sections of a recording may not be `on-point' enough or
sufficiently valuable or interesting to escape the `cutting room floor'. These are professional judgements
you make based on your assessment of the value sections of the recording have for learners who come to
view it.
   A feature of class teaching (tutorials or workshops) is focus on student participation and interaction.
Hence, we design activities to encourage responses and interaction that occur in real time i.e.,
synchronously (covered in Chapter 4). Some of the conversations that occur during these activities can
help build rapport and reflection valuable for those participating at the time the class is being held.
However, some of these conversations and interactions are unnecessarily long for the online learner
audience.
   But also, keep balance in mind in terms of capturing and preserving natural flow and authenticity in
interactive learning processes, don't let obsession with reduction lead to over-cutting to the point where it
detracts a recording's value as a learning resource.
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 49

   A great deal of class or tutorial type teaching takes place online using video-conferencing platforms, this
is certainly the case for me. I push record to begin and then have a recording of the class afterwards. I then
edit the recording to volume and divide it into segments. But make sure you keep a copy of the original
recording in full, a backup in case of a technical glitch e.g., accidental deletion, file corruption. Finally,
remember to include time-lengths for segments as well as titles that indicate segment content.

     Elements of segmenting in structuring content and delivery

            · Segmenting delivery is not achieved by editing alone. We segment, both lecture type
                presentations and interactive type tutorials and workshops, when we're in the
                process of designing and structuring lessons or learning sessions. It is, therefore, a
                part of the chunking process and it makes decisions about where to cut-edit for
                splitting into microlearning instalments easier, especially for live recordings, like live
                class recordings.

            · Structure for delivery or lesson content for any given week typically involves several
                topics, also keep in mind each topic should include at least one activity in learning
                sessions, this includes lectures. Principally, we cut by topics, while also taking volume,
                complexity and time length into account. In practice, a ten-minute learning segment
                may consist of two or three subtopics, ideally, logically grouped e.g., are closely
                related.

            · A feature of class teaching (tutorials or workshops) is the focus is on student
                participation and interaction. Accordingly, we strategically design activities designed
                to encourage responses and interaction that occur in real time i.e., synchronously.

     Tips for video files and edit-cutting

            · Remember, check to ensure `recording' is in progress
            · Setting up in classroom or online: e.g. finding `share screen', asking can people see and
50 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

                hear you.
            · Responses and conversations that were enjoyable and maybe even useful `during

               class', but off track or less interesting or overly lengthy in the context of an optimally
                timed online resource.
            · Likewise the end of the class when you're making announcements, these will not be
                reusable (not evergreen) and be announced in a message or forum.
            · Keep a copy of the original recording in full. Backing up in case of a technical or some
                other glitch.

Evaluating your delivery when reviewing recordings

One of the great benefits of editing is that it forces you to watch your recordings and engage in reflective
practice. It is a great opportunity to review and critically evaluate your own teaching and improve it. I've
been able refine my teaching practices closer to the microlearning principle of `less is more' by keeping
explanations shorter, clearer and more direct, after noticing that some of my explanations were longer than
needed.

   This video `Microlearning Presentation: Recording and editing` (video, 2'21"; CC-BY), covers editing
recordings.

Variety and novelty in media Delivery

Approaches to microlearning design centre around making learning more engaging and applies to making
learning resources more attractive and interesting. Providing variety in media delivery helps to achieve this
by making it more dynamic as borne out in student feedback: `it makes study less boring' is a common
sentiment in evaluations for my courses.

   Students report many advantages with having access to recorded classes, including the flexibility and
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 51

convenience that mobile access offers. Many said they use video recordings as a way to listen to the content
when driving, travelling or walking and that it helped reinforces learning.

   Students also appreciate the ability to listen to recordings while engaged in activities like household
chores, which reinforces learning content. Microlearning enables multitasking opportunities like learning
on the go, aiding productivity with daily tasks. The freedom to move physically during learning sessions
is also valued as way to break up the sedentary (stationary) nature of study. Some students report that
they use the mobility opportunities of listening to move around and exercise as a way to help refresh
their concentration and prolong alertness. Students also responded favourably to audio-based delivery (e.g.,
podcasts, to be covered shortly).

   The fluidity in learning modalities benefits all learners but especially those with neurological conditions
and attention challenges e.g. ADHD. Multi-sensory content can facilitate ease of absorption as well as
deeper learning allowing learners to develop connections with spoken words, text and images (Clark &
Mayer, 2016).

Slide presentations (video playable, some standard format)

Again, having recorded playable media as a centrepiece of the learning experience plays an important part
in making learning more attractive and convenient. Converting voices slide presentations into video-play
format is a microlearning staple for presentation of content. One way to add variety in media format is to
provide some slide presentations as voiced slides, that is, without converting them to media play format. It
provides students with a variation in experience, where they step through slides one by one, I include voice-
overs most times, but occasionally provide slides only, because it is another simple way to add variety into
the learning experience.

   However, it is better to use media play files most often because they provide more conveniences,
including the option of listening without vision (like a podcast). Feedback shows that students appreciate
the conveniences of being able to listen to media files while driving, carrying out chores and other tasks.

Audiocast/podcast presentations

Another way to add variation and vibrancy it can bring is to include voice only recordings, now we're
getting into the area of podcast-type form. I have found two-minute audiocasts can work well to conclude
a module with a summary of key points as `takeaways' for the week. It can be be a good way to reinforce
critical points.

   In providing variety in learning resources, I also source podcasts, including episodes from my own
podcast Communicating for Success at chriskossen.com.me which accompanies a higher education
study skills textbook, I coauthor. These micro-sized (5 to 15 minute) podcasts are aimed at making
communication concepts and how to apply them and make them accessible e.g., by relating them to
everyday and real-to-life type situations. They are based on microlearning principles of a warm and relatable
conversational style with a variety of guests and a high relevance focus, that is on how to apply and benefit
52 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

from the ideas and concepts being covered. That people associate podcasts as a medium for relaxation is
also a point of attraction that makes them valuable as a learning resources pool.

   In addition to the benefits and conveniences with portability of audio learning already identified with
students using video recordings to listen to, e.g., movement, multitasking and allowing a break on the
eyes. Audio media takes a load off the needed for visual processing and reduce stress. Audio format also
helps engage the brain other ways, it allows learners to construct and visualise as a part of the information
absorption process which can improve comprehension and retention and build stronger mental
connections (Bernabe & Orero, 2020). An informative audio or podcast format is often more convenient
and inviting to re-listen to.

   While well selected visual display can greatly reduce cognitive load, it also adds sensory load and as such
can add to mental load as a drag on the senses. As an alternative, audio delivery has potential to better
engage attention and penetrate more deeply. This level of increased focus, `cut through', can come with the
one sensory mode audio brings.

   Consider, that there is less need for visual accompanied presentation when reliance on visuals for
understanding a topic in cases where visuals do not contribute significantly to understanding or help
reduce cognitive load.

Lecturer video presentations

These are short video presentations that feature the lecturer, some can feature a course tutor or instructor.
They not only provide variety in media and presentation style, they personalise and humanise the learning
experience for students. In addition to a short `welcome to course' video, I produce short `introduction to
module' videos for each week and `assessment how to videos' for each assessment. (Covered in Chapter 5, on
student supports)

Demonstration videos

Animation videos are often designed and used for demonstrating, but demonstrative videos are not
confined to animation. Demonstration videos are useful because they can be used to show students how
a process works. In public relations for example, demonstrating the process of composing a purposeful
Tweet for an employer organisation. Demonstration videos are popular in teaching areas like mathematics,
for example, solving an equation using a step-by-step method to demonstrate the application of principles
and procedures for example solving problems (i.e. worked-examples).

Animation and Artificial Intelligence generated videos

Animation videos, up to 3 minutes recommended, can be produced and then edited to condense. These
short micro size videos have been popularised as a medium in social media communities, they allow users
to share their experiences and ideas and life hacks, inspiring their use in education as a highly appealing way
to attract views.
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 53

   Animaker is an easy-to-use software that includes functions for: text, graphics, video animation and
audio that can be included into `scenes' to convey content in novel and appealing ways to help increase
engagement, aid comprehension and improving memory retention.

   AppyPie AI Animation Generator allows you to create animations at a high quality by typing
text descriptions into the AppyPie AI Animation Generator and then transferring the animated frames
generated into to the animation maker. Then there re are options to add music, sound effects and
voiceovers. The AI function can also transform static images into animations. Software, like Animaker and
AppyPie, are available in free version form, with options of upgrading to low-fee versions with increased
functionality.

   The `bells and whistles' of animation and animation videos are an option, not a requirement, so there is
no need to burden yourself. But having said this, AI continues to make the once complex task of producing
animation much easier.

   Animation can be incorporated with increasing ease into slides (e.g., PowerPoint). Animation has the
potential to significantly, and even powerfully, increase engagement-appeal, information absorption and
ease of learning. But keep in mind, we want to avoid spending too much time on time-consuming work
for too little return. Nonetheless, AI driven automation and animation technologies will continue to
transform the way education is designed and delivered at an increasing pace.

Video-play slide presentations which can be listened, in a similar way to podcast

Static slide presentation    students step through manually (voiced, or unvoiced)

Audiocast presentations      in style of podcasts, can also include sourced podcasts

Short lecturer videos        e.g., weekly welcome for each module
(support, promote interest)  e.g., `how to' guides for assessments

Demonstration videos         e.g., demo how to solve a maths problem
                             e.g., demo how to write a media release, tweet, or post

Animation & AI videos        e.g., a character in place of instructor or yourself
                             e.g., demo a process, method, (to aid understanding)

Graphics and imagery in multimedia design

Multimedia is a key feature in microlearning design, (therefore incorporated throughout) is based on the
idea that the demands of learning can be eased when it is broken into digestible chunks, and also
combined with variety in media and use of imagery to reduce reliance on dense text to boost absorption
54 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

(Clark & Mayer, 2016). Multimedia design offers benefits of multi-sensory learning, but the focus in this
section is on images or graphics. Images can ease and enhance information absorption if selected well. If
they are poorly selected, for example, overused, the effect is reversed, they detract absorption and add
unnecessary mental load. This is a good example of less is more.

     Types of graphics, each can be useful

       Cosmetic: can be used increase appeal or attract attention (e.g., eye catching) and can help
       make content appear more attractive, and at a subtle level cosmetic can include style of
       background in used in slides.
       Representation: visual representation to show shape of an object e.g., components of
       anatomy components or visualise a process e.g., a diagram that tries to show how
       combustion engines work.
       Connection: diagrams to show connections e.g., flow chart, map/mapping topics for a
       lesson
       Relational: to visually convey information and relationships, especially useful for conveying
       quantitative information with graphs e.g. using line graphs to represent income over the
       year, or pie graphs to show areas of expenditure by proportions. Graphs can be used
       represent groups of numbers in ways that make that information tangible and easily
       understood.

Using graphics and images

Cosmetic graphics can be used to good effect when used sparingly, but harnessing the signifying power of
the more functional graphics deserve greater attention, representation in visual form can be an effective way
to make phenomena tangible. A word of caution here, be careful not to fall into the mindset that graphics
need to be included on every slide.

   Images can also be used to attract attention, and in doing so can ease cognitive load, by providing
impressions that are more memorable then written text and easier to recall. Public Relations and
marketing, for example, use images to boost chances that information they distribute will not be discarded,
e.g., in media releases, social media posts. That companies and organisations commonly use logos to
visually represent themselves, bears out the power of imagery.

   Congruency: Ensure consistency between material being displayed both text and graphics and narration
often called congruence). Spoken explanations should match what is being displayed and the number
of words displayed on a slide should be kept as short as possible, point form mostly, sentences can be
                                                                                                PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY | 55

used when needed and an occasional paragraph can work well. While it is important to avoid overly or
unnecessarily long explanations speaking at some length to several dot points on a slide can still work well,
in which case keep the number of points on a slide to only a few.

       Design Tips

            · Point form is effective, limit number of words used on screen to a minimum
            · Remember, most often, to talk to points in the order they are displayed
            · Avoid narration or speaking that is unnecessarily long
            · Avoid speaking at length on individual slides (rather, spread points out)
            · Be careful of too much talking on points not on screen or not closely related enough

                to justify
            · Check-question: `Do the graphics contribute to effective conveying of information and

               ease of understanding?'
            · Keep in mind that graphics do not necessarily need to link directly to a concept to be

                effective, a cosmetic graphic can be effective if it helps attract interest.
            · Formatting is also effective for increasing visual appeal, like font type, spacing, colour,

                etc. While not wanting to undermine the power of graphics, they are not always
                necessary, I often present with dot points only, with minimal background or use of
                colour.

Conclusion

This chapter covered pedagogical and mechanical processes involved in producing recordings of content
delivery and interactive classes as learning resources. Editing is a primary way to reduce cognitive by: (1)
splitting recordings into short, segmented sections and (2) cutting out unnecessary conversations in class
recordings. Segmenting recordings makes them more inviting, which not only increases engagement, but
improves information absorption and learning retention. Keeping video content and segments short is
important because it makes them more attractive to students and reduces cognitive load, also influenced by
increasingly busy lives and limits on attention spans.
56 | PRODUCING MICROLEARNING DELIVERY

   Microlearning sized recordings can increase engagement in terms of popularity with numbers of
students accessing them and positive comments in course evaluation. Students appreciate the conveniences
of being able to listen while driving, listening while making dinner and while carrying out chores, some
say they continue to keep an eye on the slides when doing chores. Video recordings overall, regardless
of whether they be from pre-recorded lectures or from live recorded classes, provide students with great
flexibility in ways they can consume information in recorded forms.

Recording and production

Recording and segmenting are a hallmark of the microlearning design approach in its quest to seek out
ways to assist learners with cognitive load challenges they face.

  · Voicing slide presentations and converting to video play form
  · Vocal delivery conversational tone overwhelmingly most effective
  · Inviting guest voice-overs, or co-delivery by recording with guests
  · Recording live lecture presentation delivery and recording of classes

Editing: Segmenting and reduction

Reducing recorded content by editing into short segments and then cutting out less relevant parts reduces
cognitive load and further increases engagement of audio and video recordings

  · Use editing techniques and principles to guide reducing volume and length of recordings
  · Use easily available and easy to use editing software

Media and variety in media

Increases engagement and advantages for learning and information processing

  · Provide variety in media: video recorded learning sessions, recorded audio delivery
  · Demonstration styled videos, animation videos, providing some still slides
  · Design in graphics and visual elements

LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

Introduction

This chapter covers approaches we can draw on for increasing learner engagement in delivery and delivery
design. It is supported with examples to demonstrate how these approaches can be applied, including video
recordings of classes.

   Delivery is critical to engaging people as encapsulated in cliche "It's all in the delivery". Techniques and
strategies in this area stem from thought and planning around `What would make lessons and delivery
an interesting and engaging experience for my learners?'. Our options are wide ranging: from attracting
interest and attention with novelty e.g., props, humour; including elements of gamification in activities and
developing some positive habits like projecting our own enthusiasm to attract engagement. Keep in mind,
increasing engagement, as a path to increasing learning success lies at the heart microlearning design.

   This chapter covers learning design for (a) presenting information or instruction e.g., lectures; and
(b) for interactive learning sessions with greater participation and interaction e.g., tutorials, workshops.
Incorporating activities is important in all delivery and lesson types, including lectures, so that application
of what is being covered becomes an integral component of all learning. However, this chapter also
shows learning delivery is moving into a blending of presentation and interactive-activity formats toward a
blended format (i.e., a combination of the two: some presentation bended in with interactivity).

   The term relatability features in this chapter as an engagement construct. Relatability pertains to
conveying information in ways learners can relate to easily, to increase appeal and subsequently
engagement. The challenge here is to make information as easy as possible to grasp and process or
internalise.

   Relevance Linking (previous chapters) and Constructivist Learning (chapter 4) are pedagogical strategies
that also support our aim to design and deliver learning sessions that are relatable and thus more engaging.
The constructivist approach leverages, by using associations; from things that are already familiar (or
understood) as a base for constructing understanding of new (unfamiliar) information. It views learning
as an active process rather than a passive one (Jarvis, 2006), and is not only more engaging but also works
to reduce cognitive load. Based on a student-centred mindset, it helps guide choices around relatability, for
trying to meet learners in their space.

   From a holistic viewpoint, delivery of learning in the forms of pre-recorded and live delivery recordings
are an accompaniment to modules that make up a `textual' component of learning packages. Print modules
should also be written to be relatable and include activities, and some of these activities can also be used in
lectures and interactive classes.

   Relatability can be broken down into practical approaches that include:
60 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

 1. use of easy to relate to examples (accompanied by relatable tone of voice),
 2. drawing on existing learner knowledge,
 3. making learning practical and relevant e.g., for success in employment and career and in assessments

      (Chapter 2),
 4. designing activities aimed at getting students to participate in their learning, and
 5. breaking content into easy to process bite-sized pieces (to scaffold learning and optimise cognitive

      load (chapters 2 and 3).

   Relevance Linking and Constructivist Learning approaches are also included to stimulate interest and
support the aims of making delivery relatable for learners.

Relevance linking

Even after the process of increasing relevance in course content (Chapter 2), some may still struggle to see
value and relevance, and find study unappealing and demotivating. The goal for microlearning design at
this point becomes:

            "What can we do to convince learners that the benefits they can gain are worth the effort?"
   Here, we can draw again on relevance linking (Chapter 2) to make practical value explicit in delivery.
This means frequently drawing attention to the benefits to be gained from topics and concepts as we cover
them - making this central to the way we design and deliver learning.
   Key points of focus for relevance linking are: (a) advancing employability i.e., professional skills and
competency and (b) guidance aimed at enabling students to understand and produce sound assessments.
62 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

Life skills (or transferable skills) can also be included into professional skills, and range from managing
relationships, to managing demanding environments and well-being.

            Relevance linking during delivery is an approach we can use to address the difficulties many
         learners have recognising the relevance of content. It plays an important role in increasing
         attractiveness to learners and helps prompt and increase engagement.
   It is important to promote learning resources including any readings you have set, along with the
key ideas and concepts involved. One way to link to relevance is to point to and explain how they, as
practitioners in development, can benefit from the learning materials, whether live or recorded.
   A prime place to `sell benefits', is the opening of a lecture. Another is in Introduction to week videos
(Chapter 5), as these are opportunities to `sell' to students the rewards and benefits they can gain from a
course's content, including applicability of concepts, principles, theories, and lessons to be learned from
case studies.
   The mindset I use when selecting resources like set readings is: `If a resource such as a reading is good
enough and relevant enough to be in the course, then surely it is worth promoting it to students?'.
Especially if you want them to read it and get value from it. This also applies to videos and other learning
resources.

Relevance as practical value in learning design and
activities

Weaving relevant activities into microlectures helps attract engagement and aid comprehension and
retention of learning, which includes the ability to apply learning.

   Activities should be designed with the aims of eliciting interest and involvement in mind. Accordingly,
the practical value of the activities needs to be explained and made evident. In public relations, we often use
short, scaffolded writing exercises that are authentic, based on industry work scenarios and expectations,
which again needs to be made explicit. In addition to building professional competency and confidence
for undertaking professional work, learning activities should be linked to assessments. Be sure to explain
how the activities they are undertaking have been designed to prepare them for tackling their assessments.

Learning design approach

In public relations writing courses, students are told from the start they will be doing a lot of writing,
with writing exercises. We also explain that the exercises are designed to build their skills and confidence
gently and gradually, and not to overwhelm them or frighten them off. We further explain that this regular
practice-based system of learning is designed to dispel fears about writing, as they will become confident
writers by the end.

   These writing exercises are an example of a scaffolded approach to learning, in microlearning design.
Segmenting is used to break learning down into small units, that build on one another. It is a practice-based
                                                                                                       LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 63

learning design, where students `learn by doing' repeatedly as a way to help them become accustomed to
writing i.e., build `reflex memory' skill, as a public relations writing competency.

   This kind of scaffolded activity-based learning helps show student-centeredness in microlearning design
and one firmly based in relevance (explicit) to professional employment skills and preparation for
assessments. It is natural that students would want to know how course materials and activities relate to the
assessments they have been set. They are interested in being well prepared for carrying out what is expected.
Linking relevance to assessments, almost unfailingly, hooks interest; for them it is seen as the `bottom-line'.

EXAMPLE Learning Activity: writing a media release

The following activity is from a course with the overarching aim of introducing and building
understanding of public relations core principles and practices. This class activity is aimed at:

   (1) developing some understanding of public relations job requirements for an entry level position
   (2) an introduction to understanding and developing core skills through an activity that involves
developing ideas for writing a media release.
   The lesson uses an advertisement for a typical public relations job as a source of guidance for
approaching the task. The exercise itself is the application of knowledge, featuring the use of early
engagement and diagnostic test to formatively assess learning and provide feedback.
   Design elements

  · Early engagement and learning performance, formatively assess, with guidance feedback

  · Elicit proactive participation: being able to play an active role in one's learning

  · Active, constructivist, and practice-based learning

  · Aims to instill sense of lesson relevance and worth: value for time spent attending session (or viewing
      recording)

     Read: The following slides demonstrated the activity.

     `Lecture 5: Strategic alignment. 4-1 Class Activity: Media Release` [pdf slides] (CC-BY-4). The
     activity is divided into the following four steps:

     Activity

     SELF-GUIDING QUESTIONS TO GUIDE LINKING RELEVANCE IN LESSONS
     The self-guiding questions below are framed from a learner perspective:

          · How does what we're learning (here and now) relate to career and preparation for the
             kinds of work duties and situations that that I am going to be facing?

          · How does what we're learning (here and now) relate to the kinds of tasks I have to carry
             out for the assessments for this course?

Constructivist Learning Designs

The constructivist perspective views learning as a process in which new information and understandings
are built, through people drawing on their existing knowledge, experience and understanding (Jarvis,
2006). The taking-in of new information is seen as an active rather than passive process (Lutz & Huitt,
2004). Learning can be more effective by using designs that build understanding of new content by
drawing on students' existing knowledge (Vygotsky, 1978) to increase engagement and reduce cognitive
load. Microlearning utilises constructivist design to engage students in ways that are meaningful to them,
this makes it, student-centred.

   Existing understanding can be harnessed by tapping into what is already familiar as a base and a bridge
from which to build new knowledge and understanding (including skills).

   Connecting new information to existing knowledge (e.g. previous content) also facilitates the transfer
                                                                                                       LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 65

of new information from working memory to long-term memory (Kapp & Defelice, 2019). Drawing on
existing knowledge by actively involving students also makes learning more appealing and less confusing.

   There are a number of ways we can go about activating existing knowledge (before we go on to build on
it), one is to draw on previous lesson content to begin new learning sessions.

   Key approaches for harnessing existing knowledge:
   (a) tapping into previous content (e.g., previous module or lesson)
   (b) tapping into learners' personal knowledge, understandings, experiences and interests
   (c) tapping into common knowledge understandings
   We should view these as valuable learning resources that we can use to good effect. We frequently draw
on existing understanding in our natural learning processes in life. We can easily use and combine all three
approaches in one lesson.

(a) Previously covered content

Microlearning draws on a constructivist approach when it seeks to build knowledge and skills
incrementally with a series of short segments of clear and focused information combined with embedded
performance enabling activities. These singular microlearning events fit together as a part of a wider
whole, in a process we commonly call scaffolding. The harder the conceptual material becomes, the more
scaffolding we need to use to optimise and ensure effective learning.

   Increasing the number of learning sessions with shorter duration lessons reduces cognitive load i.e.,
scaffolding aids retention of knowledge incrementally. Scaffolded sessions often use additional measures,
like repetition, knowledge check quizzes, and frequent practice-based activities that include feedback
and appraisal of those activities to help learners grasp difficult content. These are commonly used as
high-engagement design measures that aim to keep students involved and facilitate deeper level learning,
advanced mastery and comprehension, and also increase retention of knowledge and skills (Darby & Lang,
2019; Lutz & Huitt, 2004).

(b) Learner personal knowledge

Drawing on learners' life-experiences can be an effective tool for guiding students to construct their own.
This approach empowers students to become more directly involved in the process of their own learning.
They begin to sense their own agency because motivation is intrinsic. Playing an important role in their
self-development, they become more invested in ways of learning that feel rewarding. As educators, a
part of our responsibility is to help get students on board with their own learning. Our role necessarily
involves `winning hearts and minds', doing what we can to make learning interesting, relevant, engaging,
and rewarding for our learners.

   Encouraging and providing opportunities for students to draw on their personal experiences,
understandings and perspectives aids their understanding of content and concepts in new learning
material. It is an effective way to stimulate learner participation, encouraging active learning.
66 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

   We can activate and leverage learner's personal knowledge into content delivery, like lectures, by
including activities that help them draw on their experiences and understandings.

   Online Forums: We can take this a step further by setting up forum activities, providing students with
opportunities to interact and learn from each other. Using an in-course online forum to prompt open
discussion can lead to productive spirited and learning exchanges among students. Lecturers can join in
or make contributions at points where it is helpful e.g., provide clarifications or corrective guidance, and
commentary and encouragement.

(c) Common knowledge understandings

The shared knowledge and understandings in common culture provide educators and learners with a rich
and plentiful treasure trove of conceptual learning resources. These are widely understood concepts and
ideas that we can use as bridges for new learning and building understanding. To do this, I search for
common knowledge and ideas to help introduce and build understanding of new concepts and processes,
as well as build confidence and competency for tackling assessments and professional work.

   An example of a common knowledge idea that could be used as a point of comparison is, `game'. We
could use `game' to examine a topic area like life, or life-skills (target domain). We can leverage it as a
bridging comparison point to activate existing knowledge to build new understandings and insights of
`life'. For example, comparing ways in which aspects of life can be seen as being `game' like, in some ways,
e.g., it can be competitive. Another point of comparison could be - life is like `acting' e.g., acting out a
variety of roles, like parent, colleague, friend, etc.

Applying common knowledge to learning activities

Using metaphors (for comparisons) tend to work for activities that aim to stimulate interest and
participation, generating exploration and co-construction of understanding with deeper levels of insight.
We could narrow `life-skills', used above, to explore interpersonal life-skills needed to make work -life
effective (e.g., negotiation, cooperation, empathy), imagining work-life as like a `game'.

   It is possible to have students explore ways in which work-life can be likened to a game by asking them to
explain and justify the supporting example and scenario they use, and having it critiqued by peers in class
discussion. Discussion activities of this kind should be linked to practical aspects, like what lessons can be
learned, or to be knowledge gained, (e.g., by viewing work-life skills in these ways).

   Further, gamification could work well for generating added interest and enthusiasm - e.g., adding a
popular vote competition which may involve small prize.

   In designing a presentation or lecture, you may decide to use a common knowledge concept as a starting
point and centrepiece. Alternatively, it could be woven in at a later point e.g., be used as the basis for an
integrated learning activity. A common option for activities that have been built into lectures is to invite
students to post responses to an online forum; example to follow shortly.
                                                                                                       LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 67

       Design tip
       The purpose of lecture content should be made clear and relevance and value explained.
       Likewise, the purpose of learning activities should be explained along with the value they
       provide. This is a way to prompt student interest and motivate them to engage with
       activities. In other words, the value of activities should be pitched to learners' interests to
       ensure they work well and serve their purpose.

Activity design

Designing engaging activities needs thought and effort. In addition to making them relevant and
purposeful they should be enticing, so they hook interest and look enjoyable (e.g., gamification). The
following example is a novel ice-breaking activity also designed to introduce students to a fundamental
course concept, engaging and familiarising them with social constructivism and giving them a feel for the
nature of the course.

   This microlearning topic and activity, placed at the start of the course should introduce and stimulate
exploratory interest in social constructivism, a perspective in which everyday knowledge, or commonsense
knowledge, is viewed as being socially created through shared language and culture.

   Ice-breaking activities like this can be embedded into bite sized lesson recordings as an asynchronous
activity, well suited for online learners. It is designed to appeal to students and thereby attract participation
and interaction.

   It encourages active learning as students construct their own understanding, as well as peer-driven
where they are encouraged to learn from each another. It is used to encourage students to get to know
each at course commencement. It has proven popular as well as effective in orienting students to the
course. Gamification is also employed as an `interest' hook. It involves playing a friendly game that is softly
competitive. We could intensify the competitive intensity, for example, if we were to have students rate
results.

     Example activity

    In interactive online forum - format

     The following demonstrates procedures for the activity which involves generating and
     explaining clichés, also referred to as folk theories.
     Description:
     Asynchronous, online activity designed to elicit:

          · Responses and discussion of activity on online forum
          · Facilitate learner understanding of social constructivism with folk-theory / cliché exercise
     TITLE OF THE ACTIVITY ON ONLINE FORUM: "Add to our list of folk theories"
     Initial explanation and instruction:
     This activity is to get you "into the swing of things" (that's also a cliché) for the start of this
     course.
     I have commenced this exercise to get you started and demonstrate the steps you take.
     I look forward to seeing what clichés and interpretations you come up with.
     Wishing you a great week one!
     FORUM POST - TO START
     "Instructions for explaining latest cliché and adding new clichés"
     Cliché 1: "Don't put all your eggs in one basket"
         1. ADD explanation of existing forum cliché (i.e., What does it mean? What does it mean

             to you?)
         2. THEN ADD a new cliché
     My example: of a response of explanation
     "Don't put all your eggs in one basket" means don't put all your efforts into one thing because if
     it does not work out you could lose all the efforts you put in. It is a risky choice.
     My example: of a new cliché
     "Don't bite off more than you can chew"

Common knowledge: essay writing lessons

The following demonstration is a series of lessons and activities designed to help students make a correctly
focused start on an essay, in the first week. These lessons provide guidance on how to approach essay
writing. Guidance includes the importance of utilising course resources like set readings and the relevance
of these for demonstrating learning in essay assignments.

   These are public relations lessons aimed at helping students transition into their first semester of
university study. Accordingly, they are designed to help students develop the skills of understanding the
relevance and value in content, including the applicability of concepts and course materials to assessments
and then also real-life practice.

   Lesson design here takes common understandings people hold about the legal domain as a bridging
comparison scaffold. It is a metaphor used to help students develop a strong understanding of what essays
require and useful ways to approach the tasks involved in producing an essay. Given the approach is based
on providing guidance and preparation for an upcoming essay, it serves as a demonstration of relevance
linking.

   The key idea being used or leveraged here, centres around how lawyers are required to produce argued
cases to support a given position. An easily relatable example would be to defend someone against an
accusation.

   This `think like a lawyer' theme is one of the most effective I have used for helping learners quickly gain
a clear and firm grasp on the mindset that is conducive to helping them produce quality essays (largely
by avoiding pitfalls). It has proven to be effective as a way to launch into essay writing and facilitating
understanding across all aspects and processes involved, from developing well-reasoned arguments
supported by credible evidence, through to the mechanics of formal writing and referencing.

   STEP 1 MICRO-LECTURE - INTRODUCING TOPIC AND LINKING CONTEXT
   In this first session students are introduced to the topic: the historical development of public relations.
It incorporates ethical developments and runs over the next four weeks. While the content is key in this
session, it is stressed, that understanding and application of their learning will be assessed in the upcoming
essay. Students are advised to keep the essay task in mind as a centre point for guiding their approach and
focus for their study of the topic. It is an example of relevance linking to assessment, which continues in
the lectures that follow. Below, is a diagrammatic overview of lesson design - for introducing topic content
and linking it to the essay assessment.

relations, knowing that they have to write an essay based on this topic area. The key learning aim here is to
help students equip themselves with knowledge and perspective to help them perform well in producing
the set essay assessment. It also motivates them to engage with ethical issues which remain relevant today.
   Two of the biggest problems students encounter in essay writing, especially when new to university, are
(1) not staying on topic (task adherence) and (2) failure to produce argument i.e., developing supported
and reasoned conclusions, which results in description rather than argument.
   Pointing to these two stumbling blocks to raise awareness is a brief but important preliminary step as
the start of the lesson, to set the context for focus and thinking. The `think like a lawyer' theme (as a key to
good essay writing) is then introduced to prompt students to draw on their commonsense understandings
to explore the topic (essay writing), and theme, (what makes a good lawyer?) to begin the interactive
discussion activity. Narrowing focus to this one theme effectively constrains cognitive load. The following
video presentation explains this part of the lesson.
   `Essay writing discussion activity: Class 1-1 Think like a lawyer`, (video; 3'57", CC-BY) below, outlines
lesson design used for Class 1-1 on essay writing.

STEP 3 INTERACTIVE CLASS 1: Part 2 (INTERACTIVE LESSON DESIGN)
   The tangible aim in the "Start your essay" session is to have students make a start on their first

assessment, by making a draft essay plan. The activity is designed to prompt students firstly, to decide on
                                                                                                        LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 71

and write a stated position (a thesis statement), then secondly, to choose two main points they could use to
support their position, taken from topics covered in the prior lecture.

     The following slides provide a step-by-step illustration of the `Start your essay` activity.
     `Interactive class design: Class 1-2 Start your Essay' [.pdf slides], (CC-BY-4)
     This approach has been published in the following free access journal article:

     https://doi.org/10.1108/AAOUJ-09-2021-0107

Once a thesis statement and main points are written, students have, in effect, started their essay in the
course of the first week of study. This provides the platform for progressing with information and
discussion activities of other components required for the essay (as covered in slides linked above).
Components include strategies for (1) constructing an argument, including logic and reasoning, (2)
supporting with credible evidence, (3) using formal language, (4) ensuring referencing protocols as a part
of (5) effective persuasion. Notice that exploration of these aspects and components can be continued
without reference to the `lawyer theme' after the value of this perspective has been established.

Threshold skills and content for essay writing

The podcasts below on academic and essay writing, cover discussion the topics areas covered in these
classes, despite being in an alternative format. These podcasts are now used to serve as additional learning
resources for students on critical threshold skills and content for planning and writing essays for meeting
task and topic requirements. While these podcasts do not draw on a `think like a lawyer' theme directly,
Chapter 4 Podcast Episodes, are based on conversations with a lawyer about similarities between legal case
building and essay case building, in reference to producing convincing cases and arguments and selecting
evidence.

Participative class learning

We now move on to a stronger focus on active participation in classes, progressing from constructivist
learning to social constructivist learning. This includes measures and activities we can use to attract
and prompt interactivity in learning and also promote successful outcomes of community and social
belonging. This fits microlearning's first and foremost goal - to increase learner engagement - as it is a
pathway to increase rates of learning success.

   Constructivist learning, as discussed, is based on the principle that learning can be more effective
when students have the opportunity to develop or construct their own knowledge for better
understandings through active engagement with principles and concepts (Steffe & Gale 2012) while also
containing cognitive. We can facilitate this through activities that place the student at the centre of learning
(discussed earlier). Accordingly, we can encourage students to draw on their personal and existing
understandings to help learners grasp new information in ways that are meaningful to them.

   The social constructivist learning approach goes on to posit further that learners construct
knowledge more effectively when they are able to interact with other learners, i.e. group or peer learning is
preferable (Vygotsky, 1978). This often requires effort on our part to facilitate the breaking down of `sense
of isolation' among learners, and even more so for online learners.

   Interactive participation in activities facilitates social bonding and belonging, i.e., breaking down
isolation, developing a sense of purposefulness, and building student confidence in their learning abilities.

   Providing welcoming and non-threatening environments where students feel safe, supported and
encouraged to express themselves, makes participation more inviting, providing them with the opportunity
to develop and advance their own thinking and understandings of concepts. This kind of learning also
facilitates active evaluation about the value and applicability of concepts, ideas and principles e.g., how
these may be applied to professional practices and associated pitfalls overcome.

Creating supportive interactive ecosystems

As facilitators of learning, we have a responsibility to lead the way in breaking down barriers to
participation by providing a positive and welcoming class atmosphere, which is genuinely supportive. To
do this, it is important that we give students a genuine sense of ownership and belonging, by treating them
as `professionals in development' and working with them to instil their own sense of professional identity.
We use this kind of relevance linking so that they can begin to recognise themselves in relation to their
chosen area, connecting with it and viewing themselves as already being a part of it (i.e., instilling a sense of
professional belonging).

   Making all first encounters positive, enjoyable and of value to learners is critical. So, making a `splash'
at the beginning is a high priority for setting the tempo: establishing vibrancy, positivity and sense of
purpose, belonging and appeal. Give time and thought to designing activities that are interesting and
inviting to students and as enjoyable as possible. Our aim is to work together with our learners to create
a class experience that inspires them to keep attending and participating. Advice to consider here is to
74 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

place a light warm up activity within ten minutes of commencing, as a way to break the ice, set the
tempo for participation, and include something enjoyable. We have the option of being more relaxed about
purposefulness to a learning objective with a first activity.

   The following questions can help ensure that an activity will work well and serve a worthwhile purpose.
   `What is the purpose of the activity?'.
   So too, about the value: `What's in it for me, the student?', and
   `What is it about this activity that makes it interesting?'.
   These points should also be pitched to learners' interests. Preference quality of activities over quantity
(less is more); simple activities often work best. If an activity is not working as well as expected, then move
on to another or modify it midway.

Design elements, and features to include in classes and activities

The following is a checklist of design elements to keep in mind when developing learning activities and
class environments, for social peer type learning (but not limited only to), in interactive class environments.

     Checklist of design elements

            · Appeal: What makes the lesson and activities interesting, inviting, enjoyable and
                beneficial e.g., design that provides a sense of achievement and satisfaction

            · Frequent activities, practice-based for competency and confidence building with
                first activity early on: usually within 10 minutes, and light as an easy warm up

            · Active participation (learner empowerment in constructing understanding) apply
                and further develop e.g. practically explore and resolve issues or problems

            · Prompts to elicit proactive participation: prompting learners to take an active
                role in their learning

            · Interactive social learning: peer-learning
            · Develop sense of value: worth the time spent attending (that learning as

                rewarding
            · Facilitating sense of belonging and community: learning as social and enjoyable
                                                                                                        LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 75

            · Safety and support show that all responses have value
            · Guidance in learning (corrective guidance from peers and educator/facilitator)
            · Testing learning (practice, application, construction), providing feedback on

                learning, which can also serve as preparation for assessment.

Participative learning design - video examples

Classes are designed with the aim of making participation and interaction appealing to students, by
providing an environment that is welcoming, supportive, enjoyable and purposeful. It is a collaborative
space where everyone's voice matters. The sense of ownership motivates students to engage enthusiastically
in lessons; and discussion activities with technology functions like `chat' gives those who are less confident
the opportunity to participate and be included.

   Video 1: Fostering a Learning Community
   This first video (below) `Class Opening - community building' (video; 1'12", CC-BY) demonstrates
cultivating a sense of belonging and setting foundations for a (strong) learning community. Note, I pick
up on a somewhat incidental `hello' from one student to another, and use this to promote a sense of
community, belonging and ownership of class learning. I then go on to address an earlier question on
`reflective practice'. My response here validates the value of that question, and thus the student, while also
providing further guidance and clarification.
   Summation: It shows the adopting of a participative approach by prioritising student connections. I
start with inclusive gallery view to foreground the class, to create a supportive, connected and enjoyable
environment. Then student contributions and comments are also used as community-building
opportunities to help make them feel relaxed, safe and encouraged to put forward their thinking and ideas.

Video 2: Interactive Discussion showing Social Learning
   This segment (below) `Activity: Benefits of Workplace Democracy` (video; 1'56", CC-BY) reflects the

kind of interactive social learning I aim for in classes. This discussion activity focuses on the benefits of
workplace democracy. Slides are used (PowerPoint) to present information and activities where students
76 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

construct understanding by building on each other's contributions as I type their responses onto the slides
in real time. This works to validate and acknowledge the value of their efforts and contributions. Also note,
I normally start activities by providing the first response to lead and to demonstrate, by example, the process
of participating and formulating responses.

   Students are encouraged to participate, but not placed under pressure to do this. Participation often
increases as those eager to respond show the way. Students are also able to participate in ways comfortable
for them, by speaking with camera on or off, or by choosing the chat function.

   While the exercise used here was designed to examine benefits (of workplace democracy), a critical
perspective emerged naturally and added of depth of understanding. Accordingly, guidance to redirect
focus was not needed.

Video 3: Strategies for Creative Thinking
   This section (below) `Strategies for creative thinking` (video; 1'35"; CC-BY) is taken toward the

conclusion of a discussion on creative thinking strategies designed to encouraged exploration and taking
advantage of unexpected creative breakthrough ideas that often arise while taking a break. Also the idea
of deliberately stepping away from a problem is a strategy for enabling more free and open thinking on
problems. It facilitates deeper understandings of creative thinking processes and insight into strategies that
enable students to apply these in study tasks, and in other aspects of their lives.

Video 4.1: Culminating Activity, Co-Teaching and Rapport (Town Hall Meeting simulation)
   This segment (below) `Practical Activity Part 1 - Town Hall Meeting Prep` (video; 2'30"; CC-BY)

showcases a learning activity where students host and facilitate a mock Town Hall Meeting with a scenario
provided at the start of the course. A sense of community, rapport and confidence, using practice-based
learning and positive learning experiences, had been built throughout the term in preparation for it. As a
final activity for the course it helps validate the value of student-centred design approaches in empowering
students to take control and ownership of their learning. This approach helped equip the students with the
knowledge, confidence, and skills conducive to future success, especially in community consultation and
engagement work.

   This segment (below) `Practical Activity Part 2 - Town Hall Meeting Debrief ` (video; 2'27"; CC-BY) is
a debrief, it shows students reflecting on their performance and perceived areas of strength and weakness.
Combined with the whole practice activity, allowed students to solidify their understanding of meeting
facilitation processes examined throughout the course and identify areas for further refinement.
   This performance-based activity, in whole, provides students with the opportunity to apply the skills
and knowledge they have developed, and to reflect, and receive feedback, as well as acknowledge and
celebrate their performance. Positive and supportive learning environments in the activities leading up to
the Town Hall have enabled them to feel confident in taking risks, engaging in self-reflection and striving
for continuous improvement.

Hybrid teaching: participative learning design class video
examples

Hybrid delivery design is increasingly common where short bursts of information are blended with
interactive activity-centred classes. Although these activities, such as polls, quizzes and breakout room
discussions, are not shown in the videos here, these tools can also increase comprehension and retention of
learning.

   Video 5 Employment applications
   This video (below) `Job applications` (video; 2'53"; CC-BY) shows exploration on the topic of producing
applications for employment, featuring a student sharing her experiences and reflections. Insights and

and increasing chances of success in gaining desirable and suitable employment.

Video 6 Facilitation Skills (highlights Social Learning)
   The recording (below) `Facilitation skills` (video; 6'22"; CC-BY) highlights an array of techniques

including co-teaching, where an industry guest and I both project enthusiasm for the topic. Video
conferencing features like screen sharing are used for presenting information and for learning activities.
Switching between share-screen and full gallery view is used to help produce a sense of community
and belonging. Typing student responses using shared screen slides gives validation and encouragement
as they are able to see their responses being included in the construction of knowledge. This affirms
value being placed on their thinking and perspectives. The satisfaction they derive from engaging in their
own learning encourages further participation and continuing class attendance. This is a mainstay of my
teaching practice.

   Critical thinking was encouraged in the examination and analysis of facilitation techniques. A relaxed
and positive atmosphere facilitated engagement for developing deeper understanding. The video
demonstrates the benefits of a blended learning approach, use of social learning principles, use of co-
teaching, and encouragement of critical thinking by students - to equip themselves with the skills needed
for success in this area.

Video 7 Communication as Transactional (Fostering Active Social Learning)
   The transactional perspective of communication is a topic usually dealt with in lecture format. I guide

students through critical concepts only, before moving on to encourage their input on what they think the
transactional concept could entail, which enables the combination of peer learning and social construction
of understanding. Providing only necessary information gave students a base to participate in building
understanding of the transactional notion of communicator `credibility', for example, factors that
influence credibility and trust and these can fluctuate.

   Corrective feedback fits with a social constructivist design, as it is mainly student generated. This allows
students to learn from one another to refine their understanding incrementally, without teacher direction
as demonstrated in this video `Communication as Transactional` (video; 4'57"; CC-BY).
                                                                                                       LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 79

Video 8 Collaborative Learning through Co-teaching and Student Enquiry
   This segment (below) `Public speaking, facilitating - prep and confidence building` (video; 3'12"; CC-

BY) illustrates a collaborative online learning approach to understanding public speaking skills, including
the topic of building speaking confidence. It highlights the value of having a co-teacher take an active role
in sharing teaching responsibilities and coordination. Combining the strength of our different perspectives
allows students to experience variety in style and expertise.

   The session also demonstrates the value of student contributions in posing questions that open up
discussion in ways that would be less likely without them. This allows students to cover individual needs,
e.g. their aspirations, career interests, perceived areas of strength and weaknesses, and contributes to lesson
quality.

   Note, I hide/reserve points I do not want overlooked by changing colour of the type to white or very
pale grey. They are made visible when required by changing colour back to black during class.

Discussion points

`Student presence' participation is encouraged, i.e., their appearance with camera on and spoken responses
80 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

to activities, as it is best suited for developing sense of community. However, there is no pressure applied,
and some prefer to participate with written `chat' responses and the option for not revealing their name
on screen. Classes accommodate all comfort levels to foster participation, with participation the overriding
goal. Encouragement to add to and continue discussion on forums also attracts student engagement,
including from those unable to attend class.

   When students respond incorrectly or with a degree of misunderstanding that requires teacher /
facilitator involvement, I firstly affirm a correct or relevant aspect of that response. I then build on that
aspect of the response with the student until s/he arrives at a point where appropriate understanding is
attained.

             Answer questions wrongly in Chris's class and he doesn't make you feel like an idiot. (Student
                                                       feedback)

   Encouraging students actively to construct their own understandings of concepts, and how they can
apply these to professional practice and their assessments, is an important way to elicit participation for
active and social (peer-to-peer) learning.

       Classes for online students allowed us to enjoy `learning by doing' with interesting activities that are
                                      practical and useful. (Student feedback)

   With HE education shifting to a more `active' student-learning delivery, so too the role of teacher
is moving away from information presenter into roles of learning facilitator and learning environment
designer: designing environments that are student-centred, in which students have greater control and
agency over their learning. It increases engagement and is a more rewarding experience.

   Learning activities, like open discussion questions shown in class videos above, allow students to `trial
and error' their thinking to arrive at understandings that are valid while still largely developed on their
own. It allows learners to actively work through their understandings through verbal responses - cognitive
processing by talking. It is a process of learning by talking through one's own reasoning along with thoughts
and reasoning from peers and facilitator.

     Delivery and Design Tips

            · Transforming fear and anxiety into shared community support: Establishing a

                supportive and welcome tone when starting classes encourages students to

                participate in, and contribute to, community-building and mutual support.

            · Encouraging participation: Encouraging students to share their experiences,

                including their own thoughts, tips and ideas, fosters interactive student-driven
                                                                                                        LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 81

                learning.
            · Provide first response to activities: Start activities by providing a first response, to

                model and lead the process and set a supportive tone for students to `chip in' with
                their ideas.
            · Building Connection: Referring to students by name conveys a sense of inclusion
                and belonging; it helps break down relational barriers (power distance) and
                personalises their learning experience.
            · Chat function : Provides students with multiple ways to engage and express
                themselves to ensure participation from those most hesitant to speak. It also shows/
                reinforces that all voices are valued.
            · Blended/ Hybrid learning approaches: These encourage engagement and
                student- led enquiry of content as an alternative to information presentation (e.g.,
                lecture formats).
            · Practice based activities: learning by doing. For example, activities based on
                problem-solving (e.g. scenarios), simulations (Town Hall Meeting) and discussion
                questions (a feature of my teaching), that are also be used in blended delivery i.e., for
                building student- driven understanding around new concepts.

RECORDINGS AS A LEARNING RESOURCE

Online interactive classes are recorded as a learning resource and benefit those not attending. This kind of
asynchronous involvement aids inclusivity as students can learn a good deal from observing interactions.
Recordings often motivate non-attendees to join in future classes. Students unable to attend are also
encouraged to contribute to class activities in online forums.

Stimulating interest and engagement: techniques

As presenters, and as hosts of learning sessions we naturally have an interest in gaining and maintaining the
attention and interest of our learners. This section delves further into strategies and techniques we use to
attract learner interest, that is, to make content and learning appealing. We use interest-appeals, i.e., ways
to stimulate interest with enthusiasm, relatability and novelty.

   Enthusiasm
   Enthusiasm, one's own interest and commitment, is critical for conveying the `interest' and value of the
topics and activities that we are providing to students. Perceptions that study is hard because topics seem
boring is a major barrier to learning. Our aim is to show them otherwise. Harnessing or marshalling our
own passion and commitment is a vital starting point. It helps us to convey information with positivity and
interest and to look for ways to show that a topic is in fact interesting and has value.
   Relatability
   Relatability is another important delivery strategy e.g., using easy to understand and relatable examples
accompanied by warm tone of voice, and explaining of value and applicability e.g. relevance to work
competencies and employability, to gain and maintain student interest.
   Again, constructivist designs are based on relatability with the use use associative approaches like
common knowledge comparisons. However, these are not always necessary and can be overused. The
alternative, direct route approach is to convey information with clear literal explanations and definitions.
This often works well and can be a better choice in some cases, especially when precision is needed, i.e.,
when specific definitions are best suited. Having said that, a combination of both approaches often works
well, combining the advantages of both.
   EXAMPLES: A direct explanation approach. These instructive pieces are from online presentations
with a conversational tone (minimal novelty).
   This first is example is drawn from `Public Relations - Persuasion in Politics` (video; 0'45"; CC-BY)

Novelty
   Novelty in microlearning design, as a concept and strategy for interest and attention, has wide

applicability, from (1) enthusiasm and harnessing your own unique i.e. novel personality (can cross over
into humour), to (2) creativity, like searching out novel scenarios or attracting interest with an intriguing
twist or surprising fact (i.e., an interest hook).

   Achieving good balance is important across forms of novelty used to engage interest and make learning
appealing. On one hand, we are looking to make learning and content attractive and enjoyable; on the
other hand, we need to instil the realisation that learning also involves challenge (difficulty) and therefore
considerable effort and commitment. Learning does need to be taken seriously, and we have a responsibility
to equip students with expectations and understandings conducive to ensuring their success. (We explore
this issue further, shortly)

       Guidance Tip - setting tone for balance
       Convey to students that success requires taking study seriously which includes working
       through difficult periods, but that it should also be enjoyable (even though not every
       moment is enjoyable) and that rewards are transformative as you see your knowledge and
       abilities advance.

Personality
   The importance of harnessing the power of your own personality and style can be underestimated or

overlooked. This appeal of your natural self is driven by authenticity i.e., drawing on natural strengths to
make classes and presentations interesting and captivating in your own way.

   It is an approach that does not rely on imitating others' styles, nor on being highly animated. Leveraging
your own natural style can serve you well in conveying information and enthusiasm convincingly. Of
course, it comes with caveats and pitfalls to avoid, like not being self-indulgent, but rather staying learner
centred. This applies to areas coming up, like humour and narrative storytelling.

   Interest hooks
   Interest hook appeals are attention grabbers that can take many forms: format as table boxes
84 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

 Interest Hook Type Example

Catchy    music, catchy cliché (even as a topic theme)

Surprise  A startling fact, a confronting fact, an intriguing piece of information

Intrigue  Ask a thought-provoking rhetorical question

Eye catching novelty Props, graphic

Interest hooks are another broad subcategory limited only by imagination. Like most forms of novelty e.g.,
humour, they need to be thought through with care and diligence so that they stimulate interest without
giving offence or undermining the learning purpose.

   We are working in a territory here that attracts wide debate around the extent to which educational
delivery should be entertaining i.e. infotainment. We need to work on making learning attractive to reduce
one of the biggest hurdles of all, the commonly reported difficultly that study is difficult because the
content seems boring to learners.

   It also draws us back to the issue of balance - balance between (1) retaining the seriousness of learning
material and its purpose and (2) using reasonable measures to make learning interesting, including making
room for enjoyment as a part of the experience. Decisions we make around this do need to be purposeful
and justifiable. However, purpose in this case, does not always need to be directly linked to a learning
objective, as stimulating interest is a justifiable purpose in itself. Overuse or reliance on interest hooks,
however, undermines learning as the purpose and is not justifiable.

   Humour
   It is reasonable to say that infotainment needs to be a part of education: learning, where possible should
be an enjoyable and uplifting experience. But we should also keep in mind that we are not entertainers;
being too gregarious undermines the importance of the learning enterprise and erodes credibility. While we
want to be warm and good humoured, and encourage students to be this too, we do not want to undermine
their faith in us as credible and knowledgeable. We want them to understand that learning involves a great
deal of work and considerable challenge, and also be aware that this is what makes learning rewarding and
worthwhile (e.g. value-adding for them).
   Degrees of humour can be used carefully and strategically to stimulate a positive and engaging
environment to break down barriers, helping ensure learning is an enjoyable experience as well as a
developmental one. Humour is a powerful ally that we should utilise, but it can also be risky if not
handled strategically and thoughtfully.
   Narrative - storytelling
   Stories and anecdotes, both personal and professional, can work very effectively to engage and
demonstrate concepts, principles, processes and lessons on effective and good practice. However, they can
have the opposite effect if not well chosen. They can be unengaging and student feedback, worldwide
(universally) confirms this. Having said this, narratives, including those based on personal interests, can
                                                                                                       LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY | 85

convey information powerfully and engage interest and therefore continue to be a valuable teaching
approach.

   I have drawn on my interest in guitars with the Stratocaster as one example when exploring brand
identity creation. This 1950s brand naming sought to capitalise on space exploration as a new and exciting
frontier; the name was derived from `stratosphere'. It is a light touch example that takes less than twenty
seconds to include, aiding understanding without requiring any knowledge or interest in music or
instruments

   Stories from professional practice can be a rich source of learning relevancy and authenticity. They are
also referred to as war stories, by some educators. But once again, the same checks and balances need to be
applied as for all forms of narrative, as outlined in check list below, like; being clear and to the point, and
making the purpose explicit.

   Common complaints from students
   - Too many scenarios and examples that lack relevance.
   - Too many personal life stories from teachers that and are too far off topic.
   Note, that just because we find a story meaningful, appealing and useful, it is not enough to guarantee
students will see relevance or appeal, even more so if the relevance is not explained and not kept short.

       Checklist considerations

            1. Critical self-awareness: Consider whether a story you find useful and appealing will

                be interesting to students.

           2. Check or test your ideas with others for relevance, merit, appeal and

                comprehensibility before using.

           3. Critically assess your story: Does it have clear relevancy and relatability for the

                student audience?

           4. Attention to student feedback in all forms e.g. past surveys, body and language cues

                during learning sessions.

           5. Critical self-awareness: Resist urges to drift into stories as they cross your mind:

                pause for thought first.

           6. Be clear in your mind that a story connects to a learning objective.

           7. Be clear in explaining story relevance and connection to a learning objective e.g., what
86 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

                is the learning point to be learned? (make this clear before proceeding with story).

Awareness of modelling behaviour and the observational nature of learning
   Modelling behaviour is a part of the package of education but, its importance is sometimes overlooked.

A great deal of learning is observational: for example, how we learn language and the ability to speak in early
life. For example, Social Learning Theory (Bandura, 1977) emphasises how people learn by observation
through modelling by others, especially those who have influence. Students observe teachers as role models
and points of reference e.g., whom they see as successful and possessing keys to success in both study and
professional practice.

   In the formal learning context of students, they tend to see us as being successful and knowledgeable,
and naturally look to us, including our cues and behaviour patterns, as a part of the learning process. This
then, includes our use of `interest attracting' measures like humour and narrative.

   Novelty in learning delivery examples
   1. The interest hook here is a guitar used as a prop to convey a communication theory principle
linked to a learning objective. The lesson seeks to give insight and understanding into how language, as
a system is thought to work to produce meaning. Music is used as something somewhat comparable to a
language system where musical notes produce meaning, but in the form of melodies. The key point is that,
theoretically, it is the relationships between the `words' in language systems that work to produce meaning,
more so that words themselves and that this is not dissimilar to way musical notes work. Music is used to
demonstrate that it is the relationship between notes that produces melodies, more so than the notes within
themselves. Note, the sound of the music played was not captured on this video. `Signification demo with
music notes` (video; 2'28"; CC-BY).

presented in an activity forum. This `Folk Theory trial demo activity` (video; 1'31"; CC-BY) is an online live
lecture rendition on demonstrating this exercise using student involvement, in preparation for the forum
activity. It is also an example of pre-teaching, because it is short introduction for preparation.

Gamification can take many forms, it is often effective for stimulating interest in subject content by adding
enjoyment and rewards. It can increase engagement in ways that promote deeper learning that is highly
interactive and facilitates more efficient learning i.e., faster acquisition. It can also promote a sense of
community (peer relations) and belonging when design includes student interaction. Gamification can also
be deployed as a fully blown learning design e.g., in language learning apps.

Learning design formats

Gagné's (1992) Instructional Design model provides a structured approach that can be used to aid
planning and designing content and steps for learning sessions. Planning should begin with determining
learning objectives, i.e., specific outcomes desired and then context factors like existing level of student
knowledge (e.g., beginning, advanced) and the nature of the content and skill area. From there
consideration can turn to the designing of approaches, techniques and specific steps for a learning session.

       Instructional design (Gagné) Design steps, check list tips
            1. Gain attention stimulate interest (interest hook)
           2. Inform make learning objectives/aims clear
88 | LEARNING DESIGNS AND DELIVERY

           3. Stimulate recall (e.g., prior learning)and information needed for proceeding
           4. Provide new information, involve learners to co-construct understanding1

           5. Provide guidance corrective, supportive on comprehension
           6. Activity to elicit performance practice, apply and analyse and/or explore2
           7. Provide feedback corrective support during e.g. activities2

           8. Assess performance, give evaluative feedback
           9. Aid retention (opportunity) learners reflect on e.g., value, applicability3

       NOTES
       1 Providing new information strategies and techniques
       Providing new information can include clear and direct explanations, visual representations
       e.g., diagrams and mapping; demonstrative analogies; demonstrative case studies; real or
       realistic examples of professional practice; and workplace situations and other kinds of
       applications.
       2 Activity (allow application, or performance) and Feedback
       Structured activities to ensure students receive feedback on their performance to advance
       their learning.
       3 Step 9 may not always be necessary. Keep in mind we want to avoid overload and
       lengthiness.
       The model can work as a checklist, and one which we can develop specific detail from
       general considerations like those in the right column above. There is room for flexibility; not
       all nine steps need be included in every situation.

Recall `muscle memory' learning
   Repetition, like frequent practice (e.g., learning by doing) and performance evaluation (e.g., quiz

checking) are learning design tools suited to learning where precise high-detail recall is critical e.g., from
medical emergency professions, learning a musical instrument, learning to drive. Notably, learning by
doing to support retention is used in the Information Technology (IT) support sector, where users are
guided through problems by executing solutions step-by-step themselves, support technicians intervene
as a last resort. In cliché terms, teaching someone how to catch fish is more effective and beneficial than
providing them with a fish. The IT approach has shown that active engagement, e.g., the act of pushing the
keys yourself aids retention. It also helps build familiarity and skills for greater independence in problems
solving generally.

Content reduction "on the go"

Deciding what content to select for including into lessons and classes is an obvious part of lesson planning,
reason being, to avoid overload. That said, content reduction during delivery, or "on the go" has been
included to here as an idea to help manage situations where you may be required to deliver a course that is
too content heavy (in its present form).

   Selecting content on the basis of highest priority is a common sense way to manage delivery for highly
loaded content situations. The aim in designing delivery here moves to pointing out to students content
the content that is most critical, very often, what is required of them in assessments.

   Ideally, learning objectives (i.e., desired outcomes), should be designed and communicated in learning
sessions that clearly show how the skills and knowledge being covered are needed for success in assessments
and for success in professional work and employment.

Conclusion

This chapter focused on designing activities in ways that help enable and encourage learners to build
competency and confidence, which includes ability and confidence for tackling assessments and
professional work tasks and duties.

   Lecturers and teachers have a critical role to play in stimulating student interest and motivation to learn.
This includes providing interesting content and learning sessions and striving to develop a genuine sense of
ownership and belonging, a `students as partners' ecosystem in learning sessions as they take place. High-
engagement design features in microlearning are also aimed at deep learning which increases retention of
skills and knowledge as well as mastery in applying them. Accordingly, we should encourage to learners
challenge themselves to think creatively and independently, and then provide corrective guidance as needed
in affirming ways and show them that all their contributions are a valuable part of the learning journey
process.

   Working from a student-centred design approach this chapter draws on constructivist-learning models
to encourage students to draw on and leverage their own existing knowledge to build understandings of
new concepts that meaningful to them and build confidence in their ability as learners to take in new
information. It is important to provide supportive and non-threatening environments in the delivery and
design of classes, so they feel encouraged to actively participate in building understandings in ways that are
meaningful to them including how they can apply skills and knowledge covered to professional practice as
well as assessments.

   Strategies and techniques underpin design needed for effective engagement. They are used to attract
and sustain interest and include novelty in various forms, like drawing-in intriguing and/or surprising
information (e.g., fun facts), posing thought-provoking questions, interesting and relatable storytelling as
well as use of props (this can include eye catching graphics or visuals).

   For learning to be engaging, it is important that learning experiences are uplifting, for instance, contain
elements of fun. Strategic use of humour (novelty) is conducive to creating positive and welcoming
learning sessions. Humour can break down barriers isolation and alienation to help ensure learning is an
enjoyable and all-inclusive experience while at the same time one that is developmental and outcomes
based.

   Designs for lessons and activities include discussion-based activities for grasping and building
meaningful understandings and applicability, problem/solution-based activities, frequent practice-based
activities for skill building e.g., writing for media activities and quiz-check activities for evaluating recall and
reinforcement of critical and essential skills and knowledge.

   Hybrid learning design, which blends presentation of short units of information with predominantly
activity-based learning sessions is growing in popularity and proving effective for increasing learning and
engagement.

   An awareness of options and possibilities allows us to select, adapt and trial methods in ways that best
suit our subject areas and learners, as well as leverage our own style and teaching strengths.

LEARNING SUPPORTS

Introduction

Previous chapters have covered reducing volume to making learning more inviting and manageable
(Chapter 2), then bite-sizing learning sessions and recordings (Chapter 3), and developing engaging
delivery and lesson designs (Chapter 4). This chapter focuses on how we can further reduce barriers
to learning and engagement with the use of supports. Support measures we can provide include; short
videos and written messages designed to motivate learners to keep going, (e.g., with encouragement and
assurances), useful advice and guidance and communicate in ways that personalise their study experience.
The messages we design, like tips on studying efficiently and guidance on assessments, can ease student load
and impediments to success.

   Student support serves as a student-centred support component in microlearning design. Providing
support, can make a world of difference, especially for those who are vulnerable to losing hope and giving
up. For many, supports we can build in, can be effective in activating motivation and instilling confidence
they need to proceed and stick with it. It is often a critical factor for getting students engaged and keeping
them engaged to retain them over the long term. While support measures, as covered, require some time
and effort, this can be contained with routine and streamlining and pre-empting and catering for student
support needs can also pay efficiency dividends.

   Supports include lecturer presence, with brief lecturer videos, starting with a Welcome to Course (2 or
less minutes), these can then be followed with Introduction to Week (preview) videos to stimulate interest,
engagement as well as personalise the experience for students and help build sense of belonging. Students
who feel comfortable and familiar with their lecturers, tutors and class peers are more likely to engage and
less likely to feel isolated (Congiu & Moscati, 2021).

   The concept of nudging, at its broadest level, is seen as a key support-provision approach in the
context of this book and involves personalised and supportive messaging. This includes messages of
encouragement, nudge messages that prompt students to engage with learning resources and study related
activities, assignment tips and reminders for upcoming due dates. While nudging is commonly understood
as the sending of written message prompts, lecturer videos (mentioned above), also work in similar ways, as
they too, are often used to promote engagement with concepts and recommended resources to help ensure
success in a course. Announcement messages can be used to promote awareness of institutional support
services, including learning and wellbeing.

   Another important way to support our students is with the kind of feedback we give on assessments.
Feedback that is specific and focused on improvement for future performance assessments or work type
96 | LEARNING SUPPORTS

tasks, e.g., public relations content writing. Where possible, feedback should be as instructive as possible.
Ideally, feedback should maximise the efficacy of an assessment, in its function as a learning tool.

  Make grading scoring realities explicit to students to minimise and prevent
misunderstanding and disappointment and help alleviate damage to satisfaction and
motivation.

Lecturer videos

Welcome (overview)

Providing a welcoming and supportive environment from the start is an important first step toward
fostering a sense of connection with the course, and the lecturer, with the warmth of a friendly face to
humanise the learning experience. A personal welcome by a course lecturer provides a positive start and first
encounter.

   This support and engagement strategy is aimed at helping students overcome feelings of isolation,
especially for those studying remotely and online. While this is important for all courses, it is even more so
for large courses where teaching interactions can be mostly with course tutors.

   We can use lecturer videos, like a course welcome and course introduction, to try and nudge students
towards active involvement and commitment to their learning journey. The personal touch and visual
appeal of videos can be used to reduce feelings of isolation (especially in online environments), build sense
of belonging, and set a positive tone for the course ahead. While this is important for all courses, it can be
even more important for large courses where teaching interactions may be mostly with tutors.

   An informal, conversational style works best, so that can see the lecturer is an approachable person and
a supportive ally and genuinely interested in the value of the course to students (promote and stimulate
interest) as well as the quality of their learning experience, demonstrating `care factor'. It helps give a
personalised experience in feel for students when entering the course. A way to personal delivery.

   The lecturer should be foregrounded, so it is best to avoid use of slides. These videos can used for brief
advice on succeeding in the course, selling the value to be gained, stimulating interest (e.g. what makes it
interesting and rewarding) and conveying expectations, but in a positive and encouraging tone. Keeping
videos as short as possible is critical to their success, ideally they should be kept to 1 to 2 minutes.

   Learners are eager to see their lecturers `in person' in videos, particularly, in welcome videos. But in many
cases, they do not appear, and opt for voice-over slides. The problem here is that students want to see you!
If you were in the student role, you would want that too.

   Lecturer appearance is often talked about in the language of `lecturer presence' an apt term that helps
support why foregrounding physical appearance is important. It provides a way for students to connect
with the teacher in a way that helps to humanise and personalise learning and in effect provides emotional
support. While a welcome video is used to establish a connection, we can then continue to develop
connection with follow on weekly introduction to topic videos (discussed next).
                                                                                                                           LEARNING SUPPORTS | 97

   The example (below) `Welcome video' (video; 1'41"; CC-BY) establishes teacher presence, and prepares
the foundation for connection.

Ingredients for effective course welcomes include:

  · enthusiasm: for the course and learners
  · showing care: connection with concern for student success and positive experience
  · brief but interest-capturing introduction e.g. what makes the subject area exciting, appealing and/or

      worthwhile (keep brief, follow on weekly videos can be used to further stimulate interest)
  · concluding with a prompt for action to help students get active and involved. For example, asking

      students to introduce themselves on a course forum, recommending they familiarise themselves with
      the assessments and begin studying the first module.

Introduction to week

While similar to welcome videos, (as above), the aim here is to preview the week's topic, a taster to stimulate
student interest, encourage engagement and build a sense of connection to their teachers, and the learning
process itself (i.e., to view the learning as a worthwhile investment in themselves).

   Providing a 1 to 2 minute introduction for each week and module topic, delivered by the lecturer, not
only personalises learning and increases sense of belonging and connectedness, but is again used to promote
interest the topic and related subtopics week by week to sustain engagement. We can create interest by
highlighting an intriguing aspect of the week's content or practical value i.e., what is to be gained. We
can also use these videos to encourage engagement with high priority learning resources, for example, a
textbook chapter, or a reading, or video.

      Design tip

          A lesson I learned through experience was that making 1 to 2 minute `Introduction to
          module' videos can be done quickly and easily, especially, after the experience of making the
          first few. When I first started, I was making 5 to 6 minute videos and the time and effort
          needed to select and sequence the volume of detail and trying to ensure the video would be
          able to sustain attention, was much more difficult. Return on investment of time and effort
          for these longer videos at the rate of one a week was poor compared with the ease of short
          videos.

     These videos are an opportunity to point out what makes principles to be covered interesting and to link
  to relevance, like the benefits students should expect to gain from this section knowledge. The importance
  of `selling' engagement in the week's learning resources should not be underestimated. In do so, it is
  important to not only mention content topics, like concepts, but to refer to and promote and recommend
  content in the week's learning resources 1.

     If we want students to engage with resources, we should be promoting interest factors, like, what makes
  this author's insights interesting and what is the value to be gained from a reading. As pointed out in
  Chapter 2, on reduction, if a reading is not worth mentioning, then we should ask "is it really worth
  keeping?"

     These videos supplement engagement approaches covered in Chapter 4 learning design, like - drawing
  on interest (e.g., fun facts), injecting positivity and enthusiasm in classes to promote and generate interest
  in topics and material for starting each week. These steps are important because they help address risks that
  around perceptions that topics are not interesting (i.e., appear boring).

     These weekly videos also fit with well with the microlearning delivery strategy of learning in small
  steps, key concepts are introduced, and students then begin their study for the week with some familiarity
  already established. In microlearning speak, some would categorise this as pre-teaching akin to prepping
  i.e. preparing or priming, prior to engagement with learning sessions and reading resources. In this sense,
  introduction to topics, is a delivery method and learning support combined.

     Weekly videos are often best delivered by the lecturer, but they can be done by a course tutor, if need be.
  Alternating video presentations between lecturer and tutors can help build familiarity with both while also
  adding variety to the learning experience.

1. Promotion or `selling' content videos like these are somewhat similar in strategy to nudging (covered shortly), because they also encourage
  students to engage with priority content and resources.
                                                                                                                           LEARNING SUPPORTS | 99

   To help ensure the videos personalise learning, the lecturer or presenter should be foregrounded as much
as possible. This includes keeping slides to a minimum, if used at all, to ensure screen display foregrounds
the presenter. The frequency of weekly introductions is method aimed at providing continuity of
connection for building and maintaining a sense of personalisation and belonging.

   The three videos (below) offer examples of `introduction to week` videos to build continuity of
connection.

Assessment guidance

Short lecturer `how to' video guides provide added support to assist with assessments. They help students
to apply content more effectively for producing well focused assessment work. They can be used to help
students avoid pitfalls, like misinterpretation of assignment instructions and to guide them so they address
the tasks and criteria required for assessments correctly.

   Videos are a relatable medium for students for conveying what is required of them to effectively and
successfully undertake assessments. Again, a conversational tone can be used to create the feeling of the
lecturer speaking directly to students in a manner akin to a face-to-face learning experience. The lecturer
or teaching team member can foreground themselves for the opening before going on to display and work
100 | LEARNING SUPPORTS

through task instructions and marking criteria along with any other material that is useful, for example,
checklists, points of note, pitfalls to look out for, etc.

   A guidance assessment video should be provided from each assessment and therefore tailored for exams.
A video length of 2-4 minutes for each works well. For assessments that require more time, like large or
complex assessments, longer recordings can be segmented into instalments.

   Providing or including an explanation of the relevance of the assessment, e.g. value of an assignment to
employment or job capability or proficiency, is an option, but not needed if relevance details are already
provided in the opening to assignment task instructions.

   If relevance e.g., to industry, information is included with assignment instructions, ensure explanations
are short and avoid repetition. Adhere to microlearning design principles of keeping materials as clear,
direct and succinct as possible to reduce unnecessary overload to allow focus on the most essential and
critical information. A good check-question to ask here: Is this information adding or detracting from the
purpose of - useful `need to know' assignment guidance?

   Instructional `how to tackle' the assessment item is very useful for students. A tour of the marking
criteria and marks allocated also helps ensure that criteria are not overlooked and that they are fully
addressed. Providing tips, like common pitfalls, help fend off slippages in criterion score. Doing this is an
example of `feeding forward' ahead of post assignment feedback.

   The first assessment guidance video (below) is informal in tone, and an update and addition to two
previous assessment guide videos and as such more general (i.e. less specific).

   Example 1: `Assignment guidance 1` (video; 1'44"; CC-BY), is informal in tone, and an update and

Nudging: to encourage, promote and support

Nudging refers to the use of positive message prompts and messages of support and guidance that are
conveyed in a gentle and personalised style. They are often used to encourage students to engage with
online learning resources and keep them on track with their progress. This support helps students manage
assessment tasks, i.e., start and complete on time, lower the risk of falling behind, and flow on effects of
becoming overwhelmed to the point of not completing assessments - ultimately risking failing a course
(Graham, et.al., 2017).

   Nudging is a learning support intervention technique designed to encourage learners to engage more
actively in courses (Congiu & Moscati, 2021). It is a useful for motivating learners and for sustaining
motivation to stay engaged and thus increase their chances of successful completion. Support can be
especially important for online students who have fewer ways to engage and receive support, and often have
greater demands on their time and attention, e.g. jobs, young family.

   Learning resources nudging is the most widely known form of nudging in online learning education.
Formally, and mostly commonly known nudging, is the Nudging Protocol (Congiu & Moscati, 2021), it is
used for promoting engagement with course learning resources identified as most important or critical to
success. Resources promoted, are often, but not limited to, set readings, probably because longer form text
materials can seem more difficult and thus less inviting. Nudge messaging can also include reminders and
alerts, like, nearing due dates.

   A key principle underpinning the nudging strategy is that their effectiveness is not overusing them.
Nudging becomes nagging when used too often (Congiu & Moscati, 2021). At worst, overused and overly
directive nudging can overwhelm learners and make them feel that they are being threatened and criticised,
and demotivate rather than motivate them. Overuse adds to information overload and as such, annoying
`noise' or clutter than can turn students off reading messages, let alone accessing resources and advice
within. Overdoing engagement initiatives leads to engagement fatigue.

Direct messaging: Encouragement and support

Direct messaging usually involves messaging all class members, with the option of selecting students in
need. It retains a direct and personalised style of communication in tone and feel, and probably more so
than posting information and announcements on course forums because students receive these as emails.
These are generated via the online learning platform and sent once a week, and when warranted, two in
one week, being mindful to avoid excessive sending of messages. Having said that, email messages have the
advantage of reaching students who may not have checked forums for messages and updates.
These `check in' messages of encouragement, are aimed and trying to stay connected with students and
provide encouragement and support. It is a strategy that works in conjunction with weekly videos, so they
can also be used to promote interest in upcoming classes and topics and concepts being covered.

HELPFUL TIPS
Approach assignment as a series of smaller tasks and sections (headings: in marking criteria)
that you do one-by-one, rather than looking at it as one `big', whole assignment.
Doing a little each day, or as regularly as possible, a process of building it bit-by-bit can make
the task quite easy. You can start by making dot points, as a planning method, for the section
headings.

     am here to support you and help ensure your success.
     The first two modules and weeks lay important knowledge foundations on key principles and
     ideas underpinning science and research. This knowledge is essential pre-knowledge before
     moving into the study of research methods. You can draw on and include, in brief, some of the
     key ideas from this video in your assignments.
     There is a lot of support available to you including sample assignments to review (these are
     now on study desk ASSESSMENT). Make an early start, starting by taking small steps often
     with your assignment work - is the key to success with minimal stress.
     Remember, I am here to support you and help ensure your success.

Promoting learning support services

Promoting other learning support services, including institution supports offered by student support
services and library services, including study sessions (e.g. mathematics, writing), generic assignment
guidance and proof reading services, can be broadcast on course home pages and mentioned sparingly with
announcement messages. Be careful not to over-do, i.e. repeatedly promote.
                                                                                                                          LEARNING SUPPORTS | 107

Assessment feedback and expectations setting

Guidance and feedback on assessments is a critical point for providing support.
   `Paying it forward' is a useful strategy for pointing out pitfalls where students in the past have missed

out on marks due to oversights - a way of heading off problems ahead of submission. Assignment guidance
information should be timed to minimise overload e.g., bit-by-bit instalments, e.g., in nudge messaging.

   Assessment is not only important for educators as our measure of learning performance, but even more
so for our students, it is a `bottom-line' matter. So, scoring (i.e., grading) submitted work and giving
feedback warrant care and attention, as is, showing students that care has been taken.

   Feedback should be as instructive as possible and maximise the learning-value an assessment. Instructive
feedback is supportive as it provides information on areas for improvement to increase performance and
in the quality of their work and where possible in assignments to follow. It should be a component of the
learning journey. See Appendix: Essay advice and Feedback

     Instructive feedback example

     Congratulations James - 70% Credit
     Your literature review effectively outlines the scope of your research, very well done here.
     Further development in places would strengthen the work further still and add significantly
     more value, see feedback within. For instance, draw more on course readings on research
     methods (references) to strengthen support and justification for your chosen research methods
     with more detail about strengths and limitations.
     Feedback from this assignment should be useful in assisting you with your final assignment.

Marking criterion-based rubrics: Well detailed criterion-based rubrics can also play an important role
as a feedback tool (Refer: Chapter 2 on Constructive Alignment)

Setting expectations about grading

Student perceptions on the grades students are awarded for their assessment work is a major source of
disappointment and dissatisfaction for many students.
108 | LEARNING SUPPORTS

   This is understandable because the standards and conventions of grading the system in higher education
appear harsh and the number scoring used are not explained early on. As a result, students often find grades
they receive for their effort disappointing, demotivating and even distressing.

   The answer to clearing up this issue lies in explaining the grade scoring system and making expectations
clear is an important support-line for students. We carry responsibility for informing students to minimise
and prevent misunderstanding and disappointment; not doing so runs the risk of misleading them. Clear
and focused communication is warranted in this area of need, so that we can assist students with
maintaining their motivation and help ensure their learning experience remains positive yet grounded.

   Accordingly, we need to make grade scores and realities around levels of attainment explicit to students,
especially merit grades e.g., `distinction' and `high distinction', to help our students realistically manage
expectations on higher education grading standards and conventions. This is an area that warrants
attention.

Supporting and managing learning journey stresses

The better we understand the stresses our students face the better able we are to be able to support them.
Here are some stress factors to consider when working with students:

  · Lifeload refers to the commitments learners bring to the study environment. They do not arrive free
      of other obligations beside study; they too live in a world of competing commitments e.g., work life
      and time pressures.

  · Cognitive load is the load learning places on people. It becomes problematic when it leads to
      overload, which can be stressful, confusing, and depleting.

  · The stresses of life and learning also create emotional strain, which can confuse and erode cognitive
      processing resources.

Recognising the realities of our learners helps us become more effective teachers. Being empathetic and
responsive, including being a good role model, are ways we can support students through their learning
journey. Setting respectful boundaries plays at part, pandering, i.e., giving in to unreasonable demands
undermines the goal of developing responsible, resilient and self-reliant graduates and self-directed lifelong
learners.

Conclusion

Lecturers and teachers have a critical role to play in encouraging student interest and motivation in
learning. In addition to high-engagement design features in microlearning aimed at increasing engagement
and improving learning performance. Providing additional supports can play a critical role in facilitating a
genuine sense of ownership and belonging, and sense of confidence.

Supports include lecturer presence, through lecturer videos starting with a welcome and introduction to
                                                                                                                         LEARNING SUPPORTS | 109

course video. introduction and welcome and introduction to week (preview) videos can be used to help
increase engagement and improve student experience. Personalised (styled) messages of encouragement
including written nudging prompts can be used to stimulate interest in concepts and principles, promote
critical learning resources, convey guidance tips and encouragement, and also, to raise awareness and uptake
of available institution support services. We can also support learning with instructive feedback for future
performance, especially on assessments.

   Weekly introduction videos to introduce and promote topic for the week and personalise learning,
reduce feelings of isolation and create interest and curiosity by highlighting interesting aspects of important
learning resources and/or concepts to be covered. Short weekly videos personalise learning through a
supportive and `friendly face' for students i.e., lecturer presence, and promote content in ways that enthuse
and stimulate interest in topics week by week.

  · Nudge messaging helps make learning more engaging and enjoyable for students
  · Use nudging to provide positive encouragement messages and prompts, like promoting engagement

      with learning resources of high importance.
  · Assignment guidance support messaging (e.g., short weekly tips), increases grades and completions

      with the timely reminders and supportive alerts.
  · Nudging has the potential to help prevent students from dropping out of courses and foster a

      culture of academic success by encouraging learners to set goals and monitor their progress.
  · Make grading scoring realities explicit to students to minimise and prevent misunderstanding and

      disappointment (to alleviate depleting of satisfaction and motivation).

GLOSSARY

Cognitive Load: the amount of working memory resources one requires for a task / learning task (Sweller
2010; Lovel 2020). A larger and more complex task increases demand on cognitive load.

  · Extraneous load: in the context of the cognitive load framework, extraneous load refers to load that
      results from how information is presented (incl., design in the delivery of learning). It translates to
      `learning design' load. Our aim as learning designers is to design and present content in ways that
      ease load. As an added note, interactive lesson design tends to increase learning absorption by
      actively involving learners.

  · Intrinsic load: is natural or inherent difficulty of content and its volume (low, mid, high) e.g.
      ranging from a simple recipe to a very complex recipe.

  · Long term memory: is the brain's knowledge storage system once new content has been absorbed.
      It is robust (normally), however, accessing information stored requires retrieval, it carries some
      limitations. We also depend on it for interpreting and processing information.

  · Cognitive overload stress: stress associated anxiety, manifests as feelings of being overwhelmed
      and, or, confused.

  · Working memory: capacity for information in-take, it equates to a person's processing power.
      Working memory is highly limited.

  · Germane load: refers to the mental resources (load) required to grasp and integrate new
      information into long-term memory. It is closely connected to the concept of working memory,
      and refers to load placed working memory (i.e., working memory load). Many use the term working
      memory to refer to germane load.

Constructivist learning: is an approach that posits that learning can be more effective when students
have the opportunity to develop or construct their own knowledge for better understandings through
active engagement with principles and concepts (Steffe & Gale 2012). We facilitate this through activities
that place the student at the centre of learning (discussed earlier). We encourage students to draw on their
personal and existing understandings to help learners grasp new information in ways that are meaningful
to them (see social constructivist learning).

   Practical value: refers to the applicability and usefulness content and/or skills being covered, In the
microlearning context, practical value falls into categories applicability to: (a) profession and work
competency, (b) competency and preparedness for performance on set assessments (c) transferable
knowledge and competencies as life skills i.e. skills for managing the demands of life (e.g. communication,
relationship skills), that can also serve profession and work competency.

   Relatability: pertains to delivering information in ways learners can relate to easily, to increase appeal
and subsequently engagement.
112 | GLOSSARY

   Relevance Linking: is/involves referring to the practical value of content and/or skills being covered. It
enables learners to see purpose in material they are studying and being exposed to and as such attracts their
attention and motivates interest. The relevance of content and materials are often not apparent to students
(a regular criticism in student feedback). The value and efficacy of relevance linking is can inadvertently
overlooked, or underestimated, by educators e.g., teachers, lecturers, instructors. (see practical value).

   Social constructivist learning: an approach that extends constructivist learning, by going on to posit
that learners construct knowledge more effectively when they are able to interact with other learners, i.e.
group or peer learning is preferable (Vygotsky, 1978).

General feedback

Remember always - your central aim in an essay task is to argue your stated thesis in relation to the given
question. Hence essays were assessed on how well the thesis was argued.

   Note that producing an assignment at university level is a demanding task which involves coming
to terms with the literacy skills of a new "academic" culture which has many pitfalls. The feedback
comments are aimed at providing you with further direction in terms of developing your understanding
114 | APPENDIX

of the requirements of an academic paper/assignment. So please do not be discouraged by the feedback
comments as they are intended to provide you with constructive criticism - as opposed to a form of
punishment.

   It is also important to note that the university requires markers to award a percentage mark - from which
the grade is then extracted. This means that the marks given may appear to be unduly harsh. To illustrate:
65% = 26/40 = "B" credit level grade. While a "B" level grade represents commendable performance, the
numeric representation can inadvertently give the impression of a low level performance.

   The grading system is designed to rate and show level of performance, distinction (A) grades and higher
indicate very high level and outstanding level performance.

GOOD ESSAYS:

  · Started `on task' with a thesis statement that addresses the set question accurately (that is,
      appropriate focus) as the first sentence - and then stayed `on task' by linking back to the thesis
      regularly

  · Consistently provided arguments (i.e., reached conclusions) that support the stated thesis as opposed
      to descriptive work

ARGUE CASE (FOR, AGAINST or TO AN EXTENT)
   For example, "Why and how public relations has moved away from a manipulation toward credible

ethical practices"
   AS OPPOSED TO DESCRIBING - The history of public relations and surrounding events

  · Provided arguments that were convincing, that is, logical, plausible, and good grounds provided for
      accepting the conclusions made

  · Provided informed arguments with credible sources including course resources e.g. set readings
  · Show good depth of understanding of the set topic and related concepts
  · Provided examples which effectively demonstrate the plausibility of the conclusions being made

      (thereby demonstrating applied knowledge and depth of understanding of concept information)
  · Adhered to the correct structure (intro, body, conclusion) intro = thesis + overview main points
  · Expressed ideas and points clearly, concisely - in a formal tone e.g., avoid cliches and informal

      language
