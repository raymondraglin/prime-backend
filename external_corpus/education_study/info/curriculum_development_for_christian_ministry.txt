Introduction

  Curriculum is a term with a variety of related but nuanced mean-
  ings. Some associate it with a specific course of study in a particular
  school, such as a plan or a document outlining a set of required
  classes. Many colleges and universities have a core curriculum,
  which includes a specific set of courses that all students will expe-
  rience as part of their education. Major and minor courses of study
  have a separate curriculum with another layer of classes designed
  to prepare students within a specific discipline. Curriculum can also
  be understood as the totality of a student's teaching and learning
  experiences within a particular educational setting. This includes
  such components as prescribed classes and coursework, learning
  environments, teachers, students, interpersonal relationships, insti-
  tutional values, and available resources. One of the most common
  ways to think of curriculum is the specific books or publications
  that serve as the content resources for a particular small group or
  individual class. When leaders purchase materials for a discipleship
  small group or recommend texts for a ministry class, they refer to
  them as the curriculum.

              Understanding the origin of a word can bring clarity and
  continuity to the various ways we use the term. The English word
  curriculum comes from the Latin verb currere, which means "to
  run," and the noun curriculum can be verbally translated to mean
  "a racecourse."1 The characteristics of a race or a racecourse are
  reflected in how we envision an educational curriculum or a cur-
  riculum plan. A formal race is set up with a start and finish line and
  boundaries that limit where the participants may run. It might cir-

                                                                                       Introduction | 1
cle a track or stretch across city blocks and run parallel to land-
marks along the route. Sometimes races are open only to those who
qualify. Others are for participants of a particular age, and some
races welcome anyone and everyone to join their event. A race may
include pitstops or sag wagons along the way. They may be timed or
open-ended.

            While races are planned and racecourses carefully con-
structed, not everyone who participates has the same experience
or achieves the same outcome. Runners may be faster or slower;
they may enjoy the community atmosphere or simply endure the
event for the sake of exercise. The same is true for curriculum. It is
purposely designed with consideration given to teaching and learn-
ing for a specified target audience. A curriculum plan attempts to
include everything a person will intentionally encounter on a par-
ticular path that leads toward a defined educational destination.
However, unplanned experiences are also part of the journey; not
everyone learns the same things or in the same ways, even when
participating in the same curriculum.

            Curriculum design is given a lot of attention in education
but is often overlooked in planning for Christian ministry. Strategic
planning is often emphasized by ministry leadership, and while it
has much in common with curriculum planning, it doesn't have the
same precise meaning or intent. A strategy may include some of the
same components as a curriculum plan, such as mission and vision
statements, but it often has a broader focus, and a curriculum plan
is typically one piece of an overall ministry strategy. It might be
helpful to think of the curriculum plan as the road map a ministry
should follow as it seeks to accomplish the overall strategy. The goal
or mission of the curriculum plan and strategy should be identical.

            The process of designing a curriculum is similar for edu-
cation and ministry, but there are often outside governing agencies
that mandate certain components to be included in a school's cur-
riculum plan. These typically include the standards necessary for

2 | Introduction
an institution's accreditation. The process of curriculum planning as
described in this book relates most specifically to Christian educa-
tion, though the principles are the same.

            Historically, the importance of curricular planning for
Christian education has experienced cycles of emphasis and
neglect. Curriculum resources are widely available and more acces-
sible today than ever before due to technological advances. An
internet search can yield a multitude of options that can be down-
loaded immediately, sometimes without a charge. However, an
alarming number of these resources have no foundational design,
and neither do many of the ministries that appropriate them for
their discipleship efforts. This book is a response to these concerns,
written to help ministry students and leaders understand the
importance of curriculum planning and equip them to begin the
process. It includes both theory and practice, building on biblical,
philosophical, and theological foundations, and suggests a sound
approach to developing a curriculum plan for a church or Christian
ministry. Based on years of experience developing curriculum, writ-
ing curriculum resources, and teaching curriculum design, this
book is written as a practical introductory text that provides a pro-
cedure for curriculum development. It isn't a theoretical textbook,
and it isn't exhaustive or intended to be prescriptive in its use of
terms. Each construct and concept should be considered integral to
an effective plan, while the terminology and specific structure are
open to contextualization. Consider it a guide, not a rulebook.

            Many people have become frustrated to discover that one
of their favorite bookstore hangouts is going out of business. Some-
where along the line, businesses that sold books eventually became
ideal places to meet friends or spend some alone time with a warm
beverage while reading a book or thumbing through a magazine.
More and more bookstores began accommodating these experi-
ences, but they were never the main purpose for the stores' exis-
tence. They were designed to get customers in the door and
convince them to frequent their shops over those of the competi-
tion, but the ultimate goal was always to stay in business and make
a profit by selling books. The innovative strategies to attract cus-
tomers worked for a while, but then the ease of online shopping and

6 | Establishing the Essentials
   the rise of ebooks threatened their plans as sales declined. Amazon
   was often blamed for killing the bookstores, but even they eventu-
   ally closed all of their physical retail bookstores.1

               Customers may mourn the loss of a local bookstore that
   closes down, but if it can't fulfill its main objective of making a profit
   selling books, there is no longer a reason for it to exist. Store owners
   can find other ways to survive financially, but if they aren't selling
   books, then they can't stay true to their original purpose of being a
   profitable bookstore.

               The Barnes & Noble chain closed over one hundred stores
   in a fifteen-year period, but then a shift occurred. The company
   found a way to recover and began successfully opening new stores
   again. The goal of making a profit in the bookselling industry didn't
   change, but the store design and retail strategy did. One key factor
   leading to the rebound was that individual store locations were
   given more freedom in which books they stocked for sale, providing
   them the opportunity to supply the books that their local readers
   wanted to buy.2 Chain bookstores aren't the only ones to experience
   a comeback, as hundreds of bookstores have opened and been
   thriving in recent years.

               People seem drawn to the community aspect of a local
   bookshop. They can talk with others about what they've read or gain
   firsthand recommendations. When they order something online,
   they generally search for something specific, but browsing in a shop
   allows readers to discover something new they didn't know existed,

leading to increased sales. Regardless of the values or strategic
changes made by store owners, their purpose remains the same.
They exist to make a profit by providing readers with books.

            The Church is not a business, but it also exists to fulfill a
specific purpose. For Christians, the Church is the body of Christ,
which includes all people who have accepted Christ's gift of salva-
tion and are committed to following his teachings. The word church
comes from the Greek ekklesia, which consists of kaleo (to call)
and the prefix ek (out). The Christian Church is the group of peo-
ple called out of the world to follow Christ. It was intentionally ini-
tiated as an institution by Jesus, designed to nurture and develop
disciples as it grows through evangelism and thrives through wor-
ship and fellowship. Everything it does should honor and fulfill the
divine purpose for which it was established (Matthew 28:18-20). A
well-constructed curriculum plan is a means toward accomplishing
that purpose.

            As described in the introduction to this book, a curriculum
is like a racecourse, a path, or a route leading to a particular des-
tination. Developing a curriculum for Christian ministry must be
focused on designing a plan to help people grow toward Christ's
specific, unchangeable purpose for his Church. Humanity will con-
tinuously change in a variety of ways because we are all shaped by
our cultural surroundings, and culture is never static. History (time),
geography (place), and technology are some of the strongest influ-
ences on culture, and Christians cannot ignore their impact. Teach-
ing methods, learning environments, and even subject content must
adapt in consideration of these cultural shifts if the Church is to
remain focused on realizing its ultimate purpose. In other words,
the path may change, but the final destination will never change.
The destination or purpose of the Church and its teaching ministry
were mandated by God, who is immutable and not bound by time.

 Christian Education/Discipleship

   Christian ministries often use the terms discipleship or spiritual for­
   mation to describe the Church's focus on teaching and learning.
   However, for more than a century, Christian education was the
   predominant designation used by churches, Christian leaders, and
   higher education institutions to identify the specific educational
   programs designed to help Christians grow in their knowledge,
   understanding, and commitment to Jesus Christ. Christian educa-
   tion's emphasis was what we most commonly think of as disciple-
   ship. The following excerpts from twentieth-century definitions are
   representative of that understanding:

         Christian education is the process by which persons are
         confronted with and controlled by the Christian Gospel. It
         involves the efforts of the Christian community to guide
         both young and adult persons toward an ever-richer pos-
         session of the Christian heritage and a fuller participation
         in the life and work of the Christian fellowship.3
         Christian education is a means by which the church seeks
         to help persons respond to the Gospel (the message of
         God's redeeming love in Jesus Christ) and to grow in their
         understanding of its promises and their acceptance of its
         claims.4
         It is education which has for its purpose, first, the gaining
         of personal religious faith...and, second, the development
         of that faith....One must also have a correct conception of
         the nature of Christianity. Christian education has no exis-

   tives of Christian Education: A Study Document (New York:

                                                                   Establishing the Essentials | 9
         tence in its own right....Christian faith and Christian edu-
         cation are inseparable; where the first exists, the second is
         found.5

               As these excerpts exemplify, according to its original
   meaning, the goal of Christian education is distinct from the tradi-
   tional purposes of any other type of education. It is discipleship. It
   isn't simply teaching that acknowledges God or is focused on help-
   ing students learn facts about God, the Bible, or religion. It tran-
   scends human educational goals, which most often include such
   outcomes as gaining knowledge, becoming a better citizen, con-
   tributing to society, or providing what's necessary for a good life. All
   those objectives may be achieved through a solid Christian educa-
   tion curriculum, but they are characteristic outcomes or by-prod-
   ucts of striving to accomplish Christ's mission for his disciples, the
   Church.

               While the term Christian education may still be used and
   understood to describe the Church's teaching ministry, the meaning
   has shifted and expanded over time. In the twenty-first century, it
   most often evokes the idea of an educational institution affiliated
   with a church, denomination, or Christian tradition or a program of
   instruction that is taught from a Christian worldview. The Christian
   schools, colleges, and universities that serve as alternatives to pub-
   lic educational institutions are typically associated with the term
   Christian education. Their purpose is not the same as that of the
   Church's Christian educational mission. This shift in meaning is a
   key reason why discipleship may currently be a more appropriate
   term than Christian education to describe the educational programs
   and purposes within the Church.

               A common way for people to think about discipleship is to
   associate it with religion in general and Christianity in particular. In
   its broadest sense, however, it is a process of intentionally learn-

   1964), 7-17.

   10 | Establishing the Essentials
ing from a master or teacher, and a disciple can be a student of any
particular teacher or school. The Greek word for "disciple" is math­
etes, which describes one who learns from another person, formally
or informally. Christian discipleship occurs when one intentionally
chooses to learn and grow from the teachings of Jesus. Mentors,
pastors, or small group leaders may be the human teachers, but
they are teaching God's Word from Scripture through the power
and counsel of the Holy Spirit, most fully revealed by the life and
teachings of Jesus. Christians often associate the term disciples with
the original twelve men called by Jesus to follow him. The Bible uses
the term disciple most often to describe anyone who has decided to
follow Christ, not just the original twelve apostles. Today it is more
common to use the word Christians to describe those who follow
Christ, but that label wasn't used until after Christ's resurrection:

      Then Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, and when
      he found him, he brought him to Antioch. So for a whole
      year Barnabas and Saul met with the church and taught
      great numbers of people. The disciples were called Chris-
      tians first at Antioch. (Acts 11:25-26, NIV)
      Discipleship means adherence to Christ, and, because
      Christ is the object of that adherence, it must take the form
      of discipleship. An abstract Christology, a doctrinal system,
      a general religious knowledge on the subject of grace or
      on the forgiveness of sins, render discipleship superfluous,
      and in fact they positively exclude any idea of discipleship
      whatever, and are essentially inimical to the whole concep-
      tion of following Christ. With an abstract idea it is possi-
      ble to enter into a relation of formal knowledge, to become
      enthusiastic about it, and perhaps even to put it into prac-
      tice; but it can never be followed in personal obedience.

                                                               Establishing the Essentials | 11
         Christianity without the living Christ is inevitably Chris-
         tianity without discipleship, and Christianity without disci-
         pleship is always Christianity without Christ.6

               The Christians in the Early Church described in the Book
   of Acts were disciples and students of Jesus Christ, whose teachings
   were shared by prophets and teachers such as Barnabas, Saul,
   Simeon called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen (Acts 13:1).
   Wherever we are in the world today, we have that same responsibil-
   ity to teach and help others develop as disciples of Jesus.

             cation. How does your church provide this type of

Mission

A curriculum plan for Christian ministry is a discipleship plan. Its
purpose is to provide a guide for helping all persons develop as dis-
ciples of Jesus Christ. That is the mission of the Church, most clearly
articulated in what is known as the Great Commission. The Church's
mission and the mission of the curriculum plan are the same. Both
are focused on discipleship:

      And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven
      and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make
      disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the
      Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them
      to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am
      with you always, to the end of the age." (Matthew 28:18-20,
      ESV)

            The one imperative in Jesus's instructions is to make disci-
ples, with no one exempt and no people group overlooked. Making
disciples includes baptizing new believers as a sign of their com-
mitment to Christ and then teaching them to live out all of Jesus's
teachings, everything he has taught and commanded. A curriculum
plan is focused on fulfilling this imperative.

            Jesus has given us a clear mission to guide the Church
and, therefore, our curriculum journey. We know where we're
headed--on the path of making disciples. Still, while the curricular
destination is clear, it can be daunting to think about our responsi-
bility to teach everything that Jesus taught. He assured us that he'll

                                                               Establishing the Essentials | 13
be with us; we're not alone in our planning or teaching. But what if
our plan omits something important that Jesus taught? We are lim­
ited in the time we have to teach, so how can we prioritize what
we include in our curriculum? Jesus provided us guidance for this
dilemma through what we call the Great Commandment. When one
of the religious leaders tried to trick him into somehow devaluing
the religious regulations of the day by asking him which of the laws
he viewed as the most important, Jesus responded,

      And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with
      all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.
      This is the great and first commandment. And a second is
      like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these
      two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets."
      (Matthew 22:37-40, ESV)

            Jesus's response didn't omit any of the scriptural teachings.
In verse 40, we read Jesus's clarifying explanation that everything
prescribed in the Law and Prophets is reflected in these two imper-
atives--love God and love others. Taken together, the Great Com-
mission and the Great Commandment provide the heart of our
mission, the directional focus for our discipleship curriculum. The
target, the finish line of our racecourse, must always reflect these
two mandates: to make disciples who love God with every part of
their being and love and value others.

Creating a Mission Statement

A curriculum plan begins with an understanding of the overall mis-
sion for which it is designed. Various terms have been used to
describe this destination, such as an overall goal, objective, or pur-
pose statement. Designating it as a mission statement aligns it most
closely with Jesus's Great Commission. Christians are on a mission
with God, a co-mission, to evangelize and develop disciples. This
includes teaching them to love God with their hearts, souls, minds,

14 | Establishing the Essentials
and strength and to love their neighbors the same way they love
themselves (Mark 12:30-31). The Message expresses it this way: "`The
Lord your God is one; so love the Lord God with all your passion and
prayer and intelligence and energy.' And here is the second: `Love
others as well as you love yourself'" (Mark 12:30-31, MSG).

  · Two key passages, the Great Commission and the Great Com-
      mandment, should guide the mission statement for a Christian
      curriculum plan.

  · A mission statement with this biblical foundation will provide a
      clarifying focus on why the ministry exists and what it seeks to
      accomplish.

            These proclamations of Jesus have often been interpreted
to express the key purposes of the Church as worship, evangelism,
discipleship, fellowship, and ministry or service. A church-based
mission statement may include those purposes specifically, or they
may be understood or suggested by the wording of the overall mis-
sion. Some Christian ministries and para-church organizations have
a narrower focus in terms of their overall purpose or target audi-
ence. For instance, a ministry might understand its particular mis-
sion as developing young Christians to be leaders in their schools,
an organization might have a missional focus of serving local immi-
grants in the name of Jesus, or a ministry might view world evan-
gelism as its primary mission. These organizations still need to
articulate a clear biblical mission that is connected to Christ's over-
all mission for his Church.

  · A mission statement should include a reference to the
      intended target audience, such as a particular age group or
      unique population, if relevant.

Examples

                    According to the National Council of
                    Churches--Nepal, their mission is "to unite the Chris­
                    tian community in Nepal, equip them spiritually;
                    encourage them to be involved in social issues and
                    work for the betterment of society."

                       Freedom for Youth Ministries "empowers youth
                    across Iowa, through the love of Jesus Christ, to break
                    out of bondage, discover their God-given talents, and
                    lead transformed lives."

                       The website for Christ's Church of the Valley (CCV)
                    in Peoria, Arizona, says, "Our mission has always been
                    to reach the Valley for Christ." Their ministry focus is
                    clearly on those who live in their geographical area,
                    known as "the Valley." While this mission is geograph-
                    ically specific, the church also has a more formal mis-
                    sion statement reflective of the Great Commission
                    and Great Commandment: "At CCV, our mission is to
                    WIN people to Christ, TRAIN believers to become disci­
                    ples, and SEND disciples to impact the world."

  · The most effective mission statements are clear and concise
      and most impactful when limited to one sentence. This makes
      them more memorable and increases the chance that those
      within the ministry will understand their overall purpose.
      Sometimes people speak of passing the T-shirt test to deter-
      mine whether a mission statement is sufficiently succinct. If a
      mission statement can easily fit onto a T-shirt, it passes the
      test. They should be simple yet meaningful and use action-ori-
      ented words that clearly communicate.

            Our mission is to lead people to become fully
            devoted followers of Christ. (LifeChurch)
            We exist to Reach Up, Reach Out, and Reach In. (Fellowship
Church)

  · A mission statement provides a clear sense of direction for a
      ministry, which is necessary when designing a curriculum. If
      you don't know where you're headed, it is unlikely that you'll
      arrive at a desirable destination. Disciples don't develop just by
      spending time together in a small group. Disciples are learners
      who benefit and grow through intentional teaching that
      encompasses the knowledge, understanding, attitudes, and
      skills of Jesus Christ.

  · Mission statements are action-oriented and use verbs and
      phrases that reflect momentum and not passivity. Instead of
      saying, "We want to do something," a mission statement says,
      "We will do something, and this is what we will do." Examples
      of action verbs could be words such as create, empower, equip,
      establish, provide, or share.

  · Committing to a common articulated mission can help leaders
      with decision-making related to curricular content, leading to
      unity within a ministry team. Diverse opinions may still arise
      on how to achieve a mission, but without agreement on that
      ultimate objective, any curriculum planning is doomed to fail.

        Select a ministry and write a mission statement that fol-
     lows the guidelines from your reading. You may choose an
     existing ministry with which you have some familiarity, or
     you may envision a new ministry about which you have a
     passion. It may be helpful for you to do an internet search
     to discover various ways that churches and ministry orga-
     nizations have articulated their mission. Don't fall into the
     trap of copying or paraphrasing what others have created.
     While the overall mission of the Church has already been
     established by Jesus, it is important to articulate that mis-
     sion in a way that communicates clearly within your con-
     text. Refer to the previous examples to see how mission
     statements focus on a particular ministry goal for a speci-
     fied audience within a particular area. Remember that the
     mission statement for the ministry is also the mission of the
     curriculum.

Vision

A mission statement describes what a curriculum is trying to
achieve, while a vision paints a picture of what it will look like when
the mission is accomplished. The distinction between mission and
vision statements is often misunderstood, and sometimes they are
reversed in the planning process or even in how they are identi-
fied. Vision statements help us see what the ministry's future can
look like and inspire and motivate us to accomplish the mission. One
helpful way to understand how they differ is to think of them in
terms of a mountain climbing adventure. The mission is to reach the
top of the mountain. That is a succinct and clear statement about
what the group of climbers is going to accomplish together. The

18 | Establishing the Essentials
vision describes what it will be like to stand on top of the moun-
tain once that mission is completed. The vision communicates why
people should want to climb the mountain and provides them with a
glimpse of what it will take to get there. Trying to convince a group
of people to commit to a long and arduous trek up a mountain might
not be successful, especially if they only think of it as a physical
feat that would consume time and energy. A vision is aimed at con-
vincing them why the climb is worth the effort and paints a picture
of what they will experience if they make the climb. They will see
breathtaking views; breathe clean, crisp air; and gain a sense of per-
sonal accomplishment. The vision is a motivational piece, making it
more likely that others will see the value and commit to the mission.

            While mission statements are cognitive and informative,
vision statements emphasize the affective learning domain and
appeal to the heart. They clarify the mission, which is why they
are typically longer than just a sentence. Since effective mission
statements are concise, they can lend themselves to interpretation.
Vision statements can assist in clearing up any confusion. Look back
at some of the examples in the previous section and imagine the
various ways they might be understood in different ministry con-
texts.

            If you do a search for church mission statements, you will
notice many similarities in their use of words. This is to be expected
given our common biblical purpose as the Church. At the same time,
each church and ministry is unique. Inspiring others to reach young
people for Christ in one setting will not look the same in another
location. The vision statement adds colorful details that explain the
ministry's purpose in its unique context.

            Mission statements are grounded in biblical truth and align
with Jesus's teachings, so they are timeless. The language may be
updated to reflect contemporary communication, but the focus
should not change. Vision statements rely on a distinct setting and
the needs, resources, and challenges of that one particular ministry.
These characteristics may fluctuate over time because no church or

                                                               Establishing the Essentials | 19
ministry is immune to change. This reality means that some vision
statements may require occasional revisions to reflect the current
realities.

            Mission statements are more about doing, while vision
statements are about inspiring and helping people glimpse a mental
snapshot of future possibilities. They add details and rationale to the
succinct mission statement that are motivational and help maintain
a focus on the importance of the curriculum.

     Focus Activity

         · How might you describe the differences between
             mission and vision statements? Can you think of
             another illustration other than mountain climbing?

         · If a ministry has a written mission statement, what
             is the value in also creating a vision statement?

         · Can you identify the vision for your current church
             or ministry? If you aren't aware of a formal vision
             statement, how does the church or ministry inspire
             people to serve or participate?

Examples

            The following examples are taken from ministry
            vision statements expressed by students from var-
            ious countries. They are not complete, but as you
            read these excerpts, take note of the subtle con-
            textual differences that are expressed. (Note: In

20 | Establishing the Essentials
many of these examples, English is not a first lan-
guage. While some of the phrasing may initially be
confusing, I have chosen to include the words of
the students.)

                 Addis Ababa, Ethiopia: It is evident
                    that there are a lot of issues that
                    aspire to be appealing to the atten-
                    tion of teenagers during this period
                    of transition to adulthood. They
                    start to experience different kinds
                    of changes including physical, emo-
                    tional, psychological and social. It is
                    also a time where they start to look
                    meaning to life independent from
                    what they have been taught by par-
                    ents or guardians. This pursuit of
                    meaning exposes them to different
                    kinds of thought systems, ideolo-
                    gies, philosophies and religions that
                    are amply found in this diversified
                    and fluctuating world. They begin to
                    explore and even try out some of
                    these beliefs that seem to give sense
                    to their enthusiastic minds. This
                    path of exploration has taken some
                    to some cultic and evil ways and
                    directed others to Christ. Most
                    Christians testify that they came to
                    the Lord during this time of adoles-
                    cence. Therefore, this desire to find
                    meaning by itself is not evil but it is
                    important that we help these teens
                    to draw the meaning they are look-
                    ing for from the Word of God.

                                 Hence, it is our vision to see our
                                teenagers make the Word of God
                                the center of their lives and the
                                authority of their decisions.
                             Congo Town, Monrovia, Liberia: My
                                vision is for students to find mean-

                                to shape their daily activities. The
                                purpose or meaning that will give
                                each student the reason to rise up
                                early and goes to bed late without
                                anxiety, fear, and hopelessness.
                                 I dream for this generation to rise
                                and take on responsibility in order
                                to not become liability to families
                                and extended relatives. Also, I envi-
                                sion inspiring students of the sense
                                of responsibility or service in order
                                to become independent adult

                                  I envision students to find their
                                identity, significance and morality
                                in Christ. Since adolescents wres-
                                tles with "who am I," "what is my
                                worth" and what behavior that will
                                bring success in life, students must
                                be inspired to resolved their iden-
                                tity, significance and morality in
                                Christ so as to prevent being iden-
                                tified with wrong identity that will
                                make their lives empty in adulthood.
                             Wisconsin, USA: We seek to help

   textualized worship. We desire for
   our international families to be

    Our international/refugee families
   will be equipped and empowered,
   through the body, to share the love
   of Jesus to their families back home.
    (Pt 2. Challenge) Our church must
   be unified in this mission. As we act
   in hospitality to the foreigner, we
   ought to become increasingly bur-
   dened with their burdens. Their

   one body, must walk hand in hand,
   in brotherly love, with our interna-

   our key to reaching the rest of the
   world with the Gospel of Jesus.
Penang, Malaysia: XXX Church is

   national school, 3-4 schools and a
   neighborhood who has people who
   really need to hear the Gospel of
   Christ. Hence, we aim to reach out
   to young people and adolescents
   who need God by bringing His
   truths to them. However, while
   doing this, we need to train our
   youths to be more committed to
   Christ and to know God's Word
   themselves.

                                has to be placed in priority while
                                not forgetting that our time to reach
                                the lost is getting less and less. The

                           campuses where we live.
       Vision statements should answer questions such as:

               Why is it important to accomplish our mission?
               What is currently keeping the mission from being

                   accomplished?
               What will it take for the mission to succeed?
               What will it look like when we are accomplishing

                   our mission?

       *Remember that vision statements should inspire and
 attract others to follow the mission. They offer a rationale and
 provide hope for the future.

        imperative to accomplish the mission?

    · What words or phrases are included in each of
        these vision statements that make them compelling?

        Using the mission statement you created for the previous
     exercise, craft a three- to five-paragraph vision statement
     that will inspire others to commit to your ministry's mis-
     sion. The excerpts in the previous Example section are only
     partial examples of what a vision statement should include.
     As you consider the vision for your ministry, work to
     include all of the characteristics of a well-developed and
     motivational vision statement.

Core Values

If a mission statement communicates our ministry's purpose and a
vision statement inspires us toward commitment, then core values
are the key beliefs that motivate us and keep us focused. They are
why we do what we do in ministry. If we refer to the previous exam-
ple about mountain climbing, we might think of core values as the
reasons why we're climbing or even the rules we'll follow as we
climb. The mission is to get to the top, the vision motivates us to
climb as we think about what it will be like when we reach the top,
and the core values are the beliefs that motivate us to climb, the
guidelines we will follow, or how we will conduct ourselves along
the way. For instance, mountain climbing values may include phys-
ical fitness and exercise, respect for nature, adventure, looking out
for one another, or a concern for safety.

            Core values in a curriculum are the foundational biblical
truths that compel us to fulfill our purpose. They are why we engage

26 | Establishing the Essentials
in ministry. They are also the beliefs that shape what we do and
how we do it. They define the ministry's character. While it isn't
advisable, the reality is that a church or ministry can exist without
ever giving thought to a mission or vision. Core values, however,
are always in existence. They are operational, whether or not they
are articulated. In other words, every church and organization holds
specific values. They are the beliefs and commitments that drive
ministry decisions. Why does a church decide to include some min­
istry programs and not others? What influences its decisions about
spending or scheduling? Why is it that fundraising is acceptable in
some churches but not others? These are matters of value. Even
though those values may not be clearly communicated, their exis-
tence inevitably determines the ministry's actions. They are operant
core values. Sometimes, the operant values are positive, but that
isn't always the case. This is why it is imperative to carefully con-
sider and identify a ministry's intended core values. Once they are
identified, they then become articulated core values. Articulating a
ministry's values provides a basis to evaluate whether it is genuinely
acting in accordance with what it believes to be of utmost impor-
tance.

            Sometimes, a church's core values are more clearly identi-
fied by an outsider than by those within the ministry. Experiencing
how they are welcomed when they attend a service or event for
the first time gives them a window into the value a church places
on newcomers. One visit may not provide an accurate understand-
ing, but if a pattern is discerned after a few visits, the church's
value in reaching out to visitors is evident. Other value clues are
the property's condition, how corporate worship services are orga-
nized, or the types of programs and events that are held. Looking at
a flyer, bulletin, newsletter, website, or calendar also reveals what
the church or ministry emphasizes or values. What is given the most
attention or time is a strong indicator of values. How much time
is devoted to prayer or studying the Scripture during worship or in
a small group? Are there opportunities for age group teaching and
learning? Does the church engage in ministry within the community?

Observations about such things are indications of the core values
that guide a ministry. If the operant values aren't aligned with the
agreed-upon articulated core values, that is a signal that changes
are needed in the way a ministry carries out its mission.

            Culture changes, but core values should not. As technology
advances, it is necessary to think about how we teach and whether
we need to alter our methods. Flannelgraphs, chalkboards, white-
boards, overhead projectors, PowerPoint, and online streaming rep-
resent technological changes in teaching over the past century, but
they do not reflect a missional shift or a shift in core values. Even
the content of our curriculum may change to address new cultural
challenges. For example, teaching biblical truth about identity and
sexuality today requires the Church to address many topics that
would never have been imagined in past decades. To accomplish the
mission and remain true to its core values, the curricular content
must change. The changes a ministry makes in terms of method-
ology or content may reflect the importance a ministry places on
keeping current, though "keeping current" would probably not be a
core value of the ministry.

  · Biblical truth does not change. The Church's mission does not
      change, and core values should also remain unchanged.

            Core values are biblical commitments and guiding prin-
ciples determined by strong convictions of belief. They aren't the
same as doctrinal statements, even though some core values will
be doctrinal in nature. Doctrinal statements are a comprehensive
explanation of theological beliefs. While core values should align
with biblical truth, they are not, for example, a list of what a ministry

28 | Establishing the Essentials
   believes about God, Jesus, the Holy Spirit, the Church, or end times.
   Core values will reflect doctrine but speak more to a church's
   beliefs, standards, or assumptions related to doctrine.7

               Consider a commitment to the Bible as a core value. Such
   a value will reveal itself through the style of preaching, the selected
   teaching resources, the emphasis on the personal or communal
   reading of Scripture, and even the availability of Bibles within the
   church. Are Bibles read by the members of a small group Bible study,
   or are they only read by the leader or found on a handout? Are the
   words from the biblical text projected on a screen during worship, or
   are people also encouraged to open a Bible? Are sermons and small
   groups focused on a study of Scripture or current topics with little to
   no reference to the Bible? A commitment to the Bible as the authori-
   tative and revealed Word of God is a theological doctrine about the
   nature and importance of Scripture, but identifying it as a core value
   should translate into the ways and rationale for how this belief is
   lived out in the life of a church or ministry.

               Identifying core values can help a church or ministry more
   effectively accomplish its mission. As part of a curriculum plan, they
   are necessary to provide guidance for the content and the struc-
   ture necessary for impactful discipleship. Sometimes, the core val-
   ues operating within a ministry are contradictory and can impede
   the accomplishment of the mission. An example of this may be a
   ministry that values both tradition and reaching younger genera-
   tions with the gospel. While these two values are not necessarily in
   opposition, if too much emphasis is placed on adhering to tradition,
   a ministry's approaches to teaching and learning may be ineffective
   in reaching or discipling a youth population.8

            Within the context of a curriculum plan, it is vital to iden-
tify a small number of core values that will guide the discipleship
experience. Not everything a ministry values can be a core value. If
too many are designated as core, the likelihood that they will pro-
vide genuine guidance in decision-making is low. It is a good idea to
think in terms of no more than five core values.

  · Each value should be identified, explained, and supported by
      Scripture.

     Focus Activity

         · How might you compare and contrast doctrinal
             statements and core values?

         · If a ministry identifies family as a core value, how
             would you expect this value to be evident? What
             would be included in terms of programs, policies, or
             resources? What would you expect the ministry to
             avoid if they truly value family?

         · What core values characterize your church or a
             specific ministry in which you participate? Are they
             clearly stated as core values, or are they operant but
             not articulated?

Examples

            The following examples are taken from curriculum
            plans created by students as part of a class assign-
            ment.

                              tant ways we engage with
                              Christ and become Godly
                              women is through individual
                              and corporate prayer. We
                              experience the love, healing,
                              and freedom of Jesus Christ
                              through prayer.

                     2.Scripture

                                 a.Scripture is the living
                              and active word of God and
                              is all truth. It brings life and
                              equips us to fight battles
                              against the enemy so we can
                              do the good work of the
                              Lord.

                     3.Showing compassion

                                 a.We want to show com-
                              passion and love to those
                              different from us, just as

Jesus did. This means laying

down our lives and loving

them unconditionally by

humbly serving them.

b.1 John 4:11-12, Matthew

20:26-28, 34, Romans 12:10

4.Holiness

a.We are made to be

image-bearers and live pure

and holy lives to reflect the

light of Christ to the world.

This means we are to be set

apart from the world and

show the world Christ

through our humility and

Christlike love.

Sample B

                  1.Putting others before self (servant love)
32 | Establishing the Essentials
            a.Part of the greatest com-
         mandment is to love our
         neighbor as ourselves, our
         youth group wants to take
         that to the next level by
         putting others before our-
         selves. This expresses our
         care for one another and will
         be representative of what
         Christ did while on this
         earth. We are called to follow
         in his footsteps, and was a
         servant even though he
         didn't need to be, that is
         what we are deciding to fol-
         low.

            b.Matthew 25:40, Matthew
         22:37-40
2.Being scripturally grounded and knowledgeable

            a.This is important
         because if we do not know
         what Scripture says, how are
         we to know how to live our
         lives? Scripture is God
         breathed, coming by his own
         accord, if we are to truly be
         grounded in our faith we
         must also be grounded in his
         word.

            b.2 Timothy 3:16, Psalm
         119:105
3.Available for constant community

            a.Accountability and com-
         munity in the faith are ves-
         sels to help us stay rooted in

                              the right things. It is impor-
                              tant to have interaction with
                              others, going through life
                              with others, able to learn,
                              teach, and disciple one
                              another. Students will be
                              able to effectively talk within
                              intergenerational settings,
                              fostering growth from all
                              people.

                              Romans 12:4-5
                     4.Living evangelistically

                                 a.Christ calls us to go
                              throughout the world and
                              preach the gospel. Making
                              disciples and sharing the
                              good news of Jesus Christ.
                              That is central to the Chris-
                              tian life and central to this
                              ministry. We will equip the
                              youth to feel comfortable in
                              these types of situations,
                              helping to show a life lived
                              for kingdom growth.

                     5.Experiencing time with Christ

                                 a.In the Christian life, God
                              is desiring a personal rela-
                              tionship with each and every
                              one of us. Spending time
                              with him is how we learn and
                              mature in our faith the most.
                              Whether it be through
                              prayer, solitude and silence,

34 | Establishing the Essentials
                              reading Scripture, etc. We
                              believe that this is central
                              part to the lives of Christian
                              believers, and it is what we
                              want to engrain into the kids
                              of our youth ministry.

Sample C

                  1.The authority of Scripture
                                 a.Scripture grounds all

                              that we do. We believe that
                              the Bible is the inherent
                              Word of God. God used men
                              to write His words, but we
                              believe and know that Scrip-
                              ture contains messages
                              inspired by his Spirit. Scrip-
                              ture is the foundation that
                              we will come back to for all
                              things, rooting all that we do
                              in that firm foundation.

                     2.The power of prayer and praise

                                 a.Prayer and praise our
                              essential elements that can-
                              not be neglected. Prayer and
                              praise go hand in hand to us.
                              When we praise, worship,
                              and exalt the Lord, our
                              response should be commu-
                              nication with him through

                              prayer. We believe that
                              prayer is fundamentally
                              communication with God,
                              which can take on forms like
                              repentance, supplication, or
                              intercession.

                     3.The guidance of the Spirit

                                 a.We believe that walking
                              in step with the Spirit is
                              indispensable to our spiri-
                              tual vitality and longevity. It
                              is by the spirit that we can
                              live lives that are above
                              reproach; lives of upstand-
                              ing, Christian character.
                              Trusting the guidance of the
                              Spirit means that we are also
                              always willing to go where
                              the Spirit leads, no matter
                              what that looks like.

                                 a.We are meant to live in
                              community with each other.
                              Living in genuine community
                              means we are willing and
                              available to be there for our
                              brothers and sisters no mat-

                         Gospel of Jesus Christ is not
                         something that is supposed
                         to be kept within ourselves
                         or kept within the 4 walls of
                         the church. We have the
                         responsibility to share the
                         Gospel and the love of Jesus
                         to the world. This can take
                         on many forms, from service
                         projects to evangelism and
                         outreach, in order to share
                         the Gospel.

              M. Night Shyamalan's blockbuster 2002 movie Signs stars
  Mel Gibson as a former Episcopal priest, Graham Hess, who lives on
  a farm in rural Pennsylvania with his two children. Hess abandoned
  the Church in a crisis of faith after his wife died in a car accident.
  When Hess begins discovering crop circles in his fields, he initially
  dismisses them as the work of vandals. Then the crop circles begin
  appearing all over the world, and the movie develops into a tale of
  an alien invasion.1

   tural creations are the work of aliens brought to Earth by uniden-
   tified flying objects. One of the earliest historical references to this
   strange phenomenon is found in a book from 1678 called The Mow­
   ing Devil. The book includes a tale about a farmer who refused to
   pay a worker for cutting his oats. As the story goes, the devil cut
   round circles into the farmer's oat fields overnight. Even though
   the oats weren't merely flattened into crop circles but were mowed
   flat, the fable contributes to the belief that crop circles have been
   around for centuries.2

               Why do people hundreds of years later still associate flat-
   tened circles of agricultural crops with aliens and UFOs? It is
   because of a hoax carried out in the 1970s by two friends in England,
   Doug Bower and Dave Chorley. As the two men sat together in a
   pub, laughing and talking about the UFO craze sweeping the world
   and fueled by stories of Roswell, New Mexico, the friends decided
   to create their own fake UFO landing site. Using boards, rope, and
   wire attached to the brim of a baseball hat to create their patterns,
   Bower and Chorley went into a grain field to create their crop circle
   masterpieces. To their dismay, no one even noticed what they had
   done, so they continued taking circle-making trips into the coun-
   tryside over the next few years until the global media finally took
   notice. Soon, UFO enthusiasts began showing up to marvel at these
   creations.3 Crop circle experts emerged, known as cereologists, and
   they began making a living writing and lecturing about this strange
   phenomenon, often insisting that aliens were trying to communi-
   cate with us through cryptic codes. This all changed when Bower
   and Chorley revealed their hoax to journalists in 1991. They demon-
   strated how simple it was to create crop circles by putting on a
   demonstration for the TV cameras. The whole thing took only a few

   minutes. Until 1987, when others began catching on and joining in
   on the hoax, it is believed that all of the crop circles had been cre-
   ated by this same pair of English friends.4

               Even though the hoax was revealed and Bower and Chorley
   admitted to their mischief-making, many still insist that crop circles
   are a form of communication from beyond this world. What causes
   people to see these agricultural circles as messages from aliens even
   though their origin was exposed? It is their deep commitment to the
   paranormal. They view the world through that lens, and their foun-
   dational beliefs color their perceptions. In the opening quote from
   The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Wizard confessed that he had given
   everyone glasses with green lenses. This caused all the people in the
   Emerald City to view everything in Oz as green. In the same way,
   these UFO enthusiasts look at the world and interpret it through
   a set of paranormal glasses, or a paranormal lens. They may even
   accept hoaxes as evidence of unexplained powers because they look
   beyond simple explanations and hold on to their worldview. From
   their perspective, authentic crop circles do exist, created by aliens
   as a form of cryptic code.5

               Everyone looks at the world through a set of glasses, a par-
   ticular lens. Ways of seeing are sometimes known as paradigms or
   frameworks for understanding reality. Stephen Covey explains it as
   "the way we `see' the world--not in terms of our visual sense of sight,

   but in terms of perceiving, understanding, interpreting."6 A more
   common way of describing this perspective-taking is as a world-
   view. Worldviews determine our understanding of how culture and
   society operate, how we interpret life and world events, how we
   interact with others and our surroundings, and how we make deci-
   sions. A biblical foundation for understanding the world is often
   referred to as a Christian worldview. It is a perspective on reality
   founded on the truth of Jesus Christ as encountered in the Bible.
   Experiences and encounters are interpreted in light of this bibli-
   cal reality. While cultural practices and accepted norms shift over
   time, impacting what many people believe and how they respond to
   the world, biblical foundations remain solid and unwavering. Relying
   on this foundation allows Christians to see the world as it is and to
   respond appropriately.

 Biblical Foundations

   Growing as a disciple of Jesus Christ requires learning from him and
   about him and becoming spiritually transformed as we follow him
   in obedience. Scripture is our primary source for knowing what it
   means to live as a disciple, so the Bible must be the foundation of
   a curriculum plan for Christian ministry. While Christians may also
   place a high value on tradition, reason, and personal experience, it
   is important to realize that each of these means of understanding
   God also relies on his revelation through Jesus Christ as recorded in
   Scripture.

            The importance of a biblical foundation for discipleship
may seem self-evident, but many churches and ministries build
their discipleship programs around events, small groups, or Chris-
tian resources with weak connections to Scripture. During a visit
to a church in another state, I read a descriptive list of upcoming
opportunities described as discipleship small groups. Among the
choices were noodle-making, powderpuff mechanics, and a reading
group focused on a recent publication about social media. While
those options might be excellent opportunities for outreach or fel-
lowship, it is difficult to imagine that anything about them could be
described as authentic discipleship. What is most troubling is not
that churches would offer these opportunities but that Christians
might mistakenly believe their participation in such groups was dis-
cipleship and never realize their need for in-depth biblical studies
and practices that would lead to genuine spiritual growth. As stated
in chapter 1, discipleship is about growth toward Christlikeness and
developing a love for God and others.

            Christian authors have produced some valuable resources
to help Christians know God more fully, rely on him through life's
circumstances, and gain biblical perspectives on thinking about cul-
tural change through the lens of faith. These publications can be
instrumental in helping one grow as a disciple, but they cannot
serve as a substitute for studying Scripture within a Christian cur-
riculum. Knowing and following God requires reading and under-
standing what the Bible says about Christ and committing to living
accordingly. We cannot develop as disciples without it. The Bible is
the inspired Word of God, the only authoritative text for learning
and growing toward Christlikeness.

The Bible and Discipleship

All humans are created in the image of God, yet God is distinctly dif-
ferent from his creation. The only way to know God is for him to
reveal himself to us. The magnificence of creation cries out that God
exists and can even provide us with insights into the character and
creativity of God. We call this general revelation or natural revela­
tion, but we cannot know God on a personal level through nature.
He is not contained within us or just the moral conscience that

46 | Biblical and Theological Foundations
guides most humans. Neither is he one with the trees and animals,
a life spirit that is part of nature. God exists apart from his cre-
ation and is "totally other." This reality is known as the transcen­
dence view of God. No amount of human research can allow us to
discover God or unveil a miraculous formula to understand his mys-
teries. The only way we can know God is by his special revelation.
It is a revelation that he has chosen to give us; most significantly,
this revelation came to us through Jesus Christ, fully God and fully
human. Jesus's closest disciples did not understand this:

                Jesus answered, "I am the way and the truth and the
                life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
                If you really know me, you will know my Father as
                well. From now on, you do know him and have seen
                him."

                             Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father and
                that will be enough for us."

                             Jesus answered: "Don't you know me,
                Philip, even after I have been among you such a long
                time? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father.
                How can you say, `Show us the Father'? Don't you
                believe that I am in the Father, and that the Father is
                in me? The words I say to you I do not speak on my
                own authority. Rather, it is the Father, living in me,
                who is doing his work. Believe me when I say that I
                am in the Father and the Father is in me; or at least
                believe on the evidence of the works themselves."

                                                                 John 14:6-11, NIV
            God revealed himself through the incarnation, life, death,
and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Those historical and supernatural
acts took place at a certain point in time yet have impacted all of
history. Knowledge of those events and their significance is possible
because they are revealed in Scripture. God authored the Bible as
the Holy Spirit spoke through men who were faithful to record his
revelation. These men didn't write their own thoughts about God or

                                                Biblical and Theological Foundations | 47
their experiences; they didn't merely journal about historical events
in their region; God gave them the words through the inspiration of
the Holy Spirit:

                For we did not follow cleverly devised stories when
                we told you about the coming of our Lord Jesus
                Christ in power, but we were eyewitnesses of his
                majesty. He received honor and glory from God the
                Father when the voice came to him from the Majes-
                tic Glory, saying, "This is my Son, whom I love; with
                him I am well pleased." We ourselves heard this
                voice that came from heaven when we were with
                him on the sacred mountain.

                            We also have the prophetic message as
                something completely reliable, and you will do well
                to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark
                place, until the day dawns and the morning star
                rises in your hearts. Above all, you must understand
                that no prophecy of Scripture came about by the
                prophet's own interpretation of things. For
                prophecy never had its origin in the human will, but
                prophets, though human, spoke from God as they
                were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

                                                              2 Peter 1:16-21, NIV
            Jesus's life and teachings show that he valued Scripture
and considered what we know as portions of the Old Testament
to be God's Word. He relied on it to defeat Satan's temptations as
he prepared to begin his earthly ministry (Matthew 4:1-11). When
pointing out the hypocrisy of the Pharisees, Jesus reminded them
that though they knew the Law, they didn't practice it, and when
they questioned his actions, he referred them to the words of the
prophets (Matthew 23:1-7; 9:10-13). He used the prophets' writings
to reveal his true identity (Luke 4:16-20). When he spoke the Great
Commandment, he said it was a summary of all the Law and the
Prophets (Matthew 22:37-40).

48 | Biblical and Theological Foundations
               The Bible isn't just an account of how God worked in the
   past or what he communicated in the past, but it is the living reve-
   lation of God today. The Bible isn't the only way God communicates
   with his creation; he continues to speak and reveal himself through
   the text as we read and study his Word. The Bible isn't just a body of
   literature or a collection of principles or facts about God. It doesn't
   just become the Word of God if we can connect our life experiences
   with a particular passage or biblical event. While each of those con-
   ditions may be true, the Bible is much more than that. It is God's
   present revelation; the Holy Spirit continues to speak through the
   Scriptures today. As theologian Michael Bird explains, "When we
   hear the gospel proclaimed or when Scripture is read, we are not only
   hearing facts about God, but we are genuinely encountering God."7
   The ultimate purpose of Scripture is to make God known to us.

               To be a disciple is to know God and choose to follow him,
   which is possible because of God's continued revelation through the
   Bible. This requires more than reading or memorization. A church or
   ministry may say it embraces a high view of Scripture, but if the cur-
   riculum it develops and follows doesn't lead to changed lives, then
   the Bible as the Living Word isn't foundational. As God's special rev-
   elation, the Bible leads disciples to know God, not just know about
   him. Andrew Murray described this significant reality in his classic
   work The Spirit of Christ: "Spiritual knowledge is not deep thought,
   but living contact, entering into and being united to the truth as it is
   in Jesus, a spiritual reality, a substantial substance."8

         I may have in God's book all His precious promises most
         clear and full; I may have learnt perfectly to understand
         how I have but to trust the promise to have it fulfilled; and
         yet utterly fail to find the longed for blessing. The faith that

Theological Foundations

Theology is a term that isn't often used outside of academic environ-
ments, and even mentioning the subject can be intimidating to those
who don't understand what it means. The word theology comes from
two Greek words, theos, meaning "God," and logos, meaning "word."
Theology can be defined as words about God, talking about God,
or the study of God. This includes God's relationship to the world,
his character, and his actions throughout history. Any disciple who
wants to deepen his relationship with God studies the Bible, and
anyone who seeks to live out the gospel of Jesus Christ could be
called a theologian.

            Whenever we read and interpret Scripture, we are engaging
in theology. Whatever we have been taught about God, Jesus Christ,
baptism, the Church, sin, or salvation is all theology. When we ask or

                                                Biblical and Theological Foundations | 51
    answer questions about our faith, we are engaging in theology. The
    imperative to fulfill God's commission to make disciples of all nations
    is a call to be a theologian.

                In its purest form, all theology relies on the authority of
    Scripture to know God and live according to his guidance. However,
    some theologies place a greater emphasis on philosophy, expe-
    rience, tradition, or reason to shape their understanding of who
    God is and what he expects. This doesn't invalidate them, but it is
    important to understand that theology is always an interpretation
    of Scripture and not infallible. It is constructed by men and women
    who hold their own biases and perspectives shaped by personal
    experience. While humans construct theology and often rely on
    reason or Church traditions to make sense of the biblical text, the-
    ology is still helpful and even necessary for our growth as disciples.
    For example, while tradition can be misused and destructive, it is
    important to recognize that Church tradition is what allowed us
    to receive the Bible we have today. Our canon of Scripture was
    not authorized until the fourth century. However, faithful Christians
    prior to that time followed a regula fidei, Latin for "rule of faith."
    The rule of faith was a summary of the biblical story, and it was as
    powerful and authoritative in the lives of the early Christians as the
    Bible is for disciples today. Those who didn't have written copies
    of the rule of faith learned and taught others through the oral tra-
    dition, like their ancestors before them. This tradition--the acts of
    the Church to write, preserve, preach, and faithfully interpret the
    gospel throughout the ages--brought us the Bible.10

                Those who primarily teach or write about theology and
    who see themselves as theologians have devoted themselves to the-
    ological study and are often considered experts. While all theolog-
    ical experts attempt to make sense of the biblical text, they may
    adopt various ways of organizing their understanding. Biblical the-
    ologians often use the major events and themes found in Scripture

     52 | Biblical and Theological Foundations
to structure their thoughts about God, his work, and his charac-
ter. Historical theologians emphasize changes that have shaped the
religious views held by the Church throughout the centuries, and
systematic theologians attempt to organize the entire teaching of
the Bible into themes or topics. Systematic theology may be the
most commonly used organizational form for developing a curricu-
lum plan, though any theological framework may be used. There are
more than a dozen additional theological variations, each organiz-
ing and interpreting Scripture from a particular perspective.

         · How would you explain theology to a Christian who
             doesn't understand the need to study theology?

Theology's Significance

Why should theology serve as a foundation for helping us grow as dis­
ciples? Isn't it sufficient to read and study the Bible as it is written
and allow the Holy Spirit to teach us? Doesn't theology cause confu­
sion and division among Christians? These are all worthy questions,
but they overlook the reality of the meaning of theology. Biblical
study and a careful interpretation of a passage are primary, but the-
ology allows us to accurately and consistently interpret each por-

                                                Biblical and Theological Foundations | 53
tion of Scripture in light of the entire biblical text. Have you ever
read various passages of Scripture that seemed to be contradictory?
For instance, why does Malachi 2:16 say that God hates divorce, but
1 Corinthians 7 provides guidelines for those who divorce? In that
same chapter in 1 Corinthians, Paul says it is better to remain single
than be married, yet in Genesis 2, God declared that it wasn't good
for man to be alone, and Hebrews 13 says that marriage should be
honored. How can we make sense of God's view of marriage with-
out a collective study of the entire biblical narrative that helps us
reconcile what, on the surface, might appear to be contradictory
thoughts? Instead of reading and interpreting passages of Scripture
in isolation and attempting to draw conclusions based on those
interpretations, theology is a means of bringing together the entire
message of the Bible, harmonizing the narrative, and providing a
comprehensive and consistent interpretation of God's Word. It pro-
vides clarity and unity to the biblical narrative.

            Christians don't always agree on specific doctrines, which
are basic beliefs they hold from their interpretation of Scripture.
Theology helps us understand which doctrines are worth protecting
and when we can allow for differences. It allows us to discern which
biblical teachings are essential to the Christian faith and which are
less important. If that statement makes you uncomfortable, con-
sider this advice to the Roman Christians:

                Accept the one whose faith is weak, without quar-
                reling over disputable matters. One person's faith
                allows them to eat anything, but another, whose
                faith is weak, eats only vegetables. The one who eats
                everything must not treat with contempt the one
                who does not, and the one who does not eat every-
                thing must not judge the one who does, for God
                has accepted them. Who are you to judge someone
                else's servant? To their own master, servants stand
                or fall. And they will stand, for the Lord is able to
                make them stand.

54 | Biblical and Theological Foundations
                            One person considers one day more sacred
                than another; another considers every day alike.
                Each of them should be fully convinced in their own
                mind. Whoever regards one day as special does so
                to the Lord. Whoever eats meat does so to the Lord,
                for they give thanks to God; and whoever abstains
                does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God.

                                                               Romans 4:1-6, NIV
            There is room for some diversity in theological under-
standings, but the truth of the gospel cannot be compromised if
Scripture is its primary source. Throughout his ministry, the Apostle
Paul constantly reminded Christians about the centrality of Christ
and the importance of the gospel. In 1 Corinthians 15, he writes,
"Now, brothers and sisters, I want to remind you of the gospel I
preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken
your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word
I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain" (1 Corinthi­
ans 15:1-2, NIV).
            Theological study enables disciples to discern false teach-
ings and respond appropriately. Throughout the New Testament,
Christians were commanded to teach and to make sure that they
were teaching accurately. After Paul was released from his impris-
onment in Rome, he wrote to Titus, who was in Crete. False teaching
was a growing problem within many churches, and from Paul's letter
to Titus, it appears this was especially true in the region of Crete.
In his writing, he not only reminds Titus what to teach to various
groups but also gives him instructions about how to conduct himself
as a teacher: "Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good
works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity, and sound speech
that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame,
having nothing evil to say about us" (Titus 2:7-8, ESV).
            Sound theology equips us to understand and defend the
gospel to both unbelievers and those within the Church who might
be tempted to twist biblical truth. Throughout the history of the
Church, Christians have strayed from the truth of Scripture, adding

                                                Biblical and Theological Foundations | 55
   to or detracting from the biblical narrative. Theologians committed
   to a faithful and thorough study of the Bible under the guidance of
   the Holy Spirit have been God's instruments in restoring orthodoxy
   (sound or correct thought) and orthopraxy (sound or correct prac-
   tice) to Christianity.

               Theological disputes over the nature of Jesus Christ were
   especially pervasive in the first few centuries of the Church's exis-
   tence. Arius, a priest in Alexandria during the fourth century AD,
   taught that Jesus was not God but was created by God. This hereti-
   cal teaching began to spread, prompting the emperor Constantine
   to bring together a council of bishops to construct a theological
   doctrine that would end the controversy. Their work resulted in
   the Nicene Creed of AD 325, which another council of bishops later
   expanded in AD 381. This creed is a theological work that has
   defined orthodox Christianity for more than 1,600 years. It is the
   rule of faith that lays out the boundaries of Christian belief for all
   three branches of the Christian Church: Roman Catholicism, East-
   ern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism.11

      Nicene Creed

                   We believe in one God, the Father, the almighty,
                   maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and
                   unseen.

                                We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the
                   only Son of God, eternally begotten of the Father,
                   God from God, Light from Light, true God from true
                   God, begotten, not made, of one being with the
                   Father. Through him all things were made. For us
                   men and for our salvation he came down from

                heaven; by the power of the Holy Spirit he became
                incarnate of the Virgin Mary, and was made man.
                For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate;
                he suffered death and was buried.

                            On the third day he rose again in accor-
                dance with the scriptures; he ascended into heaven
                and is seated at the right hand of the father. He will
                come again in glory to judge the living and the dead,
                and his kingdom will have no end.

                            We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the
                giver of life, who proceeds from the Father and the
                Son. With the Father and the Son he is worshipped
                and glorified. He has spoken through the Prophets.

                            We believe in one holy catholic and apos-
                tolic Church. We acknowledge one baptism for the
                forgiveness of sins. We look for the resurrection of
                the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.
            The Reformation is another significant example of how the-
ologians brought about change in the Church when its practices
deviated from biblical teaching. Martin Luther is a prominent exam-
ple of this type of reforming theologian, most often identified with
the Protestant Reformation. After carefully reading and studying
Scripture, Luther became troubled by the practices of the Church
that didn't align with what he found in the Bible, such as selling
indulgences, which allowed people to pay for their sins to be for-
given. That teaching cannot be found in the biblical text, yet this
type of corruption was possible because only the priests were
allowed to read and interpret the Scripture. Luther called the
Church back to an emphasis on salvation by faith alone, possible
because of God's grace and not through any additional man-ini-
tiated requirements. His main theological teachings are often
expressed by the Latin sola gratia, sola fide, and sola scriptura,
meaning by grace, faith, and Scripture alone. Growing as a disciple

                                                Biblical and Theological Foundations | 57
requires both orthodoxy and orthopraxy that come through a com-
mitment to the Bible and a willingness to boldly speak out and take
a stand when theological teaching distorts biblical truth.

            The twenty-first-century world is quite different from the
fourth-century world when the Bible was canonized. Regardless of
where one lives, it is hard to imagine a culture that isn't radically
different today than in centuries past. Even the most remote parts
of the globe have been altered to some degree by the proliferation
of technology and globalization. It would be tempting to think that
Scripture is no longer a relevant source of truth or guidance, since
no passages directly speak to some of our contemporary cultural
concerns. The Bible doesn't contain terms such as artificial intelli­
gence, cybercrime, in vitro fertilization, gender identity, recreational
drugs, global warming, or geopolitical warfare. But don't fall into the
trap of faulty thinking that dismisses the Bible as culturally irrele-
vant and outdated. Remember these two important axioms: Human
nature hasn't changed since the beginning of time, and neither has
God. Spiritual discernment on any issue, both now and in the future,
can be found by a study of God's truth. He still speaks through
his Word just as he has through centuries of human progress and
destruction, growth and decline, poverty and prosperity. Theology
is how we can recognize and respond to his voice in ways that are
biblically faithful.

            One of the most significant and invaluable tasks of the the-
ologian is to address contemporary cultural concerns in light of the
full counsel of organized biblical truth. John Kilner, a leading Christ-
ian bioethicist, has written extensively on how a theological under-
standing of the Imago Dei has been instrumental in bringing about
social change and liberation at various points in history. In his book
Why People Matter, Kilner documents how reminding Christians in
North and Latin America that persons in poverty are also made
in God's image mobilized the Church to seek ways to alleviate the
problem of injustice. This theological truth also propelled Christians
to respond compassionately to those with disabilities and those
with HIV/AIDS. It has led people to stand up against the oppression

58 | Biblical and Theological Foundations
    of various groups within the United States, such as Native Amer-
    icans, the enslaved, and women. This theological reality that all
    persons are created in the image of God was a motivational force
    behind the Declaration of Independence and the abolishment of
    slavery in the United States.12 Theology provides us with overarch-
    ing constructs to guide human thought and action in accordance
    with God's purposes, regardless of the concern or the century.

Curriculum Development as Biblical and
Theological

The purpose of a ministry curriculum plan is to provide a logical and
consistent teaching and learning strategy to help persons grow as
disciples. While personal spiritual formation depends on more than
extrinsic experiences and courses of study, those who commit to
follow such a discipleship pathway are choosing to grow. This inten-
tionality in following Jesus makes them more likely to develop into
mature disciples than those who commit to follow but never take
the initiative to develop. In this sense, a curriculum plan is consis-
tent with biblical teaching on the importance of spiritual growth
and maturity. Further support for a curriculum plan is warranted
when the plan is based on a biblical and theological framework, and
the content and direction of the curriculum is derived from a sound
interpretation of Scripture.

            While few would argue against the importance of sound
biblical and theological content in a curriculum plan, not everyone
would agree that the process of curriculum development is neces-

60 | Biblical and Theological Foundations
sary or even biblical. Some churches still approach discipleship as a
regular biblical study that systematically covers the entire text or at
least the "most significant" books. Their focus is on instilling biblical
knowledge and developing informed Christians. The biblical narra-
tive is often reduced to a history book or collection of moral teach-
ings instead of a way to know God more fully. The value and practice
of application and theology are often overlooked or left up to the
individual. Other churches follow a topical approach to discipleship,
using the Bible to support "Christian" perspectives on how to live,
often drawn from resources other than Scripture. Another popu-
lar strategy is to provide a warm community through small groups
that help Christians feel a sense of belonging and a willingness to
share life together. Activity characterizes the discipleship approach
in some Christian communities, with participants primarily engag-
ing in service projects to alleviate needs or eradicate social prob-
lems. Their motivation may stem from a humanitarian commitment
more than obedience to Christ's imperative to love and serve others.
Outreach and evangelistic programs designed to share the gospel
might be evident in some churches, with few teaching or growth
opportunities provided to help new believers develop as disciples.
Each of these alternatives can contribute to spiritual growth, but
none of them are sufficient strategies on their own to help people
grow toward spiritual maturity. Developing and following a curricu-
lum plan reflects a ministry's desire to encourage and nurture holis-
tic spiritual growth that recognizes the significance of teaching and
preparation for spiritual maturity grounded in biblical and theolog-
ical truth:

                He also gave apostles, prophets, missionaries, as
                well as pastors and teachers as gifts to his church.
                Their purpose is to prepare God's people to serve
                and to build up the body of Christ. This is to con-
                tinue until all of us are united in our faith and in
                our knowledge about God's Son, until we become
                mature, until we measure up to Christ, who is the
                standard. Then we will no longer be little children,

                that change like the wind. We will no longer be
                influenced by people who use cunning and clever
                strategies to lead us astray. Instead, as we lovingly
                speak the truth, we will grow up completely in our
                relationship to Christ, who is the head.

              Sheep are misunderstood animals, often described as easily
  frightened, dumb animals. That's not an accurate description, but
  it is easy to categorize and label both animals and people based
  on outward appearances or misinformation. Those who have taken
  the time to research sheep and their behaviors tell us that sheep
  have excellent memories. To humans, they may all look fairly similar,
  but sheep can recognize more than fifty distinct sheep faces and
  remember them for up to two years.1 They're also able to problem-
  solve. Farmers have observed sheep overcoming cattle guards
  designed to contain them in a specific area or keep them from
  devouring a garden. Many sheep have learned to lie down on their

   sides and backs and roll all the way over the metal rails of a cattle
   guard in order to get to the food they crave in a seemingly protected
   garden.2

               If you've ever observed sheep in a field, you might think
   they keep their heads down and eat, oblivious to the other sheep
   surrounding them. Actually, sheep are also very social animals and
   need to see other sheep when they are grazing in a pasture. Main-
   taining visual contact reduces their stress levels, and they will
   become highly agitated if they are separated from the other sheep
   in their flock. You're probably aware that sheep follow a shepherd,
   unlike cattle that have to be driven. Their following instinct is strong
   because of their need to stay together with other sheep in the flock.
   It is something they learn from the time they are born. When sheep
   become frightened, they will band even closer together for safety.
   This banding together is their only real protection from danger,
   except for a watchful shepherd or protective sheepdog. When they
   close ranks and gather into a tight group, it is harder for a wolf or
   other predator to harm them. As you can imagine, it would be much
   more difficult to pick a sheep out of a group than it would be to go
   after a lone stray.3

               The sheep's strong flocking instinct that provides protec-
   tion from danger can also lead to disaster. The desire for community
   means that when one sheep moves, the rest of the herd will follow,
   even if it is a bad idea. In 2005, in the countryside in Turkey, one
   lone sheep decided to jump off a cliff, and the entire flock of approx-

   if you heard a similar account, it is understandable that you might
   shake your head and think about the stupidity of sheep. But knowing
   what you now know about sheep's intelligence and social nature,
   your perspective on such a tragedy would probably be different. You
   might wonder what made the first sheep jump, but you wouldn't
   assume that the rest of the flock did so out of ignorance.

               Humans are also intelligent social animals with individual
   characteristics that make them distinguishable from every other
   human. Even though everyone is unique, all persons share at least
   one commonality: Everyone is created in the image of God. Genesis
   1:27 tells us that "God created mankind in his own image, in the image
   of God he created them; male and female he created them." Galatians
   3:28 reminds us, "There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor
   free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus."
   All people from every corner of the world and economic status have
   worth and value, but no one is exactly the same as anyone else.
   While every person is created in God's image with the capacity to
   know God personally, each individual possesses different abilities,
   gifts, personalities, and strengths. Even identical twins born from
   the same fertilized egg, who share the same DNA, are slightly dif-
   ferent in appearance and aren't always the same in height, physi-
   cal makeup, or resistance to illness and disease. Some differences
   between twins are related to lifestyle choices, but scientists are also

   learning that DNA sequences change slightly over time after birth,
   contributing to the twins' distinctness.5 Even when people seem the
   same as others, there are always differences.

               When observing a group of people in a public setting, it is
   easy to notice both their differences and their commonalities. If you
   hang out at a coffee shop, you'll see people of all shapes, sizes, and
   dispositions ordering their brews in as many different varieties as
   their hair colors. Yet a coffee shop crowd in the US would be eas-
   ily distinguishable from the customers in a coffee shop in Cuba, not
   because of their outward appearances, but by how they want their
   coffee prepared. The general Cuban preference is for dark, strong,
   concentrated coffee, and never decaffeinated. Both groups are cof-
   fee drinkers, but their culture has shaped their preference for how it
   is served. While this might seem like a minor, inconsequential issue,
   it points to a much more significant principle that must be con-
   sidered when developing a curriculum. The Christian educator is
   teaching people, not lessons, and all people are shaped by culture.
   Cultural preferences impact not only beverage choices but, more
   significantly, how people interact, grow, learn, and respond.

Culture and Curriculum

Everyone is a unique creation, but groups within specific cultural
settings have more in common with one another than with those in
other cultural groups. That may seem like common sense if you only
associate culture with a specific ethnicity, such as African, Amer-
ican, Asian, European, or Latin. However, that understanding of a
cultural group is both too broad and too narrow to be useful in cur-
ricular planning. There are currently fifty-four countries in Africa
alone, so assuming they all share the same cultural views would
be naive at best. The word culture has at least a hundred mean-
ings, but a simple way to understand it is as one's total socially
defined life context. Family structure, sports teams, denominations,
and schools are some examples of contexts that are socially defined.
While it isn't generally contemplated or recognized in day-to-day

   living, everything a person does occurs within a cultural context
   that is powerful in its ability to shape attitudes, thoughts, behaviors,
   and values.

               Layers and levels of culture impact standards of appropri-
   ateness for all aspects of life. Where one is located geographically
   matters, from nation, region, state, city, and neighborhood. For
   example, while both locations are in the state of Pennsylvania, urban
   life in Philadelphia is significantly different from life in Lancaster.
   Families, schools, businesses, and individual churches reflect vary-
   ing cultural expectations even within a specific neighborhood. One
   of the largest multisite, nondenominational Evangelical churches in
   the United States is in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and their church
   culture is quite different from the many Amish churches that meet
   in homes in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

         Curricular activities in which children engage in solving
         real-life problems are often different in different regions,
         communities, and neighborhoods where children live.
         Among the influences on curricular activities are geogra-
         phy and natural resources, industry, history, ancestry and
         culture, wealth or income level, social status, race, and
         communities' attitudes and folkways. Some of the influ-
         ences are characteristic of large regions. Others are simple
         ways of living that may be found in one city or county and
         not in another.6

               Generations and age groups are additional cultural sub-
   groups coexisting within the same family or church, reflecting
   diverse perspectives on cultural categories such as dress, music,
   language, artistic expression, entertainment, and interpersonal
   interactions. These are some of the categories representing the
   unique ways groups define themselves and the distinctive charac-
   teristics of a specific group's way of life.

            The introduction to this book noted that a discipleship cur-
riculum is like a racecourse intentionally designed to lead students
on the path to spiritual maturity. While a plan attempts to orga-
nize the journey in a systematic way, the travelers (students) won't
all have the same experience or realize the same outcomes. One of
the main reasons this is true is because culture has shaped the ways
in which they will encounter and interpret the preconstructed road
map. These interpretations lead to unplanned learning and become
part of the curriculum.

 Cross-Cultural Ministry

  Our goal is to communicate the gospel of Jesus Christ effectively
  within the context of a specific culture. To create a curriculum plan
  that will maximize the potential for the spiritual growth of a partic-
  ular target audience, it is imperative to invest time in studying the
  surrounding culture of that specific group of people. Researching
  the cultural context to determine how best to frame a curriculum
  plan might come across as too scientific or sterile, but that is not
  the intent, nor would it be an accurate understanding. Stereotyp-
  ing can lead to prejudging others' abilities, interests, or character
  based on what we've previously experienced, heard, or observed. It
  would be wrong to assume that everyone within a particular context
  is the same as the other people in that context. However, attempt-
  ing to understand and generalize the characteristics of a particular
  group of people is a helpful means of understanding how to teach
  and disciple them toward spiritual maturity most effectively. James
  Plueddemann, a well-respected leader in teaching and cross-cul-
  tural ministry, suggests that effective teachers must not only master
  the content they are teaching but also "appreciate the cultural val­
  ues, needs, and context" of the learners and be able to help learners
  make connections between their context and the content.7

               Where a curriculum takes place matters. Christians col-
  lectively form the Church, the bride of Christ, and are shaped and
  formed in communion with other believers, most often those living
  and worshipping in their communities. The local surroundings--the
  homes, schools, places of employment, and local policies and polit-
  ical systems--shape those who live there. They impact educational
  goals and abilities, attitudes toward authority, the environment,

community leadership, future outlook and aspirations, and family
and personal values. The content and structure of a curriculum plan
will lead toward spiritual growth in proportion to how much con-
sideration is given to the culture in which the target audience lives
and works.

            Earlier in this chapter, I noted the inadequacy of associat-
ing culture only with ethnicity. While it is true that culture is much
more complex than one's nationality or ancestral heritage, there
are important, though sometimes subtle, contrasts between people
groups that must be considered for effective discipleship. When I
was teaching in China, my students listened without asking ques-
tions and were hesitant to engage in my attempts at discussion.
Where I teach in Indiana, when a class is over, many of my Midwest-
ern college students hang around for a conversation, and others are
eager to leave the classroom and get on with their lives. The first
time I taught a seminary class in California with mostly Korean stu-
dents, I was shocked and pleasantly surprised when the class broke
out in applause when the class ended. In a seminary class in Roma-
nia, my students questioned everything I tried to teach them, and
some days, I left feeling like a failure. When I first taught in Cuba,
I was astonished to discover that my students were working late
into the evenings studying and working on their assignments. Noth-
ing was ever submitted late. In some countries where I've taught,
many of the students have emailed their assignments nine months
to a year past the deadlines, hoping to have them accepted. I have
encountered situations where entire groups of students worked
together and submitted the same work, refusing to understand how
that constituted plagiarism. Each of these experiences exemplifies
how students have been enculturated as learners within a particular
context. They reflect culturally normative views on the role of both
teacher and student as well as values about time and integrity.

            Several years ago, I completed a research project in which
I surveyed five distinct groups of teenagers from three countries
on issues that were considered common concerns for all young
people. The students were Caucasian American, Asian American,

                                                               Considering the Audience | 73
Cuban, German, and Russian German. I was interested in whether
their survey responses would be similar across groups, indicating a
strong affiliation with global youth culture, or whether the results
would indicate significant differences between the groups, suggest-
ing that their national and ethnic cultural identities would be more
influential. There were marked differences between the groups on
many of the survey items. For instance, when faced with problems,
Cuban students overwhelmingly indicated they would seek God's
help first, but that was the lowest-ranking response for Caucasian
American students, who said their first source of help would be their
friends. Asian American students favored their parents when seek-
ing help with a problem, with Russian German students ranking par-
ents lower on their list of preferences than any other group in the
study. The greatest area of consensus was that none of the groups
identified pastors or youth ministers as a preferred source of help
with their problems. In fact, three of the five cultural groups ranked
them as their last choice. Research such as this could be consid-
ered useless trivia unless time is taken to understand why various
student groups responded the way they did to each question in the
survey. It could be invaluable to those designing a curriculum plan
for any one of these student groups.

            Cultural studies are helpful in developing a curriculum's
content as well as the ways in which that content will be taught.
They can offer insights into what needs the most emphasis, where
teaching should take place, preferred leadership structures, effec-
tive teaching methods, and even illustrations that would be most
impactful for learning. Cross-cultural missionaries are most suc-
cessful when they take time to learn from and interact with those
they will be serving through listening, observing, and questioning.
In a very real sense, all discipleship strategies involve cross-cultural
ministry. Adults facilitate discipleship groups for students, single
people may teach those who are married or divorced, and individu-
als who have grown up in a community often lead others who have

74 | Considering the Audience
moved into the area from another city, state, or country. In each
instance, teachers must cross cultures as they engage in disciple-
ship ministry.

            Living within a community allows cross-cultural mission-
aries to observe life firsthand and gain a richer and more accurate
understanding of those in another environment, acquiring invalu-
able insights into less tangible aspects of a particular culture known
as the ethos. The type of information collected to understand a
group's ethos is often referred to as psychographics. It is the same
type of information that marketers often gather when trying to
understand consumer groups. The focus is on understanding the
shared values, assumptions, lifestyles, and personality traits of a
particular group in order to reach them most effectively. It isn't
the type of information you can easily count and measure, but it
requires spending time in observation and communication. In soci-
ology and related fields of study, this type of cultural study is often
referred to as ethnography, and it typically involves a study of a year
or more in a particular context. These same ethnographic principles
can be used when developing a curriculum plan for a local ministry,
but it requires intentional observation of the culture or community.

  Biblical Examples

   Christ's sacrifice was necessary for our salvation, and so was his
   humanity. The Heidelberg Catechism includes this significant truth,
   found in question 16: "Q: Why must he be a true and righteous man?
   A: He must be a true man because the justice of God requires that the
   same human nature which has sinned should pay for sin. He must be
   a righteous man because one who himself is a sinner cannot pay for
   others."8 The incarnation was an act of grace, making salvation pos-
   sible, and also an act of cross-cultural ministry. God, in the person
   of Jesus Christ, crossed the boundaries between heaven and earth,
   entering the world as a helpless baby and learning the language and
   customs of his cultural surroundings.

               Jesus honored others' cultures in his teaching and ministry.
   His parables and teaching methods show his desire to communicate
   spiritual truths in a language that would resonate with his audience.
   He crossed cultural barriers to share hope and truth. In John 4, we

read about Jesus's trip from Judaea to Galilee. He traveled through
Samaria, an uncommon practice for Jews who looked down on the
Samaritans for their cultural and religious practices. Samaritans
were part Jew and part Gentile, practicing elements of Judaism
but also worshipping pagan gods. On his trip, Jesus encountered a
woman drawing water from a well during the hottest part of the day,
when most people would have been resting. This Samaritan woman
had been married five times and was currently living with another
man who wasn't her husband, so she probably went for water at
this time to avoid having to face the other women who would have
looked down on her immorality. When Jesus spoke with her, he
intentionally crossed various cultural barriers, including ethnicity,
religion, social class, and gender. This encounter with the woman at
the well wasn't just a passing conversation but Jesus's longest per-
sonal interaction recorded in John.

            Paul understood the importance of culture and that not all
differences matter regarding the truth of the gospel:

                Do not cause anyone to stumble, whether Jews,
                Greeks or the church of God--even as I try to please
                everyone in every way. For I am not seeking my own
                good but the good of many, so that they may be
                saved.

                                                  1 Corinthians 10:32-33, NIV
            He tailored his ministry and teaching to those he was trying
to reach, which required an understanding of cultural differences.
Here are two examples:

                To the Jews I became like a Jew, to win the Jews.
                To those under the law I became like one under the

                win those under the law. To those not having the law

                things to all people so that by all possible means I
                might save some.

                                                    1 Corinthians 9:20-22, NIV
                Now about food sacrificed to idols: We know that
                "We all possess knowledge." But knowledge puffs up
                while love builds up. Those who think they know
                something do not yet know as they ought to know.
                But whoever loves God is known by God.

                            So then, about eating food sacrificed to
                idols: We know that "An idol is nothing at all in the
                world" and that "There is no God but one." For even
                if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on
                earth (as indeed there are many "gods" and many
                "lords"), yet for us there is but one God, the Father,
                from whom all things came and for whom we live;
                and there is but one Lord, Jesus Christ, through
                whom all things came and through whom we live.

                            But not everyone possesses this knowl-
                edge. Some people are still so accustomed to idols
                that when they eat sacrificial food they think of it as
                having been sacrificed to a god, and since their con-
                science is weak, it is defiled. But food does not bring
                us near to God; we are no worse if we do not eat,
                and no better if we do.

                            Be careful, however, that the exercise of
                your rights does not become a stumbling block to
                the weak. For if someone with a weak conscience
                sees you, with all your knowledge, eating in an idol's
                temple, won't that person be emboldened to eat
                what is sacrificed to idols? So this weak brother or
                sister, for whom Christ died, is destroyed by your
                knowledge. When you sin against them in this way
                and wound their weak conscience, you sin against

                sister to fall into sin, I will never eat meat again, so
                that I will not cause them to fall.

Using Demographics

Psychographic cultural information most effectively derived from
ethnographic research is one means of understanding the context
of where a discipleship curriculum will be implemented. It is the
most time-consuming approach to gaining the insights needed for
effective curriculum planning, but it isn't the only strategy neces-
sary. It is also important to gather demographic data about a target
audience. Demographics refers to quantitative data, the numbers

and percentages most often found in charts, graphs, or tables. Tech-

nology makes this much easier to attain than in previous decades.

Demographic data includes information about such things as age

distributions, marital status, income, gender, educational levels,

religious preferences, housing situations, crime levels, and occu-

pations. Depending on where you live, you can search a variety

of government and nonprofit research sites to gather this data.

There are databases that contain collections of worldwide data,

such as Statista (https://www.statista.com/), Our World in Data

(https://ourworldindata.org/), World Health Organization

(https://www.who.int/), and WorldData (https://www.world­

sites that are country or region specific. Within the United States,

or other studies that aren't conducted annually.

Regardless of where or how demographic data is collected,

it is only useful to the extent that it is interpreted the same way

as psychographic information. A list of facts and numbers is mean-

ingless unless effort is given to how the data has impacted, does

impact, or should impact a church or ministry's curriculum plan. It

is helpful to bring together a team to analyze what has been discov-

ered about a particular community or target audience. What does

the data say? What does it mean? How might this inform a curricu­

lum plan?

Harleysville, Pennsylvania, USA

            Harleysville was originally settled by the Pennsyl-
            vania Dutch in the 18th century. There is no data
            on the religious affiliations of persons living within
            Harleysville, but Figure 1 at the end of this docu-
            ment speaks to the religious affiliations of all per-
            sons living in Montgomery County, of which
            Harleysville is a part. This image demonstrates
            that the largest religion in Montgomery County
            is Catholicism, with persons claiming no religion
            coming in a close second. The churches found in
            Harleysville, however, don't seem to demonstrate
            this high concentration of Catholicism, as most of
            the churches are affiliated with either the Men-
            nonite or Brethren denominations. It seems that
            students attending youth group will likely have
            many classmates who have not been exposed to

                                                               Considering the Audience | 81
            Christianity or who are Catholic. With this in mind,
            the youth group should have a variety of outreach
            events planned to reach these students. It also
            seems likely that a portion of the students attend-
            ing youth group will not have grown up within the
            Church. Therefore, the curriculum created should
            cover crucial aspects of Christianity, such as God's
            character, who Jesus was, and what Christian life
            looks like.

Brewerville City, Montserrado, Liberia

            Brewerville was historically occupied by the Dei,
            Gola, and Vai people, but the land was eventually
            given to settlers who were the Americo-Liberians,
            those who returned to Liberia as freed slaves. After
            the civil war in 1990 other groups and tribal people
            from Bomi, Cape Mount, and Lofa Counties settled
            in some communities within Brewerville. There
            are now residents from everywhere. This has
            affected crime, marriages, illegal sale of land and
            drugs just to name a few. Brewerville City has its
            share of crime ranging from petty to serious. To
            mitigate the crime rate, the police and the citizens
            of Brewerville and its environs set up a watch
            team. The city suffers issues like street and home
            robbery, stealing of anything that is forgotten out-
            side, harassment for phones, bags, money, etc.
            Ninety percent of these crimes is done by gangs
            and drugs groups within Brewerville. Many young
            persons have given in to drugs and substance
            abuse and steals from others to be able to support
            their habits. They will uproot plants from the back
            of someone's yard to sell and use the money to

82 | Considering the Audience
  buy drugs. Some of them have left home and are
  dwelling in grave yards and along the streets. They
  will harass and victimize anyone they can. They
  can steal things from their own homes without
  regrets....The majority of the population of Brew-
  erville professes to be Christians. However, it is
  funny how this works here. A person is a Christian
  simply because they are not Muslims, even if they
  are not practicing Christians or accepted Jesus as
  their Lord and Savior. Some of the issues that have
  risen is the robbery being targeted mostly at the
  descendants of the settlers. The settlers too look
  down on the others and do not see them as of
  the same class. It is only of recent that intermar-
  riages and the likes have not been a major problem
  although there are still some families who will
  never allow such. Furthermore, even in the
  churches there are similar problems. The mainline
  churches are mostly descendants of the settlers
  while the newly established ones are mainly
  natives. There is divide and issues of belonging-
  ness and acceptance.

            Given all of the circumstances around the city of
Brewerville, there is a need for this ministry for a greater
influence and impact towards godliness. This generation
needs a change so that they can influence the next gener-
ation. Like Paul says to the Jewish and Gentile believers in
Ephesians, the city needs to understand that it is no longer
natives nor settlers but rather citizens of Brewerville. In
addition, the young people must be rescued from the influ-
ence of drugs, robbery, and immorality. It is not only affect-
ing the children of the natives but also of the settlers.

Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA

            Overall, the potential to start a good college min-
            istry in the Fort Wayne area is good. There are six
            colleges in the city with a total of just under 25,000
            full-time students combined. The campuses vary
            in size and population, with the largest having
            around 10,000 students and the smallest around
            1,000. I would imagine having a small number of
            students from each campus in the church would
            be conducive to reaching them. A good way to
            engage with these students on the campuses
            would be to start small group meetings hosted by
            volunteers working alongside students from the
            church on each of their campuses. These meetings
            would be held on a weekly basis to encourage
            community building among the students already in
            CCFW, as well as provide a space for inviting other
            students on the campus (both Christian and Non).
            There would also be a larger monthly meeting for
            the whole ministry, in which students from each
            separate campus would be invited to fellowship as
            a larger group in the church.

                      Between Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox,
          Christians make up around 53% of the population in Fort
          Wayne. This leaves a combined 47% of people in Fort Wayne
          who are either Non-Christian Religious or Non-Religious
          (the latter being the larger group). If these stats are reflected
          on college campuses, then there are a large number of col-
          lege students who could benefit from growing in their rela-
          tionship with Christ through the ministry as well as a large
          number who could come to encounter Christ. In light of
          this, I would say the weekly meetings would be more of a
          discipleship opportunity (most of the time) for committed

84 | Considering the Audience
          Christians in the ministry, while outreach events and service
          projects could be conducted within the campus communi-
          ties to reach students who do not know Christ.

Diah Town, Grand Cape Mount County, Liberia

            The County is sparsely populated with concen-
            trations in commercial, mining and fishing areas.
            Three ethnic groups: Mande, Gola and Vai occupy
            this county. But the majority is Vai. Most of them
            speak the Vai dialect. It is estimated that 91% of the
            population is a Muslim. Some of them are ortho-
            dox Muslims. They have studied the Quran and are
            eager to practice rule that is spelled out in the
            Islamic law. However, others are nominal Muslims;
            that is, they carry the name but do not practice the
            religious rituals and practices. The Muslim parents
            send their children to attend the Islamic school
            and later become teacher to teach others. The Vai
            people give their daughters early in marriage. They
            do not believe in girl child education.

                      Since the Muslims of the Vai ethnic group are not
          much interested in the English education as compare to the
          Arabic education, most of what will be discussed will be in
          the Arabic translation of the Bible. The Vai ethnic group are
          good story tellers. They learn best through storytelling. Most
          of the history about their origins came down through story.
          At night children sit by the fire and the elders explain to
          them their beliefs and values through storytelling. Some-
          times there are story surrounding a well-known person
          whom the learners can want to identify with. Sometimes
          they even go as far as adopting the name of the hero

          involved. They are very keen at listening to stories. While it
          is true that reading will be done, those who cannot read will
          benefit a lot through listening to the reading done by others.

Irving, Texas, USA

            Fifty-eight and a half percent of people living in
            this area are Asian. Furthermore, 17.8% of people
            are white, 13.1% of people are Black or African
            American, 7.2% of people are Hispanic, 2.6% of
            people are two or more races, 0.4% of people are
            American Indian, and 0.3% are of some other race.
            When it comes to having multiple ethnicities in
            one area, the one thing that needs to happen is
            for this ministry to be a safe place for everyone
            to come together as one body in unity to worship
            the Lord regardless of ethnicity or background.
            There should be youth leaders from every ethnic-
            ity, not just white males and females. One way to
            connect youth is through eating different kinds of
            food from each ethnic background. Another way
            to unite the body as one is by having other groups
            of similar ages be together regardless of their eth-
            nicity because each of the different ethnicities has
            and will experience different things in their life-
            time. The students will be able to learn from each
            other by being in groups that are similar in age and
            gender but have a combination of ethnicities.

Jackson, Michigan, USA

            According to census.gov, the percentage of people
            graduating high school from ages 25+ was 87.1%,
            but the percentage of people obtaining a bache-
            lor's degree or higher ages 25+ was 15.2%. These
            education statistics show that most of the work-
            force will have more manufacturing jobs or admin-
            istrative jobs, which is what the employment
            statistics show above. This is very important for
            ministry opportunities because there will be lots
            of young adults in Jackson who aren't going to col-
            lege. This can cause loneliness, and even insecu-
            rity among young adults. It will be important to
            reach out to young adults and extend an invitation,
            so they can have a community surrounding them.

                      According to City-Data, there are 32,647 households
          in Jackson. 5,585 of these householders are male and 2,301 of
          these males are living alone. There are 7,625 female house-
          holders and 3,027 of these women are living alone. One of
          the most important facts is that there are 4,752 single-parent
          households (1,135 men and 3,617 women). According to
          mdch.state.mi.us, there were 430 divorces in Jackson 2021,
          with a rate of 5.4. This is very important information to
          know because a lot of my students may be missing father or
          mother figure in the home. Based off the data, it seems the
          most common prediction is an absence of a father. A strat-
          egy in my ministry would be to emphasize that God is our
          loving Father when we accept Christ into our hearts. Also,
          another important thing to do is get the parents involved in
          our church. Yes, make sure the students feel welcome, but
          also make sure the adults are invited as well. Secondly, many
          students could be impacted by divorce and broken families.
          In my ministry, this would impact how I talk about relation-
          ships between the two-sexes. I would emphasize the impor-

                                                               Considering the Audience | 87
          tance of honoring men and women and sex. Lastly, there
          will be many students coming from 2 parent households, but
          because Jackson has around 30% of the population identify-
          ing as religious, I will not assume their families are at all spir-
          itual. This is an awareness the ministry must have towards
          the students that come in.

 Developmental Characteristics

   The most obvious way to think about the distinct audiences served
   by a curriculum is to consider age groupings or levels of develop-
   ment. It is common to find plans and resources specifically designed
   for preschool, children, youth, or adults. While most publishers con-
   sider developmental characteristics when determining the content
   or the overall approach to teaching and learning, not all available
   resources reflect a clear vision for fostering spiritual growth.

               Developmental theorists generally focus on one particular
   aspect of development and often organize these characteristics into
   systems or taxonomies reflecting changes corresponding to age.
   Three of the most helpful in understanding the target audience for
   a curriculum are Jean Piaget, Robert J. Havighurst, and Erik Erik-
   son. Piaget described ways in which cognitive abilities developed
   throughout life into adolescence, shaping the way various ages think
   and learn, from symbolic to concrete to abstract. His work provides
   insight into both appropriate content and methodology for various
   age groups.

               Havighurst's work, published in Human Development and
   Education, described six life stages and their associated tasks. He
   theorized that when a person completes these tasks within their
   corresponding time frame, they will be fulfilled and accepted by
   society. Developmental characteristics contribute to the possibility
   that the task can be achieved. He referred to this as a teachable
   moment, stating that if the timing wasn't right, learning would not
   occur. To overcome this challenge, Havighurst recommended rep-
   etition so as to eventually connect with a student's teachable
   moment. He also recognized that one's culture influences the
   accomplishment of each task.9

   York: David McKay, 1953).

                                                                   Considering the Audience | 89
                Erikson emphasized psychosocial development, dividing
    the human lifespan into eight distinct stages. He proposed that a
    specific crisis corresponds to each of the eight stages, and if the cri-
    sis weren't resolved positively, it would impede development:

          For example, the person who does not develop a sense
          of trust (Erikson's first stage) may find it challenging as
          an adult to form a positive intimate relationship (Erikson's
          sixth stage). Or an individual who does not develop a clear
          sense of purpose and identity (Erikson's fifth stage) may
          become self-absorbed and stagnate rather than work
          toward the betterment of others (Erikson's seventh stage).10

                Erikson's work has been criticized, most often for the dra-
    matic use of the term crisis to describe developmental tasks. How-
    ever, understanding how various inner motivational factors across
    the lifespan can lead to maturity can be invaluable when thinking
    about a curriculum's content and construction. D. Campbell Wyck-
    off reminds us that "the ages and stages merge into one another
    rather imperceptibly" and "individual consciousness takes precedence
    over the idea of ages and stages," so Christian education curriculum
    should not be too closely focused on a general understanding of
    age-level characteristics.11

                After Havighurst published his book on education and
    human development, he wrote a paper on how his ideas were
    applicable to Christian education. This led to the idea that there are
    specific processes that allow learning to take place at every stage of
    the lifespan. These include the exploration stage, when people seek
    to understand themselves and their surroundings. This is followed

    by the discovery phase, in which a person finds meaning and value
    in both self and whatever is being explored. The final stage is the act
    of appropriation, when a person personally embraces the new idea
    and assumes corresponding personal and social responsibility.12

                It is important to understand cognitive, emotional, social,
    and physical abilities throughout each stage of the lifespan, and that
    information is readily available from a number of sources. Most of it
    could be considered common knowledge, but knowing something is
    not the same as appropriating that knowledge in ways that impact
    learning and foster spiritual transformation. Just as with a cultural
    study, it is imperative to reflect on developmental differences and
    ask, What is this saying, and what does it mean? How might this
    impact spiritual growth? How should this inform the experiences,
    structure, and methods in a curriculum plan for this age group?

                The most helpful resources for understanding how to cre-
    ate specialized curricula for distinct age groups explain both devel-
    opmental characteristics and how those should inform teaching. An
    older but valuable resource for this purpose is Exploring Christian
    Education by A. Elwood Sanner and A. F. Harper. It includes chapters
    focused on understanding basic developmental characteristics and
    their curricular implications for preschoolers, children, youth, and
    adults. The following is an example of how this resource describes
    preschool characteristics and some ideas on how they should be
    taught based on those characteristics.

                The motor development of preschool children allows them
    to transition from total dependence on a caregiver to the relative
    freedom of exploring their world as they become more mobile. This
    independence also brings greater pressure on the child to conform,
    as parents and other adults set limits to protect them from environ-
    mental dangers. Language acquisition and understanding opens the

    world of communication, allowing expression of ideas and feelings.
    Preschoolers can understand more than they can express but can-
    not grasp abstract ideas. Children at this age prefer parallel play, in
    proximity with others, but not fully interacting. Their attention span
    is short, and for most tasks, girls have a longer attention span than
    boys. Preschoolers need to play, engage in a variety of activities, and
    be mobile. They are curious and enjoy creating, but their fine motor
    skills limit what they can produce.

                Those who teach preschoolers should be creative, sponta-
    neous, and joyful. Limits must be imposed but done so in a kind yet
    firm manner. Teachers should communicate clearly and precisely,
    using words a young child can understand. When storytelling, they
    should exhibit feeling and excitement. An educational space should
    be large enough to allow exploration, full of interesting things to
    discover, and free from safety hazards. Young children should not
    be expected to sit still for long periods of time, participate in group
    activities except on occasion, or engage in group games or activi-
    ties.13

Putting It All Together: Chapter Assignment

    · Using the curriculum plan you began in chapter 1
        and revised for chapter 2, create a new section called
        "Curriculum Context." Research the area where your
        ministry will take place, then collect both psycho-
        graphic and demographic information about the sur-
        rounding culture. Organize the information into a
        summary document of three to four pages. Make sure
        to include curricular implications for all of the data in
        your description.

    · Then write a two- to three-page overview of the
        developmental characteristics of your specific target
        audience. Utilize resources that will allow you to
        focus holistically, including cognitive, physical, emo-
        tional, social, and spiritual characteristics. For each
        category, discuss relevant implications for curricular

            · Organize curriculum content into relevant themes
                and topics

              Every profession is associated with a specific body of
  knowledge, what one has to understand, value, or be able to do to
  hold that position. Airline pilots only have to be seventeen to get a
  private pilot certificate, but to fly for an airline, they must be high
  school graduates or have completed a GED, though most airlines
  prefer a four-year college degree. A pilot has to be proficient in
  reading, writing, speaking, and understanding English. Pilots must
  also be in good health and obtain a Federal Aviation Administration
  medical certificate. They must have strong spatial awareness and
  coordination. Regarding emotional stability and personality traits,
  pilots need to possess excellent communication skills, be able to
  work with a team, demonstrate leadership, be decisive and quick-
  thinking, and demonstrate self-confidence.1 Those are the personal
  qualifications, but that doesn't include everything a pilot has to
  learn. That's a more complicated list.

              Pilots have to become familiar with the aircraft and the
  parts of the plane they'll fly. This includes external components like

the wings and ailerons and also the cockpit instruments, includ-
ing the navigation and communication systems. The fuel system, oil,
and electrical systems also have to be understood, as well as the
aircraft engine. A pilot has to be able to compare and contrast the
performance of different aircraft using charts and understand how
to file accurate flight logs and communicate with maintenance per-
sonnel.

            Pilots also learn applied physics by studying aircraft
maneuvers and investigating the different forces at work, such as
Bernoulli's principle, which explains how various air pressures flow-
ing over and under an airplane wing generate lift. Additionally, pilots
need to understand how to keep an aircraft balanced in flight by
understanding how the weight of cargo, passengers, and fuel
impacts its performance. A pilot's training includes a study of
aeromedicine, focused on how flight affects the human body. A pilot
must understand how atmospheric pressure and other aerodynamic
forces can impact the passengers and crew. Pilots must be able to
react effectively when medical emergencies take place on their air-
craft. Besides understanding the aircraft and how it functions and
how to care for those within the plane, a commercial pilot also has
to have an understanding of weather conditions that impact flying.
They must study weather phenomena, such as cloud formations,
fronts and air masses, humidity and temperature, wind changes, and
weather hazards, including thunderstorms and various types of pre-
cipitation.

            The list of what a pilot needs to be, understand, and do is
already quite long, but there is more. Flying the aircraft requires
learning to navigate--plan, control, and record an aircraft's move-
ment from one destination to another. Pilots must follow the visual
flight rules, which include using visual cues, magnetic compass
readings, and dead reckoning (the process of determining your
position based on the last known position). Using radio navigation,
air traffic control radar, and flight computers is also part of the
process. Commercial pilots must also be competent in instrument
flight rules to fly when they can't use visual cues. They must learn

                                                                   Content and Structure | 99
   how to use GPS systems, nondirectional beacons, and VHF omnidi-
   rectional range radio transmitters to position their aircraft to stay
   on course. They must learn what to do in emergencies if all naviga-
   tion and communications systems fail.

               Finally, learning to fly an aircraft requires learning how to
   prepare, including preplanning a route and doing system checks.
   Other necessary skills include learning how to taxi, take off, and
   land with the wind or in a crosswind; how to follow airport traffic
   patterns when entering or departing; how to fly straight and level
   and make level turns; how to make climbing turns; and how to avoid
   collisions, wind shear, and wake turbulence. Additional necessary
   skills include descending the aircraft, including with turns or high
   and low drag configurations; flying at different speeds; handling
   stalled engines and other equipment malfunctions; proceeding in an
   emergency; and performing forward slips and sideslips. Knowledge
   of high-altitude operations, postflight procedures, and night flying
   experience are also essential.2

               As you read over this extensive list of what it takes to
   be a pilot, you might have been overwhelmed, or you might have
   been grateful to realize that the person who flies your commercial
   airplane has such an extensive amount of tested knowledge and
   experience! This list represents a significant part of a curriculum,
   the planned content of the journey toward becoming a commercial
   pilot. This body of knowledge is referred to as scope. As you can
   imagine, there is also a structure or order to the way this content
   is taught and learned. A pilot doesn't learn how to take off before
   learning how to taxi, and those lessons don't take place until a pilot
   understands the aircraft's engine and instruments. This structure
   and order of a curriculum plan is known as sequence.

Scope

A helpful way to understand scope is to think of other uses of the
term. A microscope brings into sharp focus whatever has been
placed on a slide underneath the scope. A telescope only reveals
a portion of the sky that is within the range of where the scope
is pointing. The same is true of a rifle scope. There is an entire
landscape in front of a hunter, but the target appears within the
circumference of the scope used for sighting the prey. With that
understanding, we may think of the scope of a curriculum as every-
thing within the range of a curriculum's mission. It is the entire field
of what is appropriate to deal with in a curriculum designed for a
particular purpose. This use of the term encompasses everything
that could possibly be included, even if it isn't covered in a plan.
While publishers typically use the term scope to refer to what is

                                                                   Content and Structure | 101
   actually included in their curriculum plans, a more accurate term
   for this might be the content. Instead of the entire relevant scope,
   it describes what has been selected for inclusion in the curriculum,
   even though some possible topics have been omitted.

               Why would curriculum designers only select part of the
   scope to include in their plan? Why not make sure that everything
   is covered? A scope is often limited because of the intended audi-
   ence. The faith level of the students might dictate the inclusion of
   some content areas in a curriculum and the exclusion of others. The
   mission of making disciples and fostering spiritual formation must
   always consider the cultural and developmental characteristics of
   those for whom it is intended. There are topics and truths within
   Scripture that may not be appropriate to teach to young children,
   for example. Theologian and teacher L. Harold DeWolf suggests that
   the manner in which we teach various parts of the scope should dif-
   fer depending on the age group, though he believes that we should
   teach the full scope of Christian education to all ages. He states,
   "The longer I have taught at both senior and adult levels, the more
   firmly convinced I am that the whole gospel must be taught at each of
   these levels, almost as if it had never been taught before."3 While some
   argue that everything within Scripture is appropriate for everyone,
   most curriculum designers focus only on what is most relevant for a
   particular age group.

               Some curriculum developers may omit theological per-
   spectives or spiritual disciplines that differ from a church or min-
   istry's tradition or doctrinal position. Another scope consideration
   is time. If a curriculum plan is designed for a ministry that has a start
   and end date, such as a Vacation Bible School, or for a particular
   stage of development, such as for teenagers, it would not be possi-
   ble to adequately teach everything that could possibly be included

   Broadman Press, 1981), 60.

within the scope. Another practical consideration for selecting con-
tent from within a possible scope relates to the background of those
teaching. For instance, if a curriculum plan is designed to be led
within a context where those leading are newer Christians or aren't
highly educated, it might be advisable to focus on content within
the teachers' areas of expertise.

            If a curriculum plan is designed by a church focusing on
spiritual maturity and learning across the entire lifespan, then an
attempt might be made to include a comprehensive scope. Still, it
will be necessary to determine which parts of the scope will be cov-
ered within various ministries, in what order, and for which groups
within the church. In effect, there will be a curriculum within the
curriculum. A lifelong race will be constructed, but it will take place
in stages. It is more common to develop a specific curriculum for
a particularly selected target audience, often defined by life stages.
That is the perspective from which this book is written, though the
same principles and procedures would apply on a broader scale.

            Selecting which parts of a scope to omit must be done with
care, but it is part of the overall process. Those topics chosen for
omission are referred to as the null curriculum. They are part of the
scope but are nullified in the curriculum because there are no plans
to cover them. What has been selected for inclusion is often called
explicit curriculum.

            One aspect of a scope falls outside of either one of these
categories. It isn't explicit and it isn't null, but it is hidden. Hidden
curriculum refers to content that is not intentionally planned but is
often intentional in terms of outcome. It isn't hidden in the sense
that it is a secret set of indoctrination goals kept from the learners.
Hidden curriculum refers to what is learned in addition to what is
explicitly stated within the scope. It is implicit, or implied. Think of
hidden curriculum as the understandings, values, or attitudes stu-
dents gain from the total curricular journey. Students often grad-
uate from high school and leave behind a youth ministry that they
love. The leaders and relationships have shaped their value for the
community and had a positive influence on their understanding

                                                                  Content and Structure | 103
of the Christian life. Their commitment to that local church may
become a standard by which they measure their future involvement
in a new church. These outcomes were never explicitly stated, but
they were shaped and transmitted throughout the entire teaching
and learning experience, their curricular journey. Hidden curricu-
lum may result from the learning context, how the environment is
arranged, the group size, the personality of the leader, or the con-
nections made with other learners. Each of these characteristics
can shape what a student takes away from an experience.

            Hidden curriculum is often implicitly taught through mod-
eling. The expectations for interpersonal interactions, the standards
of behavior expected, the style of worship, and the community and
global needs we emphasize all shape the hidden curriculum. A min-
istry's core values, when lived out, powerfully impact the totality
and outcome of the spiritual formation curriculum because the per-
sonality of churches and ministries shapes the discipleship jour-
ney. The transmission of these values and standards is aspirational,
something hoped for, but when they aren't identified in the scope,
they become part of the hidden curriculum.

            In describing school-based education, Elliot Eisner empha-
sizes the reality that explicit curriculum is what is most easily rec-
ognizable, but null and hidden (implicit) curriculum also shape
learning outcomes:

      Schools also teach through the implicit curriculum, that
      pervasive and ubiquitous set of expectations and rules that
      defines schooling as a cultural system that itself teaches
      important lessons. And we can identify the null curricu-
      lum--the options students are not afforded, the perspec-
      tives they may never know about, much less be able to use,
      the concepts and skills that are not part of their intellec-
      tual repertoire. Surely, in deliberations that constitute the

104 | Content and Structure
         course of living, their absence will have important conse-
         quences on the kind of life that students can choose to
         lead.4

Organizing the Scope

It can be overwhelming to think about a curricular scope, let alone
determine what will constitute the actual explicit content. For our
purposes, we will begin using the term scope interchangeably with
content. In other words, throughout the rest of this book, scope will
refer to the breadth of what is intentionally included in a curriculum
plan. As stated previously, this is the way publishers describe their
various curricular materials, only referencing what they choose to
cover in their resources. In your planning, you will begin by iden-
tifying a scope that is suitable for the curricular mission, and then
you will determine the content of your curriculum or actual por-
tions of the scope you will include. We will refer to that as the scope
of your curriculum. This use of the term will minimize confusion as
you develop your plans.

            An important first step in determining scope is to review
the intended mission. What is the purpose of the plan, and what
is necessary for students to believe and understand for that to be
accomplished? What do growing disciples need to know, under-
stand, value, and exhibit? How would you begin listing everything?
It is still an enormous focus, but it offers clues on bringing structure
to the planning. The process becomes more manageable if you think
about organizing the scope into various parts. Are there natural
ways to categorize the scope? What guidelines might allow you to
think about the scope in smaller, more manageable components?

            In the mid-twentieth century, the Cooperative Curriculum
Project (CCP) was initiated to provide guidance for the educational
ministry of the Church. It was an interdenominational effort, result-
ing in an extensive plan that could be adapted and used by denom-
inations to help "the church in its task of nurturing persons in

106 | Content and Structure
   the faith, thus preparing them for the mission of the church."5 The
   project described the curricular scope as "the whole field of rela-
   tionships viewed in light of, or from the perspective of, the
   gospel--God's whole continuous redemptive action toward man,
   known especially in Jesus Christ."6 This focus on all relationships
   in light of the gospel offers a guideline that the CCP used to bring
   organization to the curriculum. It is part of what is known as an
   organizing principle. Howard P. Colson and Raymond M. Rigdon
   explain an organizing principle as "the rationale for the approach
   curriculum builders take to assure the proper relation of the design
   elements in a curriculum plan. The organizing principle is also a
   valuable instrument for testing the curriculum plan to see that it has
   in it the essential elements of design in proper relationship."7

               The CCP's stated organizing principle was as follows:
         The learner "becomes aware of God through his self-dis-
         closure...and responds in faith and love" when through
         involvement in the Christian community he comes face to
         face with the great concerns of Christian faith and life as
         they are relevant to him in his situation by "listening with
         growing alertness to the gospel and responding in faith and
         love."8
      This statement provides organizational clarity by suggesting that
   the curriculum plan's intent is for students to grow in their aware-
   ness of God, commit to becoming a disciple, and become part of a
   local church where the scope will be encountered as it is relevant to
   their lives and that their participation in the life of the Church will
   contribute to even greater levels of commitment and growth. The
   scope will rely on the organizing principle for its development.

            Remember that the CCP's scope included all of the stu-
dents' relationships in light of the gospel. As this group further
developed the scope of their curriculum plan, they organized their
thoughts around the Christian experience of man under God, man's
relationship to man, and the experience of man in the world. These
three ideas are rooted in Scripture and are the foundational realities
that gave shape to the CCP's scope. To make the development
process more manageable, the CCP organized the scope into five
curriculum areas: life and its setting, revelation, sonship, vocation,
and the Church. None of the areas is more significant than any
other, and they aren't sequenced in any order. They are simply ways
of thinking about the entire scope to assist in planning.

            Think of your scope in terms of a home. Families live in
homes, and families are the cradle or foundation of existence. They
matter, so where they live also matters. It should be a place that
provides shelter, protection, comfort, and nurturing and a place
where family members can grow into responsible and fulfilled indi-
viduals as they interact with those who live with them. Each of
the rooms in the dwelling place represents a distinct area designed
to contribute to the overall purpose. A house may have bedrooms,
a kitchen, bathrooms, a laundry room, an office, a family room, a
garage, an attic, or a basement. These rooms represent the various
areas of scope, with the house itself representing the entire scope.

            Each of the areas in the CCP's plan has a unique focus or
perspective, and each area is further divided into themes or major
motifs that are important throughout the lifespan. For example, the
area of "life and its setting" is about the meaning and experience
of life. The themes assigned to this area are man discovering and
accepting himself, man living in relationship with others, man's rela-
tion to the natural order, man's involvement in social forces, man's
coping with change and the absolute, and man's creativity with life's
daily routines. The plan explains the meaning of each theme and
provides biblical examples, then identifies specific ways in which

108 | Content and Structure
   each theme is significant for various age levels.9 These age-level
   considerations are listed and can be considered as appropriate the-
   matic topics to be included in a plan for a particular age-focused
   curriculum plan.

items can be organized into general related areas, with all related
subjects grouped together. They can be further organized or
grouped by major themes and associated topics. For obvious rea-
sons, this is not the best strategy for developing a comprehensive
scope. Entire categories can be overlooked, the scope can be heavily
influenced by those who participate in the brainstorming session,
and the experiences and faith maturity of the planning group will
limit the ideas generated from the brainstorming session.

            Starting with a general framework that identifies areas of
the scope is advisable. This was the approach of the CCP. This
framework should follow the organizing principle you crafted from
your plan's preliminary elements. Think about the mission, vision,
core values, target audience, and teaching/learning context and
weave the ideas together into a guiding principle to help you orga-
nize the plan. Once you have identified the areas, or the big chunks
of your scope, then you can begin to identify each of the major
themes that should be included for each area. Continue this process
by identifying more specific topics that further define each theme.
Subtopics add more specificity to the scope, identifying various
aspects of each topic that more narrowly define the content.

            It may also be helpful to think in terms of units of study
appropriate for your target audience, related to various topics or
subtopics. However, not everything in the scope will be accom-
plished through a small group, Bible study, or sermon series.
Remember that designing a curriculum is like designing a race-
course, and it includes everything students will experience as they
run the race. Special events, retreats, camps, and projects related to
various components of the scope can all be designed to help stu-
dents learn and grow. Your plan identifies the boundaries of the
curricular racecourse through its various areas, themes, topics, and
subtopics. The race itself will involve formal and informal teaching
and learning sessions as well as events and experiences related to
the scope.

            When designing a curriculum for the first time, it may be
confusing to think about areas, themes, topics, and subtopics in

the abstract. Most of your previous educational experiences utilize
these principles, however. The following excerpts from a univer-
sity's core curriculum plan are intended to clarify further how these
concepts are related and how they can be implemented. Students
enrolled in this university select a variety of majors, so their com-
prehensive curriculum isn't identical. However, as is the case with
many universities, there is a core curriculum plan designed to help
students accomplish the school's mission, regardless of which major
they declare.

University Core Curriculum

            University Mission: With the conviction that all
            truth is God's truth, the University exists to carry
            out the mission of Christ in higher education.
            Through a curriculum of demonstrated academic
            excellence, students are educated in the liberal
            arts and their chosen disciplines, always seeking to
            examine the relationship between the disciplines
            and God's revelation in Jesus Christ.

               Organizing Principle for the Core Curriculum:
            The...University Core Curriculum challenges stu-
            dents to integrate knowledge, values, and skills
            into a coherent worldview that equips them for a
            life of faithfulness to God through service in the
            world.

               Scope Areas for the Core: Faith Integration,
            Critical Thinking, Communication, Multicultural
            Thinking, Empirical Thinking, Creative Expression

              Themes Related to the Faith Integration Core Area:
                  Biblical Studies, Christian Faith, Religious Perspectives
                    Topics Related to the Biblical Studies Theme:

                            Introduction to Psychology, Principles of Sociol-
                            ogy, Cultural Anthropology

                As you can imagine, each topic represents a semester-long
    course of study, and each course has its own set of subtopics and
    objectives.10 This model can be used to construct a scope. Deter-
    mine your mission and your organizing principle and establish rel-
    evant areas that will make up your scope. Then determine themes
    and topics for each area. For each of the topics, begin to think about
    subtopics related to each one. This is similar to how each course
    listed in the university example includes its own content. If you have
    taken a psychology course, for example, you realize that this is a
    very broad subject and includes many separate units of study on
    various subtopics in psychology. Identifying your scope subtopics
    represents a similar approach.

     Reflection Exercise

         · Look over the various themes the CCP included in
             the area of life and its setting. Select a couple of the
             themes and identify three or four relevant topics
             related to each of the themes you selected.

         · Next, select two of the topics you listed for each of
             the two themes. Create two appropriate subtopics for
             each topic you selected.

Sequence

When constructing an organized curriculum plan that will guide
the ministry's teaching and learning, it is important to establish a
planned sequence for engaging with the various components you
selected as part of the explicit curriculum. Consider the order in
which it makes the most sense to offer the various themes, topics,
and subtopics in the scope to help learners develop. Some topics or
subtopics build on one another and require a level of prior under-
standing before they can be effectively understood.

            In chapter 3, you read about Robert J. Havighurst's view on
teachable moments. He proposed that various portions of the scope
need to be repeated because age isn't the only thing that deter-
mines learning readiness. Some learners might not be at a point
where they can fully understand or appropriate various topics when
they're first presented, so weaving them into the sequence at more
than one point will maximize the possibility that everyone will learn

                                                                   Content and Structure | 113
what you have determined is important for their spiritual growth.
Not everyone will be present for every teaching and learning oppor-
tunity. If a student is absent, they will miss out on essential portions
of the scope if those are not repeated in various places throughout
the curriculum.

            The Bible references the importance of sequence and the
need for repetition in teaching as part of spiritual growth. Paul
describes a group of gullible people that are easily swayed by false
teachers because they "are so loaded down with sins and are swayed
by all kinds of evil desires, always learning but never able to come to
a knowledge of the truth" (1 Timothy 3:6-7, NIV). Another example
of why repetition is important is found in Hebrews 5. The author
is addressing Jewish Christians who are not at the level of spiritual
maturity they should have already attained:

                We have a lot to explain about this. But since you
                have become too lazy to pay attention, explaining
                it to you is hard. By now you should be teachers.
                Instead, you still need someone to teach you the
                elementary truths of God's word. You need milk, not
                solid food. All those who live on milk lack the experi-
                ence to talk about what is right. They are still babies.
                However, solid food is for mature people, whose
                minds are trained by practice to know the differ-
                ence between good and evil.

                                                           Hebrews 5:11-14, GW
            The key to developing an appropriate curricular sequence
is to consider how best to arrange the elements of the scope for
spiritual growth. If the plan is developed for an entire ministry, then
sequencing might also require determining which themes or top-
ics to include for various age groups. If a curriculum is developed
for one particular age group, then there is a limited time frame to
consider when planning a sequence. For example, if it is a curricu-
lum plan for high school students, it will probably be a three- or
four-year sequence, depending on which grade levels are consid-
ered high school.

               When developing a scope, publishers tend to think of
   cycles of learning, with entire cycles repeated every three or four
   years, sometimes less frequently and sometimes more often. If a
   ministry develops a separate curriculum for intergenerational
   learning or for specific purposes, such as a new believers' program,
   the length of the sequence and cycle needs to be considered in the
   planning stages for both the scope and the sequence.

Putting It All Together: Chapter Assignment

               Continue developing your curriculum
            plan by identifying an appropriate scope
            for your intended audience. Refine the
            organizing principle you created, then use
            it to specify four areas for your scope.
            (Your actual final plan may include more
            than four.) Remember that your organiz-
            ing principle should reflect your overall
            mission, vision, values, and target audi-
            ence. Once you have identified your four
            areas, list a minimum of four associated
            themes for each. Next, write a minimum

                 of three related topics for each theme.
                 This will be a total of four areas, sixteen
                 total themes, and forty-eight specific top-
                 ics. Finally, for each topic, list two related
                 subtopics. This will be a total of ninety-six
                 subtopics. While this may seem like a lot,
                 keep in mind that an overall comprehen-
                 sive curriculum plan would probably con-
                 tain many more themes, topics, and

         · The meaning of learning
         · Three main types of learning and their related tax-

             onomies
         · The principles of learning

                 Be able to:

         · Describe cognitive and affective learning at various
             levels

         · Create possible learning activities related to learn-
             ing principles for cognitive and affective learning

            Some concepts are easily explained and understood by
reading their definitions or hearing relevant facts. Others rely more
on feelings or emotions that need to be experienced to understand
the associated term or idea. Obscenity is one of those difficult con-
cepts to grasp. People may rely on legal definitions to understand
what falls into this category, while others may struggle to apply a
definition to a specific example. According to the Supreme Court,
obscene speech isn't protected speech, meaning that it isn't cov-
ered by the First Amendment and may even be considered illegal.
This makes it imperative to clearly determine whether something
falls into the category of obscenity. In the mid-1900s, the problem
of defining obscenity came to the forefront. Supreme Court Justice
William J. Brennan Jr., who served from 1956 to 1990, was a
renowned legal scholar of the twentieth century. He made repeated
efforts to define obscenity but found the task more challenging than
he imagined. Justice Potter Stewart tried to explain it in 1964 and is
on the record saying, "I shall not today attempt further to define the

122 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
   kinds of material...but I know it when I see it."1 This quote by Stew-
   art accurately summarizes the difficulty in trying to define obscen-
   ity. Sometimes an understanding relies on emotions or feelings and
   can't always be captured through words.

                  The meaning of obscenity has changed over the years
      through various court rulings, but the current legal definition is

                              whether the average person, applying contem-
                                 porary community standards would find that
                                 the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the
                                 prurient interest,

                              whether the work depicts or describes, in a
                                 patently offensive way, sexual conduct specif-
                                 ically defined by the applicable state law, and

                              whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks seri-
                                 ous literary, artistic, political, or scientific
                                 value.2

               These written guidelines are necessary for use in legal
   decision-making, but for many, obscenity evokes an emotion that
   allows it to be more easily recognized than by trying to identify it by
   the standards laid out in a definition.

               Art criticism is another area where objective standards
   exist but subjective feelings and emotions often influence decisions.
   Good art criticism will incorporate four main categories, the first of
   which is describing. It is an objective process focusing on the fea-
   tures of the artwork that are observable:

         To begin, the critic should collect the obvious information
         such as the title of the artwork, the name of the artist who

         created it, the date of its completion, and the medium of
         the artwork if such information is available. The medium
         of the artwork is the material that the artist has used, for
         example, paint, clay, or photographic paper. The step of
         description also requires the critic to observe the visual
         elements of art, such as shape, texture, or palette. The
         term "palette" refers to the specific selection of colors that
         the artist has used. If an artwork is representational, the
         critic identifies and describes the subject (the "who" or the
         "what" that the artwork is about). The most informative
         descriptions use concrete language to provide an image in
         the mind's eye. Description is an objective report of per-
         ceivable features. To describe an artwork is to provide
         facts, not opinions.3

               Next, the critic must analyze the piece of art to see how the
   various elements work together, then interpret the piece to make
   a statement about what is being expressed in the work, and finally
   evaluate the artwork to determine how well it meets the standards
   of the particular style or movement it is attempting to represent or
   how well the piece expresses emotion, an idea, or beauty.

               This describes the formal process of critiquing art. In other
   words, there are specific standards to follow to determine "good
   art." For many who visit art galleries, however, their opinions and
   value judgments are based more on personal feelings and emotions.
   They judge a piece of art on how it makes them feel personally. This
   same reaction is what allowed Sherlock Holmes to solve the great
   mystery in The Hound of the Baskervilles. As he was walking through
   a portrait gallery in the home of Sir Henry, the following conversa-
   tion took place as they reflected on the surrounding paintings. Sir
   Henry said, "I don't pretend to know much about these things, and

   I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a picture. I didn't
   know that you found time for such things." To which Holmes replied,
   "I know what is good when I see it, and I see it now."4 There are con-
   cepts and factual criteria for formal art criticism, but emotions and
   personal value judgments guide the determination for many. As with
   Holmes, most people know it when they see it.

               People learn in different ways: by processing information
   taken in by words, encountering situations that impact their emo-
   tions, or observing actions or people that they can imitate. This
   chapter describes these various types of learning and provides prin-
   ciples that can maximize the potential for learning to occur.

 Learning

   Designing a curriculum plan for ministry is a way of describing the
   various components of a journey toward spiritual transformation.
   Transformation is change, moving from one state, stage, or con-
   dition to another. In discipleship, it is the change that takes place
   within an individual that leads that person closer to Christlikeness.
   The essence of all learning is change. While many definitions for
   learning can be found, in its simplest form, learning involves chang-
   ing. It includes changing one's knowledge or understanding; chang-
   ing one's beliefs, values, or perspectives; or changing one's abilities
   to perform a task or skill. These three key areas represent cognitive,
   affective, and behavioral change. Sometimes, they are referred to as
   head, heart, and hand, or thoughts, beliefs, and actions.

               The previous examples of trying to determine obscenity or
   what makes good art represent how people appropriate cognitive
   and affective standards in their decision-making. Their conclusions
   may be based on cognitive information or be determined by feelings
   or value judgments. Both of these types of learning impact spiritual
   transformation, so it is important to understand each. Behavioral
   change, as it is typically conceived of in terms of spiritual growth,
   is often the result of deep commitments or values. Most often, it is
   a result of cognitive and affective learning that results in a changed
   lifestyle. Behaviors change as a result of one's deeper understand-
   ing or commitment to a belief. However, the third key type of learn-
   ing described in this chapter is related to acquiring physical skills,
   referred to as psychomotor skills. Behavioral change is associated
   with a change in ability resulting from acquiring a motor skill. Psy-
   chomotor skills are not as prevalent in teaching and learning out-
   comes related to spiritual growth, though they may occasionally be
   included in a curriculum plan.

               Various Christian educators have suggested an additional
   learning outcome, dispositional learning, to either replace or sup-
   plement affective learning. Dispositional learning is said to include
   values and the tendency for persons to act on those values, while
   affective learning describes emotions and attitudes. It is the belief of
   these educators that the affective domain is too large and contains
   too many components. They believe that secular educators rely on
   this singular affective category because they don't take into consid-
   eration the reality of the immortal soul or one's own will to act.5
   While the case has been made for this additional type of learning,
   dispositional, it will not be dealt with separately in this text. A clear

   Teacher's Guide to Educational Psychology (Eugene, OR: Wipf and

   126 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
   understanding of affective learning includes the dispositional, as it
   does give consideration to this area of volition, or the tendency to
   act on one's values.

               It is important to understand that no learning takes place in
   isolation. Cognitive, affective, and psychomotor skills are each dis-
   tinct categories of learning outcomes. LeRoy Ford refers to these as
   primary learning outcomes, or PLOs.6 He divides cognitive learn-
   ing into two distinct PLOs, knowledge and understanding, as will be
   discussed later in this chapter. Each of these outcomes represents
   the type of learning or change that is intended to be predominant in
   a given situation. However, the reality is that learning doesn't take
   place in a vacuum, and when an individual gains a deeper under-
   standing of a particular topic, known as cognitive change, it is highly
   likely that the learner will also experience a change in what they
   value or believe as a result of that cognitive learning. If a student
   gains a motor skill, it will be the result of not only practicing the skill
   but also having a deeper understanding of what is required to per-
   form and perhaps a change in the commitment to practice the skill
   or an attitude of enjoyment of the activity. This overlap or blend-
   ing of learning outcomes is known as diffusion of learning. In its
   simplest form, it means that learning outcomes diffuse or spread.
   Categories blend into one another. There may be one main type of
   intentional learning, but other types of learning also result.

Cognitive Learning

Much of what we consider to be learning is cognitive, related to
head knowledge. It refers to facts and processing information,
things we memorize or understand or can explain. Formal education
in schools places a high value on cognitive learning, and this is often
the standard for determining whether we consider someone intel-
ligent. Scripture also emphasizes the importance of the mind and
cognitive learning:

                Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but
                be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then
                you will be able to test and approve what God's will
                is--his good, pleasing and perfect will.

                                                                 Romans 12:2, NIV
                Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with
                all your soul and with all your mind and with all your
                strength.

                                                                   Mark 12:30, NIV

                The proverbs of Solomon son of David, king of Israel:
                for gaining wisdom and instruction; for understand-
                ing words of insight; for receiving instruction in
                prudent behavior, doing what is right and just and
                fair; for giving prudence to those who are simple,
                knowledge and discretion to the young--let the wise
                listen and add to their learning, and let the discern-
                ing get guidance--for understanding proverbs and
                parables, the sayings and riddles of the wise. The
                fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but
                fools despise wisdom and instruction.

                                                               Proverbs 1:1-7, NIV
            Growing as disciples requires us to grow in the cognitive
domain. Believing and trusting in God includes understanding who
he is, what he desires for us, what he has done for us, and what
he expects from us. An emotional commitment without knowledge
or understanding is dangerous. Values and commitments can fall
prey to persuasion and feelings that aren't always based on objective
truth, meaning people can be easily swayed by emotional appeals.
Spiritual transformation includes not just the heart but also the
mind. On the other hand, too much emphasis on the cognitive
aspect of change can lead to pharisaism, with a sense of being self-
righteous or overly critical of those who don't agree with us. This is
why the Great Commandment reminds us to love God holistically,
with every part of our being.

                each passage, and what is the importance or purpose
                of knowledge or understanding conveyed in the text?

 Cognitive Learning Taxonomy

  There are different levels or degrees of cognitive learning. Consider
  an exam in an academic class. Have you ever studied only to find
  the test far more difficult than you anticipated? Maybe you memo-
  rized terms, but the test required you to define them. Perhaps you
  understood definitions or basic concepts, but the exam asked you to
  compare and contrast various ideas. This is an example of how cog-
  nitive learning can take many forms, progressing from basic to more
  complex. The term taxonomy is most often used in science, but it
  refers to a system of organizing or classifying information. A learn-
  ing taxonomy is a way of organizing various levels or stages related
  to learning for a specific outcome. The cognitive learning taxonomy
  was developed around 1956 by Benjamin Bloom and some of his col-
  leagues.7 Some educators have revised it slightly in recent decades,
  reversing the order of the final two categories. LeRoy Ford follows
  Bloom's taxonomy but divides it into two separate outcomes: knowl­
  edge and understanding. We will follow that pattern as it relates to
  principles that provide guidance in teaching.

               The first and lowest level of Bloom's taxonomy is knowledge.
  It includes basic memorization or recognition of information. When

7. Issler and Habermas, How We Learn, 31.

   130 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
students are asked to recite, identify, label, list, or match informa-
tion, they are operating at the knowledge level of cognitive learning.
No understanding is necessary for knowledge, just recall or recogni-
tion. This is why Ford includes it as a separate PLO. The entire cog-
nitive learning taxonomy includes six levels, but the knowledge level
is one PLO, and the other five levels are the understanding PLO.
When learners are asked to memorize the books of the Bible, use a
map to locate the places Paul visited on his missionary journeys, or
name the twelve original disciples, they are operating at the knowl-
edge level of cognitive learning.

            The second level is comprehension. This represents the
lowest level of the understanding PLO. Comprehension requires
students to put an idea into a new form, such as paraphrasing,
explaining, summarizing, or creating a visual representation of a
concept. It involves translating or interpreting. Students demon-
strate comprehension when they are able to compare and contrast
various concepts or ideas. Asking students to explain the necessity
of Jesus's death and resurrection, write a definition of stewardship,
or create a drawing that illustrates the Church are all demonstra-
tions of comprehension.

            The next level of understanding is called application. When
students can use ideas or concepts in new situations and are able
to see how abstract facts operate in real-life concrete experiences,
they are able to apply their learning. Application involves recogniz-
ing how an idea is lived out and being able to identify a concept in
the real world. If students can provide examples of when they have
experienced forgiveness, recognize an intercessory prayer when it
is offered, or describe how the Acts 15 teaching against eating meat
sacrificed to idols might relate to contemporary culture, then they
are at the application level of cognitive learning.

            The third level of understanding is analysis, which involves
the ability to break down a larger body of thought into various com-
ponents. It might include creating an outline of a book of the Bible,
creating a diagram illustrating the key topics Jesus taught through
his parables, or creating a calendar depicting and describing the

                                             Understanding Teaching and Learning | 131
various feasts and celebrations observed by the nation of Israel.
Analysis can also involve systematically solving a problem to find
acceptable answers. When a group of high school students wants
to understand how best to reach their peers with the gospel, they
might create a strategy that involves surveys to figure out which
students are part of a church, which students are Christians, what
issues their peers are facing, or why students don't believe in Jesus
or attend a local church. The information can then be used to figure
out how best to reach them. Analysis that involves problem-solving
requires a clear understanding of the problem, a way to gather rel-
evant facts, a review of the information to see how it all relates, and
a proposal of possible solutions to the problem, with the best ideas
being implemented.

            The fourth level of understanding is known as synthesis.
It requires students to put together various ideas and concepts
about a particular subject to form something brand new. It requires
an understanding of different aspects of one particular thought or
teaching. Synthesis results in a new product, such as a written Bible
study, a sermon, a gospel tract, or a worship service. When students
work to create a prayer emphasis retreat, they are engaging in syn-
thesis.

            The fifth and highest level of understanding is evaluation.
It calls for learners to use their high level of understanding to make
judgments about the value or merit of an idea, project, event, or pro-
duction based on specific identified standards. Does the response
follow biblical guidelines? Will this accomplish its intended goal?
Does the presentation contribute to spiritual growth? Does the
worship service follow the pattern demonstrated in Isaiah 6?

             select two topics or subtopics and begin thinking
             about cognitive learning outcomes you want your

         · For each topic or subtopic you selected, identify
             specific related cognitive learning outcomes for
             knowledge and for each of the five levels of under-
             standing. What about the topic do you want them to
             know, comprehend, apply, analyze, synthesize, and
             evaluate?

Affective Learning

Knowing facts and understanding biblical truths is essential for
spiritual transformation. Paul emphasized the role of teaching for
spiritual growth, and he wrote about the importance of cognitive
learning and discernment in his letter to the church at Ephesus:

                So Christ himself gave the apostles, the prophets,
                the evangelists, the pastors and teachers, to equip
                his people for works of service, so that the body of
                Christ may be built up until we all reach unity in
                the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of God
                and become mature, attaining to the whole mea-
                sure of the fullness of Christ. Then we will no longer
                be infants, tossed back and forth by the waves, and
                blown here and there by every wind of teaching
                and by the cunning and craftiness of people in their
                deceitful scheming. Instead, speaking the truth in
                love, we will grow to become in every respect the
                mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ.

                                                          Ephesians 4:11-15, NIV
            In this same passage, Paul also emphasized the need for
affective learning. Knowing the truth must be accompanied by a
commitment to live in truth. Cognitive learning is not sufficient
unless there is also heart change:

                You were taught, with regard to your former way
                of life, to put off your old self, which is being cor-
                rupted by its deceitful desires; to be made new in
                the attitude of your minds; and to put on the new
                self, created to be like God in true righteousness
                and holiness.

                                                        Ephesians 4:22-24, NIV
            Samuel was reminded of the importance of the heart when
he was tasked with selecting a king from among Jesse's sons.

                But the Lord said to Samuel, "Do not consider his
                appearance or his height, for I have rejected him.
                The Lord does not look at the things people look
                at. People look at the outward appearance, but the
                Lord looks at the heart."

                                                                1 Samuel 16:7, NIV
            Affective learning is embracing ideas and concepts, valuing
them, believing them, and living them out. It is about a change
in attitudes. Affective change is often the result of other types
of learning. Knowing, understanding, or learning to do something
can often result in a changed opinion or new commitment. How-
ever, there are biblical scholars who aren't Christ-followers. They
have head knowledge without heart change. Spiritual transforma-
tion requires both.

Affective Learning Taxonomy

David Krathwohl created what is probably the best-known and most
widely used taxonomy for affective learning. Its five stages progress

134 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
from a general awareness of a particular value or belief toward a full
commitment that guides a person's lifestyle. As mentioned previ-
ously in this chapter, the highest level of affective learning includes
the will or a disposition to act on what one professes to value. Unlike
Bloom's cognitive learning taxonomy, not every stage of Krathwohl's
taxonomy may initially appear as if it is genuine learning. The ear-
liest two stages seem more like preparation for heart change than
an actual commitment. However, they represent the lowest levels of
value or belief. They are necessary first steps.

            The first level of the affective taxonomy is receiving. It hap-
pens when the learner becomes aware of an idea or particular sub-
ject. The learner sometimes pauses to take note of the information,
but regardless, this stage represents a point when an individual
becomes sensitive to the reality of a particular concept or idea and
is willing to tolerate it without total dismissal or rejection. When
passersby read billboards with positive biblical messages or adver-
tising about upcoming ministry events, they are at the receiving
level. When they hear an announcement about a service oppor-
tunity, receive a flyer in the mail, or see a post on social media,
they are receiving information that can lead toward commitment or
belief in whatever is being represented. This need to begin at the
receiving level is expressed in Romans 10:14: "How, then, can they call
on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the
one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without
someone preaching to them?"

            The second level of Krathwohl's taxonomy is responding.
Those who receive the information become interested enough to
react in some way. The only commitment at this point is to explore
what they have seen or heard. Think about a speaker who makes an
engaging and persuasive presentation about a new idea. Learners
who are intrigued may stay around to ask questions about the idea.
They aren't yet persuaded to fully endorse what was presented, but
they want to know more. Outreach events, missionary speakers, and
gospel presentations are designed to elicit a response from those
in attendance. When someone becomes aware of your church by

                                            Understanding Teaching and Learning | 135
receiving information and then decides to visit, that person is at the
responding level. There is no commitment to be a regular atten-
der. No positive or negative attitudes about your church have been
formed. A response is further down the road toward commitment,
but not yet there.

            The third level of affective learning is valuing, which is what
is most commonly thought of in terms of commitment or belief.
It is when a learner voluntarily recognizes truth or value in some-
thing and commits to that idea, organization, or belief system. When
someone confesses Christ, that person is at the valuing level. When
individuals sign tithing pledge cards, they are at the valuing level.
Volunteering at a homeless shelter, keeping a prayer journal, and
attending a discipleship group are all examples of valuing.

            Organization is the fourth level of affective learning. Stu-
dents are at this level when they are faced with competing value
commitments yet choose to follow through on their prior commit-
ment relative to the idea or subject. This calls for them to take more
than one value or belief into consideration before choosing to act.
Unfortunately, there is often less emphasis on the organizational
level than the valuing level within many ministries. When students
make a commitment, there may be little follow-up to help them
grow and live out what they have professed. This is what contributes
to a lack of spiritual transformation for many Christians, and it is
why understanding the need for affective teaching and learning is
so important.

            When learners commit to practicing a spiritual discipline
daily but find themselves with a full schedule, do they keep their
commitment to practice the discipline? If a student professes a
desire to grow as a Christian and commits to regular worship in
their faith community but has an opportunity to be part of a trav-
eling sports team on Sundays, what choice do they make? When
someone signs a pledge to contribute monthly to a charity but
doesn't have the funds to follow through each month, is that person
at the organization level? Sometimes people waver back and forth

136 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
between valuing and organization. Only when their choices remain
consistent with their commitment and what they say they value are
they at the organizational level.

            The highest level of affective learning is characterization. At
this level, the learner consistently acts in accordance with the val-
ues they have professed and internalized. At this stage, a learner's
lifestyle reflects their values. Others recognize this person as an
exemplar or representative of the value.

     Reflection Exercise

         · Using the scope you began creating in chapter 4,
             select two topics or subtopics and begin thinking
             about affective learning outcomes you want your
             learners to achieve relevant to that topic. You may
             find it helpful to use the same topics you chose for
             the cognitive learning exercise.

         · For each topic or subtopic you selected, identify
             specific related affective learning outcomes. What
             about the topic do you want them to believe, value, or
             commit to following? What attitude do you want
             them to hold toward that topic?

         · Can you think of specific persons whose lifestyles
             model the specific values you desire for your learn-
             ers?

Behavioral Learning

Curriculum resources often list behavioral outcomes for their
lessons, but most of these are not psychomotor skills. As a result of
a study, it might be desirable for students to be able to share their
personal testimonies or to be able to locate specific passages of
Scripture. These are not technically behavioral outcomes but cog-
nitive skills. A cognitive skill relies on understanding. Some of the
behavioral outcomes included in published curriculum resources
might actually reflect attitudinal change. Perhaps it is desirable to
see students inviting non-Christian friends to church or becom-
ing more involved in ministry projects. While those are observable
behaviors, they are a result of heart change and don't constitute a
skill. In its purest form, a behavioral outcome is a learned skill. Psy­
chomotor skills do involve both cognitive and affective elements.
There must be an understanding of what one is trying to achieve
and a willingness to perform the act. However, the dominant learn-
ing component is the actual skill that is performed.

            Psychomotor skills are physical skills or actions learned
through practice, such as sports or playing an instrument. They typ-
ically require the use of fine motor skills for precision or coordina-
tion or developing motor skills for strength or performance. It might
be helpful to think of psychomotor skills in terms of activities where
one could take lessons.

Behavioral Learning Taxonomy (Psychomotor
Skills)

Elizabeth Simpson developed the psychomotor skill taxonomy
based on the work of Benjamin Bloom and others who came before
her. The taxonomy describes stages of the learning process for gain-
ing motor skills. The first level of Simpson's taxonomy is known as

138 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
   perception. In this stage, learners use their senses to gain an aware-
   ness of the skill to be learned. When students listen to the worship
   team and notice the various instruments and sounds, they are at the
   perception stage of learning to be part of the worship team. When
   they observe someone cooking a meal or painting a portrait, they
   are at the perception stage. Whether they smell the dish as it sim-
   mers on the stove or watch the brushstrokes of the artist, they are
   using their senses to become aware of the skill they wish to learn.

               The second stage is set. Learners prepare themselves men-
   tally, physically, and emotionally to engage in the skill. They gather
   equipment, put on uniforms, and practice a stance or finger place-
   ment. They have a general understanding of what they need to do to
   perform the skill and are willing to begin.

               Guided response is the third stage in psychomotor skill
   learning and what is often considered the beginning of learning
   a skill, though perception and set are both necessary. In guided
   response, the learner is assisted in acquiring a new complex skill.
   This may be guidance by a coach or mentor or by practicing through
   trial and error while watching a video or reading an instructional
   manual.

               Mechanism is the fourth stage, when learners can perform
   some aspects of a complex skill with confidence and proficiency.
   These have become habits due to the practice in the guided
   response stage. A student learning to play baseball might have
   become confident at the plate but is still learning how to catch and
   throw with proficiency. Ford labels this level as habit and ends with
   one more stage, complex overt response.8

               Complex overt response is reached when the learner can
   seamlessly perform the complex movements required for the skill.
   There is a level of proficiency and coordination without a great deal
   of effort. The skill has been internalized and doesn't require a lot of
   thinking to perform. Think of learning to drive a car. At this stage,

                                                Understanding Teaching and Learning | 139
drivers can pull into traffic, navigate the road, stop, start, back up,
and park without having to think about what they are doing, even
though there are a lot of individual skills involved. This level of skill
allows learners to perform without hesitation.

            Stages six and seven allow learners to move beyond the
original skill they have learned. Adaptation involves the ability to
adapt or change the performance of a skill to meet the requirements
of a different environment. It is what allows a skateboarder to
quickly transition to snowboarding or an ice skater to snow ski.
Origination takes place when learners create new skills built on
what they can already do so well. Think of the various feats that
some athletes do on bicycles or the outlandish performances wit-
nessed on some of the competition shows. New skateboarding
tricks, new cooking techniques, and original gymnastic routines are
all the result of origination.

     Reflection Exercise

         · Can you think of a particular psychomotor skill you
             have learned and what it was like to progress through
             the various stages of learning?

         · When have you adapted or originated a skill based
             on something you could already do quite well?

         · When might it be necessary to include psychomo-
             tor skills in a curriculum plan? What types of skills
             could be included?

140 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
 Principles of Learning

   It is important to have a clear sense of the learning outcomes you
   hope to accomplish through a curriculum. Identifying the knowl-
   edge, understanding, and attitude or value outcomes for each area
   of the scope will help you finalize your plan in such a way that your
   overall mission is achieved. Each PLO is accomplished differently,
   which adds to the importance of clearly thinking through the types
   of learning you desire that are relevant to each topic and subtopic
   you identified. Knowledge isn't acquired in the same manner that
   values are adopted. Understanding and belief result from differ-
   ent types of teaching and learning strategies. Diffusion of learning
   means that there will always be overlap in learning, but if there is a
   desire for a specific type of learning outcome, then it is important
   to understand the types of learning experiences that are most likely
   to lead to that type of change. Ford created a list of principles or
   guidelines for teaching toward each of the four learning outcomes.
   The following lists are adapted from his original work.9

  Principles of Learning for Knowledge

   The following guidelines will help students acquire basic knowledge,
   the ability to recall or recognize information.

    1. Involve them in activities where they have to provide an active
         response and not remain passive learners.

    2. Incorporate learning activities that require the learners to use
         more than one of their senses at the same time. Hearing and
         seeing information is an example of this principle.

9. Ford, Design for Teaching and Training, 97.
                                                 Understanding Teaching and Learning | 141
3. Give the students advance organizers for their learning, allow-
      ing them to see what they are supposed to learn ahead of time.
      This might be a chart of what each session will cover or a list of
      keywords they should listen for in a biblical passage.

4. Provide the learners with immediate knowledge of the results
      of what they are attempting to recall or recite.

5. Involve the learners in many different learning activities that
      are all focused on achieving the same learning outcome.

6. Plan unique and memorable activities that will help them
      remember the information they are intended to learn.

Principles of Learning for Understanding

The following guidelines will help students acquire understanding.
As you read through the principles, notice how they are geared
toward various levels of understanding from comprehension
through evaluation. When planning discipleship events or teaching
sessions, it will be helpful to follow principles that relate to the level
of learning you hope your students will achieve.

 1. Plan learning activities in which students will be asked to
      translate basic concepts into new forms.

2. Incorporate activities that will require learners to discover the
      connections between various ideas and concepts.

3. Ask students to define or interpret specific ideas, biblical
      truths, or concepts.

4. Utilize learning activities that involve students in using what
      they have learned in practical ways.

5. Call for students to engage in an activity that requires them to
      break down larger bodies of information into meaningful parts.

6. Provide case studies or other means of presenting students
      with problems they have to solve based on their understanding
      of the key concept you want them to understand.

142 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
 7. Require students to engage in an activity that requires them to
      combine several ideas or concepts about a subject and create a
      new product or resource.

8. Call for students to use their understanding of a concept to
      judge the value or worth of something based on specific guide-
      lines or standards related to that idea.

Principles of Learning for Attitudes, Values, and
Beliefs

The following guidelines will be useful in helping students develop
personal values, attitudes, or beliefs related to specific biblical
truths.

 1. Involve leaders and peers in the learning situation who will
      model the attitudes and values that you hope the learners will
      adopt for themselves.

2. Give opportunities for the learners to read or hear about oth-
      ers who exemplify the attitude or value you want them to
      appropriate.

3. Help students to engage with respected, authoritative sources
      that will emphasize the importance of the attitude or value.

4. Assist students in identifying and articulating the attitude or
      value and what it means.

5. Give learners opportunities to have meaningful emotional
      experiences related to the value or belief.

6. Plan opportunities for learners to act on the values and prac-
      tice the attitudes in appropriate ways.

 7. Help students analyze their own values and engage in deci-
      sion-making related to moral and ethical issues.

8. Involve learners in activities that call for them to reflect on
      their lives through the lens of biblical truth.

9. Provide opportunities for students to share their stories with

                                            Understanding Teaching and Learning | 143
      others in a safe environment that gives them a sense of free-
      dom and trust.

Principles of Learning for Psychomotor Skills

While there will be fewer opportunities or needs for helping stu-
dents develop skills within the context of a curriculum plan focused
on spiritual transformation, there will be times when it will be
appropriate. Following these guidelines will help. They do not
include activities designed for adaptation or origination.

 1. Arrange situations for the learners to see the entire process or
      skill before they begin.

2. Provide a step-by-step demonstration of the skill for students
      to observe.

3. Ask the learners to explain aloud the instructions or their plans
      for carrying out a specific sequence of actions needed to
      accomplish the skill.

4. Assist the learners in their first attempts to accomplish the
      skill.

5. Give learners opportunities to perform the skill numerous
      times without any assistance.

6. Allow students to practice the skill under realistic conditions.

     Focus Activity

         · Read over the principles for each of the PLOs.
             Select four subtopics you included in the curriculum

144 | Understanding Teaching and Learning
        scope you created in chapter 4. Identify both a cogni-
        tive and an affective learning outcome for each.
    · Using the principles of learning for understanding
        and attitudes, values, and beliefs, describe two differ-
        ent learning activities that could be used to accom-
        plish each outcome for each subtopic. What are two
        things you might include in your teaching to help stu-
        dents acquire an understanding of each of the
        subtopics? What are two different activities you
        might incorporate into a learning session to help stu-
        dents develop a commitment or begin to value the
        biblical truth related to each of the subtopics? The
        principles should guide you toward creating appro-
        priate learning activities for each PLO.

                    Select one subtopic for each of the
                 forty-eight separate topics included in the
                 scope of your curriculum plan. (You may
                 include the subtopics you used for the
                 reflection exercises you have already
                 completed for this chapter.) For each
                 subtopic, identify both a cognitive and an
                 affective learning outcome you want your
                 students to achieve. These don't have to
                 be written in any particular form, but it is
                 imperative that you begin thinking about
                 the significance of your scope. Ask your-
                 self, "Why is this part of the scope? What
                 should learners know about this topic?

                 they will adopt as a result of their curricu-

                 concept?" This work will prepare you for
                 the process of writing your specific goals

            Sabine Moreau headed to the train station to pick up a
friend. The station was to the north of her hometown in Hainault
Erquelinnes, Brussels, but sixty-seven-year-old Sabine didn't ques-
tion her GPS directions, which took her south instead of north.
She began to see signs for the German towns of Frankfurt and
Cologne, but she continued to follow the route on the GPS. The trip
became quite lengthy, forcing Sabine to refuel twice and even pull
over for a couple of hours of sleep. Still, Sabine didn't question her
route. Eventually, Sabine entered Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and
she realized something was not right. Sabine's friend at the station
and her son also figured out there was a problem when she never

148 | Establishing Curricular Outcomes
   showed up, and her son finally contacted the police. All Sabine had
   to say when she got home was, "I admit it's a little weird, but I was
   distracted."1

               In Australia, three Japanese tourists used a GPS to drive to
   North Stradbroke Island, which is just off the coast of Brisbane. The
   device didn't take into account the nine miles of water that divided
   the island from the mainland, and the tourists kept following the
   directions even when the road turned to gravel, then thick mud, and
   eventually water lapping against the tires. They finally abandoned
   their car and walked back on foot, while their misadventure was
   witnessed by passengers on a passing ferry. The car was retrieved
   by a tow truck but was too damaged by the journey into the ocean
   to be repaired.2

               Robert Jones used his GPS on a drive to West Yorkshire,
   England. He kept driving as the road became steep and narrower.
   Eventually, his car bumped into a thin wire fence mere inches from
   a one-hundred-foot drop. Though he was able to safely exit, the car
   was balanced on the edge of a cliff, and it took a recovery team nine
   hours to retrieve it and haul it off. Jones explained, "It kept insisting
   the path was a road, so I just trusted it."3

               Three women visiting Bellevue, Washington, were out late
   and couldn't find their way back to their hotel. They asked their GPS
   for a reroute and drove down what they thought was a road that
   would take them back to the highway. The road was actually a boat
   launch, and they ended up in a lake. They were able to get out of

   the car, but the SUV was completely submerged by the time help
   arrived. A local fireman said, "We've seen sitcom parodies of some­
   thing like this and to actually see it is surprising."4

               A thirty-seven-year-old German truck driver used his GPS
   to guide him to a factory in Switzerland to deliver his cargo. He
   ignored the "no entry" warning signs and continued to follow the
   voice from his GPS. His truck became wedged in a cherry tree, stuck
   fast. Branches of the tree had to be chopped down to free the truck.5

               In designing a curriculum plan, it is essential to determine
   your final destination. The mission statement provides the ultimate
   purpose, but each element of the scope should also include specific
   goals related to the content. An intentional plan deliberately
   includes content for a specific reason. The goals and indicators clar-
   ify those reasons. Some curriculum resources focus on a subject,
   but they lack a clear rationale or goal and indicator statement, so
   they don't always clearly lead toward a specific learning outcome.

               Writing clear goals is a way of ensuring that you are head-
   ing in the right direction and that each element of the plan is aligned
   with your overall mission. Identifying indicators will help you know
   whether you're on the right track. The GPS users in the previous
   examples set a direction, but they blindly followed the device and
   ignored the signs that they weren't traveling where they wanted to
   go. If you plan teaching and learning situations that follow the prin-
   ciples related to the primary learning outcomes (PLOs) you identi-
   fied in your goals and you construct clear indicators for each goal,
   you will be able to determine whether your plan is on track toward
   the accomplishment of your mission.

   150 | Establishing Curricular Outcomes
From Scope to Goals

Determining the scope of a curriculum plan is essential. It sets the
boundaries for what learners will intentionally experience along the
journey, the most significant concepts, ideas, principles, and topics
intentionally taught within a particular ministry or course of study.
They hold value in and of themselves, but a list alone will not lead
students to achieve the essential change you envisioned when you
identified the themes and topics that compose the ministry's scope.
Students won't learn by looking at a list. Your curricular mission
won't be achieved simply because you have identified what needs
"to be covered" in the plan.

            Think about a jeweler whose mission is to create unique,
beautiful, handcrafted jewelry that is meaningful to the customer,
utilizing the highest-quality materials and expert craftsmanship.
The jeweler sources the finest precious gems and desirable metals
from around the world, purchasing only authentic stones and pure
metals that will last a lifetime and potentially become heirlooms for
generations to come. Her curated collection exceeds that of other
jewelers in the region. Her showcases are full of exquisite, pure
materials.

            Customers are impressed by the array, but no jewelry
pieces are on display in her shop. No samples exist, not even draw-
ings of "what might be." While some customers may have a personal
vision of the heirloom they desire, the process of selecting each gem
or metal and designing an exquisite piece is overwhelming. Most
potential customers need the expertise of the jeweler to spark their
imagination, but there are only raw materials available for view-
ing. For the jeweler, the customer is in charge of determining the
desired change to the metals and gems, then she will handcraft the
jewelry to their expectations. However, the customer is looking to
the expert jeweler to help him or her see what can and should be
changed to merge the metals and gems into something exquisite.
The jeweler's ultimate mission to craft unique jewelry is never fully

                                                   Establishing Curricular Outcomes | 151
realized. She has the materials to accomplish what she set out to
do, but she has not successfully changed them into beautiful hand-
crafted pieces.

            Gathering the essential raw materials for a curricular plan
is necessary. This is the act of creating the scope. It is also just as
crucial to determine why each theme, topic, and subtopic is part of
the curricular journey. You must determine the learning you hope
to see realized by those who engage in a study of each biblical topic
and scriptural teaching in your scope. In chapter 5, you began this
process as you read about three types of learning: cognitive, affec-
tive, and behavioral skills. For every topic and subtopic included
in your plan, it is important to think about both the cognitive and
affective learning you want students to achieve. In fact, both cog-
nitive and affective outcomes should be associated with every topic
on your list. As was mentioned in chapter 5, very few parts of your
scope will directly lend themselves to psychomotor skill outcomes.
While you may think of desired behavioral changes associated with
the scope, almost all of the time, the changes envisioned will be due
to cognitive skills (I understand how to share my faith) or high lev-
els of commitment that result in changed behavior (I am sharing my
faith because I am committed to sharing the gospel).

            Identifying the type of learning you want students to expe-
rience and then describing the rationale or purpose for each com-
ponent of the scope is the essence of goal setting. It specifies the
desired learning outcomes for each aspect of a curricular scope.
What changes are desired in the learner as a result of encountering
each of the building blocks? What outcomes do you hope to see in the
students' lives as a result of studying each biblical truth, life-changing
idea, or principle? Various terms are used to describe these learning
outcomes. Some authors refer to them as objectives, others prefer
the term instructional objectives, and still others call them aims. The
most direct and universally understood term for a learning outcome
is a goal, which is what will be used for the purposes of curriculum
development within this book.

152 | Establishing Curricular Outcomes
            As you consider each topic, give careful thought to the
associated desirable outcomes. You should be able to envision var-
ious types of learning for each topic and subtopic. For example, if
prayer was a topic you identified, perhaps related to a larger theme
of spiritual disciplines, you might want students to know the mean-
ing of prayer, understand the importance of prayer, and be commit-
ted to a consistent prayer life. You will write separate goals for each
of these outcomes because every written goal should focus on only
one PLO.

            While each goal is focused on one PLO, we know that learn-
ing doesn't occur in isolation. When we gain an understanding of
something, we often change our perception or value of the subject
we are studying. For example, when students understand more
about the health benefits of sleep or the risks associated with a lack
of healthy sleep practices, they may commit to establishing a more
consistent sleep routine, going to bed earlier, avoiding technology
before turning in, or sleeping longer. Your PLO was cognitive, but in
their understanding of the importance of sleep, some students also
achieved an affective outcome. This overlap of learning outcomes is
quite common and was introduced in chapter 5. It is the concept of
diffusion of learning. For each learning experience, you will focus on
teaching for change in one domain--cognitive, affective, or behav-
ioral--but the learning becomes diffused or spread out into different
areas.

            Your comprehensive curriculum plan should contain sev-
eral goals for each subtopic. Consider the topic of prayer that was
previously referenced. You may want students to memorize a stan-
dard definition of prayer or specific biblical examples of prayer.
Asking students to memorize specific content constitutes the
knowledge level of cognitive learning. Additionally, you may want
learners to understand the importance of prayer, to understand
what the Bible teaches about prayer, to understand how they can
develop the habit of prayer, or to understand the various types of
prayer. Affective changes you desire as learning outcomes may be
a commitment to a consistent prayer life, a devotion to praying for

                                                   Establishing Curricular Outcomes | 153
others, or a willingness to express their prayer concerns with oth-
ers. As a Christian, you would not create any skill goals related to
prayer. Some religions require specific motor skills or behaviors to
accompany the practice of prayer, but this is not part of the bibli-
cal teaching on prayer. Prayer does not require any specific motor
skills to validate the practice, which in its simplest definition is com-
munion with God. While you would want your learners to be able
to pray, that would be a cognitive outcome. In other words, if they
understand how to pray, they are equipped with everything they
need to be able to pray. The practice of prayer involves understand-
ing and commitment, not developing specific motor skills.

Writing Goals

Just as a mission statement articulates the direction and outcome
of a ministry or curriculum plan, a goal clearly identifies a purpose
for each part of a curriculum's scope. It answers questions such as,
Why is it important for this to be included in the plan? How will it
help the learner achieve the overall mission? What would we expect
learners to know, understand, or value related to this topic? Each
subtopic within a curriculum plan will likely have several purposes.
It was included in the plan because it was determined to be essen-
tial to accomplishing the mission. The essential reasons will proba-
bly include both cognitive and affective outcomes. Everything in the
scope will correspond with multiple learning outcomes.

Characteristics of a Goal

Goals that are written in proper form have at least four basic char-
acteristics. First of all, a goal statement is a fairly broad description
of what a student will learn. It doesn't provide specific details about
what a student will do to prove they have learned, but it gives an
overall picture of the direction of the learning. For example, an
acceptable goal written in proper form would not say, "Students will
paraphrase the Ten Commandments." This is too narrow. A broader
description would focus on the reason for the paraphrase: "Students
will understand the meaning of the Ten Commandments."

            Secondly, a goal statement always identifies what the stu­
dent will learn, what the student will accomplish, and not what the
teacher will do. Goals don't describe what you will do to help stu-
dents learn, such as "Explain to the students the meaning of jubilee
within the Old Testament." If you are going to explain the meaning
of jubilee, it is probably because your goal is for your learners to
understand the Old Testament meaning of jubilee.

                                                   Establishing Curricular Outcomes | 155
            The third characteristic of a goal is that it always identifies
the PLO. A proper goal always communicates whether you want
your students to achieve a cognitive, affective, or behavioral out-
come. In reading the goal, it will be obvious whether the outcome
is knowledge, understanding, value/commitment, or a psychomo-
tor skill. This means that a goal written in proper form would not
say, "Students will learn about..." The type of learning must be spec-
ified.

            The final goal characteristic may seem obvious but is often
overlooked. The goal must clearly identify the specific learning sub­
ject, and it should be something that could actually be achieved
within the desired time frame. If the goal is written for one specific
teaching session, the teacher must determine whether the goal
could be accomplished in one session. This would not be an appro-
priate goal: "Students will understand prayer." There is a subject
included, but it is not specific enough for a session. It is simply too
comprehensive to be achieved within any measurable time frame.
What about prayer do you want them to understand? What is some-
thing students could grasp within a single session? If a goal is con-
structed for an entire unit of study, such as four sessions, the same
question should be asked: Can this goal be accomplished within four
learning sessions? (Note: It is appropriate to write a goal for an entire
unit of study, but each of the sessions within the unit should also
have separate learning goals.)

             the Christian life.
         · Students will learn to connect significant concepts.
         · Equip students to study Scripture.

Writing Indicators

The first step toward bringing a curriculum plan to life is to write
specific goals related to each topic. This focuses on the desired
learning outcome. However, constructing goals alone won't guaran-
tee that students have learned. They provide direction for the learn-
ing experiences and determine the teacher's intended outcomes,
but they don't provide any guidelines to evaluate whether the stated
outcomes were met. When teachers take learning seriously, they
identify a means to measure how well the goals have been achieved.
Each written goal must include a specific action statement that will
indicate that the goal has been accomplished. The terminology used
for such a measurement can vary, but the simplest label and the
one used in this resource is an indicator. As the label implies, it
is an action on the part of the learner that indicates the achieve-

                                                   Establishing Curricular Outcomes | 157
ment of the goal. It is up to the one constructing the curriculum to
determine an appropriate indicator for each goal. It must, however,
include a specific action that can be observed or measured.

            Indicators and goals can be written as two separate state-
ments, or they can be combined into one goal-indicator statement.
A simple way of combining these two essential planning elements is
by using the following formula:

      Learners will ___ (this is your goal), and they will demon-
      strate achievement of this by ___ (this is your indicator).

            Indicators identify the specific action learners will take to
prove they have learned. It is up to the teacher or the curriculum
writer to determine what this action will be. Indicators should be
reasonable actions tied directly to the goals, simple proof that the
goal has been achieved. If you can't observe proof of learning, you
can't be confident that the goal has been met. If your goal is for stu-
dents to know the books of the Bible, what is the simplest way they
could indicate they have achieved the goal? You might say, Learners
will know the books of the Bible, and they will indicate achievement
of this by writing the names of all sixty-six books. What if the stu-
dent can recite the names but can't write them? Maybe you want to
allow students to either write the names or recite them. The best
way to frame the indicator might be Learners will know the books of
the Bible, and they will indicate achievement of this by identifying all
sixty-six books. This allows you the freedom for students to iden-
tify them on a list, by writing them out, or by reciting them. Know-
ing your learners, their ages, and their educational backgrounds will
help you construct appropriate indicators.

            Regardless of the proof you identify, it should indicate to
you that the goal has been met. As previously mentioned, an indica-
tor must include an action that can be demonstrated. If your goal is
for students to know the books of the Bible, it would not be appro-
priate for an indicator to say, They will indicate achievement of this
by memorizing the names of all sixty-six books. Why is this not an
acceptable indicator? Because memorization can't be observed. It is

158 | Establishing Curricular Outcomes
still a goal and not an indicator; memorizing is the same as know-
ing the books. An appropriate indicator would require proof that the
students have memorized.

Types of Indicators

Indicators require a type of measurable activity, but they can come
in a variety of forms. You might ask students to draw a picture of
a concept, explain an idea, write a paraphrase, act out an example,
choose something from a list, demonstrate a skill, or select concepts
from a case study. We generally think of indicators according to
three distinct categories. The first type of indicator is verbal. Words
are used to indicate the achievement of a goal. They may be spoken
or written, but the essence of the indicator is the use of words.

            The second main category of indicator is discriminatory.
Students indicate their learning by making choices or discriminat-
ing. This could include such actions as selecting appropriate terms
or explanations from a list, watching a digital clip to identify pos-
itive or negative examples of specific concepts, choosing a picture
that best represents a concept, or analyzing a case study to identify
examples of a specific idea you want them to understand. Regard-
less of the actual indicator, if it calls for the learner to discriminate
or make choices, it is a discriminatory indicator. Even if they choose
words from among a variety of choices, the indicator is discrimina-
tory and not verbal. A verbal indicator calls for students to prove
their learning through the use of words, but when they are choosing
or discriminating as proof of their learning, then they are complet-
ing a discriminatory indicator.

            The final type of indicator is rarely used in discipleship
curriculum because it is a motor indicator. It calls for learners to
engage in a physical activity to prove they have learned, but the
activity must be a demonstration of a motor skill goal. In other
words, drawing a picture that illustrates the main teaching of a Bible

                                                  Establishing Curricular Outcomes | 159
story involves a physical activity, but it isn't a motor indicator. It
doesn't prove mastery of a particular psychomotor skill. It repre-
sents illustrating ideas or words or may even represent choosing
which ideas to illustrate. What it doesn't do is demonstrate the
acquisition of a motor skill. Motor indicators are only tied to psy-
chomotor skills. If the goal is for learners to be able to shingle a
roof properly, then they could prove the achievement of that goal
by doing something like nailing shingles on a roof in an acceptable
fashion. Knowing the three key types of indicators can be helpful for
the teacher who is trying to identify the proof they will require to
determine whether learners have accomplished a particular goal.

            Indicators include information about how well a student will
have to perform to show they have accomplished the learning goal. If
the goal is for students to know the books of the Bible, would you
be satisfied if the learners could recite fifty-three of the sixty-six
books? What if they were able to recognize sixty-four of them on
a list but couldn't identify the last two? If your goal is for students
to understand the benefits of prayer, how many benefits would you
want them to explain in order to meet your learning goal? This "how
well" information should generally be part of a learning indicator.
However, it isn't always necessary. How well a student must perform
might be generally understood, as in the case of knowing the books
of the Bible. If learners can't identify all sixty-six books, it is obvi-
ous they don't know the books of the Bible, at least not all of them,
which is what the goal implies.

            If an indicator does include information about how well a
student must perform, then the amount or standard must be spe-
cific. It isn't acceptable to simply say a student should know "a few
concepts" or "most of" something. The key benefit of identifying how
well a student needs to perform is that it can be a signal to the
teacher that further emphasis on a topic might need to take place.
It provides a measuring stick to reference how well students have
learned. Instead of arriving at the end of a session wondering if the
students genuinely understand the concepts you intended them to

160 | Establishing Curricular Outcomes
learn, when the indicator includes information on how well the stu-
dent must perform, then you can more easily determine whether
the goal has been met at an acceptable level.

            Indicators may describe any special circumstances under
which a student will demonstrate achievement of the goal. This char-
acteristic is used less often in the context of discipleship learning.
It is beneficial to know, however, as it provides specific conditions
for the student's demonstration of learning. It may be a time limit,
for instance, or the materials a student will have to work with to
demonstrate learning. Will they be given a list of characteristics to
explain or descriptions of biblical accounts to place in some type of
order, or will they be allowed to work with a partner or in teams?

Affective Indicators

Affective goals are those focused on heart change. When the learn-
ing outcome is intended to elicit a commitment or value adopted
by the student, then an affective goal and indicator are required.
These types of goals and indicators are central to the type of learn-
ing one hopes a disciple will embrace on the journey toward spiri-
tual growth. The difficulty for the teacher is in accurately assessing
this type of learning. The first characteristic of every indicator is
to identify the action the teacher will require to prove the learners'
achievement of a specific goal. Obviously, it isn't always possible to
recognize when a learner has made a genuine commitment or come
to value a particular Christian ideal. How can one know if a learner
is committed to sharing the gospel with lost friends or family mem­
bers? How can a teacher be certain that a student values the Bible
or being part of the Church? The answer is that no one can ever be
certain about the values or heart commitments of another person.
The importance of evaluating the attainment of an affective goal is
no less important than measuring cognitive change, but it is always
imprecise, and the outcomes can never be accurately verified. That
doesn't mean that the teacher leaves affective learning up to chance
or ignores the importance of determining indicators, however.

            The Bible teaches the importance of affective learning and
often provides examples of the evidence seen in the life of a disciple
when this type of heart change is genuine. For example, Christians
are called to love others, and genuine love is indicated by the fol-
lowing:

                Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does
                not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor oth-
                ers, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it
                keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in
                evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects,
                always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.

                                                      1 Corinthians 13:4-7, NIV

162 | Establishing Curricular Outcomes
            A goal might focus on loving others, demonstrated by any
of the previous actions. The actions would be indicators but would
still need to be written in such a way that they could be observed.
What might demonstrate kindness, patience, or humility?

            Belief in God is an example of an essential affective change
in the life of a genuine disciple. Scripture teaches that even faith
must be demonstrated by outward actions. Values, beliefs, and com-
mitments are always indicated by observable behaviors:

                What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone
                claims to have faith but has no deeds? Can such
                faith save them? Suppose a brother or a sister is
                without clothes and daily food. If one of you says
                to them, "Go in peace; keep warm and well fed," but
                does nothing about their physical needs, what good
                is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not
                accompanied by action, is dead.

                            But someone will say, "You have faith; I
                have deeds."

                            Show me your faith without deeds, and I
                will show you my faith by my deeds. You believe that
                there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe
                that--and shudder.

                                                               James 2:14-19, NIV
            Affective indicators are written in a unique way. Instead of
precisely determining what action a student should take to prove
learning, teachers select actions that they would be most likely
to observe and then offer opportunities for the student to reflect
those actions. The teacher or curriculum writer must determine an
appropriate observable action that would indicate the student has
made the commitment or adopted the value or belief stated in the
goal.
            These are often referred to as a representative response.
What action might the teacher observe that would represent the
type of affective change they hope to accomplish through their
teaching? Because they are less certain, the indicators use a slightly

                                                  Establishing Curricular Outcomes | 163
different format than those used for cognitive or behavioral out-
comes. The following is one format for writing a goal and indicator
for an affective outcome:

      Learners will ___ (this is your goal), and they will demon-
      strate achievement of this by doing such things as ___
      (this is your indicator, a representative response).

            Here is a sample of an affective goal and indicator using a
representative response:

      Learners will commit to sharing their faith with their lost
      friends, and they will demonstrate achievement of this by
      doing such things as describing a conversation they have had
      with a lost friend about their need for salvation.

            The teacher would plan for a time during the session when
students are invited to share their personal experience of sharing
their faith with a lost friend. Of course, for a variety of reasons,
some students may exaggerate their faith-sharing experiences, and
some may choose not to talk about actual faith conversations. It is
up to the teacher to gain a sense of whether their students are com-
mitted to sharing the gospel. If students don't talk about their expe-
riences but have begun to invite their lost friends to a Bible study
or other ministry events, the teacher may gain some level of confi-
dence that the goal is being achieved even though the specific indi-
cator has not been met.

            Consider another example:
      Learners will develop a heart for the poor, and they will
      demonstrate achievement of this by doing such things as vol­
      unteering to participate in a ministry project with those in a
      local homeless shelter.

            The teacher would presumably plan an opportunity for stu-
dents to participate in a ministry project at the homeless shelter
or make them aware of opportunities that exist within the Church
or community. As in the previous example, students may sign up to
participate in such a ministry project for a variety of reasons, and
some students might not sign up because their schedule won't allow
them to volunteer on a particular date. Either way, the teacher can

164 | Establishing Curricular Outcomes
never be sure whether the students have developed a heart for the
poor, but they have determined a representative response that will
help her gain a reasonable determination of whether the students
are growing in their compassion for the poor in the community.

  or positive qualities. Cleopatra was actually Greek, though she did
  speak Egyptian, one of about ten languages at her command.1 Julius
  Caesar fell in love with her on a visit to Egypt, and she returned with
  him to Rome. The Romans weren't sure what to think about Cleopa-
  tra. They hated the idea of an Egyptian queen in Rome, but they
  were also mesmerized by her charm. However, when Caesar was

   assassinated, Cleopatra returned home to Egypt and joined Marc
   Antony as a naval commander, leading ships against the Roman
   Empire along with Caesar's nephew, Augustus. The Romans feared
   that Cleopatra wanted to rule Rome. When the relationship between
   Antony and Augustus eventually deteriorated, Augustus made it
   known that Marc Antony planned to leave lands and bestow titles
   on the children he had with Cleopatra. This convinced the Romans
   that both Antony and Cleopatra were their rivals and should be
   eliminated. The Roman Senate removed all of Antony's power and
   declared war on Cleopatra.2 This negative history between the
   Romans and the Egyptians probably accounts for much of the way
   Cleopatra has been portrayed. Eventually viewed as an enemy to
   Rome, the Romans painted her as a beautiful but seductive, power-
   hungry temptress. Arabic history remembers her as a powerful,
   intelligent, strong ruler and a great leader.

               Ludwig van Beethoven is considered one of the greatest
   composers of all time. He was introduced to music when he was
   quite young, and his first teacher was his very strict father. If he
   failed to practice correctly, his father would beat him and his
   mother if she tried to intervene. His resolution to become a great
   pianist is said to have been motivated by his desire to prevent his
   mother from being abused by his father. She died young, and his
   father became an alcoholic. Beethoven relied on private donations
   for his work, and even though his music was loved by many, he often
   struggled to raise enough support to continue his creative work.

               Though he was considered a great musician, Beethoven's
   habits were unconventional. He was considered clumsy, ugly, and
   untidy, and regardless of many attempts to make him behave, the
   efforts didn't seem to work. He once told the archduke that it was

   impossible for him to follow the rules of social behavior. Beethoven's
   music was also unconventional in his use of style and form, which
   caused him to be alienated from more classical teachers of the time.

               He began to lose his hearing in his early twenties, but he
   continued to compose masterpieces. He eventually became totally
   deaf, but his ability to inwardly hear the music allowed him to create
   beautiful music. However, his deafness made it difficult to perform
   with orchestras because he was unable to keep time with the other
   musicians. This caused him to be ridiculed by the public. Yet his
   most widely admired compositions, including the Ninth Symphony,
   were composed during the last fifteen years of his life.3

               Vincent Van Gogh was a Dutch postimpressionist painter
   whose most famous works include Sunflowers, The Starry Night, and
   Café Terrace at Night. While he eventually became known as one of
   the most celebrated artists of the twentieth century and a pioneer
   in the development of modern art, Van Gogh's artistic abilities were
   largely ignored during his lifetime.

               When he was young, Van Gogh worked in his uncle's art
   dealership, but after becoming frustrated and unhappy, he became
   a Protestant minister. He preached in poor agricultural districts and
   empathized with those who lived in poverty. Van Gogh began to
   share in their difficult living conditions, but despite trying to live
   according to the gospel, the Church authorities decided that he was
   undermining the "dignity of the priesthood," and they removed him
   from his post. That is when he became an artist.

               Van Gogh was not considered a great artist during his life-
   time and only sold one painting. He was demoted from one art
   academy because of his inability to draw. However, he continued to
   work hard and improve his technique. His early failures as an artist
   haunted him throughout his life, and he was troubled by a sense of

   inadequacy. Van Gogh was also known to have a volatile temper and
   was considered unstable. He was eventually committed to a mental
   health facility, where he lived off and on until his death.

               Van Gogh didn't hold a regular job but put his whole being
   into his art, often neglecting his health, appearance, and finances.
   His brother Theo often sent him money and provided him with
   painting materials. While aware of how he was perceived, Van Gogh
   remained passionate about his vision for life, as evident in this letter
   to his brother:

                   What am I in the eyes of most people--a nonentity,
                   an eccentric, or an unpleasant person--somebody
                   who has no position in society and will never have;
                   in short, the lowest of the low. All right, then--even
                   if that were absolutely true, then I should one day
                   like to show by my work what such an eccentric,
                   such a nobody, has in his heart. That is my ambition,
                   based less on resentment than on love in spite of
                   everything, based more on a feeling of serenity than
                   on passion.

                                   --Vincent Van Gogh (Letter to Theo, July
                                                                                   1882)4

   nature? They remind us that people are more complex than we can
   observe from the outside, that others' opinions aren't always accu-

   in the same way. Stereotypes and prejudice can prevent us from
   changing our beliefs or opinions.

   ple to agree with us, but it is about helping others acknowledge

involves clearing up misconceptions, and other times, it is about
introducing people to ideas that are brand new. Regardless of where
people are in their current understanding, the invitation to disci-
pleship is open to everyone. This is the work of spiritual trans-
formation and the purpose of a curriculum plan. This will require
teaching and learning resources that take into account all aspects
of human diversity and provide all persons the opportunity to grow
into Christlikeness, no matter where their journey begins.

Learner Considerations

A curriculum plan is a complex document, full of potential but com-
pletely useless unless it is implemented. In the introduction to this
book, it was noted that it is important to design teaching and learn-
ing experiences that lead toward spiritual transformation for a spe-
cific target audience. Unplanned experiences are also part of the
curricular journey because we recognize that not everyone learns
the same things or in the same ways, even when participating in
the same curriculum. All persons bear God's image, but that doesn't
mean people act, think, or respond the same way. While it isn't fea-
sible to try to create unique learning experiences for each individ-
ual learner, it is important to recognize the variety of ways in which
people learn so that the curriculum comes to life for everyone on
the journey.

            While the focus of this book is on curriculum development
and not teaching, there are some commonly understood patterns of
teaching and learning that should guide those who select and cre-
ate teaching and learning experiences for discipleship. Students dif-
fer in how they perceive and process information, how they relate
to other learners, what motivates them, their level of self-aware-
ness, and how they communicate. These characteristics represent
particular learning styles or preferences. When implementing a cur-
riculum plan, it is important to focus on student learning. This
necessitates the incorporation of methods and structures that will
provide opportunities for students to encounter experiences that
intersect with their preferred learning styles. It is important to real-
ize that these are learning preferences and not required conditions
for learning to transpire.

            Sometimes learning preferences are the result of condi-
tioning. Cultural expectations on the role of the teacher and learner
can shape these preferences and even override natural preferences.
If students have grown up sitting passively while the teacher lec-
tures, they may be uncomfortable in a situation that expects them

                                                            Bringing Curriculum to Life | 173
to interact or respond to questions. They may hesitate to ask their
own questions or participate in a group activity. However, remem-
ber that people can learn in a variety of ways, even when the way in
which they are taught doesn't align with their preferences. Change
is always uncomfortable, but if our desire is for students to experi-
ence life transformation, then we will consider their learning styles
and best practices for teaching and learning in our curriculum
design. This doesn't mean that each learning session will incorpo-
rate a smorgasbord of learning methods, but it does suggest that
variety will be the hallmark of our teaching.

Global or Analytic Learners

Most people interpret the world from one of two main polarities,
referred to as either global or analytic. While all learners engage
both polarities to some extent, and there are some who make equal
use of both, it is more common for individuals to show a preference
as either a global or an analytic learner. A study of the behaviors
of naval fighter pilots in World War II revealed this understanding.
A psychologist, Herman Witkin, began conducting tests to under-
stand why some pilots were able to fly out of a fogbank, retaining
their upright orientation, while others emerged from the fog upside
down. What he discovered was that some pilots depended more on
their field of vision to maintain an upright position and became dis-
oriented by being unable to see their surroundings. He labeled them
field-dependent, or global, learners. Others were labeled field-inde-
pendent learners because they were able to maintain their upright
orientation even though they couldn't see where they were. They

174 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
   fall into the category of analytic learners.5 Witkin's research led to
   our understanding of how learners interact with the world from
   either a global or analytic perspective.

                                 you feel and give a general idea of the theme,

                                 even though you do remember what they
                                 looked like.
                          2.Someone asks you how to get to the nearest fast-

                                    A.You explain which direction to head,

                                 where to turn, names of streets, and an
                                 approximate distance.

                                    B.You confess that you aren't really sure
                                 which streets to take, but you are able to pro-
                                 vide a general idea of where to head and you
                                 can describe the buildings and scenery they
                                 will pass on the way.
               If you see yourself as more of an A, then you are probably
   more analytic, or field independent. If B sounds more like your style,
   then you might be more global, or field dependent.6

Visual, Auditory, and Kinesthetic Learners

Learning occurs as we take information in through our senses,
including hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting, or touching. The three
main ways information is perceived are auditory, kinesthetic, and
visual. Most traditional teaching, especially for spiritual transforma-
tion, relies on auditory methods, though successful learning for the
majority of learners often depends on all three modalities.

            Auditory learners benefit from hearing, listening, and
speaking. Speaking is especially important for the auditory learner,
which emphasizes the importance of discussion. Visual learners like
to see what they're learning from charts, diagrams, graphs, or pic-
tures. For instance, they are more apt to remember and learn bib-
lical content if they read it themselves as opposed to listening to
someone else. Taking notes is also beneficial. Kinesthetic learners
need to become physically involved as they learn, so sitting still can
be distracting. Doing a project is beneficial, but so is pacing or walk-
ing around. Kinesthetic learners are more likely to remember what
they have done than what they have discussed, heard, or read.

 Learning Style Inventory

  Curriculum includes more than the learning content; it also consists
  of everything a learner experiences. The room arrangement, the
  time of day, the fellow students, and the temperature all impact
  learning. Kenneth and Rita Dunn developed the Learning Style
  Inventory (LSI) to assess these curricular components by studying
  student environmental learning preferences. Their research has
  become one of the most widely used, valid, and reliable assessments
  of its kind.7 The LSI identifies a learning style as "a biologically and

  cational Leadership, October 1990, 15-19.
   178 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
   developmentally imposed set of characteristics that make the same
   teaching method wonderful for some and terrible for others."8 The
   instrument takes the following learning preferences into account:

     · Environmental factors: sound, light, temperature, seating
         arrangements

     · Emotional factors: motivation, conformity/responsibility, task
         persistence, learning/classroom structure

     · Physiological factors: perceptual (auditory, visual, tactile/kines-
         thetic), intake needs of food/drink, time of day, mobility

     · Psychological factors: analytic-global, impulsive-reflective
     · Sociological factors: working alone, in a pair, with peers, in a

         group; relationship with authority; need for variety9

               As you plan for teaching and learning situations, remember
   that learners have preferences that impact their learning. The
   emphasis is on preferences that have an impact, not absolutes.
   Remember that these preferences aren't necessary for learning to
   take place. They may make it easier. Accounting for learning pref-
   erences may seem insignificant, but if we want to maximize the
   opportunity for significant life change, then we need to seriously
   consider the LSI research as we select where learning will take
   place, what expectations we place on the students, and how we plan
   the content.

Teaching Methods

Spiritual transformation involves learning, but not all learning is
done in the context of a small group or structured learning situa-
tion. As you review the goals and indicators you created for your
scope, you may decide that a retreat, service project, mentoring
relationship, or special event might be the optimum method to
accomplish your learning intent. Regardless of the structures you
implement, it is important to consider a variety of methods you
can incorporate into your plan. Repeatedly using the same methods
can suppress learning. Routines can be comfortable, but introducing
the unexpected can result in positive tension that leads to learning.
Using too many methods can also create chaos that can detract
from learning, so it is imperative to consider the audience, the goal,
and the available resources when you plan creative ways of teaching
that are most likely to lead to life transformation.

            There are a number of resources available that describe
innovative methods of teaching. The following paragraphs describe
the most common categories of methods you may want to consider.

180 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
Art Techniques

Using art methods is a great way to engage all types of learners,
not just those gifted in art. Using cartoons can allow images to
offer commentary on human characteristics and situations more
effectively than words. Displaying objects around the teaching envi-
ronment that represent key ideas or concepts can often communi-
cate or illustrate difficult or significant concepts. Posting a series of
drawings, paintings, or pictures can be effectively used in a num-
ber of ways. Students can select an image representing an idea or
feeling, allowing them to reflect on significant ideas and appropri-
ate meaning. Illustrating events, concepts, or reactions to a pas-
sage can be accomplished with any number of materials. Remember,
when asking students to produce something, the focus is not on the
final product but on the process it takes to create. Maps or charts
can clarify facts that are hard to visualize, and montages or collages
can offer a variety of images and symbols that highlight a particu-
lar theme. Sometimes a picture study can allow students to analyze
an artist's understanding of a concept. Warner Sallman's Christ at
Heart's Door is an excellent example of how this art method can be
used.

Drama Techniques

Drama is often used in teaching children or youth, as in acting out
Bible stories or creating role-plays. The method can be effective
with adults as well and for higher levels of learning than simple
comprehension. Creating hypothetical dialogues or monologues or
presenting a short dramatic situation relevant to the topic can gen-
erate discussion. Engaging in a simulation to reproduce a situation
so students can get a feel for the setting and identify what others
have experienced can be impactful.

Learning Games

Games are contests in which players operate according to specific
rules in order to achieve a goal. The four key characteristics are
contest, players, rules, and goals. Learning games include all four of
these characteristics and are marked by a serious learning intent.
They can include problem-solving, negotiating, questioning, role-
playing, information retrieving, or team building.

Music

Music is often used as an introduction to a learning session to
focus the attention of a group of learners. It might also serve to
unify a group. However, music is also a powerful teaching method
when it is purposefully woven into a plan. It can create an atmos-
phere to enrich learning and provide a means of worship but also
contribute to biblical insights and heart transformation. Instead of
music being ancillary, learners can engage in encountering musi-
cal content. They might study the lyrics from contemporary songs
or traditional hymns to evaluate their message or compare it with
biblical teaching. Students could also be encouraged to create new
lyrics to familiar tunes that reflect personal or life applications
aligned with a session goal.

Pencil-and-Paper Techniques

Note-taking, filling out worksheets, and journaling are probably the
extent of the writing methods most teachers incorporate into their
discipleship sessions. There are so many more ways to utilize this
method, which involves students in clarifying their thoughts and
feelings and expressing their understanding. Writing requires learn-

182 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
ers to engage in deeper thinking than asking for spontaneous dis-
cussion. Asking students to create an acrostic built around a
significant keyword, writing a review or paraphrase of a Scripture
passage, or engaging in a creative writing activity are all positive
uses of writing methods. Younger children can benefit from coded
messages, crossword puzzles, or puzzles to help them review and
process content. Creating hypothetical dialogues, expressing feel-
ings or encouragement through letter writing, completing open-
ended stories, or answering open-ended statements are additional
ways to incorporate paper-and-pencil methods. Writing poetry,
lyrics, haikus, or cinquains requires both creativity and critical
thinking. Asking for unsigned responses can provide teachers with
an indication of whether their affective goals have been achieved.

Verbal Techniques

Brainstorming is an often-overlooked method of problem-solving
that allows learners to offer spontaneous ideas or solutions without
criticism. Large groups can be divided into small groups to discuss
problems or case studies before reporting back to the larger group.
One discussion method, the circular response, allows everyone to
take turns responding to a posed question or statement. No one
can speak twice until everyone has had an opportunity, which can
alleviate the common problem of having students who dominate a
discussion or those who rarely speak. Panel discussions and infor-
mal debates can prompt alternate opinions and encourage critical
thinking about significant concepts. Interviews, panel discussions,
and lectures are other possible verbal techniques to consider when
planning discipleship sessions. Jesus's preferred teaching method
was verbal and often involved storytelling:

                He did not tell them anything without using stories.
                But when he was alone with his disciples, he
                explained everything to them.

Reflection Exercise

· Jesus used a variety of teaching methods designed
   to help his followers grow in their understanding and
   commitment. Which methods are represented by the
   following passages of Scripture? Matthew 5:1-2, Mark
   12:13-17, Matthew 18:1-5, Matthew 16:13-20, Luke
   10:1-11, and John 8:1-8. What other examples would
   you include in this list?

· Select one cognitive goal and one affective goal you
   created in chapter 6. For each goal, create three sep-
   arate learning activities using three different method-
   ologies. Don't describe an activity or method you
   regularly experience. Instead, use your creativity to
   develop an activity that would help learners engage in
   deeper spiritual growth. In your descriptions, include
   all of the necessary details for leading the activity.

· In your experience, what methods are most
   overused in discipleship settings? Why do you think
   that is the case?

Crafting Resources

A curriculum plan comes to life when appropriate resources are
selected and experiences are planned that bring about spiritual
transformation in the life of the learners. These decisions must
184 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
be made carefully so that the planned goals and indicators can
be achieved. Many outstanding curricular resources are available
through Christian publishers that may fulfill various purposes of a
plan. Events and unique learning experiences can also be designed
to help learners accomplish some of the curricular goals. However,
sometimes it is desirable to create your own curriculum materials.
It wouldn't be practical or even advisable to attempt to create all
of the learning resources needed to successfully implement a cur-
riculum plan. It is tedious work to produce quality materials, and
it wouldn't be the best stewardship of your time. It may be prefer-
able or even necessary at times if your target audience represents a
specialized population for which quality resources don't exist, aren't
readily available, or are cost prohibitive.

            There are many approaches to writing curriculum materi-
als or lesson plans. The first step is to understand the purpose of the
resources you are designing. Consideration must also be given to
the learning context, the experience and expertise of the teachers,
and how the resources will fit into the overall scope and sequence
of the plan. Lesson plans may be created for an entire unit of study
related to a particular topic or subtopics. Units often include four or
five weeks of materials, corresponding to a calendar month. Accord-
ing to Lois LeBar, since most discipleship meetings last only about
an hour each week, it can be difficult for students to make con-
nections between various sessions unless they are combined into
units of study. A unit allows for a more intentional focus, resulting
in greater learning continuity for the students. Each session would
include one subtopic or piece of the overall subject. An example of
a unit on the Holy Spirit might include sessions such as The Holy
Spirit as Teacher and Guide, The Holy Spirit as Counselor, The Holy

                                                           Bringing Curriculum to Life | 185
    Spirit as Illuminator, The Holy Spirit as Enabler, and The Holy Spirit
    as Convicter.10 Of course, units of study can be combined to form a
    more robust resource to be used over a longer period of time.

  Planning for Discussion Groups

    If resources are designed for discussion-based small groups, it is
    important to consider strategies for both disciple-making and com-
    munity building as you plan. The purpose should always be spiritual
    growth, but this is maximized when learners feel connected to one
    another and experience the freedom to interact honestly and with-
    out judgment. It will also be important to carefully craft questions
    that lead learners toward spiritual transformation. Rarely do worth-
    while questions simply emerge in the moment. They should be
    planned and incorporated into the teaching resource. It takes time
    to write significant questions, but if discussion is the key structure
    of a small group, the process can't be overlooked. Obviously, discus-
    sions flow out of questions and responses, and a qualified leader will
    be able to keep the dialogue moving so it doesn't come across as an
    inquisition.

  Questions

    Yes or no questions aren't helpful, but open-ended questions can
    help learners make sense of information and think beyond the obvi-
    ous. Avoid compound questions, those that combine more than one
    focus. Long-winded questions and those that are obvious, mislead-

    Revell, 1953), 208, 215-16.
     186 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
ing, or irrelevant should also be avoided. Closed questions are those
that solicit one particular correct response. These should be used
sparingly, as they focus more on factual information and lower lev-
els of understanding. Steer away from them altogether if they rely
on one specific Bible translation for a correct response. Challenging
questions allow students to think more deeply about the applica-
tion of the content to their lives. Utilizing each type of question can
be helpful. It is also possible to structure questions that lead learn-
ers through Bloom's taxonomy from basic knowledge through eval-
uation: What did the people do when they heard the news? What did
Jesus mean by his statement? When have you observed a similar reac­
tion? How might their disagreement be resolved in an orderly fashion?
How would you structure a worship experience in this environment?
How well did the Israelites adhere to God's commands?

            Michael Novelli has written a number of resources about
Bible storying as a teaching strategy. He recommends using ques-
tions from various categories to help learners understand and apply
the meaning of the text. Wondering questions require students to
consider the story's content before they begin appropriating mean-
ing. These may include such questions as, Did you notice anything
in the story that you hadn't realized before, what surprised you in the
story, or what questions does the story raise in your mind? Remem­
bering questions call for learners to recount specifics of the story,
but they should be used sparingly, since they are a form of closed
questioning. Interpreting questions take students beyond knowledge
to the comprehension level of understanding. For example, How
would you describe (key character's) commitment, or personality, or
emotions, or motive? Why do you think X acted the way he did when
X? What does this story teach us about God? Why do you think this
story was included in the Bible? Connecting questions require appli-
cation of the biblical content to the life of the learner. Examples of

                                                            Bringing Curriculum to Life | 187
    this type of question include, How is this story your story? Where
    do you see yourself in this story, or how does this story challenge or
    encourage you?11

  Planning for Structured Lessons

    Spiritual transformation is the work of the Holy Spirit within an
    individual, but God works with the human teacher to help facilitate
    that change. LeBar suggests that the teacher "prepare as if it all
    depends on God; work as if it all depended on you."12 God has chosen
    to work with and through willing Christians to disciple others. He
    has commanded us to make disciples, and doing so effectively
    requires planning. In speaking about worship, Paul reminds us in 1
    Corinthians 14:33 that "God is not a God of disorder." When teachers
    fail to plan, disorder is likely to follow. What is intended as a Bible
    study can easily devolve into a social gathering that results in very
    little learning. God expects our best effort at everything we attempt,
    and discipling others is one of the most significant tasks we can
    undertake. If we make the effort to plan a curriculum that will lead
    to spiritual growth in the life of learners, we can't simply go with
    the flow when it comes to teaching and hope that our goals will be
    accomplished:

                    Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as
                    you teach and admonish one another with all wis-
                    dom through psalms, hymns, and songs from the
                    Spirit, singing to God with gratitude in your hearts.

HBLT

Larry Richards introduced the hook, book, look, took (HBLT) method
for creating structured lesson plans. It is a useful approach to lesson
planning that can be adapted for any learning environment or target
audience.

            In their book Creative Bible Teaching, Richards and Gary
Bredfeldt suggest that Paul used this approach when he addressed
the philosophers on Mars Hill in Athens. When he was walking
through the city, waiting for Silas and Timothy, Paul noticed all of
the idols and one in particular that was dedicated to an unknown
god:

                Paul then stood up in the meeting of the Areopagus
                and said: "People of Athens! I see that in every way
                you are very religious. For as I walked around and
                looked carefully at your objects of worship, I even
                found an altar with this inscription: to an unknown
                god. So you are ignorant of the very thing you wor-
                ship--and this is what I am going to proclaim to you.

                            "The God who made the world and every-
                thing in it is the Lord of heaven and earth and does
                not live in temples built by human hands. And he is
                not served by human hands, as if he needed any-
                thing. Rather, he himself gives everyone life and
                breath and everything else. From one man he made
                all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole
                earth; and he marked out their appointed times in
                history and the boundaries of their lands. God did

                                                           Bringing Curriculum to Life | 189
                this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach
                out for him and find him, though he is not far from
                any one of us. `For in him we live and move and have
                our being.' As some of your own poets have said, `We
                are his offspring.'

                            "Therefore since we are God's offspring, we
                should not think that the divine being is like gold
                or silver or stone--an image made by human design
                and skill. In the past God overlooked such igno-
                rance, but now he commands all people everywhere
                to repent. For he has set a day when he will judge
                the world with justice by the man he has appointed.
                He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him
                from the dead."

                            When they heard about the resurrection of
                the dead, some of them sneered, but others said,
                "We want to hear you again on this subject." At that,
                Paul left the Council. Some of the people became
                followers of Paul and believed. Among them was
                Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, also a
                woman named Damaris, and a number of others.

                                                               Acts 17:22-33, NIV
            Paul's approach was to start his teaching from the vantage
point of the learner and stimulate their interest by informing them
that he could tell them the identity of the unknown god. He hooked
them, motivating them to listen. Then Paul shared the truth about
God and his desire for a personal relationship with them. He pro-
claimed the truth about Jesus Christ and his resurrection as the
way to enter into that relationship. After sharing the truth, Paul led
his audience to consider how this truth was meaningful for all per-
sons everywhere and that the entire world needed to repent. Finally,

190 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
    Paul focused on personal application. We know this because some
    wanted to hear him again, and others chose to believe and follow
    Christ.13

                The HBLT method includes these four key steps of moti­
    vation, examination, life application, and personal application. They
    are designed as four distinct parts of a session, each with a different
    purpose, but in reality, they should flow together in one seamless
    plan, and the learners shouldn't be aware when one part ends and
    another begins. However, before you begin writing each component
    of an HBLT plan, you must determine the overall purpose of the unit
    of study you are creating and identify the specific goals and indica-
    tors for each session. You can refer to your curriculum plan to select
    the topic or subtopics and the associated goals and indicators you
    identified. Create a template or outline for the entire unit, including
    the following elements:

      · Unit Subject and Title (identify the focal topic or subtopic from
          your curriculum plan)

      · Unit Goal
      · Age Group of Target Audience
      · Session Topic/Subtopic 1 and Title
      · Key Scripture Focus
      · Exegetical Idea (the big idea of the biblical passage)
      · Pedagogical Idea (the main concept or idea you want the stu-

          dents to learn; the takeaway for the session)
      · Learning Goal and Indicator
      · List of Needed Materials or Supplies for the Session
      · Preparation List (describe any special things the teacher will

          need to do ahead of time, such as a special room arrangement,
          queuing up a video clip, making photocopies, etc.)

Designing HBLT Learning Activities

Each part of the HBLT plan is designed for a specific purpose, but
none is limited to one single activity. While a small group discus-
sion-based approach to teaching relies on verbal learning tech-
niques, the HBLT approach to teaching and learning allows for many
different techniques and methods, making it an ideal way to connect
with students with a variety of learning styles. The hook is intro-
ductory and, in a typical one-hour session, should probably not take
longer than ten minutes to complete and transition to the book.
The book represents an exploration and study of the content, the
foundational biblical concepts and truths you want your students to
understand and value, so this portion of the lesson should be sig-
192 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
nificant in terms of time allowed. Twenty to twenty-five minutes is
a good consideration as you plan. Both the look and the took are
significant, but ten to fifteen minutes is often sufficient for each of
these if only an hour is dedicated for the entire session. Keep in
mind that this doesn't account for any additional activities a group
may engage in when they meet. If there are announcements, a sep-
arate time of worship, or refreshments or games included, this time
must be factored into the planning process. It is hard to imagine
how effective discipleship could take place if less than one full hour
of focused group study takes place on a weekly basis.

            The hook is designed to motivate students to learn and to
stimulate their curiosity by connecting the subject with their per-
sonal needs. When learners believe that a session is relevant to their
lives, they are more likely to want to participate and be involved.
This requires teachers to know their learners. The focus in chapter
3 of this book was on understanding the audience. This will be help-
ful as you are designing your lesson plans, but additional effort will
be required on the part of the teacher to develop personal relation-
ships with those in the group.

            A good hook sets the focus for the session and should
include a natural transition from that learning activity to the subject
or biblical content of the study. In designing the hook, refer to chap-
ter 5, which describes principles of learning for knowledge, under-
standing, and affective learning. These guidelines can help you think
about the types of learning experiences that will be most relevant
to your goal. Then refer to the various techniques and methods
described previously in this chapter to stimulate your thinking and
help you design a learning activity that will pique the interest of
your learners and motivate them to participate fully. An effective
hook could be a discussion about a current event related to the
study, a poignant question, an object lesson, a media clip, or even a
short game. The key is to make sure the activity hooks the learner
and isn't simply an irrelevant icebreaker. The hook is part of the les-
son and should lead toward learning and growth. Include a tran-

                                                           Bringing Curriculum to Life | 193
sitional statement at the close of the hook that connects this
motivational exercise to the overall purpose and focus of the ses-
sion.

            The book portion of a lesson plan is examination, focusing
on a deep study of the passage or biblical truths. This requires an
accurate understanding of the Scripture under consideration. To
accurately plan for the book, it is necessary to have done a prior in-
depth biblical study. Deductive studies begin with a topic and use
Scripture to illustrate or illuminate the topic so that it is dealt with
in a manner that is biblically accurate. Inductive studies focus pri-
marily on a study of Scripture and allow the topics or content to be
derived from the text. Discipleship sessions may take either form,
but regardless, a comprehensive study of the passage or passages is
necessary. A guide for completing an inductive study is included in
chapters 4 and 5 in Creative Bible Teaching by Richards and Bred-
feldt. Another excellent resource for preparing to teach is Effective
Bible Teaching by James C. Wilhoit and Leland Ryken.

            The key components of an inductive Bible study are obser­
vation, interpretation, generalization, application, and implementa­
tion. Observation includes an understanding of who authored a text,
when, and for what purpose. It examines the type of literature rep-
resented by the passage as well as the structure of the text. Inter­
pretation involves a careful study of the meaning and significance of
the passage. It takes into account the continuity of the message as
it relates to the totality of Scripture and considers both the context
and customary meaning of the passage. Generalization focuses on
the big idea of the passage, answering such questions as, What is the
author talking about, what is he saying about the subject, and what is
the key transferable idea of the passage to life today? The answers to
these questions form the exegetical idea for a lesson when summa-
rized into one concise statement of truth. Application in an induc-
tive study is a means of discovering biblical answers to common
problems. When studying a passage, it is important to answer the
following questions: Is there a teaching here to be learned and fol­
lowed? Does the passage contain a rebuke or a correction to be heard

194 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
    and obeyed? In what way does the passage train us to be righteous?
    Implementation is the final part of a study, when the learner is chal-
    lenged to appropriate personal meaning. This may include identi-
    fying the need for personal change, considering how best to make
    those changes, and asking God for the power to implement the
    changes the Holy Spirit has revealed to them through the study.14

                One common mistake that teachers make is to substitute
    an inductive study for a lesson plan. Often, teachers simply lecture
    over the background and meaning of a passage and fail to involve
    the learners in active learning or personal application of the text.
    While the inductive study includes elements of both examination
    and application, it is not intended as a substitute for a well-designed
    group lesson plan. Effective lesson plans rely on comprehensive
    biblical studies to formulate the content for the book portion of
    their resources. They are most effective, however, when students
    engage in active learning and are led to discover biblical significance
    instead of being told why Scripture matters.

                The look portion of a lesson is focused on helping learners
    understand how the biblical content relates to life today in their
    culture. It allows them to connect biblical teachings to daily life
    and understand their relevance in contemporary society. One of the
    most effective means of doing this is to incorporate case studies
    or current events. This may be done using a variety of techniques.
    Learners may be asked to analyze trending shows or the lyrics
    of popular music. They may use their biblical understanding to
    propose solutions for current cultural difficulties or evaluate the
    actions of celebrities or public policies according to what they have
    learned. Art, drama, or creative writing may be appropriate methods
    for discovering life applications.

                The final part of the HBLT method is the took. This is where
    personal spiritual transformation is prompted. Lasting change won't
    take place within one discipleship session, but the took asks stu-

14. Richards and Bredfeldt, Creative Bible Teaching, 68-78.

                                                                Bringing Curriculum to Life | 195
dents to begin considering where change is needed in their own
lives. It goes beyond an understanding of how the content is gener-
ally relevant or applicable. It prompts students to think about areas
where they are in need of personal growth. They should have a
clear understanding of how the study relates to their lives. It might
prompt them to think about changes, such as starting or stopping a
behavior. This could involve a personal inventory for them to com-
plete and reflect on their responses. It might ask them to write a let-
ter to someone and seek their forgiveness. Students might be asked
to create a personal plan for incorporating a particular spiritual dis-
cipline into their lives. Consider your learners as you design mean-
ingful ways for them to begin the process of appropriating what
they have learned through the session.

            One final consideration for your teaching plan involves
determining whether you have included an opportunity for the indi-
cator to be achieved. Remember that the indicator's purpose is to
determine whether the goal has been met. It is useless, however, to
determine the evidence needed to prove the achievement of a goal
if you never ask for that evidence within your study. At least one of
the learning activities should provide an opportunity for the learn-
ers to accomplish the indicator. This is often found within the look
or the took. It is known as a test because it is a means of testing the
accomplishment of the goal.

            The test activity should match the indicator in three key
ways. It should require the learner to use the same or a similar form
of response. If it is a verbal indicator, then the test activity should be
verbal. If it is discriminatory, then it should require discrimination.
The test activity should also relate to the same content. This is more
precise than expecting them to relate to the same subject. Content
is a more narrow, specific part of a broader subject. For example,
cooking is a subject, but grilling steaks and boiling potatoes are not
the same content. Both the indicator and test activity should focus
on the same content related to the subject. The final characteristic

196 | Bringing Curriculum to Life
of a test activity is that it should be at the same level of learning as
the indicator. For example, if the indicator calls for application, an
appropriate test item would not require the student to synthesize.

            Lesson plans should reflect a variety of methods and appeal
to all types of learners through at least one of the activities. Each
part of the lesson may include more than one learning activity, but
they should build on one another and be presented in a logical
order. You may want to number each activity to provide clarity for
whoever is going to be teaching. Care should be taken so the session
doesn't become a jumble of disparate activities, but every learner
should be able to leave a class with the sense that they have gained
something important and relevant for their lives. As you write your
plans, focus on balancing your techniques and approaches. Use pre-
cise, direct, active verbs that will help potential leaders visualize the
action you are calling for in your goal, indicator, or activity. Give
enough detail for the reader to know exactly how to do what you are
asking them to do. Make sure your learning activities and the meth-

plan, incorporating various techniques
and methods to accomplish your goal and
appeal to a variety of learners. Refer to the
learning principles from chapter 5 as you
design your activities. Don't forget to
include a test activity in your plan that
mirrors your indicator. Remember that
each portion of the plan may use more
than one activity, but the session should
have a flow. The learners should not feel

bounced from one activity to the next but
should experience a seamless time of
learning that is personally impactful.

              Successful companies aren't immune from making brand-
  ing mistakes that cost them customers and a loss in revenue. Coca-
  Cola changed its formula in 1985 to compete with Pepsi, a growing
  competitor. Customers rejected the new formula and thought Coca-
  Cola was abandoning its values and its heritage. The company
  immediately began receiving five thousand phone calls a day from
  furious customers, and eventually, the number of calls went up to
  eight thousand a day, causing Coca-Cola to hire more operators.
  Protest groups formed, such as the "Old Cola Drinkers of America."
  Coca-Cola eventually decided to return to the original formula.1

              Right or wrong, consumers have opinions, and their views
  impact the success or failure of businesses. For restaurant owners,
  it isn't always about the food. People choose restaurants based on
  ten key factors. The number-one factor is the customer experience.
  They could buy food at a grocery store, but when they go to a

   restaurant, they are most often paying for an experience. They want
   to have fun with their friends, spend time with family, and feel spe-
   cial and respected. They want to be able to ask questions with-
   out feeling like they're stupid or being a burden. If the servers are
   approachable and smile, customers are likely to return.2

               Cultural expectations can also determine whether a com-
   pany succeeds. Walmart was successful not only in the United
   States but also in China and other foreign countries. That reality
   prompted its expansion to Germany. However, it eventually had to
   pay a competitor to take over its real estate and employee liabili-
   ties so it could leave Germany before losing any more money. Why
   did this happen? While there isn't one simple answer, a lot of it
   had to do with Walmart's failure to understand German culture.
   Having greeters at the door bothered Germans, who aren't fans
   of very friendly customer service. Employees smiling at customers
   was strange, and some of the male customers thought the friendly
   female employees were flirting with them. Walmart team members
   do morning chants to motivate them for the day, but German
   employees would sometimes hide out in the bathroom to avoid this
   ritual. For Germans, chanting is something you do at a soccer game,
   not at your place of business. Having the cashiers bag their gro-
   ceries was also a cultural no-no since Germans customarily bag
   their own.3

               Judgment and evaluation are part of life, even if the stan-
   dards are sometimes hard to decipher or may seem unfair. For
   Olympic athletes, there are strict rules that determine whether

   they are eligible to compete or retain a medal. Drug violations are
   an automatic disqualifier. Chinese swimmer Sun Yang was banned
   for three months in 2014 after testing positive for the stimulant
   trimetazidine. In 2018, Yang, a three-time Olympic champion,
   wouldn't allow the antidoping officials to leave his home with his
   blood sample. One of his companions smashed the vial with a ham-
   mer so it couldn't be tested. Yang was then banned from competing
   in the Tokyo Olympics. The Russian bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva
   was disqualified from the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics after also
   testing positive for trimetazidine. She was given the banned drug
   by her mother, a doctor. One of the most infamous Olympic drug
   scandals was when Ben Johnson, a Canadian sprinter, won the hun-
   dred-meter dash in record time at the Seoul Olympics. After testing
   positive for an anabolic steroid, his gold medal was taken away and
   given to the American sprinter Carl Lewis.4

               Standards of evaluation are necessary in many life situa-
   tions for a number of reasons. They can ensure fairness in business
   practices or athletic competitions. They can protect public health
   when they take the form of inspections for disease or when med-
   icines are evaluated for safety and effectiveness. They are used in
   determining whether a student has sufficiently accomplished what
   is required for a promotion or a degree. This is especially signif-
   icant for medical personnel and other professions whose actions
   can result in life and death for others. Evaluation, as it relates to
   curriculum, doesn't seem to rise to the level of life and death, at
   least not physically. However, when you consider the purpose of
   curriculum for spiritual transformation, the importance of evalua-
   tion should take on greater significance. That's not to suggest that a
   poorly designed plan or hastily chosen resource will keep someone

from knowing Christ or growing in spiritual maturity. God's sover-
eignty is greater than that. However, it is possible that dull and inef-
fective lessons or inaccurate teaching can turn people away from
the Church or quench their desire for growth.

            Faith maturity is the work of the Holy Spirit in the life of an
individual; God initiates this faith relationship:

                No one can come to me unless the Father who sent
                me draws them, and I will raise them up at the last
                day.

                                                                     John 6:44, NIV
            God also invites us into the process. Our partnership with
God in the discipleship project is significant. God didn't just give us
busywork to make us feel useful. Spiritual growth is dependent on
the work of the Holy Spirit, but we have a role to play in the spiritual
development of others:

                What, after all, is Apollos? And what is Paul? Only
                servants, through whom you came to believe--as
                the Lord has assigned to each his task. I planted the
                seed, Apollos watered it, but God has been making
                it grow. So neither the one who plants nor the one
                who waters is anything, but only God, who makes
                things grow. The one who plants and the one who
                waters have one purpose, and they will each be
                rewarded according to their own labor. For we are
                co-workers in God's service; you are God's field,
                God's building.

                                                       1 Corinthians 3:5-9, NIV

Selecting and Evaluating Resources

As described in chapter 7, bringing a curriculum plan to life involves
planning learning experiences and selecting resources to accom-
plish the goals that were established for the scope. Sometimes, the

204 | Evaluation
resources are created, but much of the time, they will be selected
from those that have already been published. Choosing the right
resources will impact whether the intended goals are achieved and
ultimately determine whether the overall purpose or mission of
the plan is realized. All too often, ministry leaders select curricular
resources without carefully evaluating their effectiveness. They may
opt for those that are the least expensive, have the most visual
appeal, or have been recommended on a blog or by a friend. While
this doesn't necessarily diminish the value of the resource, it also
doesn't guarantee their appropriateness. Any resource considered
for use should be evaluated for both its orthodoxy and its ortho-
praxy.

            Orthodoxy refers to sound or correct doctrine. As it relates
to Christianity, orthodox teaching should align with biblical teach-
ing. Chapter 2 included the Nicene Creed, which is an overview
of the central tenets of Christian belief. Most Christian publishers
include an explanation of their doctrinal beliefs on their website, or
they identify an affiliation with a particular denomination. Denom-
inations clearly identify with particular doctrines, and an internet
search of an authorized denominational site will describe those
beliefs. While most Christian denominations would affirm the
teaching of the Nicene Creed, it cannot be assumed. Some groups
have drifted from biblical teaching to embrace cultural changes that
have not traditionally been accepted.

            One of the most important doctrinal considerations is
related to salvation. What does it mean to be a Christian? Can one
grow up in a Christian home and identify as a Christian, or is a per­
sonal commitment and decision to follow Christ necessary? There
may be additional doctrines or beliefs valued by your ministry that
you want to evaluate. They may be central in your ministry but of
lesser importance to some publishers. Sometimes core beliefs are
shared, but the interpretation may vary. This is true for Church
ordinances such as baptism or communion. When selecting

                                                                                   Evaluation | 205
resources for use within a ministry, it is important that their views
on such key issues align with acceptable teachings within your
church or ministry.

            While orthodoxy refers to right belief, orthopraxy refers to
right practice. It encompasses the idea of both ethical and liturgi-
cal practice. How Christians are expected to live in accordance with
their faith and how the Church is expected to function are examples
of orthopraxy. Denominations and individual churches hold stan-
dards related to orthopraxy. Some of these are represented by their
core values, but not everything will be addressed in such a short
list. Orthopraxy has undergone more changes throughout the last
several decades than orthodoxy, so it is important to understand a
publisher's view on orthodox practice. If issues of ethical and litur-
gical conduct matter, then it is imperative to make sure that the
resources you select align with those standards. A review of cur-
riculum materials by a particular publisher related to key areas of
concern will provide clarity on their views.

            It might seem daunting to evaluate the orthodoxy and
views on orthopraxy of any particular resource you're considering,
but following some guidelines will help you make wise decisions. If
the publisher doesn't clearly state its position, then create a check-
list of foundational truths and practices and use the list as you eval-
uate a resource. You may also use existing resources that have been
developed for evaluating the curriculum.

            Correct belief and practice are central to the evaluation
process, but there are other considerations that should be included
in the process. For example:

  · Are the materials available online for download, or are they
      only in print?

  · Are there resources for students or only for the teacher?
  · If there are resources for individual learners, are they visually

      appealing? Is the layout clear and easy to follow?
  · What is the intended target audience for the resource, new

      Christians or mature believers? (Published resources often

206 | Evaluation
      state the intended target audience if applicable.)
  · Are the examples and illustrations inclusive, or are they

      focused on one ethnicity or people group? (This is more signif-
      icant when artwork is included, but even names can reflect a
      bias. While often unintentional, if learners receive the impres-
      sion that the resources are focused on a people group to which
      they don't belong, they are less likely to see the relevance.)
  · What is the reading level or educational expectations for the
      learner? (Your ethnographic or cultural study of your ministry
      will help you determine if the resource will be too difficult or
      underchallenging.)
  · How clear are the guidelines for the teacher? How much
      preparation time is needed? (While you want to look for
      enough details and depth in the plan, you also need to consider
      how much time your volunteer leaders will have to prepare
      during the week.)
  · Is there a good representation of learning techniques, or is the
      approach mostly focused on lectures or other verbal methods?
  · What would it cost to purchase these resources for use within
      your ministry? (Some downloadable resources include pricing
      based on the size of the group. Others allow multiple down-
      loads. Some resources have both digital and print options.)

            Terry Linhart's book Teaching the Next Generations
includes a basic but helpful checklist in chapter 12 that includes
additional evaluative questions. You can also find more extensive
evaluation guides online.

         · Refer to the list of possible guidelines for evaluating
             curriculum resources. Are there other considerations
             you might add to this list?

         · Select a curriculum resource currently used in your
             church or ministry. Using the evaluating list provided,
             review the resource to determine whether it meets
             your ministry's standards. Is it something that should
             continue to be used, or would you recommend elimi-
             nating it and finding an alternative learning resource?

Evaluating Resources You Created

Chapter 7 provided guidelines for creating units of study and indi-
vidual lesson plans. Evaluation of this created work is also impor-
tant, even if you're confident that the guidelines were carefully
followed when the units of study were created. As you review your
plans, ask yourself the following questions:

  · Is the goal clearly stated?
  · Is the indicator appropriate? Is it focused on the same primary

      learning outcome (PLO) as the goal? Does it reflect an observ-
      able behavior that would prove the accomplishment of the
      goal? Does it state how well and under what conditions the
      indicator should be achieved?
  · Will the hook motivate the learners? Is it appropriate in length
      and subject matter as a means of stimulating learning and
      introducing the content?
  · Is there an introductory transition between the hook and the
      book?
  · Is the book of sufficient substance and quality to allow for sig-

208 | Evaluation
      nificant learning opportunities?
  · Does the look focus on life application, creating a bridge from

      the biblical content to contemporary life?
  · Does the took require learners to consider how the session's

      content connects to their own lives?
  · Is one of the activities a test of the indicator, and does it reflect

      the same level of learning, type of indicator, and content as the
      indicator?
  · Which of the appropriate learning principles have been fol-
      lowed when creating the learning activities?
  · What learning preferences are represented by the activities?
  · Do the learning activities reflect a variety of techniques or
      methods?
  · Are the learning activities age-appropriate? Will they foster
      genuine learning? Do they help learners go beyond compre-
      hension and application in their understanding? Do they set
      the groundwork for organization or characterization if they are
      focused on affective outcomes?
  · Is there a natural flow to the session from the hook through
      the took?
  · Is the session closing an appropriate way to end the lesson?

            After the plans have been used in an actual discipleship
session, they should be reviewed again to assess how well they
accomplished their purpose. Using the same checklist, make note of
areas that could benefit from a revision. Make those changes and
review the revised plan when it is used in the future. Creating les-
son plans and evaluating their effectiveness will not only benefit
the learners, but it will also provide the ministry with curriculum
resources that can be reused or confidently shared with other min-
istries.

Reflection Exercise

                     Evaluation | 209
         · Review the teaching plan you created for chapter 7.
         · Use the questions provided in the previous section

             to evaluate your plan. Make any changes necessary.

Evaluating Your Curriculum Plan

A curriculum plan is a blueprint for a discipleship ministry. Each
part of the plan serves a unique purpose in the design of a compre-
hensive racecourse for spiritual transformation. Review each part
of your plan to make sure it is constructed appropriately, that it is
comprehensive, and that it is current.

Construction

Review each of the following required elements for a curriculum
plan. Are they clearly stated? Are they accurate? Do they represent the
overall purpose of your ministry?

            Mission: Does it reflect the biblical purposes for ministry?
Is it written succinctly?

            Vision: Does your vision describe what you're trying to
achieve in your ministry? Will the vision inspire others to see the
overall purpose of the ministry and why it is important? Does it add
clarity and significance to your mission?

            Core Values: Do each of the values represent the most sig-
nificant biblical truths that shape your ministry? Are they clearly
articulated? Is each one supported by a biblical foundation?

            Curriculum Context / Target Audience: Does your plan
include an ethnographic description of the community you are try-

210 | Evaluation
ing to reach? Are both demographics and psychographics included?
Is the information clearly interpreted in ways that suggest ministry
implications that should be considered? Have you provided a clear
and concise description of the developmental characteristics of the
target population for your ministry? Does the description include
holistic information about the age group, considering all aspects of
development and how these should inform the practice of ministry?

            Organizing Principle: Is this written in one or two sen-
tences, and does it describe the strategy you will use to organize the
various areas of your scope?

            Scope: Is your scope both comprehensive and clearly
defined with themes, relevant topics, and associated subtopics?
Have you omitted important truths? Have you allowed for the most
significant biblical concepts to be addressed from various perspec-
tives on multiple themes or topics?

            Goals and Indicators: Are each of your subtopics clarified
with both cognitive and affective goals? Are the goals realistic and
written in proper form? Are they achievable and significant? Will the
stated indicators provide demonstrable proof that the goals have
been achieved?

Comprehensive

Take time to review your curriculum plan again. The first evaluation
was a check to make sure each element was included and that it
was written clearly. For your second evaluation, focus on the scope.
Review each of the themes and associated topics and subtopics. As
you consider what it means to be a disciple and experience spiritual
growth, evaluate whether your plan is designed to lead toward that
end. What is the likelihood that the mission of your curricular jour-
ney will actually be accomplished if your plan is fully implemented?
Look for gaps that may exist in terms of both cognitive and affec-
tive outcomes. While spiritual growth is a lifelong endeavor, a well-

                                                                                    Evaluation | 211
constructed plan should facilitate the discipleship journey. Change
should be evident in the lives of believers who follow the racecourse
you have designed.

Current

Once a curriculum plan has been developed and thoroughly eval-
uated, it should not require any regular changes. If it is designed
for one particular age group or developmental phase, it should be
implemented and not require further evaluation until the cycle is
complete. As the sequence of learning progresses, it will be impor-
tant to assess whether the intended growth is taking place in the
lives of the learners. If you notice deficiencies, it may be necessary
to modify the scope of your plan to strengthen what is taught.
As culture continues to change, there may be additional topics or
subtopics you wish to include. Perhaps your resources need to be
updated to reflect the shifts taking place in your community. Case
studies, illustrations, or even methods should be revised to allow for
greater relevance in the lives of the learners. Always remember the
purpose of your plan, which is to help disciples grow toward greater
Christlikeness:

                Then we will no longer be infants, tossed back and
                forth by the waves, and blown here and there by
                every wind of teaching and by the cunning and
                craftiness of people in their deceitful scheming.
                Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to
                become in every respect the mature body of him
                who is the head, that is, Christ.

                                                         Ephesians 4:14-15, NIV
                No prolonged infancies among us, please. We'll not
                tolerate babes in the woods, small children who are
                easy prey for predators. God wants us to grow up, to
                know the whole truth and tell it in love--like Christ

212 | Evaluation
           in everything. We take our lead from Christ, who
           is the source of everything we do. He keeps us in
           step with each other. His very breath and blood flow
           through us, nourishing us so that we will grow up
           healthy in God, robust in love.
