LAND ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

Land acknowledgements are one small part of disrupting and dismantling colonial structures. As a settler of
colonial ancestry-like many other settlers I have benefited greatly from living and working on Turtle Island.
As a visitor on the land, I have an important responsibility to acknowledge my privilege to gather and work in
higher education.

   I would like to reaffirm my obligation to acknowledge the unceded and ancestral land of all the Métis, Inuit
and First Nation people that call this land home. This book was written at Fanshawe College on Treaty 6 the
home of the Anishnaabe, Haudenoshaunee , and Lenape people of Southwestern Ontario.

   We celebrate the continuous living cultures of the original inhabitants of Canada who care for this land,
and may we remember with humility, kindness, and respect this rich history as we walk softly on these lands
acknowledging the important contributions of the Métis, Inuit and First Nation people.

Why an Open Resource on Reflective Practice?

Reflective practice is a term strongly associated with lifelong learning in professional contexts such as teaching
and early childhood education, and it can be thought of in several ways. Defining reflective practice can be a
challenge. This resource will provide a context that will allow the reader to consider their obligation to reflect
from their own perspective and will explore how to create a practice that best suits their professional setting.
This book will bring together in one place the history, values, skills, and disposition required to be a reflective
practitioner. It is a textbook with elements of a workbook embedded with opportunities to watch, think, write,
and listen, allowing the reader to become a purposeful and intentional reflective practitioner.

1.2 REFLECTIVE PRACTICE

    Reflective practice is "a dialogue of thinking and doing through
            which I become more skillful" - Donald Schön (1983)

   How often do you find yourself replaying the events of the day? Whether it is going through a conversation
that happened with a colleague or thinking about how certain events led you to make a decision (Third, 2015).
How are you feeling about your decisions? Often this process of reflection happens without us even knowing.

   Reflection can be described as a learning tool, something that is going to help you to synthesize, explain,
and make sense of something, while developing meaning from your experiences. It can be considered to be a
professional competence, a skill but more likely a disposition. It is through examining our heart, our values and
our thinking we can examine and rethink our pedagogical practice.

   Reflective practice is not something that comes to us as a natural skill, and is not inherently comfortable
for most of us. This resource is meant for the reader to uncover their own perspective on reflective practice to
determine their own level of skill or disposition and to try out activities that will support an intentional way
                                                                                                                             1.2 REFLECTIVE PRACTICE | 5

of being. The reader will be encouraged to question, to act on one's curiosity, to be a researcher and to ask the
questions like, "why am I doing what I am doing?"

   Reflective practice focuses on one's thoughts about their experiences, why things happened the way they
did and how we can improve on these experiences. This resource will guide you through the basics of what
reflective practice is, its benefits, how to integrate it into your everyday life and explore reflective tools such as
writing, blogging, and creating a circle of professional support.

   As the profession of early years education itself is experiencing transformation, educators too are looking
to redefine and transform their practice. This resource will examine reflective practice through the lens of
educators while investigating the theory of reflection and how reflective tools can support a practice from a
psychological, social, spiritual and educational context.

   Finally, the research suggests there is evidence that writing can influence the ability of educators to elevate
their reflective practice skills in their daily work with children, families and colleagues. Reflective writing
prompts throughout this resource will allow the reader to examine and hold their thinking in place in order
to have dialogue and reflect on their practice. As educators begin their journey through the reflective process,
writing can act as a catalyst to embrace new skills and pedagogical practices (Third, 2015).

 "Reflective practice is the ability to reflect on one's actions so as to
      engage in a process of continuous learning" - Donald Schön

Why Reflective Practice?

We all undertake activities to think about our experiences, learn from them and develop a plan for what we will
do or continue to do. Can you think of a time when you came home at the end of a week where everything
had gone wrong? Or maybe when everything had gone well? What are your next steps? Are you able to answer
the question "why am I doing what I am doing?" In order to continue to develop a reflective practice within
our workplace with colleagues, children and families we need to examine and understand the reasons for
                                                                                                             2.2 WHAT IS REFLECTIVE PRACTICE? | 11

our reactions, our feelings and our interactions with others, which in turn leads us to becoming a reflective
practitioner.

   Reflective practice is something which has developed across many disciplines such as teaching, to learn from
our experiences. There was a time when reflective practice would have been considered an optional skill or a
desired disposition but over the past few years, reflective practice is no longer considered an optional skill but a
required disposition.

   Reflective Practice has been defined by many including Bolton (2014), Moon (2001), Rodgers (2002) and
Schön (1983). Reflective Practice is a systematic rigorous self-directed meaning-making process where a person
moves from one experience to another through the development of insights and practice with the intention of
coming to a deeper understanding of one`s personal values and intellectual growth. Schön (1983) suggests that,
in practice, reflection often begins when a routine response produces a surprise or an unexpected outcome.
The surprise gets our attention, which may begin a process of reflection. Reflective practice is "a dialogue of
thinking and doing through which one becomes more skillful" (Schön, 1983, p. 56).

     Reflective Practice according to the College of Early Childhood
     Educators of Ontario

       An approach used by educators to analyze and think critically about their professional practice
       with the intention to better understand and improve their practice. Reflective practice is
       thoughtful, action-oriented and often, a collaborative effort. Educators use reflective practice to
       plan, evaluate their strengths and challenges, make decisions and create change, if necessary.
       Self-reflection, critical reflection and collaborative inquiry are all important elements of reflective
       practice (College of ECE, 2017).

Although a definition of reflective practice has been included this is only one part of the reflective process.
Reflection is a very personal skill or disposition and different people will define it in different ways. It is
important to remember that there is no one `correct' way of defining what reflection is or how it should
be done as a lot of this will depend on your own personal circumstances and work environment. For this
reason this resource will explore elements of reflective practice that will help the practitioner develop their own
practice. In describing reflective practice, I have interchangeably referred to it as a skill and/or a disposition.
This is related to the current literature and discourse that suggests reflection is not a natural skill but rather a
way of being or disposition. It involves an evaluation of our ethics, values and feelings around experiences. We
will explore this idea later in Chapter 6.

    "We do not learn from experience. We learn from reflecting on
                          experience." - John Dewey (1933)

   The fundamental theories and models of reflection and reflective practice were born initially from the work
of Dewey and Schön. A century ago, John Dewey emphasized the importance of involving the learner in
reflection. He believed that our experiences shape us, and when reflective practice is part of learning, meaning
and relevancy is created, which initiates growth and change (Dewey, 1933).

Schön (1983) based his work on that of Dewey and is most widely known for his theory of reflecting in and
reflecting on one's practice. His theory was grounded in reflection from a professional knowledge and
learning perspective (Bolton, 2014.p.6). In simple terms this is described as reflecting as the experience is
occurring or reflecting on the experience after it has occurred. Reflecting in action refers to situations such as:
thinking on your feet, acting straight away, and thinking about what to do next. Reflecting on action means
you are thinking about what you would do differently next time, taking time to process (Bolton, 2014.p.6).

3.4 KOLB'S EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING
CYCLE

    "Kolb's Experiential Learning CYCLE" by Giulia Forsythe is licensed under CC0 1.0

Kolb's model (1984) is based on theories about how people learn, this model centres on the concept of
developing understanding through actual experiences and contains four key stages:

 1. Concrete experience
 2. Reflective observation
 3. Abstract conceptualization
 4. Active experimentation
The model argues that we start with an experience - either a repeat of something that has happened before or
something completely new to us. The next stage involves us reflecting on the experience and noting anything
24 | 3.4 KOLB'S EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING CYCLE

about it which we haven't come across before. We then start to develop new ideas as a result, for example
when something unexpected has happened we try to work out why this might be. The final stage involves us
applying our new ideas to different situations. This demonstrates learning as a direct result of our experiences
and reflections. This model is similar to one used by small children when learning basic concepts such as hot
and cold. They may touch something hot, be burned and be more cautious about touching something which
could potentially hurt them in the future.

This model builds on the others and adds more stages. It is one of the more complex models of reflection but it
may be that you find having multiple stages of the process to guide you reassuring. Gibb's cycle (1998) contains
six stages:

 1. Experience
 2. Feelings
 3. Evaluation
 4. Analysis
 5. Conclusion
 6. Action plan
As with other models, Gibb's begins with an outline of the experience being reflected on. It then encourages
us to focus on our feelings about the experience, both during it and after. The next step involves evaluating the
experience - what was good or bad about it from our point of view? We can then use this evaluation to analyze
the situation and try to make sense of it. This analysis will result in a conclusion about what other actions (if
26 | 3.5 GIBB'S REFLECTIVE CYCLE

any) we could have taken to reach a different outcome. The final stage involves building an action plan of steps
which we can take the next time we find ourselves in a similar situation.

A cautionary tale

These are a few of the theories and models that give some context to the process of Reflection. None is meant
to be followed exclusively. We will delve deeper into more models in Chapter 8. Since reflective practice requires
a combination of skill and disposition, and often creates a sense of discomfort, understanding the theoretical
background gives credence to the process.

     "The reflective practitioner allows him/herself to experience
   surprise, puzzlement, or confusion in a situation which they find
 uncertain or unique. They reflect on the phenomenon before them,
and on the prior understandings They carry out an experiment which
  serves to generate both a new understanding of the phenomenon

            and a change in the situation." Donald Schön (1983)

   There are many benefits to becoming a reflective practitioner but it is not always realistic to think that it
will be an easy process. Depending on your circumstances, there may be many challenges to reflection whether
these are related to personal situation or work life. With a little thought and planning, most of these challenges
can be addressed. This chapter will allow you to determine your current reflective stance and what challenges
you may be facing.

Are you naturally reflective?

Most of us do reflect more often than we think. The key here is to make reflection an
intentional practice with a purpose to improve your practice and often to determine why you
are doing what you are doing.

4.3 BECOMING A REFLECTIVE
PRACTITIONER

                                            Let's look at some of the reasons reflective practice

                                            may be challenging. In exploring challenges you will

                                            be able to consider possible solutions to becoming

                                            more reflective.

                                            For most of us, the # 1 challenge is finding the

                                            TIME or right time.

                                            Whether you are studying, working or both it can

                                            be hard to find time to complete your existing to-do

                                            list so why add on more things? Doing intentional

                                            reflection takes time and as Ellen Rose (2013) suggests

                                            it is a form of deep thought, an opportunity to slow

                                            down that allows for original thought, perspective and

                                            insights to emerge. Anyone in education knows time is

                                            always at a premium. Having said that, we are often

                                            unconsciously evaluating things and so the goal here is

                                            to be more intentional in analyzing your pedagogical

                                            practice which requires the time to do so.

                                            What if the organizational culture and

                                            environment doesn't support reflection?

                                            Not everyone works in an environment which is

                                            open to the idea of being reflective - since it can be

                                            difficult to cultivate. If those in charge don't see

Unsplash License.                           to really cultivate a practice. If you believe reflection is

                                            a mindset, it may require a specific place, or time to

initially reflect and it may take some trial and error to find that perfect fit for you. Rose (2013) also points out

the decline in reflection may be due to the way we are consuming information. We consume small chunks or

nuggets of information on social media and we move from one topic to another with little time to digest the

information let alone reflect on what we're reading, hearing or thinking.

Finally, do I have the skills, motivation and disposition needed?

For many people who are unfamiliar with reflection it can seem a bit challenging, especially if they are
                                                                                                4.3 BECOMING A REFLECTIVE PRACTITIONER | 37

looking for a recipe, a specific approach or checklist to follow. As described earlier, a lack of time and support
can influence your ability to reflect. At this point we can examine whether reflection is a skill or disposition.
Being reflective does take a certain level of insight which can for some be uncomfortable, especially if you are
new to reflection. Seeing reflection as a disposition does not eliminate the possibility of you needing a certain
level of practice to develop into a reflective practitioner, but knowing what it takes is helpful. What is needed
is time to slow down, to be curious, motivation to improve, and the desire to know why you do what you do
are some essential mind-sets if you hope to overcome any of the challenges and wish to lean into becoming a
reflective practitioner.

    When you are writing you are constructing your own voice and
putting on the paper your own thoughts, so you can shape it, delete

   it, or add to it ..to come up with something. Ellen Rose (2013, p.63)

   From their book Writing the Mind Alive Linda Trichter Metcalf and Tobin Simon (2002) outline the
process of writing that involves listening to what one hears, a place to honour your own voice through daily
writing. (p.18) The process listed below is an adaptation of their work with the intention to write for reflection
by seeking others' perspectives, being open to your own feelings, values and seeing things through multiple
lenses. In these writings it is important to JUST write, don't worry about sentence structure, spelling or
content. You are trying to get your thinking on the page. Sometimes this looks like a to do list, that's OK. It's
the beginning of creating intentional practice.

  "It's on the strength of observation and reflection that one finds a
      way, so we must dig and delve unceasingly." Charles Monet

important is the necessity to make space and time to think deeply about our why?" Roffey-Barentson &
Malthouse (2009, p. 16) introduces ten useful `benefits of reflective practice' which address the nature of
disposition and reflective practice, as well as the personal and professional benefits of reflection. These ten
benefits highlight the need to integrate our thinking and incorporate our values and beliefs. By recognizing
this, we may be more inclined to establish a day-to-day practice of reflection.

 1. Improving our own practice; if one takes time to reflect on the different parts of their work, it is
      bound to lead to improvement.
                                                                                            6.2 REFLECTIVE PRACTICE IN THE WORKPLACE | 53

 2. Learning from reflective practice; there is good evidence that purposeful reflection helps `deep'
     learning take place, and this helps make connections between different aspects of your work.

 3. Enhances problem solving skills; by carefully and honestly considering problems, and multiple
     perspective solutions can be found.

 4. Becoming a critical thinker; Critical thinking is about `thinking well' and reflective practice allows
     one to adjust what they think to take account of changes in circumstances. Are our assumptions correct?

 5. Making Decisions; as you reflect on your practice, you will find you need to make decisions about what
     to do (or not to do) next.

 6. Improving your own organizational skills; If one is thinking carefully about what they are doing,
     identifying possible actions and choices, trying out solutions, and adjusting what to do involves a great
     deal of organization.

 7. Managing personal change; if you are using the techniques of reflective practice, which involves, calm,
     thoughtful, honest, critical and organized thinking and action, this should introduce a calming and less
     emotional response to that change.

 8. Acknowledging personal values; there will be things which take place within a professional situation
     as an educator which will bump up one's own personal values such as what you believe in, and what you
     think is wrong or right.

 9. Taking your own advice; workers are often more critical of their own work than anyone else.

10. Recognizing emancipatory benefits; if as a worker one reflects on the nine benefits of reflective
     practice which have so far been described; this is a model of practice which represents the educator as
     someone with influence over their own practice This is what is at the heart of reflective practice
     (Third,2015).

As you move through this resource one of the goals for the reader is to have a clear motivation for being
reflective. It is a deliberate, intentional way of being. The more the educator can remove or detach themselves
from their thoughts and feelings, the more objective and curious you can become. A quote whose author is
unknown speaks to this intention of reflection, "between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space
is our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our freedom" (It is essential to find
the space and time for deep thinking and reflection.

   "I write because I don't know what I think until I read what I say."-
                                    Flannery O'Connor

   In On Reflection, an essay on technology, education, and the status of thought in the twenty-first century
by Ellen Rose (2013), she challenges us to reflect on reflection as she asks us to consider reflection in the context
of time, and silence and not in a context of a forced practice.

   As many know we bump up against the ideology of becoming unbusy, of providing space and time to
ponder, think, reflect. In our fast-paced technology-rich world and coming off the global pandemic of 2019 we
have been tasked to consider the many priorities we have set for ourselves. What are ways we can simplify or
prioritize what is really important to our work

   As we consider our reflective practice, many obstacles may still come up, "there is only so much time in a
                                                                          7.2 BEING REFLECTIVE BEGINS WITH REFLECTIVE THINKING | 63

day", "I have to do this or that", "I must follow this curriculum or that", "I only have so much time to teach
this."

   Rose (2013) more than once used the term stewardship in referring to reclaiming reflective practice.
She suggests we must be stewards of the use of writing, of technology and of reflective practice. According
to Merriam-Webster (n.d.) stewardship is "the conducting, supervising, or managing of something;
especially the careful and responsible management of something entrusted to one's care. The act or
activity of looking after and making decisions about something."

   When you take the time to seemingly do nothing, notice what you are thinking about, try to go with those
thoughts and see where they take you. There are multiple ways to be reflective both individually or in groups.
(More on group thinking in future chapters.)

   Self reflection is typically where one's reflective practice begins. This can resemble things you are already
doing: writing which may include blogs, papers, journaling, creating a professional portfolio, walking, thinking
through meditation, yoga and storytelling. What are the ways you are currently practicing slowing down?

"Unless teachers develop the practice of critical reflection, they stay
trapped in unexamined judgments, interpretations, assumptions, and

   expectations. Approaching education as a reflective practitioner
     involves fusing personal beliefs and values into a professional
              identity" (Larrivee, 2000, p.293 in Finlay, L, 2008).

   Disposition can mean many things to different people but according to Merriam-Webster (n.d.) disposition
is defined as a "person's inherent qualities of mind and character, prevailing tendency, mood, or inclination,
temperament or makeup."

   So why is it essential to examine disposition as related to a reflective mindset? There is much debate about
whether reflective practice is a technical skill that can be taught, or a way of being an attitude or a personal
quality that can be cultivated.

   There is evidence that supports creating a culture of reflection, a disposition of thinking critically, and of
valuing multiple perspectives as a context of one's own reflective pedagogy. Farrell (2014) Rose (2013) and
others suggest there are main characteristics of a reflective educator some of which include open-mindedness,
whole-heartedness, and responsibility. Dewey (1933, 1986) has noted that all three of these attitudes are not
only important in "order that the intention of thinking in a reflective way...they are traits of personal character
that have to be cultivated" (p.139). Rose (2013) speaks to responsibility as stewardship stating we must be
stewards of the use of writing, of technology and of reflective practice. Reflection can be cultivated by a teacher
for whom reflection is an ethical commitment (pg.105).

   "Children do not experience our intentions, no matter how heartfelt.
    They experience what we manifest in tone and behaviour." Gordon

Rachel Carson wrote the book A Sense of Wonder originally in 1956 and republished it in 1998 and 2017. In
this book Carson talks about the hope to inspire both children and adults to appreciate and hence value the
spiritual, emotional and sensory experience of the living world. Dr. Hopi Marten shares Ojibwe worldviews
in context to teaching. He explores spiritual, cultural, and land-based learning as a teacher through what has
been coined a seasonal pedagogy. Both these examples demonstrate the power disposition, culture, values,
and beliefs have on our work. This is not a one-time conversation but a contextual concept around reflective
practice that can be embedded in every interaction we have within our workplace.

   Take some time to explore Dr. Hopi Marten's website The Edge of the Bush. Watch the videos, listen to the
teachings, and feel mother earth all around you. What touches your heart?

     Jean Lave, Etienne Wenger and communities of practice by infed.org:

After watching and reading the above content, it is important to have a shared understanding of what we
mean when we refer to a community of practice. The College of Early Childhood Educators references the
communities of practice definition by Wenger et al. (2002) as "a group of professionals who share a common
concern or passion about a practice topic and who wish to learn how to improve this area of practice by
communicating and collaborating with each other regularly over time." (2018, p. 2). Wenger (1999) states
there are three main elements that make a community of practice different from other groups: the domain
is the connection between the group and there is some commitment to a shared competence that makes it
different than a club or group of friends. This community is the second element. This means the group
is engaging in a relationship to help learn from one another and finally the third element is the practice.
84 | 9.2 WHAT IS A COMMUNITY OF PRACTICE

This is the practitioner looking to share their experience around a sustained problem or seeking solutions.
Communities of practice often are more formalized but not necessarily formal. They provide a time and space
and a protocol for coming together. A community of practice can have members who come in and out of the
group but usually a core group exists to help move the interests of the group forward through solutions and
practice.

BEING REFLECTIVE

Boud (2001) reinforces the benefit of reflection in a social context for educators: These reflective processes
can be undertaken in isolation from others, but doing so often leads to a reinforcement of existing views and
perceptions. Working in pairs or with a group for which learning is reason for being can begin to transform
perspectives and challenge old patterns of learning. It is only through a give and take with others and by
confronting the challenges they pose that critical reflection can be promoted.

   As educators embark on the practice of reflection the elements that Taylor (2007) describes supports the
process of reflection and creates concreteness to what for some might feel quite abstract. The notion of
reflecting individually, with a critical friend or mentor is noted as the educator moves through the stage of
conscious competence. Rather than becoming complacent or habitual, Taylor (2007) suggests moving into
reflective consciousness which he describes as mature practice. Skattebol (2010), suggests "engagement in
this type of reflection propels educators to examine the dimensions of the teaching or learning that popular
discourse regards as interior, and how non-conscious (often collective) habits operate in tandem with our
conscious and cognitively driven interactions" (p.89).

This context of reflection takes our thinking from a habit to an intention or reflective consciousness and this is
the essence of reflective practice.
