   Podcasting is becoming increasingly popular in Af-
rica and Asia as in the rest of the world (Wikipedia,
2008). Podcasts, collections of digital media distributed
over the Internet, often employ syndication feeds, for
playback on portable media players, e.g., iPod, MP3
player, and PCs. Several thousand podcast episodes can
be stored in iTunes stores and retrieved at will, enabling
us to use them in teaching, learning, demonstration, etc.
Requirement of podcasting equipment, mechanism of
podcasting, and practical examples are available at vari-
ous websites, e.g., Podcasting Tools (2008).

The evolution of the socio-cultural shift in education
created a turn in the design of instructional systems and
learning management systems. Fenrich (2005) identified

Basic colour theory

Colour theory focuses on how colour manifests on the
spectrum. Colour psychology goes one step further to
assign common meaning or moods to specific colours.
To apply these to the course design, the team should
explore the meaning of primary, secondary and tertiary
colours which are the most common colours used on the
World Wide Web. Figure 13.9 illustrates the 12 basic
colours of the colour wheel.

   Analogous colours are any three colours which are
side by side on a 12-part colour wheel. Complementary
colours are any two colours which are directly opposite
each other, such as red and green.

   Of course there are also black and white, both very
common colours used in course designs.

   You can identify those who
have signed into a WebCT quiz
through the Submissions page. To
open the submissions page, go to
the Quizzes/Surveys page and click

   The link to Submissions dis-

A program like NetSupport (the
following is a screen shot from the
NetSupport website http://www.net
supportschool.com/quality.htm)
allows an instructor to visually
monitor all computer screens
during a quiz, and this can assist
in identifying if a student is view-
ing a practice set of questions
(with answers) during the closed
book quiz or even emailing a
friend for assistance.

   When using NetSupport with
WebCT you would see something
like the screen shown here.

NetSupport provides a view of all
of the computers in the lab. It also
allows you to mouse-over a station
icon, which pops-up a magnified
window of a student workstation
(this is a view in a Thompson Riv-
ers University lab).

If the NetSupport view raises sus-
picion of wrongdoing, you can
force the suspicious workstation to
expand to the full size of the
monitoring workstation.

           And you can identify all programs
           the student has activated in the
           background by viewing the task
           bar of that workstation.

           As well, by setting your quizzes a
           certain colour it is easy to spot
           workstations that are accessing
           material that is not part of the
           quiz. You can do a screen capture
           of any suspicious workstation, to
           act as evidence of violation of the
           rules of the exam setting.

              You can also increase the mag-
           nification of the collective class
           screen. The following demon-
           strates that it is possible to create
           other views of the workstations in
           the lab, which are easy to tab be-
           tween. You can create a tabbed
           view of all workstations, of the
           workstations for only the class, or
           of the workstations that are only
           doing the quiz (I frequently allow
           other students in the lab who are
           not completing the quiz). The fewer
           the number of stations monitored
           the greater the magnification pos-
           sible to view all stations at once.

linking from the quiz module to other files. JavaScript
can be used in this linking process to significantly en-
hance quiz presentation.

   There are five different types of quizzes in WebCT,
and one type, the short answer quiz, allows the student
to enter either a single word or a more complex longer
phrase as answer. The answers for these quizzes can be
parsed using RegularExpression coding. This means that
immaterial or trivial typing mistakes on the part of a
student, such as an extra space between words, can be
identified and will not be penalized. This reduces some
of the anxiety often experienced with online testing.
After discussing linking to files, I examine RegularEx-
pression coding in some detail.

THE WEBCT QUESTION DATABASE                                Matching: Students match items in relation to two
                                                             columns. This type of question uses a pull-down menu.
There are five different types of WebCT questions:

 Multiple Choice: MC questions are of two types,
   students are allowed to select either you or multiple
   answers to a question. The following example only
   demonstrates the one answer type.

 Short Answer: Students enter a word, phrase or short
   sentence, which is then matched against possible an-
   swers. Short answer types of questions can use the
   RegularExpression feature for evaluating answers
   (more on this feature later).

                                                           Paragraph: Students answer the question using a longer

 Calculated: Students answer a mathematical ques-
   tion, which requires the use of a formula. In creating
   the question, the designer specifies the mathematical
   formula and the set of variables it uses, along with a
   range of values for each variable. Up to 100 different
   sets of answers are generated from the set of variables
   specified (each value in the table below is a variable,
   which in principle varies from one student to the next).

In each type of question shown above, you can link ei-
ther to content contained within a WebCT directory or
to content external to the WebCT course module.

           As well, you can also add other
           sections, for example, I always add
           a section for the level of difficulty
           of a question.

         Two easy methods of linking to images

            IMAGE FIELD: In the question
              database section accessed with
              the question editor, WebCT pro-
              vides a field to link to images.

           This field is primarily useful when
           a common image is used to provide
           information for each possible an-
           swer in the question, as in this
           example.

              It is a simple matter to create
           the link to the image, click on the
           browse button to search the di-
           rectory structure of WebCT for
           your graphic; you simply need to
           know where the image is located
           in your WebCT file structure.

 <IMG SRC=" ">: If you want
   to be a little more creative in
   the use of images in your ques-
   tions, each of the question field,
   the answer # field, the feedback
   # field, and the general feedback
   field can contain code to images,
   such as the HTML image tag,
   <IMG SRC=" ">, which is used
   to automatically display graph-
   ics in a HTML page. (These
   fields can also contain anchor
   links <A HREF=" "> to other
   HTML pages or external web
   pages. More on this later.)

   For example, suppose you

each answer in a question. Simply
enter the appropriate <IMG

for each possible answer in your
question.

An undocumented (though dis-

variable in WebCT is the

ADVANCED FEATURES WITH HTML AND JAVASCRIPT IN WEBCT QUIZZES

In two of the quizzes created for
this section on WebCT Quizzes, I
used some relatively advanced
coding features of HTML and
JavaScript.

Use of HTML in question field

For example, in the calculated
question example, I create the
table for the quiz using the fol-
lowing HTML code.

       SHORT ANSWER WITH REGULAR EXPRESSION

           As is the case for the other quiz
           types, the entry screen for a short
           answer quiz generally has five
           sections: category, title, question,
           answers, and general feedback.

           The answer section, however, is a
           little more complex than on the
           multiple choice question. In this
           question type, there is a pull down
           menu to select the grading option,
           and one grading option is Regular
           Expression. The regular expression
           option enables you to parse the
           input. This assists in reducing the
           number of simple data entry er-
           rors, such as the student entering
           an extra space between words, in a
           multiple word answer.

            they like to share this interesting thing with others. Suddenly, you get both entertainment
            from the fact that you are doing something interesting, and you also get the social part.

       Indeed, my argument is that every course is inherently an investigation, an experiment, a
       journey motivated by purpose and beset by uncertainty. A course, therefore, in its design,
       enactment, and analysis, is as much an act of inquiry and invention as any other activity
       more traditionally called "research" or the scholarship of discovery. - Schulman (1998)

               This is a good start. WHEN does it happen? Keep in mind that the process does not end with using a data collection tool. There is analysis of the
               process before the course begins, and after collecting the data. Also, WHERE does it happen? Is this online, in the classroom, or both?

power of social networks, in that following links from a
person's weblog can introduce readers to material they
would never find on their own.

   As this process became a social phenomenon, soft-
ware developers began creating blog software with fea-
tures to improve ease of use, and entrepreneurs entered
into the field of providing free blogs. Modifications to
the software allow more advanced features like group
blogging (where a group of people assume authorship),
tags or categories (where posts are classified according
to theme and for which custom views are available), and
comments (where people reading a blog can comment
on a particular post or simply communicate with the
author or other readers), and these features have by now
become all but standard.

   Why did blogging become such a social phenome-
non? We suggest that the main reason is that a blog
conforms to a certain mental model of writing (the indi-
vidual diary) that was built upon and extended. This

   It is convenient to view the signing up/creating proc-
ess of a blog as having three separate stages. In the first

are doing their own work.

   The first purpose, an icebreaker, is critical for the
development of positive learning environments (Dooley,        Image 31.1

   The second purpose, a pattern, helps students to de-
termine the rhythm of the course and its expectations. In
studio-based courses, activities consist of required and
elective components, and evaluation takes the form of
critiques (crits). Sharing and trust within a community
are essential parts of a studio environment, so a collective
understanding of acceptable behaviour for constructive
criticism is important. Rubrics and/or checklists, circu-
lated in advance and negotiated during the completion of
the activity promote a positive "crit" process. Patterns, as
suggested by Alexander et al. (1977), help to break down
complex concepts or activities into their component parts,
allowing experts and novices to participate at their own
levels. In the case of the icebreaker activity, pitching a
story, storyboarding the actual film segments, and pro-
viding access to a final version constitute the pattern for
task completion for the remainder of the course.

   The third purpose, an opportunity to demonstrate
prior knowledge and skills, is consistent with sound
principles of adult learning (Knowles, 1995). Adults
bring rich and varied life experiences to their learning.
Because of this, they are capable of latitudinal as well as
longitudinal learning. This means that they can en-
counter a new concept, link it to a previous experience,
modify their understanding, and incorporate it into
something new. The literature (Knowles, Holton &
Swanson, 1998; Richards, Dooley & Lindner, 2004) sug-
gests that adults come to learning highly motivated, so
drawing on their need to know, prior experience, and
