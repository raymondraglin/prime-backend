ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY

We acknowledge that the Conceptual PlayLab, a spiritual home of Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld, is located
on the unceded lands of the Boon Wurrung/Bunurong peoples of the Kulin nation. We pay our respects to
Elders past, present and future. With that future comes a new generation of young Aboriginal and Torres
Strait Islander children. As people invested in early childhood, we always stand with these children. We
understand the violent impact that colonisation has on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. As
we play, learn and imagine our future on these lands we encourage all engaged in early childhood to support
reconciliation and share our friendship, kindness and respect for all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Peoples.

CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A
CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

   Marilyn Fleer

   Chapter Goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn:
           what is Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
           how to plan a Conceptual PlayWorld
           how to set up a pop-up Conceptual PlayWorld.

Introduction - Jumping into the imaginary situation

You are about to enter an imaginary world of an early childhood centre (later, you will be in a primary
classroom). In this world, you will meet Charlotte, a student teacher, and Yuwen, an experienced teacher.
They are co-teaching. However, a problem has arisen.
You meet Charlotte crying outside of the classroom. Sobbing, she says, `I can't go back in'. Charlotte
appears to be experiencing a crisis. She needs your help (see Figure 1).

       Crisis is a scientific concept from cultural-historical theory that captures a moment when
7 | CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

       someone is experiencing some kind of drama or contradiction that propels them forward in
       their development as they consciously experience the situation emotionally and cognitively.
In this book, you will encounter many scenarios like this. Your role is to work through a range of solutions
to help Charlotte and Yuwen as they plan and implement different kinds of Conceptual PlayWorlds.
Figure 1.1.
Meeting Charlotte

Each chapter of this book will prompt you to research and solve a problem associated with Charlotte's
                                                                           CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 8

implementation of Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld. There are many scenarios to work through and various
solutions to assist Charlotte. Your scenario menu is:

     Chapter 2: Conceptual PlayWorld in support of equity and access
     Chapter 3: Play role, drama and learning concepts in a Conceptual PlayWorld
     Chapter 4: Conceptual PlayWorld in dialogue across international contexts
     Chapter 5: Capturing learning: Assessment in a Conceptual PlayWorld
     Chapter 6: Mathematics in a Conceptual PlayWorld
     Chapter 7: Conceptual PlayWorld fostering language and literacy learning
     Chapter 8: Using Conceptual PlayWorld to build wellbeing
     Chapter 9: Conceptual PlayWorld for families: Why play works for teaching STEM in the home
     setting
     Chapter 10: Conceptual PlayWorld to study the structuring of time into days, weeks and months

You can navigate the menu in whatever way supports you with resolving the challenges Charlotte meets. As
you review each chapter, record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking
book (see booklet in Appendix A). The general questions are:

   What is the problem that Charlotte is thinking about or experiencing?
   What is one key idea you gained from reading the narrative or viewing the material that you believe

      could help solve Charlotte's problem?
   What are you curious about? Which chapter in this book could help you?

In some of the chapters are additional questions. You can respond to those questions in your Fleer's
Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book .
However, before you launch into the different scenarios across the chapters, listen to Charlotte's story and
discover why she is sobbing and `can't go back' into the classroom.

Charlotte's story: practical life is full of challenges -
Meeting the problem

Charlotte grew up in a regional community on a farm. Her family are immigrants. Charlotte was the
9 | CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

first in her family to go to university. Moving from the country to the city for university was the first
big challenge she met. However, planning to teach in a preschool was her second. She had never stepped
inside a preschool before. She had no personal experience of preschool education herself. Charlotte was
very excited to be on her first placement.

Charlotte spent much time planning for her teaching placement. The university had asked her to plan one
activity each day and suggested the first might begin by reading a children's book to a small group. She
chose Rosie's Walk (Hutchins, 1987). It suited her, as she felt comfortable with the plot; it connected with
her own rural life. She made plans and checked these with her supervising teacher, Yuwen.

She prepared the scene for reading the book to add excitement for the children. On the weekend, she drove
to a farm and bought 3 bales of hay - this would make good seating and define the space where she would
read the book. She placed a painter's sheet on the floor to protect the carpet. She also prepared a basket of
real eggs - the idea was to collect the eggs Rosie had laid. They would be hidden in the hay for the children
to find. The reading would be followed by using the eggs to make pikelets. This also connected nicely with
the flour mill in the story.

On the first day of her practicum, she came into the preschool early and full of enthusiasm. She showed her
detailed plans to Yuwen, placed the sheet over the carpet as discussed and built a defined reading area with
the hay bales. She opened one bale of hay, which she scattered evenly over the floor. She then hid the eggs
in the hay. Her cooking equipment was close by, ready to be used for her follow-up activity. Her PlayWorld
transition would be as hungry chickens leaving the farm. Charlotte felt satisfied with the visual effect.

       Practice reflection 1.1: Do you see any potential problems? Can you guess what
       happened? Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
       thinking book. Note Charlotte's planning. Consider Charlotte's first experience working with
       a `whole group' of children - not just a small group, as advised by the university.

Fast forward to mid-way through the story reading. The children are throwing hay everywhere. One child
reacts to the hay, and Yuwen quickly removes the child and calls the family, leaving Charlotte to deal with
the situation arising as the children shower each other in hay.
                                                                          CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 10

Another child sits on one of the eggs - not knowing the eggs
are hidden in the hay. She is covered in yoke and screaming.

No cooking took place that day.  You might be interested to
                                 know that this narrative is
                                 based on a real situation of the
                                 author of this chapter.

Research reading 1.1: Read Chapter 7 to learn more about student wellbeing and consider the links to
teacher wellbeing.

       Practice reflection 1.2: What would you do to restore the situation? What went wrong
       despite Charlotte's thoughtful planning? Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's
       Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

As you read on, your role will be to help Charlotte as she solves the challenge of planning and implementing
a Conceptual PlayWorld for the first time. Consider the following:
Charlotte put great effort into planning and designing the reading space. Yuwen responded positively to
Charlotte's enthusiasm and creativity. She had never had a student teacher go to so much trouble to read a
story. The crying did stop (see Figure 1.2).

Figure 1.2.

11 | CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

Yuwen introduced Charlotte to a model of play and learning called Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld.

What is Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld?

An overview of a pop-up Conceptual Playworld based on Rosie's Walk is demonstrated in the video below.
This video also showcases all of the characteristics in practice.

Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld - Evidence-informed
model

Yuwen suggested a set of resources to help Charlotte to plan her own Conceptual PlayWorld.

   Yuwen was introduced to Charlotte Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld website during their debrief.
   Charlotte then looked at the planning resources on the website to learn how to create a Conceptual

      PlayWorld.
   Appendix B is an example of a planning proforma designed for infants and toddlers, containing

      detailed content for each characteristic that could help Charlotte in the future with planning a
      Conceptual PlayWorld for very young children.
13 | CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

   Yuwen also showed Charlotte a portable pop-up of Rosie's Walk as a resource to support her
      practicum placements in the future. Using the suitcase of the story props will mean less preparation
      for her (see Figure 1.3).

       Practice reflection 1.3: In your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book, compare what
       you see in the overview video of practice to that of Charlotte's story of using the same book.
       Critically view the video, identify some pedagogical characteristics you are curious about,
       and start a discussion about it in our private Facebook for Conceptual PlayWorlds.

Research reading 1.2: You can also find other ideas about how to design interesting spaces for a
Conceptual PlayWorld in Chapter 9.
Research reading 1.3: Select and read the research papers that are the foundation for Fleer's Conceptual
PlayWorld on Monash University's Conceptual PlayWorld webpage. This evidence-informed model is
used across Australia and internationally (see Chapter 4 and Chapter 10).

Dramatic story, rather than dramatic activity

Yuwen is sitting outside of the classroom, still comforting Charlotte. She explains to Charlotte that she
has selected the perfect book to read to the children. The story is dramatic and suspenseful - as Rosie the
hen walks about the farmyard, oblivious to the fox who tries at every turn of the page to catch and eat her.
The children experience the suspense as the audience viewing the drama in the picture book. It is highly
motivating for them. They build empathy for the characters in the story. They want to keep Rosie safe and
don't want her eaten. Some want to be bees so they can sting the fox, while others playfully identify with
the fox. Yuwen explains that suspense and drama are important when planning a Conceptual PlayWorld.
Charlotte looks surprised but is listening intently.

       would help children build empathy with the characters in the story. Record your ideas in

15 | CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

Planning how to jump into the story

Charlotte was disappointed by the outcome of her carefully planned activity and engaging reading area.
Yuwen highlighted an important thing that Charlotte did - she had considered the imaginary situation
of the story. She had turned the preschool into Rosie's farm. The props made it easier for the children to
imagine being on the farm - something outside the children's city experience of everyday life.

         Yuwen: The scene you set up made it easy for the children to jump into the imaginary world of
         Rosie's farm.
         Charlotte: But it was chaos - hay everywhere!
         Yuwen: You were thinking about developing the children's imagination by being on the farm. I
         noticed in your planning that you had carefully thought about a routine to go from the farm to the
         cooking area. This is also an important part of planning a Conceptual PlayWorld. You planned the
         exit by being hungry chickens clucking over to the cooking area to make pikelets. You could do the
         same for entering the Conceptual PlayWorld space you designed. The children could be chickens
         entering the imaginary space, but they could also be other characters from the book. The children
         already know the story, and when they see a sign on the preschool door that reads `Rosie's Farm'
         they can enter the imaginary world in character. Importantly, both the children and teachers enter
         in character as a group of foxes, a group of bees, and a group of chickens.

       Practice reflection 1.5: How would you design the imaginary space for the book you
       previously selected? Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual
       PlayWorld thinking book.

       Practice reflection 1.6: Brainstorm a range of entry and exit routines for Rosie's Walk and
       your chosen book. Some examples from the research include stepping into a huge basket
       and pretending to go up in a hot air balloon (Lindqvist, 1995) or going back in time through a
       portal (outdoor equipment) with the routine of counting down from 10 to zero in the time
       machine. Other examples can be found in the Conceptual PlayLab Working papers.

Authentic problem

Yuwen asks Charlotte if she had used the planning proforma, what kind of concept the book could offer
the children, and what might be the authentic problem they could solve together.

         Charlotte: I thought Rosie was walking all over the farm in the story. I had thought that we would
         imagine going all around the farm as part of finding the eggs. We would go over the haystack -
         which we had plenty of here today. The children would also go around the pond, and they would
         go under the flour mill. That's why we were going to make pikelets - to use the flour from the flour
17 | CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

         mill - collecting it in the imaginary situation, and then using it in an actual situation of cooking for
         snack time.'

Yuwen discusses with Charlotte the prepositional language foregrounded in the book, which could be
brought out in the imaginary situation as children jump into the story of Rosie's Walk and become Rosie
walking around the farm.

         Yuwen: What is special about Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld is that when you take the child's
         perspective, you don't just `teach the concept' but rather you carefully plan what concept is to be
         learned and then create motivating conditions where the children meet a problem that they want
         to solve. That is, the children want to help the characters from the book. They want to keep Rosie
         safe. Also, you would have seen in the video that the teacher set up an additional problem - Rosie's
         cousin wants to visit but is lost. The children need to help her by making maps. This happens
         outside of the imaginary situation after they return from visiting the farm. But it could also happen
         inside the imaginary situation.
         Charlotte: So the children learn the concepts to help Rosie?
                                                                          CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 18

         Yuwen: Yes, the concepts serve the children's play. The children take the map back into the
         Conceptual PlayWorld to help Rosie's cousin find the farm.
         Charlotte: Did all of that happen in just one day?
         Yuwen: It can happen all in one day. It is called a pop-up Conceptual PlayWorld. The imaginary
         situation is just a pop-up imaginary play after reading the story. However, a Conceptual PlayWorld
         can also take much longer, even weeks or months - just by adding more problems to solve or
         reading a chapter each week from a much longer book. You can introduce new problems to a simple
         picture book, like Rosie's Walk. For example, by returning to Rosie's farm, the children find that
         the pond has dried up and the animals are thirsty. Bringing civil engineering principles to pipe
         water in and help solve the problem.
         Charlotte: But how is this high level of engineering thinking possible with such young children?
         Yuwen: Most will think this is not possible for such young children, but research now shows we
         underestimate what young minds can engage with (See the Conceptual Playlab working papers for
         more information).

Imagine children looking at the water flowing down a pipe in the sandpit. They adjust the pipe level to
channel the water into places they want. We can see them doing this now in their play in the sandpit.
However, for engineering, you can ask them to look for any blockages and make adjustments to the water
flow; you can introduce a spirit level so they can physically see how the gradient has changed, and they can
then adjust the pipes accordingly, and with more precision and understanding; this is civil engineering at
its very best for 3- and 4-year-old children.

       Practice reflection 1.8: In planning your Conceptual PlayWorld of your chosen story, what
       will be the authentic problem? What concepts will act to serve the children's play? How will
       the play deepen because your children bring more concepts into their play? Record your
       thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

By turning her planned creative ideas into a Conceptual PlayWorld, Charlotte can now see how she could
19 | CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

plan for children's play and learning. She can be more focused on the concepts and what might be the
authentic problem that the children want to help solve.

PlayWorld by reading Chapter 6 and gain further examples of mathematical learning. You can also find
more on literacy concepts and their development in Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld in Chapter 7.

Being a play partner

Unlike other beliefs about children's play, Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld works on the premise that the
teacher changes her role from teacher to play partner. Yuwen explains to Charlotte that she can take on
many roles. But she needs to be inside the imaginary play situation as a character from the story or an
introduced character, such as,

   a wise owl (above position)
   a curious puppy (equal position)
   a helper rabbit (under position)
   someone who acts in unity with the child(ren), and together they role-play in the same character or

      family of characters, such being as a flying bat (e.g., teacher) with her babies clinging on (e.g., child/
      ren) as they go on adventures together (primordial we position).

         Charlotte: But I am learning to be a teacher. How can I be a teacher and a play partner
         simultaneously? I already have problems with managing the children. Won't this model of a
         Conceptual PlayWorld make the children even more chaotic if I am not controlling the situation?

Yuwen explains that all the research on the model confirms that because the children are so motivated to
help solve the problem, the teacher can still manage the situation from inside the play and through their
character role.

         Yuwen: When you are the wise owl, you can be above the children giving advice. So, if something
         is going wrong, the wise owl can come in and say, `I have such a headache from all this noise. I
         cannot hear myself think. Did you know ...' If you want to introduce some key information, it can
         be delivered, like in the series of books about Harry Potter when the owls deliver messages or items
                                                                         CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 20

         to help the play along - like a new broom or a message about approaching danger that has to be
         avoided.

The teacher can also be in the under position with the children in the above position. Such as when the
second teacher joins the children and asks what happened here. This could also be the principal if you were
in a school. The children then recount their experiences and what they have learned to the second teacher
(or principal).

         Charlotte: That is a nice relationship - the teacher in the under position and the children in the
         above position. What a fantastic way to find out what the children know and can do. That must be
         such an authentic approach to assessment.
         Yuwen: But wait, there's more... The teacher can also be in an equal position. By being with the
         children they are solving the problem together.

       Practice reflection 1.9: Look at all the responses you made in your Fleer'sConceptual
       PlayWorld thinking book while reading this chapter and consider if you are ready to plan a
       pop-up Conceptual PlayWorld.

How to set up a pop-up conceptual playworld

Fleer's pop-up Conceptual PlayWorld is planned and implemented in one session. It takes place instead of
group time and uses part of free choice time/tabletop activities. Your planning would follow the steps in
Table 1.1 and involve gathering the children as you usually do for group time. You would use group time
for reading the story. Rather than children self-selecting activities following group time, you would go as a
whole group into the imaginary Conceptual PlayWorld using the routine you planned for entering into an
imaginary situation. This would take about 15-20 minutes. After meeting the problem in the role-play of
the storybook, you would exit the imaginary situation to solve the problem. The planned activities include
you and the children researching and solving the problem you met in the Conceptual PlayWorld. This
may take 15 minutes as children draw, create, or look at books/YouTube as part of their research. Then,
you would re-enter the Conceptual PlayWorld to play out the solution. This would take about another 15
minutes. Your program for your pop-up Conceptual PlayWorld could look like this:

   Group time (read the story and invite children to be a character from the storybook).
   Enter the Conceptual PlayWorld space (jump into the story in character) using the planned routine.
   Pretend play of the story. Meet a problem to solve - helping the character.
   Exiting the Conceptual PlayWorld space using the planned routine.
   Researching to solve the problem so you can help the character from the book.
   Re-enter the Conceptual PlayWorld space (jump back into the story in character) using the planned

      routine and then, through your play, help the character.
   Exiting the Conceptual PlayWorld space using the planned routine.

       The play problem could also be set up when reading the storybook to the children - such as
       when a letter falls out of the book. The letter could be from the main character asking for
                                                                          CHAPTER 1: OVERVIEW OF A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 22

       help. Alternatively, the children could find the letter with the problem in the imaginary
       Conceptual PlayWorld.

     Conclusion

     In this chapter you met Charlotte and Yuwen as they worked through Charlotte's teaching
     placement crisis, transforming it into a Conceptual PlayWorld. She is now re-engaging with the
     children and thinking about how to plan and implement Fleer's pop-up Conceptual PlayWorld
     of Rosie's Walk.

       Practice reflection 1.10: Before reading the next chapter, review the notes you made for
       each video link and summarise or list the characteristics of Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld for
       Rosie's Walk. Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
       thinking book.
       Practice reflection 1.11: Finalise your own Conceptual PlayWorld for your chosen book.

   Chapter goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter you will learn:
           what Conceptual PlayWorlds look like in practice
           how Conceptual PlayWorlds motivate children to learn
           the role of teachers in a Conceptual PlayWorld
           why Conceptual PlayWorlds create a more level playing field for diverse learners, looking
             particularly at girls and STEM engagement.

Introduction

In the previous chapter, you were introduced to Yuwen and Charlotte as they tried out a new idea called a
Conceptual PlayWorld.
Marilyn Fleer and her team at the Monash PlayLab have created a whole collection of Conceptual
PlayWorlds based on popular children's books like Rosie's Walk. They have even teamed up with the
Australian Broadcasting Commission's (ABC) Kids Early Education team to produce resources for their
Play School Story Time program.
These PlayWorlds are all tried and tested in real classrooms, with real teachers and educators from Samoa
to China and Indonesia to Norway.
In this chapter, we look at three examples from Australia. In exploring, we can start to understand the
mechanics behind a Conceptual PlayWorld and what the research-backed model looks like in practice.

Rosie's Walk Conceptual PlayWorld: Mount Barker,
25 | CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY AND ACCESS

Western Australia

Everything was quiet in the playground of Mount Barker Community College - until the chickens got
loose from the kindergarten classroom. They flapped across the yard, stalked by a group of foxes. Then, a
swarm of bees flew out the door and made a beehive.

The chickens clucked but were oblivious to the danger. Every time they turned around, the foxes would
freeze. The bees hummed, concerned.

Sprinkled among all the animal sounds was children's laughter as they played the roles of the animals
in Rosie's Walk. The students especially loved making fox yips - they had just learned the sound from
YouTube.

Teachers were equal play partners and also took on the roles of animals.

PlayWorlds don't require elaborate resources

The game needed no equipment- a simple sign transformed the playground into `Rosie's Farm'. The
children's hands became fox ears and a piece of play equipment, a bee hive.

One of the educators created an imaginary pond simply by making splash splash sounds. When it looked
like the foxes were getting too close, the bees would swarm and chase them away.

After about 10 minutes, the children and teachers went back inside - and that's when the real drama
started.

The urgent problem

Marilyn Fleer - who had designed this Conceptual PlayWorld based on decades of research and was testing
it with the class - played an urgent message from Rosie's cousin.

       Rosie, Rosie! I need your help! I am trying to visit, but I am lost, and I think a fox is trying to eat me.
       Can you help me?

       A wave of excitement ran through the children. And then Marilyn asked, `What can we use to find
       our way when we are lost?'

       The children called out, `A map!' `A phone!'.

Then, with the urgent problem to solve, the children were shown different kinds of maps, prompting them
to draw their own to help Rosie's cousin find her way.
                                         CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY AND ACCESS | 26

This urgent problem to solve is what the research shows is a key to unlocking the power of the Conceptual
PlayWorld - as it harnesses children's curiosity and motivates them to learn.

How the children responded

`You could see the kids so incredibly engaged, and those learning outcomes were going to be coming in all
directions,' said teacher Belinda O'Dea.
`Early childhood educators all know the value of play, so for someone like Marilyn to come and say, `This is
paramount,' is just perfect.'

about her experience taking part.

Learning outcomes

         Yuwen: In this Conceptual PlayWorld, the children learned several foundational concepts while
         immersed in their play.

                Mathematics - Spacial relationships
                Prepositional language, using words like over, under, beside and beneath
                Design and technology - plan view of the farm.
27 | CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY AND ACCESS

         Charlotte: I can see there were also different opportunities for social and emotional development.
                Empathy
                Naming emotions
                Problem-solving.

Charlotte's Web Conceptual PlayWorld: Melbourne,
Victoria

Meanwhile, at Edithvale Primary School, a group of children in their first year of school all troop into the
science lab. They've put on their imaginary farm hats and wellington boots and are ready for an adventure.
The lab has been transformed into the barn from Zuckerman's farm in the book Charlotte's Web. Barn
                                         CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY AND ACCESS | 28

doors and animals mark the entrance, and a bale of hay adds an air of authenticity. Specialist teacher Ashlee
McCarthy is dressed in overalls and her farming hat, ready to go.

For the past term, the science team has been exploring the lifecycles of animals that produce offspring
similar to their own. And they've done it all through the lens of the imaginary world of Charlotte's Web.

The urgent problem

Today, the children are learning about butterflies. Ashlee is reading from the book when a letter falls out -
it's from Wilbur. The children smile and jump in anticipation.

         I am scared and lonely. Up until yesterday, I was living a happy life. I had a cosy home under the
         apple tree and drank milk, so much milk!

         And now everything is dark, sticky, and smelly. I don't recognise anything or anyone, and my tummy
         is rumbling. I don't see any milk to drink or hear any kind words. I don't know where Fern is. How
         will I survive here? What do I need? Can you help me?

It looks like Wilbur is stuck inside a chrysalis. Miss McCarthy asks, `Can we help Wilbur?' The children
respond with a resounding yes.

Learning about life cycles

And so begins the children's exploration of the life cycle of a butterfly - from egg to caterpillar to chrysalis
to metamorphosis. When the vocabulary is confusing, Miss McCarthy becomes Charlotte and drops in
from her web on the ceiling to explain.

Wilbur - a special stuffed toy the children have quickly come to love - also drops in to check on their
learning and asks for help.

The role of the teacher in the spider's playground

The class goes outside - via a `magical portal' - to visit the `spider's playground' and roleplay the different
stages of the lifecycle. An outdoor climbing gym forms a web, perfect for the children to hang from when
they are in a chrysalis.

         `Everything is still and quiet because something special is happening inside these cocoons. They are
         undergoing a change called metamorphosis,' Miss McCarthy says in character.

         Together, the butterflies slowly emerge. They need to dry off. They need to be strong enough to fly
         and then the butterflies flit all over the playground.
29 | CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY AND ACCESS

         Miss McCarthy flaps and flies with her students. `You quickly get over feeling silly. You get wrapped
         up in the kids giggling and having fun ... it's giving [the students] permission to play'.

Research Readings 2.2: Teachers and educators must be active play partners in Conceptual PlayWorlds.
Utami, Fleer & Li's (2022) study originally published in the International Journal of Early Childhood
shows how these interactions transformed play for teachers in Indonesia. Read this study, available as
working paper 46 in Conceptual PlayLab working papers.

       Practice reflection 2.2: Ashlee McCarthy played various roles in the Conceptual PlayWorld,
       including Charlotte, Wilbur, and - along with the children - a butterfly going through a
       metamorphosis. What position did she take in each: equal, below, or above?
       Practice reflection 2.3: A Conceptual PlayWorld has five key characteristics that are
       informed by research. In addition to the video below, these PlayWorld starters from the
       PlayLab offer more ideas. Which ones would you like to try? Remember to record your ideas
       in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Learning outcomes

         Charlotte: I am starting to understand how versatile PlayWorlds can be. I can see three key science
         concepts being taught here at a very low cost.
                                         CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY AND ACCESS | 30

                Science - life cycles
                Scientific language, using words like pupa, chrysalis and metamorphosis
                Science - ecosystems.

         Yuwen: In terms of social and emotional development, the children were also able to:

                learn about regulating emotions
                cooperate with each other
                understand friendships.

The Very Hungry Caterpillar Conceptual PlayWorld:
Brisbane, Queensland

Wonderland is a long day care centre at Sheldon College in Brisbane. Educators Kristy and Tiana both
participated in professional development at the Monash PlayLab to learn how to run a Conceptual
PlayWorld.

They based their first Conceptual PlayWorld on the classic children's story, The Very Hungry Caterpillar.
After reading the story, the children - all aged between three and five - ventured out into their imaginary
garden by crawling through a special tunnel.

There, they met Kristy, playing the role of a very hungry caterpillar, and helped her find food. The children
learned what caterpillars eat and used B-Bot coding as part of the activity.

`The children were instantly mesmerised and that level of excitement remained throughout the PlayWorld,'
Kristy explained.

Tiana said it worked well for the group's younger and older children and `was quite easy to differentiate
their learning according to their abilities'.

Keeping girls engaged with STEM

As the playworld progressed, Kristy and Tiana noticed something special was happening in particular with
the girls.

The girls loved the dramatic play and had plenty of opportunities to choose different characters and
activities, which had a flow-on effect on their learning.

         `It helped them become engaged, and they were more invested in solving the STEM problem,'
         Tiana observed.
31 | CHAPTER 2: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN SUPPORT OF EQUITY AND ACCESS

         Kristy also noticed that the girls in the group were very engaged with the engineering and
         architectural problem-solving within the Conceptual PlayWorld.
         `It just changes up the way you teach a unit. It's just so much more exciting for the teachers and for
         the children,' Tiana reported.

Tiana shares what she loves about using the Monash PlayLab Conceptual PlayWorld model in her
classroom. Watch Tiana's story below.

The difference Conceptual PlayWorlds make for girls

A big area of focus for the Monash PlayLab researchers has been to investigate the differences in how girls
engage in STEM inside and outside of Conceptual PlayWorlds.
Studies show that in kindergarten, girls have a science achievement gap. A report released by Australia's
Chief Scientist found the origins of this to be under-representation and unconscious gender biases in early
childhood education.
Building on previous research, the PlayLab team reported in traditional early childhood spaces girls:

   get pushed aside in spaces like construction areas without intervention
   play differently to boys
   experience accumulative micro-aggressions that lead to them disengaging with STEM.

In contrast, Conceptual PlayWorlds have been shown to create safe and positive spaces for girls to learn
alongside boys. In particular, the team found Conceptual PlayWorlds:

   transform the role of teachers to be play partners who then intervene early
   motivate girls to learn through stories and dramatic play
   enable girls to experience collective imaginary play on an equal footing.

   Conclusion

     In this chapter, we learned about the practical ways that Conceptual PlayWorlds have been
     applied in three different early childhood spaces in Australia. We explored some of the research
     behind the model and from the teachers themselves. We covered the different ways the
     Conceptual PlayWorld model can motivate children to learn by:

           introducing urgent problems into imaginative scenarios
           having teachers as play partners in the scenario
           equalising power dynamics through collective imagination.Charlotte and Yuwen have

             been learning and reflecting together.
     In the next chapter, we'll dive deeper into how a teacher's role is transformed from supervisor
     to play partner.

LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL
PLAYWORLD

   Chapter Goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn:
           how to become a play/character role in a Conceptual PlayWorld
           how to dramatise the conceptual problem in a Conceptual PlayWorld
           how to act and embody subject knowledge/concepts in play

Introduction - Entering an imagined Conceptual
PlayWorld

You are about to enter the imaginary world of an early childhood centre.
After learning about the Conceptual PlayWorld from Yuwen (see Chapter 1), Charlotte was keen to try
her own Conceptual PlayWorld for the first time. Charlotte chose the storybook, The Gruffalo (Australia
only) written by Julia Donaldson and Axel Scheffler.
Charlotte chose this story as she wanted the children to identify with the mouse, because although the
mouse was little, the mouse always came up with many clever plans to save herself. She wanted to use this
story to help the children understand that even though they are small, they can still find a way to `save'
themselves in any challenging situation.
It was the first time the children were to travel to the Conceptual PlayWorld space, which was set up in
the centre of their playroom. Before entering the Conceptual PlayWorld, Charlotte and the children read
37 | CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

the story together and designed different character roles using art materials (Figure 3.1.) to create character
puppets and develop scripts for the play.

Figure 3.1.
Character puppets for use in the Conceptual PlayWorld

                                                                 Note. Image
                                                                 provided by the
                                                                 author.

They created a new storyline and narrated an ending where all the animals, even the Gruffalo, became
friends. After entering the playworld, the children actively performed their chosen character roles, acting
out the new storyline and following the prepared script. Charlotte acted like a director of their play, giving
them suggestions of what and how to perform, while Yuwen watched on. After the session, Charlotte asked
Yuwen if this was how Conceptual PlayWorld should be experienced, feeling like it was very similar to
theatre play she had previously done in her preservice teacher training.
                     CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 38

       Practice reflection 3.1: How do you feel about the Conceptual PlayWorld that Charlotte
       has created? Can you see what problems arose based on your understanding of Conceptual
       PlayWorld from Chapter 1? Could you help Charlotte solve the problems according to what
       you have learned? Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
       thinking book.

Double-subjectivity: Play role and real role

Through her first experience of the Conceptual PlayWorld, Charlotte reflected on her teaching role and
wondered about the differences between theatre play and Conceptual PlayWorld. Yuwen suggested that an
important element Charlotte did well was thinking about supporting the children in building an emotional
connection with the characters in the storybook. Charlotte used theatre play to support the children to be
familiar with the storyline and develop a new ending. This helped the children to transition to the imagined
playworld space. Yuwen also mentioned that Charlotte's professional reflection was beneficial, and her
question about the difference between a Conceptual PlayWorld and theatre play was important. Yuwen
explained the differences between theatre play and Conceptual PlayWorld to Charlotte and elaborated
upon the importance of being an active play partner in Conceptual PlayWorlds.

         Yuwen: It is good that you chose a storybook that has an adventure and an emotionally charged
         situation, such as what the little mouse experienced, and which followed the children's
         perspectives. The Conceptual PlayWorld starts with children's literature, which is why the book
         you chose was just great. However, within the Conceptual PlayWorld, teachers also need to be
         part of the playworld. We call this taking a partner role. Acting out the story is just a start to help
         the children become familiar with the character roles and build emotional connections with the
         storybook's characters. In this way, the Conceptual PlayWorld can be personally meaningful for
         children. Teachers need to enter the Conceptual PlayWorld together with the children by taking
         a character role instead of being a director of the children's play. The director's role is outside of
         the imagined play. To be inside the play, teachers can be a role from the storybook or even a new
         character role that might not come from the story at all! The teacher can even take on the role of an
         object, like a tree, who can guide the children and promote the play and exploration process (See
         Figure 3.2). Some teachers worry that they cannot control the classroom and manage children's
         behaviours, especially when going inside together with a whole group, so they might choose a
         character role who has magic powers, which will inspire the children.

         Charlotte (nodding her head): Oh, it means I need to be an animal friend drawing upon the story
         or other character role. I thought I was part of their play as a director taking a play role instead of
39 | CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

         being a teacher. Now I can see that I need to be an active player. But why do we need to take such
         an active role? And how to be an active player? It feels quite challenging to play a role with children,
         acting like an animal. I'm not sure I am playful enough.

         Yuwen: Very good questions Charlotte! Why do teachers need to be part of the Conceptual
         PlayWorld? Think about if you become a play role such as an owl, what is your role in the children's
         eyes? As a teacher? Or an owl? In their eyes, you become an owl! Once you are inside the imaginary
         situation, you can better understand the children's perspectives and intentions. Then, you can use
         your character role to guide the children to investigate the conceptual problem. While in a character
         role in the Conceptual PlayWorld, it doesn't mean you forget your real role as a teacher. Rather,
         simultaneously, you have what is called double-subjectivity (Kravtsova, 2014): a player who is a
         play partner of the children and a teacher who has a pedagogical agenda. By doing so, you can teach
         the subject knowledge and concepts and support meaningful learning and play development.

Charlotte could be a tree

       Practice reflection 3.2: What are the relations between a play role and a real role? Why do
       we need to become play partners in the Conceptual PlayWorld?

After listening to Yuwen's explanation and suggestions, Charlotte shared another concern due to her lack
of confidence in being in the play role within the Conceptual PlayWorld.

         Charlotte: Oh! Very interesting to know this. I haven't thought about this before. It is important
         to hold two roles at the same time. Now I know what I should do. However, I still find it
         challenging to act like an animal or be playful, as I have never played like that before. I am so
41 | CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

         worried about how the children will see me. Also, I am not sure how to use my role to extend
         children's thinking and exploration?
         Yuwen: Please don't worry. We can do some playful activities together, and I can invite other
         colleagues to the professional training day this week. We can do some improvising activities and
         support you to be more playful.
Later, at the professional training day within the whole centre, Yuwen leads the whole group of teachers
to do the improvised activities she discussed with Charlotte. The webpage Demonstrating Viola Spolin's
Theater Games has examples of the theatre games used in the training day.

       Practice reflection 3.3: What improvisation principles could you use to extend the
       children's imagination and play in your classroom? Can you use improvisation principles in
       daily conversation? Why do you think they are important in a Conceptual PlayWorld?
       Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Embodied imagined play role and concepts

During the professional training session, Yuwen created a conceptual play activity to explore the embodied
imagined STEM concepts. This supported Charlotte's understanding of the STEM concepts and help her
transition to an imaginary situation.

Conceptual play activity

Professional training participants, as a small group, portray the assigned scientific concepts without using
words. Others need to guess the concept which has been portrayed, such concepts can include such as:

   Direction: Directional movement through the arrows and walking steps
   2D shapes: Triangle, Square, Rectangle, or Circle
   Germination: A plant grows from a seed into a seedling
   Freezing & melting: Ice melting into water on a sunny day
   Light refraction: Rainbow
                     CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 42

Figure 3.3.
Acting the directional movement

       Practice reflection 3.4: How do you feel about using body movements and gestures to
       illustrate the scientific concepts? Have a practice with your friends, family or colleagues and
       see if they can guess which concepts you are trying to portray.

After the professional development training day, Charlotte debriefed with Yuwen and reflected on the
conceptual play activity.

         Charlotte: I found I really enjoyed the conceptual play activity. It was a fun and interesting
         activity. I could create anything I liked using my body movements and the related objects. I changed
         the meaning of my actions and objects by interacting with the group imagination. It really opened
         my mind, and I was amazed how I could dramatise the concepts using an imagined play role. Play
         has such a powerful meaning!
43 | CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

Is the Conceptual PlayWorld scripted?

After the professional development training session, Charlotte reflected on what she learnt with Yuwen
and explained the importance of improvisation and how this also supported the children's play
development. As Charlotte wanted to do it right, when she first tried the Conceptual PlayWorld session,
she had a script ready, but now reflected on that decision with Yuwen:

         Charlotte: Thanks for all your great ideas, Yuwen. I now feel I know how to extend the children's
         thinking by stepping out of my role as the teacher and, instead, use the play role, which motivates
         the children to explore the concepts. I still have another question though: is the Conceptual
         PlayWorld scripted? Should I prepare every sentence to guide the children's exploration of the
         concept in the Conceptual PlayWorld?

In response, Yuwen discussed with Charlotte the planning process of the Conceptual PlayWorld and
highlighted how to plan and dramatise the conceptual problem while considering children's learning
processes:

         Yuwen: Excellent thinking Charlotte! I am so glad to hear that you feel more comfortable with
         being in a play role. Also, you have asked another great question. The Conceptual PlayWorld needs
         to be planned; however, it should not be scripted, or cannot be scripted, as we do not know how the
         children will interact with the problem-solving scenario in the imagined Conceptual PlayWorld.
         What we can plan, though, is the dramatisation of the emotionally charged situation that motivates
         children's exploration of the problem. While doing this, we also assess children's play and their
         exploration process (see Chapter 5 for more information about assessment).

         For instance, you might plan your imagined role in play and the dramatised conceptual problem
         for children and teachers to investigate together. In addition, you can plan the teachers' interaction,
         all while considering children's diverse needs and intentions. For instance, you might invite the
         characters to explore the concept of direction and say that the little snake was lost in the forest
         and could not find a way home. Then, the little snake met the Gruffalo and asked for help to find
         the way home, so needing directions. Within the Conceptual PlayWorlds, the children could use
         the concept of direction to help the snake and solve this emotionally charged situation of the poor
         snake being lost. Or you could create the emotionally charged scenario where the children in their
         character roles need to build a new house for the snake, as they could not find Snake's old house
         and want to build them a new house. In this way, engineering principles could be applied, and the
         children can use design technology concepts to support the problem-solving process.
                     CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 44

Authentic problem: Curriculum links and learning subject
knowledge/concepts

Through their discussion, Charlotte has reflected on what Yuwen suggests and asks another important
question related to the dramatisation of the authentic conceptual problem:

         Charlotte: So, does it mean that in the Conceptual PlayWorld, the children's learning process is
         reflected through the problem-solving process using relevant concepts? I wonder which concept I
         should start with?! For instance, if we would like children to learn the concept of direction, should
         I start with directional language? Or learning about maps? How can I embed the concepts into the
         Conceptual PlayWorld?

         Yuwen: This requires us as teachers to be familiar with the curriculum and the children's learning
         sequences with concepts and, in your example, direction. We aim to support children's learning
         progression. We are not expecting the children to solve the problem in one day, rather, it may
         take a few sessions of the Conceptual PlayWorld to solve the problem. But we do need to start by
         setting up the emotionally charged scenario. For instance, while the children travel to the Gruffalo's
         PlayWorld as different characters, such as a mouse, owl, snake or even the Gruffalo, the teacher
         might take on the role of a baby snake, explaining that she is lost in the deep dark wood, and needs
         help to find her way home.

         Charlotte: That is a great idea! I could use our outdoor play yard to become Gruffalo's playworld
         space. I could set up different areas representing the different animals' houses. I could invite the
         children to explore these areas together with me. We could even have a community walk. After
         the first session of Conceptual PlayWorld, I will become a baby snake, lost and afraid and needing
         help to find my way home. The children could be other character roles to guide me, the lost baby
         snake, home. While they do this, I could prompt with questions like, should I go left or right, move
         forward or backward from the fox house? How many walking steps should I take?

Yuwen gives Charlotte a big smile and agrees with Charlotte's creative ideas and thoughtful planning. She
supports Charlotte in reflecting on the importance of planning the conceptual problems by considering
children's learning progression and curriculum content. Yuwen highlights that the play will hold
significant meaning to the children through the dramatisation.

         Yuwen: It sounds like a great idea. The directional language is used here to help solve the problem.
         Also, by counting steps, the children will be using the one-to-one correspondence principle. The
         measurement of the distance will also be important. But can you see how the Conceptual
         PlayWorld is not scripted? We must assess children's learning and exploration while we play and
         explore with children together. For instance, if some children feel challenged counting the steps,
         we might spend more time counting and helping them to support counting between two animal
45 | CHAPTER 3: PLAY ROLE, DRAMA AND LEARNING CONCEPTS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

         houses (see Chapter 6 for more information about pedagogical positioning to support concept
         learning in mathematics).

         Charlotte: Yes, thank you, Yuwen. Now, it is becoming so much clearer to me. I need to follow
         children's intentions. Also, I think I could draw a map with the children while we help the baby
         snake find the house.

The following images demonstrate progressively exploring the concept of direction within a Conceptual
PlayWorld.

       Practice reflection 3.5: Can you think of another dramatic conceptual problem you could
       plan for children's STEM exploration, drawing upon the story of The Gruffalo? How would
       you design the learning process while considering children's learning progression of the
       concept? Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking
       book.

   Conclusion

     One of the ideas introduced in Chapter 1 was the role of the teacher and dramatisation of the
     concepts in a Conceptual PlayWorld. In this chapter, you are invited to think about how you feel
     about being a play partner, setting up the drama of a problem, and acting and embodying the
     subject knowledge through play. To resource this challenge, this chapter provides information
     that will increase your capacities and build confidence in understanding and implementing the
     Conceptual PlayWorld in a play-based learning program.

     By reading and completing this chapter, you will be able to:
           understand the possibilities of using Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld across different
             settings and learn case studies from the Australian (see Chapter 1) and Indonesian
             contexts
           research how to integrate local contexts to benefit your teaching (e.g. being mindful of
             sociocultural aspects of your kindergarten setting, respecting local beliefs, values and
             practices; understanding the national early childhood curriculum, selecting local stories,
             and selecting important and localised concepts)
           develop strategies when applying intentional teaching in different contexts.

Introduction - Jumping into the imaginary situation

In Melbourne, Charlotte is looking at her diary. School holidays will begin in 2 months and she is very
excited. She has been planning for months to visit her childhood friend, Sita, in Indonesia. They studied in
the same primary and secondary schools in Clayton, a lovely multicultural suburb in southeast Melbourne.
At that time, Sita's parents were postgraduate students from Indonesia studying at Monash University.
After her parents graduated, they went back to Indonesia. Sita and Charlotte have kept communicating
over the years as they share the same hobbies and interests, enjoy reading and writing stories, and, most
importantly, they love children and were keen to become kindergarten teachers. It has been 4 years since
Sita returned to her home city of Yogyakarta.
Now, time is ticking! Charlotte feels that she needs to prepare for her visit to Yogyakarta. She has wished to
49 | CHAPTER 4: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN DIALOGUE ACROSS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS

visit this city since she heard from Sita that Yogyakarta is a beautiful place and a centre of classical Javanese
fine arts and culture. Even more fascinating is that although Indonesia is a presidential republic, the
government gave Yogyakarta a special region status as the only Indonesian royal city ruled by a monarchy.

Research reading 4.1: Explore the history of Yogyakarta special district, Indonesia.

From 1755 to 1945, the Yogyakarta Sultanate was a Javanese Islamic monarchy. After Indonesia gained
independence in 1945, the Sultanate was transformed into the Special Region of Yogyakarta Province. In
essence, Yogyakarta is the only province among all 38 Indonesian provinces led by a Sultan from 1755 until
today.

What is the difference between a Sultan and a King? Both labels refer to a sovereign ruler with the power
and authority to rule a country. However, a Sultan is a noble title with religious significance in Muslim
countries, while the title of King tends to be more secular and is widely used in both Muslim and non-
Muslim countries.

The current Sultan in Yogyakarta is Sri Sultan Hamengkubuwono X (read: Hamengkubuwono the tenth),
also the Governor of Yogyakarta Special Region. While he holds a powerful political and spiritual position
within the island of Java, he is also highly respected in the international community.

Research reading 4.2: Sultan of Yogyakarta: A feminist revolution in an ancient kingdom.

The changing role of women in Yogyakarta Sultanate

Javanese culture is traditionally a patriarchal one where the society expects men to play public-facing roles
while women stay at home. This often translates to men enjoying superior public positions. In contrast,
women were often given domestic roles that positioned them in a publicly inferior position.

Despite this, Sultan Hamengkubuwono X wishes to modernise the royal system by enacting a number of
reforms. His stance is one of respect for women, and he values their position as equal to men. The Sultan
married Gusti Kanjeng Ratu Hemas, and they have 5 daughters: Crown Princess Mangkubumi, Princess
Condrokirono, Princess Maduretno, Princess Hayu and Princess Bendoro. All the children were sent to
study in either Europe, the United States or Australia. Once they returned to Yogyakarta, they were all
given various leadership positions in the palace.

There are at least 3 important decisions the Sultan has made since he came to power in relation to gender
                     CHAPTER 4: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN DIALOGUE ACROSS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS | 50

equality. First, the Sultan changed his title to be gender neutral. Second, he announced his eldest daughter
as his successor.
The third decision is considered controversial yet one he highly values. In the past, it was common practice
for a Sultan to have more than one wife. Given that all of the current Sultan's children are female, this is
even more important within Javanese high society as they prefer that his heir be male. However, the Sultan
has publicly declared that he will not practice polygamy.

Research reading 4.3: By reading this journal article, Gender politics in Yogyakarta Sultanate (Ratnawati,
2021), you will learn about the shift in the culture of the Yogyakarta Palace, from being patriarchal to
promoting gender equality.

Planning a Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld in a localised
context: What to prepare?

Charlotte has bought return flight tickets from Melbourne to Yogyakarta. She has read information about
Yogyakarta and has a list of places to visit. Has she finished with her preparation?
Of course not. One important thing on her bucket list is to share Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld model with
Sita and practice it together in the kindergarten where Sita is currently teaching.

       Practice reflection 4.1. Go back to Chapter 1 and review the 5 characteristics of Fleer's
       Conceptual PlayWorld. Record your notes in your Fleer's Conceptual Playworld thinking
       book.

Charlotte starts thinking about the 5 characteristics of Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld. Before she begins,
she needs to know more about Indonesia's contexts in general and specifically Indonesian early childhood
education. What do Indonesian children learn and how do they play? How do local kindergartens operate
in Yogyakarta? So many questions to explore.
51 | CHAPTER 4: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN DIALOGUE ACROSS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS

Understanding the educational system

Charlotte begins browsing websites about the Indonesian educational system. The Republic of Indonesia
is the fourth most populous country in the world, with 277 million people living there. Although it is
officially secular, religion is an important aspect in people's lives. Approximately 87% of Indonesians, or
241 million people, identify themselves as Muslims, making Indonesia the largest Muslim-majority country
in the world (Ministry of Religious Affairs of Indonesia, 2022).
Compulsory education in Indonesia starts at primary (7-12 years old), followed by junior secondary
(13-15 years old), and senior secondary (16-18 years old) levels. Enrolment in pre-primary or early
childhood (3-6 years old) is optional. Two ministries oversee the education system. The Ministry of
Education, Culture, Research and Technology (MoECRT) manage public and private schools, which
are predominantly decentralised. The Ministry of Religious Affairs (MoRA) manage Islamic public and
private madrasahs, which are mainly centralised. Around 80% of primary and secondary schools are
managed by MoECRT and the remaining schools are madrasahs managed by MoRA.

       Practice reflection 4.2: Do you remember the Australian education system? Compare it to
       the Indonesian education system - did you find any similarities and differences? Record your
       thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Now that Charlotte understands Indonesian education, she wants to know more about the early childhood
setting. She endeavours to spend the next few days learning more about the Indonesian approach to early
childhood education.

Understanding early childhood in Indonesia

The Indonesian government recognised the importance of early childhood education in 2001 when they
established the Directorate of Early Childhood Education under the Ministry of Education and Culture
(note. The Ministry of Education and Culture and the Ministry of Research and Technology were merged
in 2021 and renamed as The Ministry of Education, Culture, Research and Technology [MoECRT]).
As with other countries, the MoECRT works with other government agencies to improve the quality of
early childhood. The Ministry of Social Welfare, the Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Women's
                      CHAPTER 4: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN DIALOGUE ACROSS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS | 52

Empowerment also oversee Indonesian early childhood education and care. To add a layer of complexity,
Indonesia's strong religious culture means that the MoRA manages religious-based Early Childhood
Education (ECE) centres, while the MoECRT manages non-religious-based ECE centres.

There are different types of ECE centres in Indonesia. They can be formal or nonformal, and public
or privately funded. One of the many criteria used to define formal vs nonformal ECE centres was the
qualification of teachers working there (UNESCO, 2004, 2005). Those teaching in a formal ECE centre
must have a teaching qualification from a university. Meanwhile, nonformal ECE centres do not have such
requirements for their teachers.

In 2020, only 2% of the 202,991 ECE centres in the country were public and funded by the government
(Adriany, 2022). Thus, the majority of ECE centres are run by private organisations.

                                  Note. Charlotte
                                  thinks all of this
                                  information is
                                  very interesting
                                  and will help
                                  inform how she
                                  approaches
                                  Fleer's Conceptual
                                  PlayWorld in the
                                  Indonesian
                                  context. She
                                  continues
                                  researching.

Another interesting classification of Indonesian ECE centres is the name of services based on their
activities. The ECE centres can be categorised as kindergarten (a formal centre for 4-6-year-old children),
playgroup (a nonformal centre for 2-4-year-old children, although in some areas it may include 4-6-year-
old children), day-care (a centre for 0-2-year olds), and nonformal early childhood education (which are
often run by volunteers in villages/rural areas).
53 | CHAPTER 4: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN DIALOGUE ACROSS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS

Research reading 4.4: You can explore more about ECE in Indonesia (Adriany, 2022, pp. 2-6)

Early childhood curriculum

The ECE curriculum in Indonesia is `highly standardised and centralised' (Adriany, 2022, p. 9). The
ECE National Curriculum classifies children's development into 6 domains: physical, social-emotional,
language, art, cognitive, and religious development (MoEC, 2014). It addresses core competencies based on
children's age groups, from birth to 2 years old, 2-4 years old, and 4-6 years old.

Charlotte finds too much information at this stage. She decides she needs to focus on kindergartens because
Sita teaches at a local kindergarten in Yogyakarta. Charlotte reflects on all her reading so far and tries to find
more information on Indonesian kindergartens.

In the kindergarten setting, children are expected to develop 4 core competencies: spiritual, social,
knowledge, and skill competencies (Adriany, 2022).

   First, the spiritual competencies expect children to believe in God and His creations, and be able to
      appreciate themselves, other people, and the environment as an expression of gratitude to God.

   Second, the social competencies consist of 14 fundamental competencies, such as having a healthy
      lifestyle, showing creativity, showing appreciative behaviour and tolerance to others, showing
      honesty, and being humble and polite to parents, teachers and friends.

   Third, the knowledge competencies comprise 15 fundamental competencies, such as acknowledging
      daily prayer, having good morals and behaviour, acknowledging the environment (e.g. animals,
      plants, climate, land, water, and rocks), knowing simple technology (e.g. household items, mechanic
      utensils), understanding receptive and expressive languages, as well as knowing their emotions and
      others.

   Fourth, the skill competencies consist of 15 components, such as observing daily prayer with adults'
      guidance, demonstrating good moral behaviour, being able to solve daily problems creatively,
      demonstrating receptive language, understanding expressive language, and demonstrating preliteracy
      skills.

Research reading 4.5: See Table 5, page 11, for a complete list of competencies for kindergarten in the
Indonesian ECE curriculum (Adriany, 2022)

       Practice reflection 4.3: Now you that know the 4 core competencies intended for
       kindergarten children in the Indonesian ECE curriculum, read the 5 Learning Outcomes in the
       Early Years Learning Framework for Australia V2.0 (ACECQA, 2023, p. 29). What did you find
       most interesting between the 2 policy documents? Record your thoughts in your
       personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld in the Indonesian
context

Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld model was developed in the Australian context (see Chapter 1 and the
Conceptual PlayWorld website). We know that Charlotte will implement Conceptual PlayWorlds with Sita
in a local kindergarten in Yogyakarta. She has read about the local culture in Yogyakarta, the province where
Sita's kindergarten is located. She has also prepared herself with some knowledge about the Indonesian
55 | CHAPTER 4: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN DIALOGUE ACROSS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS

education system, early childhood setting, and national ECE curriculum. Now, it is time to get into the 5
characteristics of Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld.

       Practice reflection 4.4: Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld planning proforma has been
       translated into different languages: Bahasa Indonesia, Chinese, Japanese, Vietnamese, Laos,
       Arabic, and many more. You can download these planning proformas from the Conceptual
       PlayWorlds website.

Help Charlotte think about which aspects of the 5 characteristics of Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld need to
be modified in different cultural contexts. Refer to Table 1.1 in Chapter 1.

The big day

Charlotte feels ready to practice her Conceptual PlayWorld with Sita in Yogyakarta. She has read extensively
on the background of ECE in Indonesia, selected a local storybook and completed a planning proforma.
Charlotte can't wait to visit Yogyakarta and implement a Conceptual PlayWorld with Sita. She notes that
during her preparations, it is important to:

   learn about cultural values, beliefs and practices of both settings
   explore the target country's education system and national curriculum
   understand the target country's early childhood curriculum, including any expected learning

      outcomes or core competencies
   try using local sustainable eco-friendly resources to support your Conceptual PlayWorld

   Conclusion

     This chapter discusses several important concepts to consider when implementing Conceptual
57 | CHAPTER 4: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS IN DIALOGUE ACROSS INTERNATIONAL CONTEXTS

     PlayWorlds in different sociocultural settings. We suggest student teachers be mindful of the
     local values, beliefs and practices when teaching in culturally diverse contexts. Understanding
     the national curriculum and education system would be helpful, particularly in early childhood
     settings. Student teachers are encouraged to integrate local knowledge into their teaching
     practice. By developing these strategies, student teachers can use evidence to contextualise the
     Conceptual PlayWorld model. This will enable them to successfully implement a Conceptual
     PlayWorld that aligns with country-specific curriculum and cultural expectations.

       To find out more about Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld read the research on the Conceptual
       PlayLab website.

ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL
PLAYWORLD

   Gloria Quinones

   Chapter Goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn about:
           what is Intentional Observation of children's learning
           how to establish mutual dialogue between colleagues about capturing children's play
           what is assessment and its relation to Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
           how do teacher's assess children's learning.

Introduction

In Chapter 3, you were introduced to the importance of your pedagogical role in Fleer's Conceptual
PlayWorlds. In this chapter, we extend your role in relation to assessment and what this might mean when
you engage in imaginary Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds with children.
Your new challenge is to think about intentionally observing children's play in Fleer's Conceptual
PlayWorlds and, making some judgements about children's learning. This involves understanding what
assessment is. Remember that as a student teacher, you can always check with your mentor teacher (like
Yuwen), who has more experience making judgements about children's learning.
Remember that you are making observations of children's interests in the flow of play during the
Conceptual PlayWorld. We will draw upon the story of Rosie's Walk (you can use another story you like,
too) to reflect on the possibilities for assessing children's play and learning.
It is important to consider what children learn in Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds - in the different moments
                                   CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 60

of interacting with children, to capture children's learning. Specifically, we will focus on Fleer's Conceptual
PlayWorld using visuality - visual tools to support you in capturing different perspectives - your personal
learning, children's individual and collective learning, and the conditions that have been jointly created in
the flow of playing.

       Practice Reflection 5.1: Brainstorm what you think children are learning in Fleer's
       Conceptual PlayWorlds. Record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual
       PlayWorld thinking book. Note the children's ideas and your own reflections.

What is Intentional Observation

Observing children in their everyday play is important (Ebbeck, 2016). When observing children's play,
remember the multiple perspectives about play: teacher's and children's perspectives. The act of observing
involves collaboration with your mentor teacher or peer during placement; they can also add to what you
are observing. Before making an assessment, it's important to ponder what is observed. By observing and
wondering during children's play, you can capture their learning and interests.

       Practice Reflection 5.2: When observing children's learning, use the following questions
       for reflection and wondering:

             what is currently happening in this situation?
             what are the imaginary situations children are co-creating, negotiating and

                collaborating with each other?
             how are children relating and discussing ideas (verbally and non-verbally)?
             what resources in the environment are available for children's Fleer's Conceptual

               PlayWorlds?
61 | CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

When teachers are intentional, they develop a sensitive awareness of children's interests and intentions
(Ridgway, et al., 2021). These are significant for further observation and reflection of `what' is learned in
play. Through your observation, you can identify how children are learning so you can further plan and
extend in Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds.

Mutual Dialogue

It is important to remember to continue to discuss these ideas with your mentor teacher, to establish
mutual dialogue about what children are playing and learning. For example, what would your role be
in Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds (Chapter 3)? Mutual dialogue enriches a teacher's understanding of
children's play (Ridgway, et al., 2021). In this case, imagine how Charlotte wondered with Yuwen about
children's play. Charlotte had many questions about where to begin to observe, and this conversation
followed.

Figure 5.1.
Charlotte and Yuwen having a discussion about children's play.
                                   CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 62

         Charlotte: The children are enjoying playing together. What should I do next? I am unsure where
         to start observing children's play.
         Yuwen: Remember, you're always observing and thinking about children's play: at the beginning
         of the day when they arrive, when we're joining their play and when children exit the Conceptual
         PlayWorld.
         Charlotte: Thanks, can I ask the children questions while I observe them?
         Yuwen: Yes, of course! Like you are having a conversation with me, you can also discuss ideas with
         the children.

Through observing children's play you can also discuss, clarify and ask questions to children about what
they're playing. In Chapter 2, a discussion of your pedagogical role was discussed and the multiple
positions you take when joining children's play. For instance, when you observe, you are outside the
imaginary situation - and inside the imaginary situation taking a role - in both roles, you continue to
observe children's play. This conversation occurred when Charlotte was asking questions to the children
and having a mutual dialogue with them.

Figure 5.2.

63 | CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

         Charlotte: I really like what you are building with your friend.
         Child: Yes, thanks.
         Charlotte: I wonder if you need my help?
         Child: Yes, you can bring more tools to help us build a farm for the chickens.
Charlotte smiled and continued to observe children's play, while they were building a farm together for the
                                   CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 64

chickens. She realised that she could observe from the `outside' and `inside' joining them in their play. She
continued reflecting and observing children's interests in the Conceptual PlayWorld.

       Practice Reflection 5.2: Think about your current Conceptual PlayWorld. What questions
       do you have about making observations that you can discuss with your mentor teacher?
       What new ideas have you learned when asking questions to children when they're playing
       (inside and outside their play)? Record your ideas in your Fleer's Conceptual
       PlayWorld thinking book.

Digital Technologies: Gaining Children's Voice and
Permission

Digital technologies support teacher's documentation of children's play (Ridgway et al., 2015). It is very
important that before you decide to record images of children, you ask for permission from parents or
guardians. You also need the children's consent when recording an image. For example, when taking a
photo of children's faces, you need to be sensitive so that children feel comfortable with you. Remember
that you are developing a relationship with your mentor and children during placement, so you are
building `trust'. Children will become more comfortable with you recording images of them if this trust is
built.
For example, Charlotte had to learn about the early learning centre's policy about photographing children.
Recording images also involved listening to children's verbal and non-verbal language (e.g. gestures).
Charlotte discussed digital technologies with her mentor, Yuwen.

Figure 5.3.
Charlotte and Yuwen discussing how to use the early learning centre's iPAD.
65 | CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

         Charlotte: I wanted to check with you if I can record images of children's play.
         Yuwen: Yes, you can take images of children. As part of our early learning centre's policy, we have
         asked families permission to take images using our early learning centre's iPad.
         Charlotte: That's great, thank you. Can I share them on Facebook or Instagram?
         Yuwen: Thanks for asking how you can use children's images. We exclusively use these images for
         documenting children's learning in the early learning centre. We don't use social media to share
         children's images. We are protecting children's and parent's privacy. Please remember that we use
         the early learning centre's iPad to record images, not personal devices like your mobile phone.
         Charlotte: Ok, I will record images using the early learning centre's iPad. Then, I will share them
         with you.
         Yuwen: Yes, remember, when taking photos, you also have to listen to the children.
         Charlotte: Do you mean asking them if I can take their photos?
         Yuwen: Yes, you can ask them and check how they provide consent to you to record their image at
         the moment, observing their non-verbal language, for example, face expressions and body language.
                                   CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 66

         Charlotte: Thanks, this is very helpful. I'll keep this in mind when observing them.

Recording images is important for capturing children's learning and also for listening to children's verbal
and non-verbal language. As discussed by Charlotte and Yuwen, you might need to check which devices
you can use to take photographs or images. In this case, Yuwen told Charlotte to only use the early learning
centre's devices (e.g. iPad). You must make decisions and reflect on your intentions when taking images
of children. The images you take of children can support you in `capturing' an important moment of
children's learning. Intentional observation provides a framework for reflecting on your intentions of `why'
you (or others in the early learning centre) are capturing a moment in time and `why' it is important in
relation to children's play and learning. Visual images are a resource for teachers to inquire about children's
individual and collective learning.

       Practice Reflection 5.3: Discuss with your mentor teacher if you have consent to record
       images of children. Think about how you will ask children for permission to take record
       images, and what questions you would ask them. Record your ideas in your Fleer's
       Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

What is Assessment?

We have discussed intentional observation as an important tool for reflecting on children's engagement
in Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds. Fleer (2017) discusses assessment practices to implement in your
Conceptual PlayWorlds: assessment through play, assessment of play and assessment for play. The
following visual model will help you think about the different moments to assess children's learning (see
Figure 5.4).

                                                                          Note. Based on
                                                                          concepts from
                                                                          Fleer (2017).

A. Assessment THROUGH Play - Focus on What Children Know

Before planning a Conceptual PlayWorld, you must consider children's interests in play. Once these
different interests appear, assessable moments in play occur when children are fully engaged in Conceptual
PlayWorlds. According to Fleer (2017), an assessable moment is a layered process. The teacher observes,
captures or documents and analyses children's learning when they are fully engaged in play activities.
The assessment moment can instigate planning for new problems to solve and help you think, with
children, about new concepts to be introduced. While children are playing, you will have possibilities for
teachable moments. A teachable moment is a moment for timely instruction where you can offer a new
provocation for children to engage in Conceptual PlayWorlds.
Through mutual dialogue with your mentor, discuss the following questions to guide your thinking:

   what do children know and can do in play? (intentional observation)
   what is being captured or documented in order to make judgements about children's play?

      (assessment moment)
   what new provocations can I introduce to engage in children's play? (teachable moments)

       Practice Reflection 5.4. Record your answers to these questions in your Fleer's
       Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book. Discuss with your mentor teacher your thoughts for
       further reflection.

B. Assessment OF Play - Focus on Children's Play and Learning
                                   CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 68

In relation to the assessment of play, the focus is on what children are playing, therefore, there is a need to
pay attention to children's individual and collective imaginary situations. You will need to focus awareness
on different groups of children, and the resources needed for their play. While doing this, you will also focus
on their learning, taking into consideration the following:

   A detailed account of how children are conceptualising a play problem.
   How children determine how to solve the play problem and the content of the problem in Fleer's

      Conceptual PlayWorld.
   The relationships occurring between peers while children are engaging socially with others.

In the following chapters, you will learn how children can be introduced to different concepts, such as
mathematical concepts (Chapter 7). In assessing children's play and learning, you will need to explain and
describe how you capture children's play in your observations. We now focus on how you assess children's
cognitive-creative and socio-emotional knowledge (Fleer, 2017). A detailed account is explained below.

   Cognitive-creative knowledge involves:
          children's learning of complex and richer vocabulary
          children's play involvement with peers
          children's longer attention span, being more engrossed in their play
          children creating imaginary situations, which leads to greater creativity
          children demonstrating more curiosity and asking more questions and information about
            something in particular
          children's ability to take on another person's perspective (empathy), for example, on new
            characters
          children's higher forms of problem-solving, providing creative solutions to problems.

   Socio-emotional knowledge involves:
          children demonstrating higher levels of cooperation
          children managing emotions by communicating how they feel in a positive way
          children communicating effectively their dislikes, leading to reducing aggression
          more effective teacher management of the group and time runs smoothly.

       Practice Reflection 5.5: Charlotte discusses the intentional observations with Yuwen.
       Yuwen asks her to identify and assess a focus child's cognitive-creative and socio-emotional
       knowledge. Record your answers to this in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds thinking
       book. Discuss with your mentor teacher your thoughts for further reflection.
69 | CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

C. Assessment FOR play - Framing, Extending and Supporting
Children's Play

Charlotte has made notes of children's interests (assessment through play) and shares them with Yuwen
and they discuss these together. Then, Charlotte made some notes on the assessment of children's play in
relation to their cognitive-creative and socio-emotional learning. She was surprised about how much she
has learned about children's learning in Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds. For example, children's knowledge
about chickens

Next, she focuses on the assessment for play - to think further about how she can extend children's
learning.

In the assessment for play, you will be thinking of continuous assessment of children's learning to frame,
extend and further support children. You will enter and exit children's imaginary situations in Fleer's
Conceptual PlayWorlds. For this, you will need to consider `what is going on' at the moment of play, during
and at the end of the Conceptual PlayWorlds.

Assessment for play involves:

   building play complexity and entering children's play
   teachers assessing what is going on in children's play (formative assessment) as well at the end of the

      Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds (summative assessment).

In Conceptual PlayWorlds, children's and teacher's interests and ideas are developed, and you will need to
see the possibilities and potential of children's play. Formative assessment is a continuous process occurring
through and of play assessment, while summative assessment assesses play at the end of a Conceptual
PlayWorld, for example, how children are problem-solving ideas and learning new concepts. Summative
assessment celebrates children's achievements and success in Conceptual PlayWorlds.

Through mutual dialogue with your mentor, discuss the following questions to guide your thinking:

   what is going on during children's play that you can further support or extend for children's learning
      (think of their cognitive-creative and socio-emotional knowledge)?

   describe the different problems children are trying to solve in the Conceptual PlayWorld and
      describe their learning (remember you can use images to support your ideas).

   in terms of problem-solving, think about the complexity of children creating new problems or if
      they need your support in creating new problems.

   celebrate children's new learning and friendships.
   think about what other Conceptual PlayWorlds you can think about to support children's newly

      developed ideas.
                             CHAPTER 5: CAPTURING LEARNING: ASSESSMENT IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 70

  Practice Reflection 5.6: Review your notes and consider your observations of children's
  play and learning. Consider how you can further extend children's learning. Record your
  answers to this in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book. Discuss your thoughts
  for further reflection with your mentor teacher.

Conclusion

In this chapter, for colleagues Charlotte (preservice teacher) and Yuwen (mentor teacher),
mutual dialogue is an important pedagogical strategy for assessing children's play. There are
multiple layers for assessing children's play and learning: assessment through play, of play and
for play that involves you and the children.

CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A
CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

   Leigh Disney

   Chapter goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn:
           how to teach mathematics in play from within the imaginary play of children
           how to plan a Conceptual PlayWorld for mathematics
           how to pedagogical position yourself within the imaginary situation

Introduction - Jumping into the imaginary situation

Within this chapter, we will continue to follow our preschool teachers, Charlotte, the student teacher,
and Yuwen, an experienced teacher. This chapter will focus on embedding mathematics concept learning
into children's imaginative play using Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld model. The chapter will present
a case study of Charlotte and Yuwen working collaboratively with their preschool children to solve a
mathematical measurement-related problem.
However, before returning to our protagonists, it's important to consider how we think about teaching
mathematics to young children, a topic that Charlotte has given much thought to. When Charlotte
reflects on her experience of learning mathematics, she thinks about the drill-and-practice style from her
own primary school experience. Some of our earliest memories of mathematics reflect countless hours
spent completing worksheets or working on pre-designed worded problems. Charlotte worries that such
practices will not fit within a play-based program as delivered within Yuwen's program.
73 | CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

       Practice reflection 6.1: What are your earliest memories of learning mathematics? Like
       Charlotte, do you recall endless worksheets or a range of mathematics manipulatives (i.e.
       counting blocks, shapes, etc.)? Or, do you recall mathematics embedded in your play during
       everyday experiences (i.e. making biscuits with your parents, measuring quantities and
       making shapes)? Would you suggest that these experiences were playful? Do you think
       mathematics concepts can be intentionally taught during play? Reflect on your memories
       and thoughts in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Supporting mathematics learning in the teaching
program

During planning time, Yuwen and Charlotte discuss the following week's teaching program. Charlotte
notices that the mathematical focus is on the concept of measurement. Yuwen has already embedded
several mathematical experiences into her program, mainly focusing on length measurement. This gives
Charlotte an idea:

         Charlotte: Yuwen, can we teach mathematical concepts using the Conceptual PlayWorld model?
         Yuwen: Absolutely! What did you have in mind?
         Charlotte: Well, I can see that in your teaching program, you focus on length measurement.
         Yuwen: Do you remember the 5 characteristics of the Conceptual PlayWorld? Do you still have a
         copy of the Conceptual PlayWorld planning proforma?
         Charlotte: I sure do! And I have a great story in mind!

Like other conceptual areas, when planning a Conceptual PlayWorld around mathematics, the chosen
story must have a complex plot and a dramatic dimension. There are multiple mathematics-related
children's books specifically related to mathematical concepts, such as The Doorbell Rang by Pat Hutchins,
which uses the notion of sharing to explain an equal distribution. Another is One is a Snail, Ten is a Crab
by April Pulley Sayre and Jeff Sayre, a book focusing on number sense and skip counting. While great books
for teaching children about specific mathematics concepts, stories like this do not always contain complex
                                                                    CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 74

plots or a range of characters that lend to the multi-layered problem-solving scenarios inherent to Fleer's
Conceptual PlayWorld. Therefore, choose your story carefully.

Research reading 6.1: See Chapter 1 for detailed information about the 5 characteristics of Fleer's
Conceptual PlayWorld model, and Appendix B for an example of a planning proforma designed for infant
and toddler children.

       Practice reflection 6.2: What other books can you think of that may have inherent
       mathematical connections yet involve complex plots and a dramatic dimension? Record your
       ideas in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Charlotte proposes her choice of story:
         Charlotte: The book I think would be great is Room on the Broom by Julia Donaldson. As we
         get closer to Halloween, I have heard the children talking about witches and fairies and know they
         are very interested in this imaginative play. Plus, when I think about the book's title, I think a link
         could be made to length measurement. You know, when we think about `room', because, in the
         story, the broom needs to be fixed after getting broken. This got me thinking: how long would a
         broom need to be to fit everyone?
         Yuwen: Great! I like many of Julia Donaldson's books and think your choice will work well. What
         I also appreciate is that you have considered the children's interests. I've also noticed the children
         getting excited about Halloween. This shows that you have thought about the first fundamental
         characteristic of the Conceptual PlayWorld.

Charlotte and Yuwen then spend time planning the Conceptual PlayWorld, considering each characteristic
and how the concept of measurement can be learned within the meaningful conditions they intended to
create. When designing the space, the teachers decided that the children would need room to move and
75 | CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

manipulatives to work with. Adjacent to the main teaching space, the preschool had a large area where they
decided to strategically place large items such as blocks (Figure 6.1), sticks, and milk crates so that when
the children were deciding how to make a broom, they would have resources to choose from. The teachers
also created badges of frogs, dogs, cats, and witches so the children would be helped to identify with their
character roles within the Room on the Broom story.

                                                            come in a range of
                                                            sizes, shapes, and

Between the main teaching space and the large area was a door. Yuwen found a witch's hat in the storeroom
and stuck it to the door to act as the entry and exit to the Conceptual PlayWorld space (see Figure 6.2).

Situating mathematics into the storyline

The children each chose a character role before entering the Conceptual PlayWorld space for the first time.
Charlotte decided to play the role of `Itchy Witchy', and as the children entered the Conceptual PlayWorld
space, she would say a magic chant and wave a magic wand to support them as they entered through the
door with the witch's hat (Figure 6.3). Yuwen decided to take on the character role of a dog, calling herself
77 | CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

`Detective Dog' because she was always carrying around a notepad and pen (Figure 6.3). Yuwen did this
during the Conceptual PlayWorld so she could first, stay in a character role and second, have easy access to
documentation materials to note what the children said and did during the Conceptual PlayWorld. In this
way, Yuwen was engaged in authentic documentation practices.
Figure 6.3.
The teachers in their character roles.

Research reading 6.2: See Chapter 5 for insights into assessment practices capturing learning within the
Conceptual PlayWorld.
After reading the story of Room on the Broom to the children, the teachers were keen to discover what aspect
of the story the children were interested in and whether they could identify any problems that needed to be
fixed. Much to the teacher's delight, the children immediately identified that the broom needed to be fixed,
and thus, the conceptual problem was formed: How long do we need to make the broom when we fix it?
                                                                    CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 78

To help dramatise the conceptual problem, the teachers crafted a letter, which they said was from `Ritchy
Witchy', the sister of Itchy Witchy (played by Charlotte). The letter (Figure 6.4) invited Itchy Witchy and
all her animal friends (played by the children) to come to Ritchy Witchy's house for a party, but they needed
to come together on one broom.

The letter created the dramatised problem of creating a broom that could fit all the characters. We now pick
up the Conceptual PlayWorld between the teachers and children as they collectively solve the problem, and
we will explain how the teachers pedagogically positioned themselves to support the children during the
Conceptual PlayWorld experience (see Chapter 5 for more information on pedagogical positioning).

Considering your pedagogical positioning to best
79 | CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

support children's mathematical discovery

As the children worked together, they used the large building blocks (see Figure 6.1) to create a new broom,
where each block was a seat for a character. As this was a collective experience, the children were never
in the primordial-we position, as all the children were building within the storyline of the Conceptual
PlayWorld and understood their roles. As the children worked, Charlotte interacted with them, asking
them simple questions and getting into the character role of a witch. During this time, both teachers
were in the under position and the children in the above. In this way, the children and teachers made an
emotional connection with their characters, which led to the children's motivation to eventually solve the
conceptual problem of making the broom long enough to fit all their friends.

While the children were certainly building a structure using the large blocks that was straight and
resembling a new broom, many were more interested in their own character roles rather than solving
the mathematical problem. For example, the frogs were having a conversation about needing water on
their delicate skin for the long journey; hence, they needed a tap attached to their seat. At that moment,
Charlotte feared that the mathematics concept of learning about length measurement was being lost, but
then, a breakthrough occurred (Figure 6.5).

Figure 6.5.

Charlotte has a breakthrough in how to support children's mathematics thinking - using multiple pedagogical
positions.
                                                                    CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 80

Charlotte noticed how Yuwen was positioned, interacting with the children, seemingly noticing
everything, and then asking a pointed question:

         Yuwen: [Spotting 3 blocks joined together, asked the entire group] I wonder how many of our friends
         can fit on this section of the broom?
         Charlotte: That's such a good question Detective Dog, I'm not sure. Can anyone help figure this
         problem out?
         Child A: [Walking over and pointing at each block] There are 1, 2, 3 blocks.
         Charlotte: So, how many of our friends will fit on this section of the new broom?
         Child B & C: [In unison] Three! Three friends!
         Yuwen: So, how many blocks long does are new broom need to be? How many friends are here
         with us today?
In this scenario, the teachers had moved from being below the children to being equal with the children.
They were now collectively problem-solving together, focusing on solving the mathematical problem
81 | CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD

originally presented in the letter from Ritchy Witchy, to make one broom that could fit everyone to fly
to the birthday party. The children had to determine how many characters needed to fit onto the broom,
which would let us know how long the broom needed to be. Yuwen (still in her character role as Detective
Dog) asked the children to sit in a circle so that one of the children could easily count all of the friends in
the group. At this stage, the teachers began moving into the above position. They were showing children
strategies that they could use to help solve the conceptual problem.

         Child A: [After moving around the circle and tapping each friend on the head, declared] 16, we have
         16 friends.

         Yuwen: 16; wow! That's so many friends that need to fit onto the broom. So, if one block can only
         fit one friend, how many blocks do we need?

         Multiple children: 16! 16 blocks!

         Yuwen: Oh, I think I need to write this down in my Detective Dog book!

         Charlotte: [Trying to capitalise on the teaching moment, in the above position, asked Child A] How
         do you know we need 16 blocks?

         Child A: [Looking a little unsure of themselves] Everyone needs a seat...

         Child B: [Stood up with a loud and enthusiastic voice] Because one block can only fit one friend!

         Yuwen: According to my Detective Dog book, we have 16 friends. So, how many seats do we need
         on our broom, everybody?

         Whole group: [Very loudly] 16!

         Charlotte and Yuwen: That's right!

The children then busily worked together to build a broom that was 16 blocks long. Once the children
thought they were finished, the teachers asked them to count how long it was. The children then
collectively counted the length of the broom. The first attempt was 14 blocks long. The children then
added 3 more blocks. Oh no, too long! The children finally made a broom of 16 blocks, and the group took
off on their new broom to Ritchy Witchy's birthday party! This also acted as a transition into lunchtime,
so the group exited the Conceptual PlayWorld setting.

In this way, the teachers had moved from the under (initially building an emotional connection to
characters) to the equal (getting the children thinking mathematically) and finally to the above position
(demonstrating mathematical problem-solving techniques) within the Conceptual PlayWorld experience.
                                                                    CHAPTER 6: MATHEMATICS IN A CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD | 82

It is also important to note that the children were never in an independent position. This was because the
teachers were inside the children's play, fully aware of what the children were doing and part of the play
scenario. Each pedagogical positioning allows the Conceptual PlayWorld to continue and grow, motivating
children to solve mathematics problems through imaginative scenarios and their character roles.

       Practice reflection 6.4: While the focus was on measurement, what other mathematics
       concept could you see happening in the Room on the Broom Conceptual PlayWorld?

Charlotte was so pleased with how the Conceptual PlayWorld had run, and while there were moments of
worry, both Yuwen and Charlotte agreed that the Conceptual PlayWorld had met their teaching agenda
and allowed for conceptual learning beyond their initial expectation.

   Conclusion

     In this chapter, Charlotte and Yuwen planned and implemented a Conceptual PlayWorld as part
     of their teaching program to specifically teach mathematics to children. By taking different
     pedagogical positions, both teachers could take different roles within the collective play to allow
     children to be mathematical problem solvers and teach specific mathematical concepts.

       Practice reflection 6.5: Bring together the elements of your Fleer's Conceptual
       PlayWorlds thinking book. Hopefully, not only can you help Charlotte on her journey, but
       your thinking will provide you with a springboard for embedding mathematics learning in

       Conceptual PlayWorlds. Carefully consider pedagogical positioning to engage children
       throughout the Conceptual PlayWorld to create an emotional connection to their character
       roles and, ultimately, solve the mathematical conceptual problem.

CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD:
FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY
LEARNING

   Janet Scull

   Chapter Goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn about:
           children's play-based language and literacy learning
           textual features that foster children's language and literacy learning
           how to use Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld to foster literacy learning.

Introduction - Jumping into the Imaginary Situation

This chapter continues to follow the learning journey of Charlotte as she explores children's play-based
language and literacy learning. Co-planning with Yuwen, her mentor teacher, they discuss how they can
create an authentic context to enhance children's literacy learning using Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld.

Exploring the Research

To ensure her practice is well grounded in research, Yuwen suggests Charlotte review the research that
considers how play supports children's literacy learning, with a focus on language and early writing.
Reading to children is a well-established practice in early childhood. It builds the linguistic resources and
print awareness skills children need as they learn to read (Dickinson et al., 2012). Alongside learning
about print, book reading creates opportunities for children to hear the pattern and sounds of words
with opportunities `to play with words the beginning of a more sophisticated understanding of how
language works' (Raban, 2018, p.57). Moreover, the language of text often moves beyond conversational
85 | CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD: FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY LEARNING

speech. Through listening to printed text read aloud, children are introduced to new vocabulary and begin
to extend their understanding and expectations of the syntactic complexity of written language (Raban
& Scull, 2023). Yet, equally important are the intertextual conversations that occur as texts are read to
children. As active interlocutors, children build their comprehension of the story and are encouraged to use
words in new contexts, which promote the construction of meaning outside their own experiences (Massey
et al., 2008). The shared narrative builds shared understandings and language that can be reinforced and
extended through talk and play.

Play also creates authentic opportunities for text production and it is in such moments that children can
develop and extend their early conceptions of writing (Peterson & Rajendram, 2019). During and through
their play, children become composers of text as they assign meaning to their drawing and mark-making,
demonstrating a clear awareness of the interconnectedness between the symbolic nature of oral and written
language (Scull & O'Grady, 2022). Likewise, we know the importance of the social contexts that shape and
surround the texts produced and how children's interaction with adults advances literacy learning (Dyson,
1999; Compton-Lilly, 2014). As adults write for and with children, concepts such as the permanency of
text and the conventions used to encode meaning are further developed. Just as when reading to children,
adults engaging children in writing model the discourse patterns of written texts, characterised as more
integrated, detached, and explicit than oral language (Raban & Scull, 2023). Educators need to see and
highlight the links across the modes of literacy as they support children to apply their early literacy learning
to an increasing range of contexts and to extend their understanding of more complex texts in reading and
writing.

15 pages doi:10.1155/2012/60280

Selecting the Text

Convinced of the opportunities play-based literacy provides, Charlotte was keen to continue her
explorations. However, the first step was to select a text that allowed her to engage the children in the
problem-based premise that underpins Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld while meeting curriculum
expectations and priorities. Educators in Australia must extend and enrich children's learning guided
by the national curriculum framework Belonging, Being and Becoming: The Early Years Framework for
                       CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD: FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY LEARNING | 86

Australia (ADGE 2022). This document informs `educational programs and practices that are place-based
and relevant to that community' (ADGE, 2022. p.4).
Drawing on the children's recent interest in Australian animals and the curriculum expectation that
children are connected to and contribute to their world, becoming socially responsible with respect for the
environment, Yuwen encouraged Charlotte to explore the basic needs of living things (AGDE, 2022). This
could be achieved as children learn to care for native animals and protect and improve the environment for
wildlife with connections to the concepts of environmental sustainability. Further, this would coincidently
engage the children in early literacy concepts to develop children's understanding of the communicative
intent of texts and advance their symbolic awareness of print and written language.
With this in mind, Charlotte recalled her enjoyment of reading Wombat Stew (Vaughan & Lofts, 1984)
and decided to check the suitability of this text regarding the five characteristics of a Conceptual PlayWorld
for the intentional teaching of STEM (Fleer, 2022).
Both Yuwen and Charlotte agreed that the children would relate to the drama of the story and develop
empathy for the characters as their play involved saving the wombat. The plot also introduces a new
problem: how to continue caring for the rescued wombat. This would engage the children in STEM
concepts related to developing an understanding of natural worlds and sustainable ecologies for Australia's
native animals.

However, with a language and literacy focus, it was important for Charlotte to better understand the
linguistic structure and features of the text as a springboard for children's learning. Working together,
Yuwen supported Charlotte in conducting a linguistic analysis of the text to foster children's language
and literacy development. Together, they examined the text, focusing on elements particular to the young
children in their care.

Features of the text

Phonological Awareness

Wombat Stew draws attention to the patterning and sounds of language using rhyme, rhythm and
repetition as key linguistic elements. Most obvious is the repeated refrain with rhythm emphasised when
read with a cadence reflective of a sing-song pattern.

Wombat stew,
Wombat stew,
Gooey, brewy,
Yummy, chewy,
Wombat stew.

Rhyme is prominent throughout the text. In addition to the rhyming pairs above, other playful examples
include `crunchy, munchy and lunchy', also `spicy and nicey'. The patterning of language is also apparent
through alliteration, the repetition of the same sound at the start of a sequence of words often used to
provide a lyrical effect. Examples in the text include `bubbling billy' and `creepy crawlies'.
                       CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD: FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY LEARNING | 88

Vocabulary

The text contains vocabulary that may be new to young children, including ambling, brewing, graceful,
fluttered and scribble.

Narrative Structure

Wombat Stew follows the grammar of a traditional narrative. The story commences with an orientation
that introduces the setting as the billabong and the central characters, the dingo and wombat. As a problem
to overcome, the complication is that the dingo has captured the wombat to make wombat stew, followed
by a series of actions by different animals to trick the dingo with the resolution or problem solved as the
wombat is saved.

       Practice Reflection 7.1: Using Charlotte's analysis of Wombat Stew as a model, complete a
       linguistic analysis of a text of your choice. What text elements will you focus on as you read
       and discuss the story? Record your answers in your Fleer's Conceptual Playworld thinking
       book.

Addressing Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld Pedagogical
Characteristics

With the text selected Yuwen and Charlotte considered the remaining Conceptual PlayWorld pedagogical
characteristics (Fleer, 2022). To guide their decisions and assist with their planning they used the template
found on Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld website .
Together, they identified a discrete space in the garden for an imaginary billabong where the story and new
problems could be played out.
They agreed that the refrain from Wombat Stew would signal entering and exiting the Conceptual
PlayWorld, so Charlotte set about recording this for the children.
The problems to be solved would be two-fold; first, they would follow the story elements to rescue the
wombat, prompting the new problem of how to keep Wombat safe and well, with strong connections to
the natural world and ecosystems for food and habitat.
Regarding play roles, Charlotte and Yuwen agreed to participate as play partners, most often equally
89 | CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD: FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY LEARNING

present in the imaginary play space, trying to help Wombat stay safe and well. However, outside of this,
they will act as models and guides, facilitating children's learning of STEM and literacy concepts.

Implementing the Conceptual PlayWorld and Amplifying
Literacy

The following sections highlight how Yuwen and Charlotte implemented a Conceptual PlayWorld using
Wombat Stew to intentionally engage children in language and literacy learning. Each instructional context
below describes the carefully organised ways literacy concepts were advanced. Importantly, these occurred
within the STEM problem-based play setting.
                       CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD: FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY LEARNING | 90

Book Reading

The text Wombat Stew was read a number of times throughout the Conceptual PlayWorld, with the
children becoming more familiar with the text with each reading. Reading occurred with the whole group
and on other occasions with small groups of children who requested to have the text reread. The book was
available for the children to read independently. Frequent reading fostered familiarity with the text and
created opportunities for the children to actively contribute to the reading process, joining in as the refrain
`Wombat Stew, Wombat Stew' was repeated. The children could see themselves as readers, prompting
positive attitudes and a sense of achievement as they were apprenticed into a community of readers.

                           provided by the
                           author.

With familiarity with the text increasing with each reading, Charlotte engaged the children in shared
reading, inviting their participation in conversations about, around and beyond the text (Gonzalez et al.
2014). Children were asked to predict the next animal and what they would contribute to the Wombat
stew. They were also invited to imagine other animals that could be included in the story and what else
could be added to the stew. Questions such as `What will the dingo do now?' and `Will he enjoy the stew?'
created opportunities for children to produce language at an appropriate linguistic level while promoting
conceptual challenge as new ideas were explored (Rowe & Snow, 2019).
91 | CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD: FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY LEARNING

A similar conversational style was used as word meanings were reinforced or introduced. Within the
meaningful context of story reading, Charlotte described a `billabong' as a pool of water in the bush, with
the `bank' at the water's edge. Children were encouraged to `amble' like a platypus and arch their necks
`gracefully' like the emu.

Charlotte also engaged the children in playful word interactions to stress the rhyme in the text. They
repeated `goey' and `chewy' and enjoyed finding and inventing new words that followed the same rhyming
pattern. On other occasions, Charlotte paused her reading inviting the children to build on the rhyming
sequence and complete the text `crunchy, munchy...for my lunchy' and `hot and spicy, oh so...nicey'.

The Wombat Stew text was not the only opportunity for children to develop understandings of reading.
The Conceptual PlayWorld included signs such as `This way to the billabong' as environmental print. The
message received from the wombat requesting the children's help was also prepared as an enlarged text, with
this read with and by the children.

       Practice Reflection 7.2: Working with a book you have selected, plan a series of prompts
       to invite children into shared reading. Your interactions should engage the children as active
       partners, focusing on the characters, the sequence of events and the language features of
       the text.

Modelled Writing

From her review of the research literature, Charlotte was aware of the importance of engaging children in
drawing and writing experiences and was keen to involve the children as early writers. Modelled writing was
selected as, through this approach, Charlotte could demonstrate the conventions and discourse patterns of
written texts. While mindful this also needed to connect to and advance children's play.

Yuwen and Charlotte planned for the children to role-play the story the first time they entered the
PlayWorld. This involved choosing an animal character as they entered the play space and leaving a `stew'
by the billabong for the dingo so the wombat would be safe. To support the play, Charlotte decided to list
the characters from the book and record what each animal added to the stew. As the list was created, the
children could recall the animals, demonstrating their understanding of the sequence of events. Charlotte
also found opportunities to draw the children's attention to early print concepts, such as the left-to-right
serial order of text and their knowledge of the alphabetic principle of matching letters and sounds.
                        CHAPTER 7: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD: FOSTERING LANGUAGE AND LITERACY LEARNING | 92

The children eagerly contributed to the writing process, and Charlotte fostered knowledge of letters in two
ways. She asked the children to spell words by reading from the list (what letters can you see in dingo?). She
asked the children to suggest letters that can be used to record the names of the animals (what letters do I
need to write emu?). Once composed, the list served as a prompt for the children's role-play and became a
reference point for children's engagement in the Conceptual PlayWorld. By drawing children's attention to
specific features of the text, including, in this case, spelling, letter formation and letter/sound relationships,
they gained a greater understanding of writing and what's required of writers.

                                             to the stew:

The children were also encouraged to document their thoughts, feelings and insights after each Conceptual
PlayWorld experience. This often occurred through the children's drawings and then talking about their
ideas. Charlotte and Yuwen recorded the text for the children, following the Draw, Talk, Write and Share
protocol (Mackenzie, 2022). In this way, they assisted the children in creating a permanent record of their
imaginative play and learning. As the educators transcribed children's thoughts, they were helping children
to bridge the gap between oral language and printed text. These texts communicated the children's ideas
to a broader audience, capturing the depth and breadth of their thinking, which they would be unable to
share if constrained by their own writing abilities (Halliday, 2016).

       Write (and share) process and consider how this can supplement children's learning as they

       Playworld thinking book.

Drawing and Early Writing

Beyond modelling, Yuwen and Charlotte were keen for the children to see themselves as writers, so they
created occasions where writing was promoted as a social, shared experience. The children co-constructed
texts with the teachers, working together to produce texts. They were also encouraged to appropriate the
skills Yuwen and Charlotte modelled to produce texts independently, making conscious decisions to apply
or approximate the understanding of print demonstrated to new situations.

After rescuing the wombat, Yuwen and Charlotte assisted the children to learn more about what wombats
need for survival. Together, they accessed various books and websites. The knowledge gleaned from these
texts was collated on a large chart. Children's drawings and labels were pasted on the chart under the
following headings:

Habitat - Where wombats live
Diet - What wombats eat
Activities - What wombats do

The letter received from Wombat that stated he was hungry and asking if the children could make a
wombat stew for him to eat became the stimulus for the children to create and document a new recipe.
This consisted of the children's drawings and text, with the stew left by the billabong for the wombat to
enjoy when he woke that evening.

       Practice Reflection 7.4: What other opportunities can you think of to engage the children
       in drawing, mark-making and writing in the Wombat Stew PlayWorld? Record your
       thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

   Conclusion

     The Conceptual PlayWorld that Charlotte planned and implemented enabled her to learn more
     about supporting children's literacy learning through play. Reading to children continued to
     expose children to the complexities of written language. As she engaged children in a range of
     drawing and writing activities, working and problem-solving together to construct texts jointly,
     the children could see themselves as writers.

       Practice Reflection 7.5: In your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book, record the
       literacy learning opportunities the children experienced in the Wombat Stew Conceptual
       PlayWorld and the understandings about reading and writing that were advanced.

Return to the text you selected for linguistic analysis and design a Conceptual PlayWorld amplifying
children's literacy learning. List the opportunities for reading and writing to, with and by children within
the context of STEM learning.

CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL
PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING

   Kelly-Ann Allen

   Chapter Goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn:
           the importance of wellbeing in early childhood
           determinants of wellbeing in early childhood and the role of creativity, imagination, and
             play
           how to use Conceptual PlayWorlds to build wellbeing.

Introduction - Jumping into the Imaginary Situation

In this chapter, you will be working again with Charlotte, our student teacher, and Yuwen our experienced
teacher, to explore the concept of wellbeing. They are co-teaching in a primary school this time, but
another problem has arisen.
Charlotte has been reading the newspaper and found an alarming statistic, `Around 13.6% of children aged
4-11 are experiencing a mental health disorder'. She is puzzled and perplexed. How can this statistic be so
high? She needs your help once again.
In this chapter, you will explore Charlotte's latest problem around how she can better prepare herself
to build the wellbeing of the students she works with in a way that responds to the increasing number
of young children identified as having mental health problems. Your role is to work through a range of
solutions to help Charlotte and her mentor, Yuwen, as they plan and implement a Conceptual PlayWorld
to build wellbeing.
Don't forget to record your thoughts in your personalised Fleer'sConceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

However, before you launch into understanding how Conceptual PlayWorlds can be used to build
wellbeing, read Charlotte's perspective and find out why she is so alarmed about the rising rates of mental
health in young children.

Amid the bustle of the primary school where Charlotte now works, a statistic confronts her during a break
in the staff room: `Around 13.6% of children aged 4-11 are experiencing a mental health disorder'. The
numbers leap off the page of the newspaper, leaving her shocked. This new information gnaws at her all
day. How could such a large proportion of young children be grappling with mental health disorders? She
finds herself looking for guidance.
In this quest, she turns to her trusted mentor, Yuwen. Together, they ponder over how Conceptual
PlayWorlds - could be used to foster wellbeing proactively and preventively. It feels like a great approach,
but there's a hitch.
101 | CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING

Charlotte is a teacher, not a psychologist. She is willing and eager to make a difference. But a little voice
inside her head whispers some self-doubt. She questions if she's equipped or prepared to address mental
health and wellbeing in students. She feels daunted but decides to tackle this challenge head-on while
remembering, that she isn't alone - with YOU and Yuwen right beside her.

       Practice reflection 8.1: What do you think Charlotte's most significant barrier is to
       implementing Conceptual PlayWorlds for Wellbeing? Record your thoughts in your
       personalised Fleer'sConceptual PlayWorld thinking book. Note Charlotte's thinking and
       perceived preparation.

Diving into the Research

What is Wellbeing?

In education research and practice, the debate over whether it should be `wellbeing' or `well-being' - is
only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the complexity of this construct and how extensively it is
debated, theorised, conceptualised, and operationalised in the literature. It is no surprise, therefore, that
defining wellbeing can get pretty complicated. For the purpose of this chapter, the concept of wellbeing, is
best described using Professor Martin Seligman's weather metaphor (Seligman, 2011). Seligman, Director
of the Penn Positive Psychology Center and Zellerbach Family Professor of Psychology in the Penn
Department of Psychology, is a pioneering psychologist in positive psychology. He suggests that wellbeing
is akin to the weather - an ever-changing, dynamic, multifaceted concept in a constant state of change
- much like a child's perceived wellbeing. However, like the weather is an umbrella term for a range of
elements, such as temperature, rain, wind, UV rating, etc., wellbeing involves various domains such as
happiness, coping, gratitude, grit, optimism, hope and physical health. In the same way that it is nearly
impossible to capture the complexity of the weather with a single reading, it is also hard to measure a child's
wellbeing based on just a single score. This is because wellbeing is multifaceted and complex and what
influences wellbeing can be unique and different for each child.

When working with younger children on concepts concerned with wellbeing, one important consideration
is how they understand what this term means. Waters et al. (2022) investigated how five and six-year-
olds understand and foster their wellbeing through a `draw and write' methodology designed for young
participants. This approach required children to illustrate their responses to a question about wellbeing
and then explain their drawings. The results indicated that children at this age could understand and
comprehend the concept of wellbeing and identify a range of practical strategies that built their wellbeing,
like listening to music, receiving a hug, eating a lollipop and playing. These findings were informative
in highlighting that young children are active participants in their own wellbeing and not merely passive
recipients.

The Importance of Wellbeing in Early Childhood

Despite the well-documented importance of wellbeing for children in the early years of schooling for
cognitive development, friendships and resilience (Bakken et al., 2017; Shoshani & Slone, 2017) and
particularly in terms of long-term outcomes in adulthood related to future mental health, employment and
general life satisfaction (Layard et al., 2014; Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
[OECD], 2020; Schoon et al., 2015), there is proportionately less information for educators on how they
can foster wellbeing in early childhood compared to that available for older children and adolescents.
Creativity, imagination and play allow young children to explore wellbeing concepts, while also potentially
contributing to their wellbeing. Important evidence for this emerges from the research that shows
engagement in creativity, play and imagination can contribute to wellbeing in childhood (Bungay & Vella-
Burrows, 2013; Howard & McInnes, 2013; Lee et al., 2020; Silvey et al., 2004). This may be because
                                                   CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING | 104

these factors allow children to express themselves, explore their feelings, interact with their peers, solve
problems and develop skills such as coping, all of which are vital elements of wellbeing. By integrating
wellbeing concepts within creative and imaginative play, educators can create engaging, student-driven and
age-appropriate learning experiences. This allows children to understand complex concepts of wellbeing
in a way that is relevant to them. Therefore, play-based approaches like Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds for
Wellbeing have immense potential to teach children about wellbeing and related concepts. Conceptual
PlayWorld provides a framework for educators to teach wellbeing. Educators who do not require
specialised qualifications or training. In fact, everything you need to know to deliver a Conceptual
PlayWorld is in this book!

       Practice reflection 8.2: Now that you understand the importance of wellbeing for young
       children, can you help Charlotte? How would you help her feel more equipped to use
       Conceptual PlayWorlds to build wellbeing? What could have stopped her despite being
       alarmed by rising rates of mental illness? Record your answers in your Fleer's Conceptual
       Playworld thinking book.

A Conceptual PlayWorld for Wellbeing

Conceptual PlayWorlds that build wellbeing share similarities with other playworlds in their design and
implementation. However, they emphasise building in problem scenarios, discussion points,
psychoeducational opportunities, and social and emotional learning opportunities that contribute to
young children's wellbeing. Both playworlds are rooted in constructing immersive, engaging, narrative-
driven environments that allow children to explore certain concepts and ideas through play. Playworlds
encourage children to engage in imaginative scenarios, problem-solving, and social interactions, providing
opportunities for wellbeing literacy.

When Conceptual PlayWorlds are designed specifically for wellbeing, they build in elements that directly
support the competencies, skills, opportunities, attributions and opportunities that help build wellbeing
and related concepts. Activities in these playworlds may be crafted to help children identify and express
their emotions, manage conflicts, build relationships and cope with challenges. The stories and narratives
chosen can depict characters dealing with emotions or adversity (however minor), and the discussions and
reflections can focus on learning social and emotional skills.
105 | CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING

In contrast, while other playworlds might incidentally contribute to children's wellbeing through
engagement and enjoyment, they may not explicitly focus on building specific social and emotional skills
or coping mechanisms. The primary focus of other playworlds may be on other concepts like mathematics
(see Chapter 6) or language and literacy (see Chapter 7). Therefore, the main difference lies not in the
structure of the playworlds but in the objectives, aims, and purpose as well as the specific experiences that
aimed to be fostered.

The model for building Conceptual PlayWorlds for Wellbeing follows the same model as a typical
playworld and is presented in Figure 8.4. It involves:

 1. Choosing a story;
 2. Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld for wellbeing;
 3. Planning how to jump into the story;
 4. Creating an authentic wellbeing problem; and
 5. Being a play partner. Considerations should be made as to how the learning objectives of the

      Conceptual PlayWorld for wellbeing can be sustained for the children.

Your role is to help Charlotte as she solves the challenge of planning and implementing a Conceptual
PlayWorld to build wellbeing for the first time.

Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld for Building Wellbeing
- Evidence Informed Model

Getting Prepared

Charlotte took a deep dive into the research on wellbeing and spent an hour or so reading the research. This
helped her understand a few things:

 1. Many teachers feel under equipped when it comes to teaching or even support the wellbeing of
      students (Mazzer & Rickwood, 2015; Shelemy et al., 2019). There are some teachers that feel this is
      not their role (Graham et al., 2011) while other teachers feel that their courses did not adequately
      prepare them (Reinke et al., 2011). Charlotte felt relieved she was not alone, but also thankful that
      the textbook her university set as a reading detailed enough information on how to build wellbeing
      in young children to give her the confidence to go further with her professional development.

 2. That proactive and preventive approaches to wellbeing are considered world-standard best-practices
      in addressing mental health problems in children and adolescence. Charlotte felt relieved to learn this
      and this provided her with the motivation to know she was on the right path.

 3. One resource that exist on how to use Conceptual PlayWorlds for Wellbeing is:

          Allen, K.A., Fleer, M., & McKinley, L. (2023). Conceptual playworlds for wellbeing: A practical
            resource for the lonely little cactus. Routledge.

          A companion to picture story book, The Lonely Little Cactus: A Story About Friendship, Coping
            and Belonging. The resource utilises the Conceptual PlayWorlds model by Professor Marilyn
            Fleer and applies it to wellbeing. It's designed to aid children between the ages of four and eight
            to tackle problems and comprehend wellbeing concepts via play.

          The guide works in tandem with The Lonely Little Cactus, which follows a lonesome desert
            cactus. It provides teachers and caregivers with richly illustrated scenarios and 20 distinct
            activities, enabling children to grasp wellbeing ideas through experiential learning. This
            resource directs users through various wellbeing activities, such as recognising emotions,
            developing coping mechanisms, cultivating friendships, fostering positive feelings, learning
            relaxation strategies, and promoting belonging and inclusion.

                                                                   Marilyn Fleer and
                                                                   Lara McKinley.
                                                                   Not for reuse

Charlotte also discovered there is an endless number of picture story books that are perfect for developing
into Conceptual PlayWorlds for wellbeing. Searching online she found resources that specifically listed
books about wellbeing concepts like happiness, friendships, togetherness and belongingness.
You will find a planning proforma for Conceptual PlayWorlds for Wellbeing in your Fleer's Conceptual
PlayWorld thinking book and a generic proforma of a Conceptual PlayWorld in Appendix B. This is the
planning framework that Yuwen introduced to Charlotte in their debrief in Chapter 1.

1. Choosing a Story

Charlotte spent a great deal of time and thought in selecting a book, The Lonely Little Cactus: A Story About
Friendship, Coping and Belonging. The book is targeted at 4 to 8-year-olds and tells the tale of a solitary
cactus in the desert. Throughout the story, the cactus interacts with various desert inhabitants and learns
how to navigate its feelings of loneliness. This book underlines that feelings of loneliness are universal and
can be dealt with effectively. It introduces children to different coping mechanisms and encourages them
to discover what works best for them. The book serves as a tool for teachers, support staff, mental health
                                                   CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING | 108

professionals, and parents in guiding children to comprehend and manage their emotions and build well-
being in young children.

       Yuwen was impressed, not only at Charlotte's planning but also by her willingness to engage in an
       area she felt less comfortable with. She said, `Charlotte, I can see your knowledge in this area has
       vastly improved. Your self-directed learning will be of great value to your professional development
       and your students'.

Charlotte had reframed her worries about feeling unequipped to feeling inquisitive and ready to take on
the challenge of building wellbeing in her students!

       how you might apply a Conceptual PlayWorld model to build wellbeing. What would be
       different from other Conceptual PlayWorlds? What would be the same? Identify some
       pedagogical characteristics that you are curious about and start a discussion about it in our
       private Facebook for Conceptual PlayWorlds.

Little/Allen-Fleer-McKinley/p/book/9781032073651

Charlotte shared her chosen book with Yuwen, who agreed with Charlotte that The Lonely Little Cactus
had useful components to teach wellbeing. The Lonely Little Cactus engages in various strategies to build
wellbeing, but also introduces a variety of characters along the way. The Little Cactus faces problems
and challenges, and the book provides drama and suspense that make it easy to work with for building
a Conceptual PlayWorld. Yuwen suggests to Charlotte that, on one hand, the book has important
psychoeducational components in terms of teaching coping strategies; and on the other hand, it has
important features to adapt to a Conceptual PlayWorld. Charlotte feels pleased that she has selected a great
book!

2. Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld Space

       Yuwen asked Charlotte where she will design her Conceptual PlayWorld space. `Easy', Charlotte
       says, `the desert!'.
       Yewen reminds Charlotte that not all playworlds need to take place in the same setting as the book,
       but then asks: `How will you transform a playground into a desert landscape, and how will it
       promote wellbeing among primary school children?'
       Charlotte explained her vision: `I see the playground as a blank canvas. To transform it into a desert,
       I will use sand, fabric, and cardboard to create dunes and cacti. We will have designated areas such as
       a `sand dune' and a `campground'. These areas will provide different opportunities outlined in the
       play scenario.'

Figure 8.7.
Charlotte imagines the playground as a desert

3. Planning How to Jump into the Story

Yuwen reminded Charlotte to think about how she planned to enter the Conceptual PlayWorld with the
children. Charlotte planned to take the class to the playground for the activity. In the playground was a
traditional climbing frame, but for the purpose of the playworld, Charlotte explained to Yuwen it would
111 | CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING

become a magical mythical time portal that the children could walk through and step straight into the hot,
dry, dusty desert where The Lonely Little Cactus takes place.

       Practice reflection 8.5: How would you design the imaginary space for the book you have
       selected? Record your answers in your Fleer's Conceptual Playworld thinking book.

       Yuwen enjoys Charlotte's idea and reinforces to her the importance of planning the entrance and
       exit. But Yuwen asked, `What role will the children play?'
       Charlotte had forgotten to think of that! Yuwen suggested that the children could play desert
       dwellers and take on roles of animals commonly found in the desert, like small desert frogs or
       characters in the story, such as the porcupine and the porcupine's friends.
       Charlotte loved that idea. She thought she could play the role of the Little Cactus in the upper
       position and the children could play the role of porcupines in the lower position.

       Practice reflection 8.6: Brainstorm a range of entry and exit routines for the book of your
       choosing. Record your ideas on your Conceptual PlayWorlds for Wellbeing proforma.

4. Creating an Authentic Wellbeing Problem

Yuwen asked to see Charlotte's planning proforma. She asked, `What authentic problem could they solve
together?'
Charlotte had clearly given this much thought! She had conceptualised the playworld for building
wellbeing to extend the story of The Lonely Little Cactus. The playworld was a great opportunity for The
Lonely Little Cactus, with the help of the porcupines, to help solve other challenges that might emerge.
                                                   CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING | 112

In The Lonely Little Cactus, the cactus had feelings like anger, worry and sadness because he felt lonely.
Loneliness can affect our wellbeing, but all children (and all people in fact!) face other worries or stresses. In
her research on coping (Frydenberg et al., 2014), Erica Frydenberg tells us that some of the biggest worries
faced by children (3-6 years) include:

   uncertainty in new situations
   separation from a significant adult
   rejection or not having a friend
   losing control (e.g., such as wetting oneself)
   being reprimanded or `getting in trouble'
   fear of the dark at night-time
   saying goodbye at school drop off
   trying new foods
   making decisions (e.g., who to play with, what to play)
   dealing with loss (e.g., broken toy or loss of a pet).

Research reading 8.2: Yeo, K., Frydenberg, E., Northam, E., & Deans, J. (2014). Coping with stress
among preschool children and associations with anxiety level and controllability of situations. Australian
Journal of Psychology, 66(2), 93-101. https://doi.org/10.1111/ajpy.12047

Charlotte explained to Yuwen that she thought that in the playworld, the children, as porcupines, could
enter the desert. But the first problem they face is that it is night-time! They had not been prepared. And it
is dark! In fact, so dark that they cannot see a thing! They could experience a range of feelings and emotions
and need to be able to spot them and identify them, but also cope with them to solve their problems. The
first problem the children will face is needing to find a light source! The Little Cactus could elicit ideas from
the porcupines on what they could do (of course, with their eyes closed!). Some children might suggest
torches, but it could be challenging because the children did not pack them. Others might suggest building
a fire, which is a great idea.

Someone might ask, `Did anyone bring marshmallows?' Thankfully, this is something the Little Cactus
always carries, and then the children as porcupines and Charlotte as the Little Cactus can stop for a
moment and share toasted marshmallows, relieved that they can see now that there is light.

But light was not the biggest problem! It turns out that cactuses do not like fire and all of a sudden, the
Little Cactus is losing their prickles because they are too warm next to the fire. One by one, they dropped
out. Oh no! Before the Little Cactus had time to respond, 10 had fallen onto the ground. He loved his
spikes, and now 10 of them were gone forever. He starts to cry.

       Practice reflection 8.7: What are the potential wellbeing concepts Charlotte is explaining
       to Yewen? Record your ideas in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorlds thinking book.

Charlotte has learnt that wellbeing concepts can be brought out creatively in imaginary situations as
children jump into the story of The Lonely Little Cactus. She also explained to Yuwen how she loved using
playworlds to build wellbeing because she did not have to feel equipped and expert in teaching wellbeing as
she was not teaching the concept explicitly. Rather, she was taking everyday scenarios like fear and loss and
helping to elicit ideas from children on how they cope.

       Practice reflection 8.8: In planning your Conceptual PlayWorld of your chosen story, what
       will be the authentic problem that arises? What concepts will act in service of building
       wellbeing through play? Record your ideas in the Conceptual PlayWorlds for Wellbeing
       proforma found in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

5. Being a Play Partner

This Conceptual PlayWorld for wellbeing creates multiple opportunities for the children to engage in
wellbeing concepts. Charlotte, as the Little Cactus, could begin the Conceptual PlayWorld in the upper
position, asking children to identify their feelings or possible feelings in the dark, brainstorming helpful
and unhelpful ways to cope, trying different coping strategies and working out the best way forward.
Possible prompt questions Charlotte could ask the children include:

       `How does being in the dark like this make you feel?'
       `Let's think of all the things we can do - no matter what they are.'
                                                   CHAPTER 8: USING CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO BUILD WELLBEING | 114

       `What are the helpful ways we can cope with this? What are the unhelpful ways?'
       `Have you ever had to cope with a scary situation before? What helped?'

Once the Little Cactus loses spikes, Charlotte can take on an under position with the children in a collective
upper position, providing insights into what she can do to feel better.
The children can offer ideas on how she can cope with the loss of her 10 spikes. They can continue talking
about helpful ways of coping (e.g., talking to a friend, asking an adult for help) and unhelpful ways of
coping (e.g., screaming, crying, rolling on the floor).
Returning to the upper position, Charlotte, as the cactus, can also draw from what helped her to cope last
time when there was no light or draw from the past coping strategies that worked for the Little Cactus in
the story.

       Yuwen asks Charlotte, `How do you think Conceptual PlayWorlds that build wellbeing differ from
       other Conceptual PlayWorlds?'

       Practice reflection 8.9: How do Conceptual PlayWorlds for wellbeing differ from other
       playworlds? Record your ideas in the Conceptual PlayWorlds for Wellbeing proforma found
       in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

From the perspective of young children, they will unlikely differentiate between playworlds targeting
various educational concepts, be it STEM, literacy or wellbeing. Instead, they will hopefully be immersed
in the narrative and the play. Their focus is not on the instructional goals but on the imaginative and
interactive elements that make the playworld engaging. This underscores the significance of using play as
an effective pedagogical tool for teaching complex concepts, including wellbeing. The child's involvement
in the narrative serves as a vehicle for learning, growth and development. All playworlds have potential to
create meaningful, memorable, and intrinsically motivating learning opportunities.

   Conclusion

     This chapter revisited Charlotte's journey in learning Conceptual PlayWorlds. Her ability to
     implement a Conceptual PlayWorld to build wellbeing was driven first by her willingness to
     embrace a proactive approach to mental health in the early years. She learnt that wellbeing is a
     core determinant of children's overall development and ability to handle adversity.
     The chapter highlighted how Conceptual PlayWorlds aimed at promoting wellbeing differ from
     other playworlds, but also share similarities. While all playworlds foster a form of learning,
     those designed specifically for wellbeing weave in elements that directly support emotional
     development and competencies like coping skills. Moreover, such playworlds not only equip
     children with knowledge but also provide them with strategies and tools to address real-life
     challenges, fostering their ability to cope with various situations.
     Despite feeling initially unprepared, Charlotte effectively used Conceptual PlayWorlds to
     enhance student wellbeing. Her learnings serve as an example of the power of educators in
     shaping children's mental health and how supporting wellbeing does not always require
     additional expertise or training.
     As we move forward in the book, it is essential to remember that the purpose of Conceptual
     PlayWorlds is not to replace the work of mental health professionals like psychologists but
     rather to complement it by embedding wellbeing-focused strategies into everyday learning
     scenarios. By doing so, teachers like Charlotte can foster an approach that is responsive to the
     needs of her students and proactive in strengthening mental health and wellbeing.

   Chapter goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn:
           how to plan a Conceptual PlayWorld for your home setting
           how to set up a Conceptual PlayWorld for STEM teaching.

Introduction

Charlotte is very worried, pacing back and forth in the staffroom. Yuwen asks Charlotte what's bothering
her. She finds out that Ella's mother, Lily, came to meet Charlotte earlier in the day. Lily thanked Charlotte
for doing magic in her class; Ella is curious about science, technology and design. Lily has heard about
Conceptual PlayWorld from Ella and wants to set one up at her home to support Ella's STEM learning.
Charlotte is worried as she has never done a Conceptual PlayWorld for families. As mentioned in Chapter
1, Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld is an evidence-based pedagogical model that supports children's STEM
learning and imagination in their early years. Developed by Fleer (2017, 2018, 2020), the model has been
created in collaboration with educators but is equally powerful in creating new motivating conditions for
STEM learning in the home setting (Fleer, Fragkiadaki & Rai, 2020).

Meeting the problem

Charlotte knows how to plan a Conceptual PlayWorld for her children in the centre, but the home is a
different scenario. She has not done it herself before. Her head is spinning as she considers the complexities
of a Conceptual PlayWorld in the home setting:
   CHAPTER 9: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD FOR FAMILIES: WHY PLAY WORKS FOR TEACHING STEM IN THE HOME
                                                                                                                                             SETTING | 120

   Apart from the usual worries of which story to choose and which concept to work with, she also
      thinks about the child, her siblings and other adults in the home.

   How do you develop a Conceptual PlayWorld that fits a child's daily routine, especially when the
      child is so young, like Ella, who has just turned two?

   She is also unsure if her mother would like the idea of being a play partner, and on top of everything,
      how will she talk about science concepts?

Yuwen comes to Charlotte's rescue. She has recently done a Conceptual PlayWorld with a family, which
was a big success.

       finding it so challenging? Record your answers in the Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking
       book.

HOME SETTING

Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld for families

Yuwen tells Charlotte that we use the same characteristics of the Conceptual PlayWorld in the home
setting. However, one big difference is that you are planning for others, i.e., parents to implement it instead
of the teacher. Yuwen thinks this will help Charlotte become the master trainer as she can train families to
implement a Conceptual PlayWorld.

Dramatic story

Charlotte remembers Lily and Ella are reading the storybook Time for Bed by Mem Fox. However,
Charlotte feels there is no drama in the book. Yuwen suggests that in a Conceptual PlayWorld, building
empathy for the character and being together in the imaginary situation is key. To amplify the drama, they
can add their own narrative. They can also encourage Ella and Lily to wear props that help to build the story
plot. Charlotte likes the idea of reading books with props. Yuwen suggests that Lily and Ella can read the
book at different times of the day and as a bedtime routine to develop familiarity with the story's characters.
She shows Charlotte one of her own treasured possessions - a sketchbook she developed while working
with one of the families.

                                                                                                     author.

Knowing children's social situation of development

Charlotte's eyes lit up as she looked at the images from the sketchbook. She would like this to happen in
children's homes where they are happy and relaxed reading stories with their parents. While looking at the
sketchbook, Yuwen realised they had not discussed the family and children's routine. She asked Charlotte
if she knew more about Ella's everyday routine, whether she has siblings, her parents' occupations, and
other family interests. Charlotte knows from the centre's record that Ella has an older sister, and both her
parents are working. Yuwen comes up with an idea and asks her to become a teacher researcher for a while.
Yuwen had a simple format to ask Lily about Ella's daily routine so that they could plan their Conceptual
PlayWorld better.

                                                                 Note. Image
                                                                 provided by the
                                                                 author.

Charlotte feels supported and excited about being a researcher and learning more about the family. Yuwen
shared with Charlotte that they have to design a Conceptual PlayWorld for Ella's home so that she feels
supported and has space to bring her family practices to her play. A child's interest and developmental
process need to be acknowledged and used so that they are agentic in contributing to their learning. She
explained to Charlotte the concept of `social situation of development', which could be defined as `the
special combination of internal developmental processes and external conditions that are typical of each
developmental stage and that condition both the dynamic of mental development for the duration of
the corresponding developmental period and the new qualitatively distinct psychological formations that
emerge towards its end' (Bozhovich, 2009, p.67). Yuwen simplified the ideas further and said they must
acknowledge a child's age, social environment and unique relationship with this social world to create this
Conceptual PlayWorld. They have to support the child to create these new conditions for their STEM
learning - they have to value their agency.

Research Readings 9.1: The following reading highlights the importance of understanding the demands
created by specific institutions like home, childcare etc. on children's everyday practice and routine.

Designing a Conceptual PlayWorld space

Charlotte comes back with information on Ella's everyday routine and some understanding of their family
values and cultural practices. She also heard from Lily that Ella is fascinated with shadows. Charlotte
quickly planned so they could explore and learn the concept of light and shadow in this Conceptual
PlayWorld. Yuwen could see that Charlotte was becoming confident in engaging with the concepts, and
she supported her idea. They discussed how the book offers an excellent context to introduce the concept
of light. The end-of-the-day bedtime routine could fit in very well with a working mother like Lily. They
can read the book at night and plan a few play activities over the weekend.
Their next challenge was to create different spaces that give opportunities for exploring both concepts and
give them a sense of being together in a collective imaginary situation. Being in the collective imaginary
situation is so important.

       Practice reflection 9.2: What do you think we should do to create a space that aligns with
       the story and also helps in exploring the concept of light and shadow? Can you help
       Charlotte create a collective imaginary situation? Record your answers in the Fleer's
       Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Research Readings 9.2: This reading below foregrounds imagination as one of the key psychological
functions in early years. It also explores the role of collective forms of imagining in children's concept
learning.
Fragkiadaki, G., Fleer, M. & Rai, P. (2021). The social and cultural genesis of collective imagination during
infancy. Learning, Culture and Social Interaction, 29, 100518.

Material conditions and Conceptual PlayWorld space

While planning a Conceptual PlayWorld we need to acknowledge the mutual constitution of the material
condition and people's subjectivity. Slj (2019) suggests that humans can `convert ideas into artefacts that
support intellectual and physical activities, and that later will intervene in our daily practices' (p. 21). This
dialectical relationship between artefacts and thinking is not limited to everyday objects around us but also
to digital tools.
125 | CHAPTER 9: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD FOR FAMILIES: WHY PLAY WORKS FOR TEACHING STEM IN THE
HOME SETTING

Research Readings 9.3: This paper emphasises the relational nature of tool use. It also offers evidence to
show how Conceptual PlayWorlds create new conditions for children's concept learning in their home.
Rai, P., Fleer, M. & Fragkiadaki, G. (2021). Theorising Digital Tools: Mutual Constitution of the Person
and Digital in a Conceptual PlayWorld. Human Arenas. 5, 654-671.

Yuwen and Charlotte were excited as they received more information about the Ella's social situation and
her everyday family practices. They were mindful that children's material conditions offer them unique
experiences and they have to build their Conceptual PlayWorld plans around it. They planned to set up a
dark space in the bedroom, like a tent or a cubby, which Ella and her parents could explore with torches.
They can also take objects or toys of different sizes and shapes and explore shadows. Yuwen recalled an
episode from Dr Binocs shows, which families can watch together for more ideas.

                   view them online here: https://oercollective.caul.edu.au/why-play-works/?p=331#oembed-1

Yuwen suggests that once they have played in the tent/cubby, Ella can make some puppets and they can do
some shadow puppet theatre. Knowing Ella, Charlotte was not sure if this was going to work. She recalls
that Ella loves music, and goes to dance classes. Yuwen thinks it would be a good idea to suggest a shadow
dance. This does not need any special set up - children and family members can manipulate light using
their bodies on one of the walls to show different dance moves. Watch this video for some shadow dance
ideas.

         Charlotte: I'm delighted to imagine that Ella will have so much fun in this Conceptual PlayWorld.
         Yuwen: The key is that both adults and children should have fun and play. As we design this
         Conceptual PlayWorld, we need to develop plots that help to explore the concept further and make
         it personally meaningful for Ella. Do you think if they make animal puppets, e.g. horse, cow, cat,
         goose, fish, deer or other characters from the story, it would help them extend the play plot?
         Charlotte: Great idea! They can use various homemade animal ears or tails to add drama.

         Yuwen: You are getting so good at this, Charlotte!

       Practice reflection 9.3: What do you think about Yuwen and Charlotte's plan? Do you
       think it will work? Write your own plan in your Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Yuwen is reminded that, unlike usual science teaching sessions, the purpose is not to give children science
facts or concepts quickly. The Conceptual PlayWorld supports exploring science concepts, so they must
plan multiple ways of exploring the concept in detail. Yuwen suggests they need to plan more opportunities
for children's ideas and understandings to become more visible. Charlotte plans a `shadow detectives' game
where children and adults can use mobile phones or cameras to take photographs of shadows of different
objects in the house and then compare their photos. They can talk about the light source, direction of light,
size of the object and shadow.
They remember they had recently seen a Bluey episode on shadowlands. Charlotte thinks it would be a
lovely idea to watch this episode together.
You can watch the Bluey episode yourself on the Bluey website.
Yuwen highlighted that it is so important to consider these multiple resources. Digital tools can amplify
children's experiences and add fun and drama to their play. Yuwen showed another page from her
sketchbook to highlight that material conditions afford new possibilities for learning. In the picture below,
children play with their mother using Lego blocks and other manipulatives.

                                                                                                         author.

Entering and exiting the Conceptual PlayWorld

Yuwen and Charlotte plan for the family to enter the Conceptual PlayWorld, imagining they are travelling
to bedtime and singing their favourite rhymes together (e.g. Twinkle Twinkle Little Star). They can pretend
to put on pyjamas and pretend to wind the clock forward/backwards to enter and exit the PlayWorld
playing animals putting their young to bed. All the family members are in the same imaginary situation
- pretending to be in a night-time setting together. Family members can choose characters from the
storybook as they enter the imaginary situation. Charlotte says that the most important point is that
parents are also always a character in the story or acting as a human prop (e.g., as the goose or the cat), being
part of the night-time routine, being the parent animal, pretending to be the baby animal and vice versa,
inviting role reversal. They play with children and can control or direct them from inside the collective
imaginary situation.

Planning the play inquiry or problem scenario

Charlotte always finds developing an authentic problem challenging. Yuwen comes to the rescue; she
thinks the problem is that baby animals cannot find their shadow at night without light. They ask the
children at home for help. As they get busy detailing the problem, Yuwen reminds Charlotte that the
problem scenario is not scripted but a general idea of the problem is planned. They could suggest that
children have received a letter from the animals: Please help us find our shadows, we are lonely, we need your
help.
The other equally important aspect of developing the problem scenario is that children need to have
enough knowledge to solve the problem. Several activities (shadow dance, shadow detectives or Bluey's
shadowlands) designed by Yuwen and Charlotte will help children explore the concept of light and shadow.

         Yuwen: This might be a good moment for Lily to pretend to be an engineer and offer expert
         knowledge on light and shadow. A shadow is a dark shape that forms when an object blocks some
   CHAPTER 9: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD FOR FAMILIES: WHY PLAY WORKS FOR TEACHING STEM IN THE HOME
                                                                                                                                             SETTING | 128

         of the light. I think we have to explain the idea in an easily understandable language. It is important
         to bring children's experiences of playing shadow games here. We can detail this further. For now,
         the problem looks dramatic and engaging. This will motivate Ella to know more and help the
         animals. Being clear about the concepts that will be learned from solving the problem situation is
         also essential. In one of the works I did in the past, we asked children to measure their shadows at
         different time points of the day, and they loved the game. Do you want to see my sketchbook again?

         Charlotte: I love your sketches, of course yes!

Yuwen had images of children playing a game of measuring their shadow. It was so relevant to their
planning that they decided to share them with Lily so that she could get some examples.

Yuwen thinks this will be an inspiring experience for Ella. She will be able to experience, with the help
of her family, that the size and shape of shadows change depending on the light source, e.g. distance;
silhouette, 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional shape, light and dark, opaque, transparent, and translucent.
The key would be how to plan the adult interaction.
129 | CHAPTER 9: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD FOR FAMILIES: WHY PLAY WORKS FOR TEACHING STEM IN THE
HOME SETTING

Planning parent's interaction to support conceptual
learning

It is evident from the activities that the concept is in `service of play'. Children are exploring the concept,
but their play is being further enriched.

Parents are not always the same character, and their roles are not scripted. Parents might be a cow or horse
and invite the child to be part of the animal family. If there is another adult or sibling, they can play a
role or help to solve the problem, e.g. how to create shadows. Yuwen explains that the biggest challenge
for the parents would be to take on multiple roles. They might have to prepare a bit for that. She suggests
that Charlotte talk with Lily about this. They must work alongside children to solve the problem and offer
expert knowledge on the science concept when the moment is right. If the child is not feeling motivated,
they may have to be encouraged from inside or ask questions that could generate interest. Yuwen suggests
they make a few suggestions for Lily, which might make her more confident doing this.

         Charlotte: I get your point. Like me in the centre, she can be a play partner, leader or explorer.
         What if we label roles like that?

Yuwen thinks it is a brilliant idea, and they come up with the following plan:

   Parent as play partner - Be equal with the child, e.g. `Let's work out how to create a shadow
      together', playing shadowlands, holding the torch or being inside the tent with the child.

   Parent as play leader - Above position, where parents are responsible for leading the play, sharing
      information about light and shadow and highlighting to children what is important. It is an essential
      role to lead concept learning. A child would not be able to do this alone.

   Parent as play explorer - Sometimes, a parent has to work from the below position, asking questions
      to generate curiosity or understand the child's experience. Kravtsov and Kravtsova (2010) use the
      concept of subject positioning in the context of pair pedagogy. Here, it explains the pedagogical
      relationship between the adult and the child. It is worth highlighting the dual positional perspective
      here, allowing participants to understand themselves and their social situation. So, both children and
      adults are the subjects of play, but they also control the play. These ideas around pedagogical
      positioning are also discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
   CHAPTER 9: CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLD FOR FAMILIES: WHY PLAY WORKS FOR TEACHING STEM IN THE HOME
                                                                                                                                             SETTING | 130

       Practice reflection 9.4: Can you think of other pedagogical positionings of the adults in
       children's play? Which role do you like to take? Do you think these roles differ from being
       the director of children's play from outside? Record your answers in the Fleer's Conceptual
       PlayWorld thinking book.

Research Readings 9.4: In the video below, a lecture by Laureate Prof. Marilyn Fleer will help you to
carefully think of the role of the adult in children's play. The argument worth considering is that parents or
teachers need to be mindful of their pedagogical positionings while working with children.

   Conclusion

     This chapter shows how the Conceptual PlayWorld could create new motivating conditions for
     STEM learning in children's home settings. Yuwen and Charlotte worked out a detailed plan for
     several days that was not just considering the child but also the participation of their siblings
     and parents. The Conceptual PlayWorld is a collective experience where children learn new
     concepts in their social interactions with others in an imaginary situation weaved around a
     children's storybook. It is important to think carefully about children's social situations of
     development as the Conceptual PlayWorld empowers children to contribute to their learning.

CHAPTER 10 : CONCEPTUAL
PLAYWORLDS TO STUDY THE
STRUCTURING OF TIME INTO DAYS,
WEEKS AND MONTHS

   Anne Clerc-Georgy and Myriam Garcia Perez

   Chapter Goals

     By reading and exploring the content of this chapter, you will learn:
           how dates (days, weeks and months) can be used for in early childhood
           why the use of knowledge promotes the construction of meaning
           how to maintain dramatic tension in a Conceptual PlayWorld.

Introduction : Jumping into the imaginary situation

Charlotte went to Switzerland. She wanted to visit her friend Michael, who works with a class of 4 and
5-year-olds. Michael is worried because his colleagues criticised him for not doing the `date of the day'
activity every morning. He disagrees and doesn't understand the point of repeating the date every day, and
he can't get his students to do it. He asks Charlotte how children learn to use a calendar in Australia.
In this chapter, you will explore how young students construct temporal reference points, like days, weeks
and months. You will help Michael and Charlotte find ways to work the meaning of using a calendar in
Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld.
Additionally, in this chapter, you will reflect on how to support students' motivation in a Conceptual
PlayWorld.
But before you start understanding how Conceptual PlayWorlds can be used to build temporal concepts,
read the story of Michael and find out why he disagrees with his colleagues.

Michael's story - The morning calendar is a meaningless
activity

Last week, in the teachers' room, two colleagues confronted Michael. They criticised him for not working
on the `date of the day` with his students. This is a problem because the students don't know how to do
it when they join the primary class. Michael replied that he didn't find it interesting to recite a date every
morning, especially when the students didn't understand what it means.

AND MONTHS

Michael tells Charlotte that he understands why his colleagues are upset but doesn't see how a calendar
routine could make sense to the children in his classroom. He would like to work on the calendar and
today's date with his students, but first, he needs to figure out a way to make it work in a meaningful way.

Charlotte suggested they reflect deeper together and imagine Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorldWorld to work
on the concepts underlying the calendar routine.

       Practice reflection 10.1: Why do you think Michael's colleagues are upset? How do you
       work with the calendar in your classroom? How useful do you think the `date` date of the
       day' day' activity is in the classroom? What do children learn from doing it? Record your
       thoughts in your personalised Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

Diving into the research

What does time structuring mean?

Throughout time, different civilisations have attempted to formalises the periodicity of certain phenomena
(day/night alternance, moon cycles and the return of the seasons). Based on these facts, humans needed to
structure and organise their lives by measuring time in a more concrete, predictable way. This was done
either in the form of dates (to count days) or duration. According to Harris (2002), a famous psychologist,
imagination probably emerged in sedentary men in connection with their need to measure life (they knew
they were mortal) and to anticipate the future (harvests, seasons, etc.).

In our civilisation, we have organised the days into groups of 7 (weeks). We've also divided the year
into 12 months and the months into about 4 weeks. This is the result of numerous adaptations since,
unfortunately, there isn't an exact number of moon cycles (months) in one sun cycle (year). In addition,
we have divided the day into hours, minutes, seconds, and so on.

By measuring time this way, we can find out how long we've been born, how many days we have left
before the summer holidays, when we can meet up with a friend, etc. However we've agreed on measuring
objective time, but it doesn't correspond to our subjective experience. An hour at the dentist's isn't exactly
the same as an hour playing with friends!

What will the children learn about time?

time passes irreversibly. They will learn certain conventional concepts, such as the days of the week or the

months of the year, and thus learn to orient themselves in time (today is Friday, October 13, it's morning;

what day will it be tomorrow?). They will also learn to tell the time and organise events in time (my

birthday is in February; I go to music lessons on Tuesdays). Finally, from a language point of view, children

will learn to use verb tenses and time words (before, yesterday, later, it's a long time, etc.).

In pretend play, children develop their ability to imagine, anticipate, bring into existence what is not yet.
At the same time, imagination is shaped by elements drawn from past experience. More specifically, when
playing, children use their imagination to postpone actions and desires, to wait, anticipate and plan actions.
Thus, play is ideal for expanding, transforming and structuring children's relationship with time.

Let's go back to Michael's question. What's the point of using a calendar or working on the day's date with
5-year-olds?

Practice reflection 10.2: In what situations do you use a diary or calendar? How do you do
it? What does it help you achieve? Record your answers in the Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
thinking book.

A Conceptual PlayWorld for making sense of temporal
concepts

Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld is particularly relevant for exploring temporal concepts. First, because
imaginary scenarios allow children to go back and forth in time. It's common for children to go back in
time or leap forward into other times as they play. Second, pretend play continually invites children to
plan or anticipate actions, i.e. to imagine actions before they happen or to order actions in relation to each
137 | CHAPTER 10 : CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO STUDY THE STRUCTURING OF TIME INTO DAYS, WEEKS
AND MONTHS

other and thus situate them in the future. Finally, the construction of temporal notions is closely linked to
the development of imagination. Indeed, to navigate in time, it is essential imagine different past or future
situations.

More specifically, Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld offers numerous possibilities for organising time in terms
of days or weeks and using a diary. Numerous dramatic situations invite children to situate themselves in
time, measure past time or anticipate dates to set future events.

Your role is to help Michael and Charlotte imagine dramatic events that involve situating oneself in time
and anticipating a date in the future through these suggested steps :

   Choose a story that requires you to place yourself in time and anticipate a date.
   Plan a Conceptual PlayWorld.
   Plan how to jump into the story (enter and exit the playworld).
   Create an authentic problem of location in the calendar.
   Be a play partner and anticipate ways to support children's motivation.

Let's get to it!

Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld for building temporal
concepts

Getting prepared

Michael and Charlotte read widely on development of temporal concepts in early childhood. They also
sought to understand the situations in which a calendar or diary is helpful and how it enhances the ability
to act, remember, plan or communicate. Finally, they examined their thinking patterns when using their
diaries.

On the Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld website you will find a planning proforma for Fleer's Conceptual
PlayWorld. This is the website and planning framework that Yuwen showed to Charlotte and which she
passed on to Michael. In Appendix B, there is an example of a planning proforma which was designed for
infant and toddler children.

1. Choosing a story

Charlotte and Michael spent a lot of time looking for a story for their Conceptual PlayWorld. Many of the
stories available in school materials didn't contain enough drama or, more importantly, didn't invite the
readers to empathise with the characters.
        CHAPTER 10 : CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO STUDY THE STRUCTURING OF TIME INTO DAYS, WEEKS AND
                                                                                                                                            MONTHS | 138

       Practice reflection 10.3: Help Michael in his quest for stories. What do you think makes
       children empathise with a character? Record your answers in the Fleer's Conceptual
       PlayWorld thinking book.

Figure 10.3
Michael shows Charlotte the book he found.

They agreed to select King of the SWAMP. This book tells the story of Mac Gadouille, who lives in
a disgusting swamp. He learns that the King wants to destroy it to build a skate park. He decides to
transform the swamp into a magnificent flower garden. The King gives him 10 days to prove that such
a beautiful place shouldn't be destroyed. Unfortunately, shortly before the King's visit, Mac Gadouille
discovers caterpillars eating all his flowers. The King will have to wait until the day when all the caterpillars
become butterflies, because on that day, the marsh will be even more beautiful and colourful. The question
is, when is the King due for this visit?
This is a fantastic book for exploring the world of dates and diaries. Indeed, there are several references to
days to look forward to or anticipate.
Charlotte is pleased with the book's choice made with Michael. She decides to plan and participate in this
future Conceptual PlayWorld with him. Michael explains that this story allows us to pose the problem of
139 | CHAPTER 10 : CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO STUDY THE STRUCTURING OF TIME INTO DAYS, WEEKS
AND MONTHS

dates and days passing over and over again, specifically at three moments in the story: First, when the King
announces that he will return in 10 days. Then, when Mac Gadouille discovers the caterpillars and has to
anticipate how long it will take them to become butterflies. Finally, when Mac Gadouille must set a date to
invite the King to visit his marsh. Charlotte congratulates him on all his good ideas.

       Practice reflection 10.4: Do you know of any other stories that involve counting days,
       measuring time or setting dates and appointments? Record your answers in the Fleer's
       Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

2. Planning a Conceptual PlayWorld space

Michael and Charlotte decide to organise three areas in the classroom:

   The space for reading the story and working on the calendar near the blackboard, on the floor.
   The office of the scientist who knows all about caterpillars and butterflies.
   The rest of the classroom, which represents the swamp where Mac Gadouille lives.

Michael is worried about transforming the classroom and adding flowers and caterpillars. Charlotte
reassures him: The children don't need all that. She knows Michael can take them to a beautiful imaginary
garden.

3. Planning how to jump into the story

Charlotte explains to Michael that defining how he will mark the entrance to and exit from the imaginary
world is important. Michael suggests passing under her desk. He thinks this will help the children enter the
extraordinary garden even better.

       Practice reflection 10.5: What do you think of Michael's idea? How would you help
       children enter the PlayWorld? Record your answers in the Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
       thinking book.

                                                                                                                                            MONTHS | 140

Figure 10.4
Michael and Charlotte read together

Charlotte explains to Michael that it's important to decide on everyone's roles. Michael says he would
narrate the story and then play Mac Gadouille in the playworld. All the children would be the swamp's
inhabitants and belong to Mac Gadouille's family. Charlotte suggests that she play two roles. In the
playworld, she would be the scientist explaining the life cycles of caterpillars and butterflies. She would also
play the King but through the telephone. That way, she would call Mac Gadouille to arrange meetings.

4. Creating an authentic problem

Charlotte then asks Michael what the children's real problem will be. Michael thought long and hard about
it and after having read the story over and over again, he explains to Charlotte that the children would
be facing two problems. The main problem would be to set the date for the King's arrival right when the
caterpillars have all become butterflies. But to do this, the children would need to answer another problem:
they would need to find out how long it takes for the caterpillars to transform.
Michael and Charlotte talk for a long time. Michael wonders how they will get the kids to empathise with
Mac Gadouille, and how they will motivate them to do the work of understanding the calendar.
Michael decides that he will start by reading the beginning of the story to the children. He'll explain
that Mac Gadouille and his family will transform the swamp into a beautiful garden. Then they'll enter
the playworld and go gardening together. After a while, when the garden starts to bloom, Michael//Mac
Gadouille would call for help because he would find a caterpillar nibbling the flowers, before noticing there
are hundreds of them!
141 | CHAPTER 10 : CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO STUDY THE STRUCTURING OF TIME INTO DAYS, WEEKS AND
MONTHS

Charlotte reminds him that sharing his emotions of surprise, helplessness, and maybe a bit of disgust with
all the children would be particularly important at that moment. Later on, another crucial event would
happen in the story: the King would call to announce his arrival. Mac Gadouille would ask him to wait a
few days, promising he would call back soon to invite him.
Everyone would then leave the playworld and visit Charlotte, the scientist, who would explain the butterfly
life cycle by showing on a time strip (in days and weeks) how many days it takes for the caterpillars to
become butterflies. When the children have memorised this number of days, they'll go to the calendar to:

       1. identify what day it is
       2. count the days needed for the caterpillars to become butterflies, and
       3. identify the date to invite the King for a visit to the swamp.

Then, Michael/Mac Gadouille could call the King.
Michael is really happy. He's finally found a learning situation where using the calendar makes sense for
him. He now understands the importance of how to use it and why children need to be supported in this
learning process.

       Practice reflection 10.6: What about you? Have you now a better understanding of the
       importance of calendars and diaries? What has changed? How can you help your students
       understand it too? What new ideas do you have on the subject? Record your answers in the
       Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld thinking book.

4. Being a play partner

To engage themselves and the children in the play about the diary, Michael and Charlotte felt that they
first had to get them into the swamp. They must see it as their own home. Then they imagined what
Michael//Mac Gadouille would tell them and how he would engage the children.
Upon entering the playworld they would say:

       `There is mud everywhere and it smells bad!'
        CHAPTER 10 : CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO STUDY THE STRUCTURING OF TIME INTO DAYS, WEEKS AND
                                                                                                                                            MONTHS | 142

       `It is dirty!'
       `Be careful where you step, I'm sinking into the mud and will fall!'
       `Try to walk on the stones!'
Then, to motivate them to work on transforming the marsh into a beautiful garden:
       `I am planting a flower here. It's beautiful! This flower is so amazing!'
       `Oh, the seeds have grown. Look! The flowers are blue, yellow, red...'
       `Mmmmh, how nice it smells in our garden.'
       `I think we're ready for the King's visit!'
When they discover caterpillars :
       `Oh no! That is awful, a caterpillar. Oh! Another one, and another one here... Thousands of
       caterpillars, can you see them?'
       `They are going to eat all our flowers, it's horrible!'
       `We will have to leave the swamp. If the King sees this disaster, he'll destroy everything!'
       `Help me, what can we do?'
After the King's phone call:
       `I have an idea. When all these caterpillars become butterflies, the swamp will be even more beautiful
       and colourful, right? But how do we know when that will happen?'
For her part, Charlotte, as the King, had been thinking about the telephone call. She really wanted to
impress and engage the children in solving the problem. She, therefore, imagined she could say:
       `Hello, I am the King. I am on the way. I am coming to visit your stinking swamp. I'm going to
       destroy everything in your swamp. I am finally going to build my skate park. I am happy. Don't make
       me think it is a beautiful place. You are just stinky pickles!'

5. Maintaining dramatic tension

During the implementation of the Conceptual PlayWorld, the children were fully involved in the play.
They followed Michael into the swamp, imagined his transformation and got angry with the King. In this
way, they easily retained the scientist's lessons. They memorised the 12 days it would take for the caterpillars
143 | CHAPTER 10 : CONCEPTUAL PLAYWORLDS TO STUDY THE STRUCTURING OF TIME INTO DAYS, WEEKS
AND MONTHS

to transform into butterflies. They then worked with Michael to identify the day's date and count the 12
days.
At one point during the calendar work, some of the children showed signs of declining motivation.
Charlotte, who was observing the children, decided to leave the classroom and take on the role of the King
to call Michael/Mac Gadouille again. This new, unplanned intervention, re-created the dramatic tension
that motivated the students to resolve the question of the date for the King's invitation. Charlotte, as the
King, threatened to arrive right away if he didn't receive the invitation date soon.

       Practice reflection 10.7: If, like Charlotte, you perceive a drop in motivation or dramatic
       tension in a Conceptual PlayWorld, what are your tools for recreating that tension to get
       your students on board again? Record your answers in the Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld
       thinking book.

   Conclusion

     Charlotte is very excited about her experience with Michael. On the way back to her hotel, she
     can't resist emailing Yuwen to tell her what she's learned during her stay.

         Dear Yuwen,
         I've just had a wonderful experience in Michael's kindergarten class in Switzerland. It
         completely transformed my understanding of the value of learning to use a calendar with
         these young students. In our Conceptual PlayWorld, we were able to make this a necessity.
         Indeed, the calendar becomes indispensable when we need to situate ourselves in time to
         anticipate and communicate an upcoming date.
         Furthermore, when we were implementing Fleer's Conceptual PlayWorld, I noticed that the
         children sometimes needed us to support their motivation. I proudly identified a moment
         when this motivation was declining. I then intervened, phoning the children to stimulate the
         dramatic tension and motivate them to solve the calendar problem. It worked!
         I look forward to coming back to Melbourne to tell you about my adventure.
