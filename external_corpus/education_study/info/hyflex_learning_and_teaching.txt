Learning has evolved rapidly in recent years giving rise to the
HyFlex approach; an innovative, disruptive, and necessary
change in teaching and learning. We invite you, as a teacher,
a course coordinator, a learning designer or other educational
role, to reconceptualise your practice around online learning.
This resource examines current pedagogical thinking around
blended, hybrid, and HyFlex approaches to learning, with a
view to rethinking and improving online learning opportunities
and engagement for students.

   The information and suggested activities in this resource
may encourage you to think in different ways and apply new
educational technologies. Your adaption and adoption of a
HyFlex approach will likely be bespoke, based on clear
attributes and general guidelines provided. Your success with
HyFlex centres around what you discard from the past,
embrace for the future and, above all, your determination to
build accessible, equivalent and flat learning that provides for
student choice and autonomy.

   We have designed this book for you to read and interact with
simply as a book or as a course. In the spirit of HyFlex this is your
choice.

                                                                                  Introduction | 1

PART I

WHAT IS HYFLEX?

HyFlex learning refers to a combination of the terms hybrid and
flexible. HyFlex applies to various learning situations and is a
key design approach for online learning.

   Let's explore the origin of this concept further. Traditionally,
in-person learning means attending an on-campus class at the
same time as other learners and teachers. The advent of online
learning means students can attend class via
videoconferencing from a distance. Blended/hybrid learning
modes evolved that combined both online and traditional on-
campus sessions as a split model, where students can choose
one or the other.

   Hybrid learning, similar to and often called blended learning,
refers to a combination of online and on-campus in-person
activities using largely synchronous learning modes. Students
have some choice regarding how they want to learn according
to their needs and are expected to undergo the same
combination of online and in-person activities.

   HyFlex learning means that hybrid online learning
opportunities are provided for students that leverage
synchronous and asynchronous modes. In addition to this, a
more flexible learning environment is provided where students
can not only choose how they want to learn but when and
where, with the flexibility for change during a semester or
across a program. The "flexible" aspect of HyFlex is that
students are given a choice in how they participate in the
course and engage with the material in the mode that works
best for them over the course and from session to session.

   HyFlex differs from Hybrid in that there is no `second-class'
learning experience--all learning modes provide the same or
similar access to content, conversations, feedback, and

                                                                             What is Hyflex? | 3
opportunities for success. Therefore, designing learning to be
HyFlex is an opportunity many institutions are now considering
and consequently applying resources for development.

4 | What is Hyflex?
Background

HyFlex is a term that has gained in popularity in recent years,
particularly during the COVID pandemic when alternative
learning opportunities were urgently required instead of on-
campus sessions.

   Brian Beatty is credited with coining the term HyFlex back in
2006. At that time, San Francisco State University was exploring
opportunities to increase their design and facilitation of online
learning experiences, and Beatty wanted a term that reflected
a particular approach.

   What Beatty was hoping to describe was not just an online
experience but one in which the student had choice, and
therefore flexibility, in the ways they studied without any
compromise of learning outcomes.

                                                                                  Background | 5
                                                        Clearly, a traditional
                                                        blended learning approach
                                                        was not going to meet our
                                                        requirements. We decided
                                                        that we needed a "bridge"
                                                        to online; an approach to
                                                        serving fully online students
                                                        without abandoning our
                                                        current classroom students.
                                                        (Beatty, 2019, p. 17)

   Learning remotely, whether online or as distance education,
has been an option for many years. The now ubiquitous access
to networked technologies has helped facilitate the online
experience, but prior to this, students would receive
documents and media in the post. These resources and
learning experiences were replications of the on-campus
experience. While that might sound like a reasonable
substitute and perhaps even an equivalent experience, it has
become clear that this is not the case. Regardless of the type of
experience, more students are now choosing to study remotely,
which has created a need for greater thought to be applied
to fully utilising the technology that can facilitate a truly
equivalent experience.

6 | Background
   You have come to with this short course due to your interest
in HyFlex, or perhaps your motivation to learn new approaches
to online learning design (what ever it is called). Many of you
may already work in the online environment, and if not, you
most probably did during the height of the COVID pandemic.
You are here as an online learner, which means you have a
glimpse at what these experiences will be like. We start this
HyFlex story by looking at the strategies, theories and practical
approaches that have come before, with an emphasis on the
people working in the field as online technology supported
learning has grown.

   Wenger (1998) coined the term "Communities of Practice",
and this has been a significant conceptualisation of how
people learn. Importantly there is an emphasis on how adults
learn and how they learn in the workplace. The premise of
`legitimate peripheral participation' reflects the type of online
learning that is flexible. The learner is making choices about
how and why they learn, and the learning is often done
through interactions with a community. This approach is
different to one where the teacher is directing what, when
and how the learning will occur. Wenger's (2020) more recent
work frames these ideas within Social Learning Spaces, again
recognising the varied ways that we learn outside of the on-
campus teacher-centred spaces. Social Learning Spaces
provide for peer-to-peer interaction and encourage team work
thereby helping students to feel more engaged and
connected.

   Presenting a paradigm shift, Garrison argued in 1985 that
technology had a significant impact on distance education
and the way in which it was delivered/received. Garrison
continued to focus on exploring the dynamics between
technology and learning with the seminal text for online higher
education, E-Learning in the 21st Century, first published in
2003 with his colleague Anderson. This is where the framework
of three presences was discussed, and it has gone on to be

                                                                                  Background | 7
adopted and adapted by online teachers across the globe. You
may have heard of social presence, teaching presence, and/
or cognitive presence. These all sit within the community of
inquiry framework.

   You may be curious about why communities have featured
in these theories, and we will unpack this further. For now,
consider whether the learning environment in which you work
is a community, or if learners are isolated and do not interact
well with peers.

Hybrid

The first part of the term HyFlex, `Hy' is referring to hybrid.
That means the learner experience for the student will be a
blend of modes. Usually that is the on-campus (face-to-face)
experience and some form of technology-enhanced learning.
With the rise in use of Learning Management Systems (LMSs)
in Higher Education, the ease with which learning resources
can be housed and accessed has increased. But that does not
always equate to a good learning experience or suitable use
of the technology. The key point here is that hybrid would not
exist if we did not have the technology to support it.

   Bonk and Graham edited the Handbook of Blended
Learning in 2006 with subsequent reprints. You will find this is
a useful text to explore if you want a bit more history of hybrid,
blended, distributed, and e-learning approaches. Interestingly
the 2000's was a time when significant uptake in online
learning was happening and when teachers were trying to find
ways to improve the experience. Supporting this was access
to the new and exciting `Web 2.0' tools such as blogs, wikis,
podcasts and early video conferencing tools such as Skype.
These digital tools allowed participants to connect,
communicate, and collaborate more effectively online.

8 | Background
Importantly they also supported personal and collaborative
creation and co-creation, not just content consumption.

Flex

The second part of the term, `Flex' refers to flexible, and this
is the real point of what HyFlex is or should be. This is what
makes it more complicated than simply being Hybrid or using
technology. We are going to explore this aspect of HyFlex in
more detail, but for now, consider whether the courses you are
designing meet some or all of Beatty's (2019) Four Principles of
HyFlex:

 1. Learner Choice
2. Equivalency
 3. Reusability
4. Accessibility
Undoubtedly the COVID pandemic has impacted on and
changed the way that education is viewed. Learners already
had expectations that were not being met, but through
enforced online learning experiences, a spotlight was shown on
what could be achieved. The will to create a student-centred-
hybrid learning environment has been driven by those that are
at the centre, which is the students.

                                                                                  Background | 9
     Educators who embrace HyFlex will
     forge ahead as they provide relevant,
     flexible learning experiences, and
     students will vote with their virtual
     feet.

Learning Modes

The term `Learning modes' refers to `how' a learner essentially
interacts with the content, the teacher and peers. There are two
learning modes: synchronous and asynchronous.

   Synchronous means in real time, being in the same place
at the same time. Asynchronous means activities and
communication are done not in real time but when the
participants are ready/able to engage.

Synchronous

Synchronous equates to `in real time' being in the same place
at the same time where learning takes place in person and
teachers and or learners are able to interact simultaneously. To
be synchronous there needs to be two or more people in the
same space (physical or virtual, and face-to-face) at the same
time.

Asynchronous

Asynchronous equates to `not in real time' where learning or
interaction is not at the same time whether in class or online
but when participants are ready/able to engage in their own
time. It most often occurs with the learner (from an on-campus
or online cohort) being by themselves and choosing how and
when to interact with the learning content and activities. It
also applies to learning activities where the teacher and other
students interact online using specific edtech tools, but not at
the same time.

12 | Learning Modes
Most people are very familiar with synchronous learning modes
because of the years spent in classrooms physically present
with a teacher and their peers. The synchronous virtual
learning mode is now also very familiar and it can be via video
conferencing (e.g., Zoom, MS Teams) or even in a virtual world
(e.g., Second Life, Minecraft).

   Many of us have been building various synchronous
experiences for a long time. We now see teachers and learners
grappling with the reality and importance of asynchronous
learning modes. But what do we mean by asynchronous being
the `glue' that hold online learning together? How can we
make it an equivalent experience to synchronous learning?

    Asynchronous is the glue that holds online
                       learning together.

                                                                           Learning Modes | 13
   Blended, hybrid and HyFlex are terms that employ a
combination of synchronous and asynchronous learning
modes to share content and encourage interaction,
engagement, retention and overall satisfaction. In 1989, Moore
shared the Theory of Transactional Distance for increased
engagement through online interactivity. This included how
engagement in learning takes place student to student,
teacher to student, and student to content. It continues to
resonate today as we design and build better online learning
opportunities using existing and emerging technologies.

   Asynchronous learning is a leveller that allows students to
participate when they can't join the synchronous session.
Asynchronous mode can also be the dominant design that
drives the learning instead of typical synchronous modes.

   Asynchronous versatility is an affordance of using various
digital technologies. This continues to be a truly untapped area
that has moved beyond text based forums to students being
able to collaborate and communicate, especially through video
and audio. Exploring this opens learning experiences to feel
more like they are synchronous and begins to humanise the
online experience. Examples include contributing to a forum or
sharing resources via an edtech tool like Padlet or Voicethread
or collaborating on a Google doc.

   The table below briefly shares typical actions in synchronous,
asynchronous and combined modes.

Designing for asynchronous learning is not new; institutions
have been doing this for more than two decades; however,

14 | Learning Modes
what is more challenging is changing the mindset away from
synchronous being the dominant or only mode of learning
through belief that learners cannot succeed unless they are
`face-to-face' in a synchronous environment.

   Bates (2015), author of Teaching in a Digital Age shares a
post-COVID update to his book about learning modes (Bates,
2022). He describes the educational benefit of asynchronous
technologies or recorded media as:

"...the ability to access information or communicate
at any time offers the learner more control and
flexibility".

He shares relevant research leading to inevitable design
changes for asynchronous use and concludes:

"...for online learning, asynchronous should be the
default model, but supported by synchronous
teaching where necessary and appropriate."

All good design decisions should be based on the problem
we are trying to address. A problem isn't necessarily a bad
occurrence, but at its most useful, it can help drive our reason
for finding a solution or a new way of doing something. A
problem helps us focus on the outcome of our design
decisions.

   Here are a few problems that we have experienced that
HyFlex helps to solve. Consider why you are here. What made
you think that HyFlex might be a solution to your problem?

Reflection

HyFlex learning - innovation or
disruption?

Can we call HyFlex learning and teaching
innovative, disruptive - both? or neither?

Moving into HyFlex learning is probably innovative. But maybe
it's also more disruptive because we already know that we can
learn synchronously. Do we know how to learn
asynchronously? How comfortable are we starting to rethink
asynchronous as the dominant mode aligned with HyFlex
objectives? How do we foster innovation in current practices
around this to fully support student learning outcomes? Maybe
it's disruptive in terms of asking people, teachers, designers to
think in a different way.

   We invite you to consider your position on HyFlex learning
based on your understanding, context, and disposition towards

APPROACHES TO
LEARNING

At the very heart of HyFlex learning is the learner-centred-
hybrid model.

   Most of us believe that we are doing what is best for our
students, and it can be perplexing when we receive feedback
that suggests otherwise.

   At the heart of HyFlex, there is a shift away from a didactic
method to a more constructivist approach to teaching. The
didactic method of teaching centres on structured learning
that is planned in advance where learners are more passively
engaged and given information (Indeed, 2023). It usually
consists of teachers presenting pre-planned lessons to address
specific learning objectives (Indeed, 2021). On the other hand,
a constructivist approach is where the teacher takes more of
a facilitator role and helps the student become more active
in their learning (McLeod, 2019a). This is because constructivist
theory centres on the idea that knowledge is gained through
past experiences, and in teaching practice, this means the
student's prior knowledge is considered in the classroom
rather than prescribed to a set learning plan (McLeod, 2019a).

   This table from SimplyPsychology (McLeod, 2019a) shows the
difference between the two:

                                                               Approaches to Learning | 21
Traditional classroom (didactic) Constructivist classroom

Strict adherence to a fixed       Pursuit of student questions and
curriculum is highly valued.      interests is valued.

Learning is based on repetition.  Learning is interactive, building
                                  on what the student already
                                  knows.

Teacher-centred.                  Student-centred.

Teachers disseminate              Teachers have a dialogue with
information to students;          students, helping students

Teacher's role is directive, rooted Teacher's role is interactive,

in authority.                     rooted in negotiation.

Students work primarily alone     Students work primarily in
(competitive).                    groups (cooperative).

Consider:

 What type of teaching approach do you currently use?
 Have you tried other approaches?

Constructivism

A good starting place to understand constructivist approaches
to teaching and learning is in the work of Lev Vygotsky. His
work dates back to the early 1900s, but it has formed the
foundation for much of the teaching strategies that consider
the way a person learns and specifically in Vygotsky's case,
how a child learns (Vygotsky, 1978). Vygotsky's main theory is
the "Zone of Proximal Development", which describes a child's
learning ability with different levels of assistance (McLeod,
2019b). The inner zone is what the child can do on their own,
the second is what they can do with assistance/guidance, and
the third is what they cannot do (McLeod, 2019b).

   When we adapt the basic premise of the Zone of Proximal
Development, we start to put the student as an individual at

22 | Approaches to Learning
the centre of the decisions made about the learning
experiences we design and the way we teach.

   However, with the adult at the centre of the learning design,
a picture emerges of someone who wants to be given choices
to support their learning. These choices will manifest in flexible
delivery style, time, and modes. At the same time they provide
meaningful learning experiences that sit within theories of
experiential, inquiry, problem and project based learning (to
name a few).

     When both temporal and geographic
     constraints are eliminated and
     learning design is student-centred,
     then HyFlex approaches become
     possible and viable.

Connectivism

Connectivism (Siemens, 2005) is another theory or approach
to learning. Downes (2022) reiterates the learner as having two
separate networks: personal learning and social learning. In
simple terms, and related to our theme of flexibility and choice
regarding HyFlex, learning does not happen in isolation.
Students may think it does (or some may want it to), but
learning is about making connections through online
networks. Another way to look at this is a Personal Learning
Network (PLN) (Oddone, 2018) developed through local and
global interaction with others. Constructivist learning requires
social interaction and a designed HyFlex model provides
choices for how, when and what this looks like for the learner.

                                                               Approaches to Learning | 23
     Connectivism is the thesis that
     knowledge is distributed across a
     network of connections, and therefore
     that learning consists of the ability to
     construct and traverse those networks
     (Downes, 2022, p. 59).

Identifying the unique needs of your students (and teachers) is
an important part of the process when moving to or designing
HyFlex learning. Their preferences for connection,
communication, collaboration and creation or co-construction
of learning should be considered. Development of learner
digital literacy (Oddone, n.d), including media literacy and
improved confidence when using technology for learning -
both as an individual and with peers and teachers - is another
aspect of HyFlex.

   We will explore educational technologies later in this course.
For now, consider your context and expectations for student
connection and social networking, leading to collaborative co-
construction of knowledge.

Transformative
pedagogies

Based on social constructivist principles (Vygotsky, 1978) and
the context of HyFlex learning, transformative pedagogies use
digital technologies to change how we teach and learn. This
is beyond merely "upgrading" to new edtech tools. By forging
new socially constructed relationships, transformative
pedagogies provide for reconstructed understandings by
learners. The SAMR model (Substitution, Augmentation,
Modification, Redefinition), developed by Dr R. Puentedura,
helps define how the use of digital technology is shaping
pedagogy and transforming learning.

     Modification and redefinition, describe
     how digital use has led to a significant
     change in the way teaching and
     learning is planned and delivered. If
     the introduction of technology has
     created a brand new practice, then
     redefinition has taken place.
     Collectively, these two categories are
     more likely to promote digital
     transformation. (JISC, 2022)

According to Meyers (2008), transformative pedagogies go
beyond information transmission when teaching online. This
includes creating a safe environment and using teaching
strategies for student engagement and participation.

                                                          Transformative pedagogies | 27
Facilitation, communication, collaboration, and the exchange
of information in new and digitally progressive ways align with
key HyFlex attributes and objectives.

Foundational learning theorists emphasise the
importance of learning with others, such as:

   Social constructivism where knowledge is constructed
      through interaction with others (Vygotsky, 1978)

   Collaborative learning that emphasises interaction
      between students (Dillenbourg, 1999)

   Community of Inquiry where learning never takes place in
      isolation or devoid of environmental influences (Garrison,
      2016)

   Communities of Practice where people engage in a
      process of collective learning that creates bonds between
      them (Wenger, 2015)

Additionally, it is important to consider evolving theories that
rely on internet capability through networked online
communities and the socialisation of online learning. These
theories provide for student-centred learning and student
autonomy through connected and collaborative pedagogies.

   Collaborativism (Harasim, 2017) builds on constructivist
learning theory and the use of the Internet for collaborative
knowledge creation, where educational technologies (usually
Web 2.0 tools) are used for communication, collaboration, and
co-creation practices to construct knowledge.

   This discourse includes other theories that speak to adult
learning and motivation. Andragogy (Knowles, 1984), based on
the assumptions of self-direction and independence, is a
model that gives learners control over learning, to become self-
directed, and to realise actualisation. Heutagogy (Hase and
Kenyon, 2000) is the application of self-determined learning

28 | Transformative pedagogies
with the attribute of knowledge sharing through open
communication and collaborative teamwork.

   Then there is the idea and practice of Critical Digital
Pedagogy, which is also very relevant to this discussion of
pedagogies as it transforms learning and teaching in some
way.

   A Critical Digital Pedagogy demands that open and
networked educational environments not merely repositories
of content; rather, they must create dialogues in which
students and teachers participate as full agents (Morris &
Stommel, 2018).

   To this effect, we should question the role of interactivity and
engagement in a digital learning environment and consider
how to ensure connected and networked practice while
interrogating/deconstructing the roles of teachers and
students.

   The shift from delivering content to students constructing
their own knowledge is a vital concept and practice when
planning for HyFlex teaching and learning. Typically,
transplanting traditional pedagogies onto a HyFlex design is
unsuccessful. Your plan for HyFlex should include scope to help
teachers and learners make that shift to socially based,
collaborative learning modes.

   Beatty (2019) has suggested that HyFlex is underpinned by
four principles - Choice, Equivalence, Accessibility and
Reusability. These are born out of his work and his context. We
have found in our own context that the idea of Flat Learning
encompasses many of the attributes of HyFlex. As such we
propose three principles or attributes - Choice, Flat Learning
and Accessibility. In this section, we unpack these and invite
you to connect your own context to each of them.

   Interpretation of the three attributes, their connection to
each and inclusion or overlap with Beatty's four principles is
shown in Figure 1. Adopting a HyFlex approach means
designing learning that accounts for the relationships between

32 | Key Attributes of HyFlex Learning
`choice' (learning mode that works best), `flat learning'
(connected, social, no hierarchy), and 'accessibility' (equality
assured by embedded universal design principles). Providing
for flat learning and choice ensures equivalent outcomes.
Using a digital-first design strategy within the provision of
choice and accessibility ensures the reusability of artefacts in all
learning modes. In addition, connected learning design affords
the relationship between flat learning and accessibility.

Benefits of HyFlex Learning: Choice, Flat
Learning, and Accessibility

   The attribute of choice can be challenging to implement
      effectively, as educators often feel attached to certain
                                                 Key Attributes of HyFlex Learning | 33
      requirements. However, by designing learning experiences
      that allow students to have choices within certain
      parameters, true student choice can be achieved. Trusting
      students to make choices that align with learning
      outcomes is crucial. One example of implementing choice
      is allowing students to inquire into topics they are
      interested in, rather than providing a limited list of topics.
   Flat learning is another attribute of HyFlex Learning,
      which promotes a multimodal approach where learning
      can happen with anyone, from anyone, at any time, and in
      any mode. This approach flattens the hierarchy of learning
      and emphasizes peer-to-peer, connected, and
      collaborative learning. It focuses on the social
      constructivist approach rather than content delivery.
   Accessibility is a key attribute of HyFlex Learning,
      ensuring that all students have access to technologies and
      learning resources that cater to their diverse needs. By
      providing equivalent experiences and allowing students to
      choose when they access their education,
      underrepresented groups can have equal opportunities in
      higher education.

Choice

A common approach to learning design is to be student-
centred, and this is a popular idea in instructional design
models. However, there is a difference between student-
centred and learner-choice. The first focuses on the learning
designer making decisions that they believe will facilitate an
authentic student experience. On the other hand, learner
choice firmly shifts the learning journey into the hands of the
learner, with the learning designer needing to provide multiple
and various opportunities for the learner. Fundamentally, the
teacher/instructor must be willing to "let go" of a significant
amount of control in the learning journey and trust the student
to make choices that may differ from ones previously imagined
by the designer/teacher/instructor.

   When trust is evident between the learner and the designer/
teacher/instructor, the learner will move confidently through
their choices. Ultimately, they will develop the skills to navigate
to the learning outcomes they need for the results they want.
In some cases, students will say they don't like choice, but this
may be because they are unfamiliar with being given choice
and autonomy in their learning experiences. In these instances,
the student needs to be supported to explore the choices in a
safe environment, where risk is considered a positive attribute.
Once students have experienced the positive aspects of choice,
they won't want to return to being restricted in their learning
experiences.

   Underpinning HyFlex learning is the choice of learning
mode (online, on-campus, asynchronous), but this can be
extended to choice at all stages of the learning experience.

36 | Choice
HyFlex learning and teaching provides for
choice for all because:

   learners are given a choice about when, where and how
      they study

   learners are given various opportunities and means to
      interact with their peers, the content and the teacher

   the learning design provides equivalency of experience
      regardless of learning mode

   learning is presented through multiple modes of content
      and resources.

                                                                                         Choice | 37
Choice in the context of HyFlex is about
providing choices for the learner. For
learners to have choices, they must have
access to multiple resources, pathways,
multimedia, and modes.

Typical examples of design for choice
include:

   A simple shift from providing a list of topics to choose
      from (something that looks like student choice) to asking
      the learner to formulate a question to guide their research.
      The result is that the learner has more autonomy and still
      researches the discipline area. For this to happen
      successfully, the designer/teacher/instructor has an
      important support role in listening to the learner's
      interests and helping develop a sense of inquiry.

   Encouraging personal preferences, for example one
      learner may prefer to watch a video and not read the text,
      while another might read the text and never watch the
      video. If they feel pressured to consume all of the provided
      content, the element of choice has been removed. They
      have true flexibility if they know they can achieve the
      learning outcomes by choosing which parts they engage
      with.

   Providing multiple ways the learner can explore content
      initiates flexibility. The concept of "redundancy" (see Reiser
      and Dempsey (2012), for example) is often cited as a reason
      not to provide multiple versions of the same idea or
      concept. However, in a HyFlex model, it assures the
      learner is not "missing" part of the learning.

Flat Learning

Flat learning implies there is no hierarchy of learning as such.
All voices are equal and no one group delivers the information
to another group. It implies that learning does not happen
in isolation, is social, and requires making authentic and real
connections.

       "Flat-connected learning is part of a pedagogical
       approach enabled by online technologies and has
       parallels with connected learning, but in many ways,
       it goes beyond just connecting. It uses digital
       technologies to forge connections and support
       everyday workflow, communication and collaboration."
       (Lindsay, 2016, p. 17).
The challenge with online learning is sustaining connections
beyond the face-to-face and virtual synchronous experience.
Flat learning is about being able to work with others at a
distance (asynchronously) as well as in person, and it involves
effective connection, communication and collaboration
afforded by appropriate technologies and the development of
digital literacy/fluency.

40 | Flat Learning
Being "digitally literate" means acquiring the skills to make and
create meaning and select technologies to do so. If you are
[digitally] fluent, you can self-select from a range of tools to
achieve the same outcome and navigate collaborative spaces
effectively and confidently with other people (Spencer, 2020).

   In a HyFlex learning environment, flat learning relies on
student choice (when, where and how to learn) with the
understanding that whatever mode/method is chosen, the
learning experience and outcomes will be equivalent. Flat
learning is also enabled by accessibility when design provides
for equality of access to all learning materials and all learners.

HyFlex learning and teaching flattens the
learning for all because:

   Good teaching is about learning and not content delivery.
      Therefore, in a social constructivist and connectivist
      context, learners are connected through different
      modalities using various technologies

   An individual's personal learning network (PLN) is key to

                                                                               Flat Learning | 41
      flat learning and the HyFlex approach. Learning becomes
      the energy that drives the curriculum. Student agency
      and autonomy through digital literacy/fluency and
      knowledge management can make the teacher irrelevant;
      however, an astute online teacher implementing HyFlex
      approaches understands this and uses multiple
      opportunities to connect their students with each other
      and beyond
   All learning materials and interactions/collaborations are
      available at all times (choice and access)

"Flat" and connected learning is a
multimodal pedagogical approach to
learning with and from others where all
learners have the freedom to communicate
"across" rather than up or down (Lindsay,
2016).

Typical examples of design for flat learning
include:

   Minimising closed environments. We know the
      institutional learning management system (LMS) must be
      closed to others; however, edtech tools such as Padlet,
      Voicethread, and others can be set for open viewing or
      even open access to avoid "blocking" users and to
      encourage collaboration beyond the immediate cohort
      and beyond, as required

   Providing a synchronous "backchannel" for hybrid learning
      where on-campus and online converge. Current practice
      usually divides these two stakeholder groups while in a

      synchronous session. This is alienating and not
      encouraging of collaboration. Typical tools for this include
      MS Teams chat, Padlet or a learning environment like
      Zoom or Engageli
   Leveraging collaborative authoring tools such as Google
      docs and slides
   Selecting and using a class/course hashtag for use with
      LinkedIn and other social tools that feed interactions and
      responses
   Encouraging the use of open resources and open sharing
      among learners
   Designing assessment that can be openly shared, or at
      least a part of it, such as a reflective blog post

Accessibility

Accessibility can have different meanings for different people
and contexts. In HyFlex, we define accessibility as providing
options for the learners so that they can access content, ideas
and collaborations through whichever mode they choose and
at a time and place they choose.

   The reason that accessibility is a priority for a HyFlex
environment is because of digital technology. Accessibility is
possible in previously inconceivable ways due to network
capabilities, software and hardware. With the rise in access
to networked technologies, there has been an increase in
enrolment into post-secondary formal education by groups of
people who would previously not have been able to do further
study. For example, people with children are now more likely
to return to study because they can access the learning
experiences from home, asynchronously, at a time and in a
place that fits their other commitments. The ubiquitous nature
of the internet and the way in which anyone can produce
44 | Accessibility
"learning" materials has facilitated access to informal learning
experiences, from how to knit to how to change a tyre, to
learning philosophy.

   Another aspect of accessibility is the way that learning
experiences are designed. Technologies that support different
learner needs have increased and become more widely
accepted as the norm. This includes assistive technologies such
as text-to-speech software, voice recognition, reading pens,
proofreading software, the ability to adjust text size and colour,
virtual reality and augmented reality. Those designing learning
experiences now have easier access to audio and video creation
materials, including captioning, thereby offering the learner a
variety of modes to access the content and ideas.

   An area of learning design that is perhaps less considered
is the asynchronous experience. There is often an assumption
that synchronous experiences are the lifeblood of learning, in
which the teacher interacts in real time with the learner.
However, current technologies provide asynchronous
experiences that not only provide high-quality interactions but
also allow the learner to choose when and how they will
interact.

When designing for HyFlex you may observe that there
are overlaps in the principles of Universal Design for
Learning (UDL):

   Engagement: the why of learning
   Representation: the what of learning
   Expression: the how of learning (Rose & Meyer, 2006)

Each of these is considered and presented to the learner
through numerous means. Barriers should be anticipated in
order to circumvent them early. Learning goals and objectives
should always be clear and achievable through various
pathways.

                                                                                Accessibility | 45
   If you are already using UDL principles, you will find that you
are either in a HyFlex environment or very close to it. If you are
new to UDL, we encourage you to explore the online resources
further.

HyFlex learning and teaching provides
accessibility for all because:

   The learning design provides equivalent experiences no
      matter how students access the materials

   Students are encouraged to connect and interact with
      peers, teachers and content through accessing mode of
      choice

   Flexibility in relation to modes and time frames is a focus

Typical examples of design for accessibility
include:

   providing content in different formats, e.g., a PDF as well
      as a video. This caters to the diversity of the learner cohort
      and provides entry points to content in ways that are
      meaningful to everyone.

   ensuring no students are left behind through shared
      resources in reliable places, e.g., a recording of the
      synchronous session for students not present to review; a
      handout provided in an on-campus class also available to
      online students or asynchronously from the same time

   making sure that transcripts, captions, text are provided
      for multimedia content to be inclusive of learners needs.

   designing courses in a manner that is flexible in relation to
      timeframes of completion, including assessment
      deadlines.

Attributes in context

Now that you have explored the three attributes of HyFlex
learning, let's discuss interpretation and relevance to your
context.

   Here is the diagram we created earlier sharing the
relationships between HyFlex attributes and principles.

   Use these questions as prompts for discussion with your
peers:

   How do the three attributes (choice, flat learning and
      accessibility) apply or could apply in your context?

   What are some challenges with implementing designs
      that cater for choice?

   What are the features and challenges of a flat learning and
      teaching approach?

   What are challenges with accessibility?
   What examples can you share of these attributes being

      used in your learning environment?
   How do you see the interconnectedness of the attributes

      with equivalence and reusability?
   If you were to draw a contextual relationship diagram of

      the attributes and principles, what would that look like?
      Why?

Consider your online learning challenges/problems and your
context in terms of your students and teachers.

   How HyFlex are your current approaches?
   Do you currently design learning in a `digital-first' mode?
   How do you/would you develop relationships between

      synchronous and asynchronous learning?
   Is HyFlex the `magic bullet' for how we design and

      implement learning now? Does it meet the needs of your
      context?

This is an important area for you to formulate initial ideas about
HyFlex learning based on evidence from your institution/
context/beliefs/practices.

PART III

DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES

In the past 20+ years, digital educational technology has been
the main driver in terms of facilitating a shift in approach and
attitudes toward teaching and learning. Even for people who
don't have any particular interest in edtech, it is unavoidable.
Technology is ubiquitous, and to ignore the affordances leaves
the educator exposed to poor outcomes for their students.

   If we want learners who can:

   Connect
   Communicate
   Collaborate
   Create
   Co-construct/co-create new knowledge
   Develop digital fluency

And we want teachers who can:

   Connect learners
   Facilitate communication
   Encourage interaction that leads to collaboration
   Provide for learner choice when creating and co-creating
   Encourage an environment of experimentation leading to

      skill building and digital fluency

And we want learning ecosystems that:

   Are readily accessible and intuitive to use
   Accept multi-modal responses and contributions: text,

      audio, video
   Provide for different forms of collaboration
   Encourage student autonomy and risk taking

                                                                    Digital Technologies | 53
Then we can look to the affordances of contemporary ed tech
tools to support the development of these attributes in the
learner, teacher and learning environment.

54 | Digital Technologies
Access

Access to good educational technology tools should be a
priority within a HyFlex learning environment. What is needed
is well designed educational technology tools, or taking tools
that are out there (such as social media e.g., Instagram) and
reapplying them to an educational context.

   What if we ask ourselves -

   How am I connecting with my students after we meet
      synchronously?

   How are they connecting with each other?
   What tasks are in the learning design that foster

      meaningful connection and collaboration (as opposed to
      the typical `comment on this week's content' style of
      discussion forum post)
   What choices are provided for assessment that foster
      individual as well as group responses?

When tasks are manufactured through the use of assessed
discussion boards or forums they become `false' collaborations
and communications. Fabricated for the teacher. Now that we
are all so familiar with instant messaging and social media
our expectations have changed about when and where we
communicate and collaborate so we need to be harnessing not
necessarily the actual technology but the affordances of that
technology.

   What is it about social media that works so well? Anytime,
anywhere to almost anyone. Imagine if we had that level of
captive audience in our learning environments. Well we do and
we can, if we utilize edtech tools with more understanding and
fluency.

   It is challenging to list educational technologies in an ever-

                                                                                         Access | 55

   HyFlex learning and teaching is exciting. It's transformative
for learning and teaching and might solve a range of problems
in our online programs. So, why is HyFlex not more widely
adopted?

Barriers and enablers

There are always challenges or barriers when implementing
new educational technologies to support learning. We need to
solve many of these and find or create enablers. Ultimately, it is
important to acknowledge them and find solutions rather than

58 | Overcoming Barriers
allowing them to stop us from innovating. Including enablers
in your planning is critical to future success.

   Educational technology research often explores the barriers
and enablers with common themes emerging for the Higher
Education context. We have aligned these to:

   Institutional - controlled by the institution and sometimes
      out of the control of the learning designer, academic and/
      or student. This might include access to the technology as
      distinct from the actual technologies.

   Technological - the technologies that are available at any
      given time and in any given context may add a barrier. The
      institution may provide access to the technology, but it
      may not be the technology that best facilitates HyFlex.

   Personal - these barriers are varied and may include the
      individuals' access, attitude and aptitude.

                                                                   Overcoming Barriers | 59
Institutional

Despite all the best intentions by the institution, it is often
the most difficult barrier to address. This is partly due to the
many stakeholders involved and partly due to the processes
and procedures. In the HyFlex context, the adoption and
implementation of new learning and teaching approaches,
including the use of alternative educational technologies,
requires collaboration between:

   Administrators
   ICT department staff
   Policymakers
   Pedagogical experts
   Discipline experts

Communication and collaboration around HyFlex learning
objectives at the broader institution level is crucial for success.
Beatty first coined the term `HyFlex' to provide a common
language for stakeholders in the institution. He discusses this
in HyFlex Course Design Model (Beatty, n.d.). Therefore, the first
step in implementing HyFlex in your context is to come to a
common understanding that can be communicated to all of
the stakeholders.

Things to consider:

These are the essential considerations and discussions to have
when moving towards HyFlex learning (or any other related
digital transformation) within the institution:

   Infrastructure: what exists and what is required (hardware,
      edtech software and networking)

60 | Overcoming Barriers
   Policies and guidelines: is there willingness to shift in
      support of new ways of learning

   Teacher capacity: how stressed is the teaching staff and
      what support will they receive within academic courses
      and programs

Ideally, HyFlex learning needs to start with a vision for both
virtual and physical learning (on-campus and online) and then
build from there. Often an institution divides the two modes,
on campus is, well, on campus; online means using a tool like
Zoom or Engageli to run and record sessions. Combining these
tow objectives creates the hybrid situation we shared earlier,
and this requires ICT careful setup and pedagogical knowledge
to manage the session.

Technological

Technological barriers include institutional (availability and
access) and the approach or attitude that individuals have
towards technology. Ertmer (1999) described these as first and
second-order barriers over 20 years ago, and they persist today.
First-order barriers refer to a lack of hardware, software and
networking, a lack of time to plan, and inadequate technology
and/or administrative support. Second-order barriers are
intrinsic to the person and include attitudes and beliefs about
the efficacy of digital learning and unwillingness to change.
Ertmer's framing of barriers in this way is useful when you
are trying to make a case for the use of technology. The
categorisation into first and second order can also help when
trying to identify what the barrier is and how it might be
addressed.

   The institution needs to provide the technology and the
"licence" to innovate and experiment with technology. Some
institutions are very proprietorial about what can be used,

                                                                    Overcoming Barriers | 61
which can restrict innovation. Often, the status quo is easier
to maintain through controlled strategies that do not align
with innovation or change. In some countries or global areas
laws restrict the use of some technologies in order to provide
privacy and protect user data. These `barriers' can be difficult to
overcome or problem solve. In our experience, there is always
a way, keep ideas alive through ongoing discussions and find
pathways to success.

   One goal is to have a fully integrated virtual campus for
students to experience on-campus learning and vice versa. For
HyFlex, this includes both synchronous and asynchronous
technologies, and therefore these technological aspects need
to be addressed:

   Low/poor bandwidth
   Technical support by the institution's ICT section (helpline)

      and/or third-party
   Students and staff knowing how to use the technology

      (include video-based "how to" resources for all
      newcomers)

Personal: the teacher

As Ertmer (1999) revealed it can often be personal barriers that
stop faculty from progressing when it comes to innovative
approaches like HyFlex.

   Rogers's (1962) diffusion of innovations is a good
representation of the stages of adoption and where people
might sit in terms of their willingness to try new approaches.
There may be a range of people from laggards to early
adopters, but fundamentally, most people are with the late
or early majority. These people are willing to adopt innovation
once it has been tested out by the early adopters. Rogers first

62 | Overcoming Barriers
published his work in 1962, and his book is in its 5th edition,
referencing more recent innovations.

   Other models that help to explain why the teacher may find
technology as a barrier is the Technology Acceptance Model
(Davis,1989). Davis suggested that for a technology to be
accepted, the user needs to recognise its usefulness and ease
of use in order to move towards using the technology. This is
often described using the graphic below.

Technology Acceptance Model

A HyFlex Mindset

Much of this points to the individual's mindset in terms of how
open they are to try new things and how willing they are to
take a risk and perhaps feel that they have failed (hopefully only
at first). We'd like to suggest that there is a HyFlex mindset in
which the student is at the centre of learning design, with the
provision of authentic and flexible learning for students being
the key driver. When we start with this as the premise, then we
have the motivation to work through the personal barriers.

                                                                   Overcoming Barriers | 63
Personal: the student

The student may have their own barriers to accepting the
HyFlex model, and the teacher may encounter barriers that
impact the students. Many students will not be familiar with
being given choice and flexibility, which may make them
apprehensive and fearful of what that means. If they typically
know what they need to do to get a certain grade and have
been stepped through processes, then this may be a more
comfortable place for them in the learning environment.
Students will also be on the innovation scale of laggard to
innovator, and teachers will have a cross-section in their
classes. What will the level of readiness to accept HyFlex as a
student actually be? Trying to ascertain this at the start of your
course may be prudent.

   While HyFlex is designed to be student-directed at its core,
the students may not be ready to do the directing. The work of
Gilly Salmon (2011) in her five stage model for online learning
is useful reminding us to start small and build up to more
complex and open opportunities for the students. She starts
with "access and motivation", leading to "social experiences"
that encourage students to develop confidence in the learning
ecosystem. Course design that follows the additional stages
accounts for "information exchange" and learning community
building, "knowledge construction" involving collaboration and
a move to teacher facilitation, and "development" of meta-
cognition.

   Students also need to recognise that some of the technology
and approaches we are using may not fit their initial
perceptions of a learning experience. They need to trust us
to set the scene for effective learning and to support them
through the journey. Our role is to help develop that trust so
that we can frame their experiences.

   For example, what if the student has come to class thinking
they just want to sit and get? There are some days when some

64 | Overcoming Barriers
of us would like to do that too. In a HyFlex model, we can
have experiences designed so that on those days, students can
choose the level of interaction or participation and at a later
date, if they believe they need to, they can come back to other
resources and materials. This is a more personalized approach
that potentially requires using a range of multimedia that may
stretch their comfort zone of technology. For example, using
video to be more present in an online space. This might take
some time and consideration of what their previous
experiences are.

   In order to facilitate HyFlex well we must be mindful of
student expectations for their learning environments to ensure
full engagement through use of contemporary technology
available.

The Impact of Artificial
Intelligence

HyFlex design focuses on flexible learning options and choices
for participation. The integration of Artificial Intelligence into
HyFlex approaches includes the use of tools for academic
efficiency and personalized design. In addition, approaches to
Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI: capable of generating
text, images, videos, or other data using generative models,
often in response to prompts) for students might include
fostering critical thinking, creating artefacts and developing
skills for more personal interactions leading to enhanced
outcomes. One key objective here is `personalization' of the
learning. The use of AI can compliment both the learning
process and learning outputs in ways that we might not have
even thought of yet.

Enhancing interaction with AI

Much has been written and researched about the challenges of
`Transactional Distance' (Moore, 1997) and now in the emerging
era of AI integration into learning and teaching we are realising
the power of new tools to simulate the interactions found in
synchronous learning. Student isolation from other learners
can be mitigated via GenAI. Tools such as ChatGPT can be
used to build chatbots for dialogue with students learning in
asynchronous mode who may not have sufficient autonomy
to succeed. Beatty (2024a) discusses chatbots as study aides
with capacity to interact with the student as a substitute for
instructor interaction, such as `Course syllabus explorer'. The
use of GenAI helps build a sense of community among

                                              The Impact of Artificial Intelligence | 67
asynchronous learners by emulating interaction with peers.
Examples include `Breakout companion', `Peer review partner',
and perhaps even more interesting `Breakout for three', about
which Beatty (2024a) states,

       The Breakout for Three GPT offers a simulated three-
       person breakout discussion, with the AI assuming two
       roles: a "more knowledgeable other" and a nave learner,
       based on Vygotsky's concepts (1978). This setup allows
       students to engage with peers of varying
       understanding levels, providing a rich learning
       environment..... aynchronous learners can immerse
       themselves in a simulated synchronous experience,
       similar to a genuine breakout conversation. The GPT can
       offer a summary for class debriefs and steer the
       conversation based on provided prompts, allowing
       deeper exploration of topics. Each interaction is unique,
       and students can use the GPT multiple times to further
       explore the subject matter.

The possibility of making asynchronous interactions more
interesting and accessible through AI has great potential, as
Beatty (2024b) states,

       While AI interactions cannot fully replace human
       interactions, they offer a valuable supplemental
       experience that addresses the unique needs of
       asynchronous learners, ensuring that all students can
       achieve their educational goals.

   While we are still in the early days of AI in education, the
type of access and personalised learning that AI can provide
aligns perfectly with a HyFlex approach. Consider how AI could
support your HyFlex aspirations. Some of these ideas might
help:

 Personalized learning paths adapting to the learner's
   specific needs.

 Automated content creation to support faculty to develop
   better content quicker.

 Intelligent tutoring systems in which the tutor responds to
   the learner at their own pace, when and where they have
   time.

 Enhanced engagement tracking that feeds back to the
   learner.

 Improved accessibility with automated transcripts,
   captions etc.

 Adaptive assessments linked to the needs of the individual
   learner.

   Predictive analytics to support the development of
      resources specific to where the learner is at.

   Chatbots and virtual assistants to do the `drudgery' work
      that faculty do (emails, FAQs etc).

   Automated grading and feedback to save faculty time and
      provide feedback in a timely manner.

   One key enabler of HyFlex learning is applying digital-first
design strategies that explore the relationship between
synchronous and asynchronous modes. Appropriate digital-
first design strategies can re-conceptualise student
engagement and online learning within a HyFlex classroom.

   Digital-first learning design means designing learning for
the core business of online learning. It means designing for
asynchronous online learning modes from the beginning or
"first," using techniques that provide the HyFlex attributes of
choice, flat learning, and accessibility. Synchronous
opportunities can then be placed on top of the essential design
rather than being integral to student engagement and
success.

                                                                       Digital-first design | 73
   Therefore, in support of social, cognitive and teaching
objectives, digital-first learning design means you:

   Start with the online space as the essential means of
      exchange and collaboration

   Lay out the communication and multimedia in a way that
      flows for students

   Design learning experiences that suit the modality and
      use the affordances of technology

   Create/convert all learning resources for online at all times
      from the start, e.g., there should be no handouts that only
      on-campus students receive

   Design learning activities to be interactive and
      collaborative that are scaffolded by online spaces and
      resources

Digital-first learning design means designing for asynchronous
online learning modes from the beginning or "first" using
techniques that provide for HyFlex attributes of choice, flat
learning and accessibility.

Elements of
digital-first design

Teaching presence

The element of "teaching presence" is informed by Garrison's
(2017) Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework. When learning
online facilitation by the teacher ensures productive and
sustained participation in the CoI and improves student
confidence, independent learning and socialisation of the
learning experience is encouraged and supported. This
involves regular online teacher-student communication such
as announcements. It also applies to contributions in places
where students are encouraged to engage and interact (e.g.,
forums, Voicethread, Padlet, MS Teams group).

   Teachers often state they cannot get to know their online
students unless they meet with them synchronously. This is a
fallacy, as much research has shown (Garrison, 2003; Watson
et al., 2023). However, through strategic online facilitation
(teaching presence), students often share more, contribute
more (especially if there is an anonymous option for some
discussions), and reveal more via online interaction, blogs and
portfolios than in a series of synchronous sessions.

                                                    Elements of digital-first design | 77
Figure 1. Community of Inquiry framework

Student interaction and collaboration

Aligned with Garrison's CoI framework and "social presence",
interaction and collaboration are necessary to establish
relationships as a foundation for deep and meaningful
educational experiences. Enhanced learner-learner interaction
through designed activities for formative or summative
assessment is a key digital-first strategy. This includes both
synchronous (virtual) and asynchronous modes and
encourages shared understandings, critical thinking and social
construction of knowledge.

78 | Elements of digital-first design
   Cultivating a Community of Practice (CoP) (Wenger, 1998)
relies on interaction where peer learning activities are
important in addressing students' sense of isolation. Flexibility
is assured when designed predominantly for asynchronous
communication and collaboration. Consider the student who
isn't comfortable in the on-campus classroom and doesn't
speak up. In an asynchronous online space, they can have more
of a voice, one in which they have had time to consider the
ideas of others, perhaps do some further research, and then
make a contribution. And if we use applications that promote
students using their voice or video, they also start to feel like
they are interacting with their peers in a meaningful and
humanised way despite not being in the space at the same
time.

   Learning does not happen in isolation; therefore, designing
and facilitating student interaction and collaboration to build a
Community of Practice is vital for supporting HyFlex goals.

                                                    Elements of digital-first design | 79
Interactive resources

High-quality learning media can support the student's
understanding of conceptual material by providing visual
examples of practice and contextualising the broader learning
experience. The use of curriculum-specific interactive learning
resources, including audio, video, interactive multimedia and
computer-based simulations, can provide rich and deep
engagement with content and support student learning
through visualisation, exploration and embedded feedback.
This includes immersive environments where students
undertake simulated professional practice. In addition,
assessment redesign that supports the student as the "creator"
of rich media artefacts encourages flexibility and choice of
assessment products.

   The development of interactive rich media artefacts supports
conceptual understanding of the material. In a HyFlex digital-
first environment, this applies also to student choice for
assessment and the opportunity to create visual, audio, or
graphic material to share learning outcomes.

Strategies for
digital-first learning
design

There is a range of digital-first learning strategies that can be
applied in a HyFlex classroom.

Figure 1. Strategies for digital-first design
82 | Strategies for digital-first learning design
 1. Chunking content to reduce cognitive load and improve
      student engagement.

Chunking (also called micro-lectures when applied to video)
is a form of sequential self-directed learning that involves
breaking down and selecting content for sharing. Features
include:

         Breaking away from traditional lectures (online or on
            campus)

         Rethinking the use of video, audio and animation tools
            to segment ideas into smaller bite-size chunks aligned
            with unit or module requirements, e.g., videos no
            more than 20 minutes long (pseudo lectures)

         Creative use of text, images, hyperlinks, images,
            posters, graphics and other communication means

2. Astute use of file formats and accessibility across
      platforms and within bandwidth limits, e.g.,
      understanding of the difference between PPT and PDF or
      Word and PDF.

 3. Providing access to all content to all learners at all
      times--not privileging those who attend synchronous
      events.

4. Using design elements within the LMS, such as
      accordions, drop-downs, tabs, call-out boxes, and
      headings/banners, for clear communication and
      accessibility.

 5. Inclusion of interactive elements such as quizzes, polls,
      H5P artefacts, and choice of student response (e.g., within
      the LMS or beyond using separate tools).

6. Collaborative elements that support community sharing
      and discourse for deeper learning using tools such as
      Padlet and Voicethread.

Reflection

Adopting and Applying Digital-First
Design

From the literature:

Pre-empting your own reflection on digital-first learning
design you are encouraged to explore the two examples below
for ideas and inspiration.

Example 1

In a large and busy central London university the course
lecturer Chaudhury, (2023) describes a storytelling approach to
sharing content online using MS Sway as the communication
tool. This approach replaced some/most of the online `lecture'
creating an asynchornous learning experience. Although not
focusing on asynchronous student-student interactions it is a
good example of stepping into digital-first design, using a new
tool and constructing content for higher student
engagement. The author commented:

       This "digital-first" approach, referring to the fact that
       the education model was designed to be delivered
       without in-person interaction if required, meant that
       many of the engagement problems that MOOCs face
       were relevant here as well (Chaudhury, 2023, p. 216).

86 | Reflection
Example 2

During the COVID pandemic three leading USA universities
(MIT, Stanford, Harvard) developed independent digital-first
approaches to online learning and then came together to
share and reflect on these experiences. This article (Dede &
Lidwell, 2023) discusses the possible emergence of a next-
generation model for massive digital hybrid learning based on
experiences and developments.

   The Harvard experience shares:

       The default format of instruction changed from hour-
       long face-to-face courses to short-form digital content
       with flexible opportunities for interaction. Digital-first
       experiences move beyond transferring face-to-face
       instructional strategies to an online format (a PDF of the
       classroom) to instead building on the many short-form
       digital assets created by Harvard during the pandemic.
       Hybrid experiences can draw on multiple modalities to
       personalize learning to students' preferred approaches
       (Dede & Lidwell, 2023, p. 2).

Your Reflection

How will you combine strategies and elements into the
learning design process in order to enable digital-first design?

   Think about this in your context and in consideration of the
support and collaboration provided in your institution:

   Where are you on the digital-first scale? Not at all -
      Somewhat - Getting there - Completely

   What is your usual process for designing learning? Can
      the elements and strategies be integrated into this
      process?

                                                                                   Reflection | 87
   Which of the elements and strategies will you consider
      adopting? e.g., consider the element of `Teacher Presence'
      for asynchronous learning and what technology you have
      available to apply this.

PART V

ASSESSMENT

Good assessment design can help keep the learner motivated.
Assessment can take many forms, including final summative
assessment and formative ongoing feedback. On the whole,
students come to an educational institution to receive some
kind of award for their learning, and judgement is made
through assessment.

   A well-designed assessment should make it more difficult
for a student to skip the content and go straight to the end
task. Furthermore, the students should be highly motivated
to engage if the context of the assessment and the content
are well aligned and if they are given a choice for output. This
is part of constructive alignment as described by Biggs and
Tang (1999). The research by Biggs and Tang (1999) is updated
regularly and is a great place to start with practical examples.

   Let's take constructive alignment one step further and
consider HyFlex assessment. Giving students elements of
choice will further positively impact their motivation.

Flexible Assessment

Here are some examples of how you can make assessment
flexible. Offering more than one option builds into that
student's choice.

   Presenting their knowledge
   Give multiple options about how the students will show you
what they know. Include opportunities for students to use
some of the skills they have. Someone who is good at essay
writing is very privileged when all of the assessment is writing
essays. Someone who is good at making videos would be
equally privileged if all the assessments were video
presentations. Allow the student to choose the best support for
them to achieve at the highest level. Creating a digital artefact
(with a choice of tool) encourages transliteracy skills and clear
communication of ideas through the use of multimedia.
   Selecting the part of their knowledge

                                                                    Flexible Assessment | 93
   Allow and encourage students to pick from a range of
questions/topics. Well-designed assessment tasks should be
able to provide multiple options without losing any
equivalence in the demonstration of learning. A good rubric
and clear criteria provide a scaffold for a marker-to-grade
assessment that may look a little different to each other.

   Develop their own questions and doing the research
   The learner can be given the opportunity to be a researcher
and not just a presenter of their knowledge. Supporting the
learner to investigate an area of interest within the guidelines
for the course will support their skill development in inquiry as
well as their motivation.
   Working on a project in a team
   Group work is rarely popular; however, it allows learners to
acquire new skills in communication, collaboration and co-
creation. These are especially vital when working virtually. One
approach is to require some co-created work, such as a website,
in conjunction with individual work, such as a multimedia
artefact to embed on the website or a personal reflection (or
both!).
   For team projects, the following checklist will help:

   How will students communicate online? (provide the
      facility or leave it up to them? Do you need evidence of
      communication? Is this evidence part of the assessment?)

   Where will they store planning notes and ideas? (do you
      need to see process or final product, or both?)

   Where will the final collaborative product be available?
      (presumably online?)

   Will the final product be visible to other students?

Beatty (2024) provides tips for HyFlex group work and states:

       The largest difference may be that dedicating class time
       for group discussion and process time may not be as
       effective with "mixed-mode" groups since some

94 | Flexible Assessment
       students may not be present in the synchronous
       session.
Authentic tasks that seamlessly integrate with the discipline
content
   Authentic tasks are relevant to the learner and highly
motivating. This includes encouraging the learner to connect
with professionals in their field and draw on their knowledge.
Good learning design will weave the authentic task into the
actual learning of the content so that the learner may not be
aware of the learning or the assessment.
   Although students may find working with digital media
challenging, if scaffolding and choice are provided, the
experience can build confidence in online tools and mastery of
creating communication pieces.

Technologies to
Support Assessment

With the advent of Web 2.0 nearly 20 years ago, in conjunction
with the evolution of AI apps, there is a never-ending range of
educational technology tools to use for assessment. Here is a
list to kick start your thinking:

   Websites, blogs and online journals for formative and
      summative assessment such as the use of Blogger,
      WordPress, Wix, Weebly, Squarespace

   Portfolios to capture student reflections and record and
      demonstrate professional practice capabilities, often
      created using a website tool

   Rich Media Artefacts (video, audio, animation) modelled
      on the products of the profession using educational
      technology tools such as PowToons, Voicethread,
      Camtasia, Adobe Creative Cloud, AI apps such as Synthesia
      (video), Dalle-E-2 (Images)

Reflection

Can assessment ever truly be flexible?

When designing flexible assessments, consider how to
empower students by allowing them to develop their own
research questions within course guidelines, fostering
independent inquiry. If incorporating group work, carefully
structure it to enhance online communication, collaboration,
and co-creation skills, which are crucial in today's digital
landscape. Strive to create authentic tasks that seamlessly
blend with your discipline's content, increasing student
motivation through real-world relevance. As you implement
this flexible approach, be prepared to face challenges such as
ensuring equitable assessment across different formats,
managing increased grading complexity, and maintaining
academic integrity. Address these issues proactively by
developing clear rubrics, providing comprehensive guidelines,
and leveraging appropriate technological tools to support both
students and assessors throughout the process.

   Pathways to go HyFlex
   Consider and investigate your context and pathways to
HyFlex assessment:

   How can you provide multiple options for students to
      present their knowledge (e.g., essays, video presentations,
      digital artefacts)?

   In what ways can you allow students to select which part
      of their knowledge to demonstrate while maintaining
      equivalence in learning outcomes?

   Which educational technologies (e.g., blogs, portfolios, rich
      media tools) could you use to support these flexible
      assessment options?

PLANNING AND
IMPLEMENTING

Before deciding what focus to take (and there will be choices of
course!), we ask you to evaluate your context and how HyFlex
that approach might already be.

   There are two continuums: hybrid and flexible. Read the
following descriptors to determine your and your institution's
position on each scale.

                                                       Planning and Implementing | 101
   When planning and implementing HyFlex learning, the
challenge is how to leverage the unique opportunities
provided by educational technology, including Web 2.0 online
technologies, rather than to replicate face-to-face learning
experiences.

   Web 2.0 refers to online tools that are user-generated, open,
and often free, such as a blog, a wiki or website, X, and media
creation tools. Use of Web 2.0 tools escalated as of about 2005,
affording user creation in addition to receiving information.

Planning Your HyFlex
Environment

Take this opportunity to map out a plan for HyFlex
implementation.

   Consider previous information and discussions around
HyFlex learning and teaching and choose what works for you
right now in your context and where it might take you in the
future. There is no template to follow, you are at liberty to use
this opportunity to create something bespoke and useful.

   Where you go with this is completely open; however, for
those who need some scaffolding, here are some initial ideas of
what you could produce:

   A whitepaper for your institution describing the attributes
      of HyFlex and recommendations for further discussion
      and planning

   A chart/diagram sharing barriers/enablers evident within
      your institution and your recommendations for
      overcoming them to provide HyFlex. Perhaps choose
      those barriers/enablers that are relevant:
         Institutional
         Technology
         Personal (staff, student)

   A graphic sharing your interpretation of HyFlex to be used
      as a discussion point in a future workshop, for example:

   An audio file of a conversation or monologue sharing
      ideas, questions, and thoughts about HyFlex

   A video sharing current HyFlex learning (footage,
      screencasts etc.)

   A design plan for creating (or converting) a course into
      HyFlex considering the three attributes:

   A review and recommendations for educational
      technology to support HyFlex learning
Once your HyFlex learning and teaching plan is complete, you
might like to share it with a colleague(s) for feedback.

Setting your goals

Use our planner to decide where you are now, where you want
to be and how you might get there.

106 | Planning Your HyFlex Environment
The Change Process

HyFlex learning and teaching means that all students have
an equivalent learning experience, whether they are online,
on campus, or a combination of both (as per student choice).
This may be a considerable change within your institution that
requires careful management and implementation. You may
have already started to consider this in your implementation
plan overview, so now let's look at aspects of the change
process in more detail for possible strategies. Remember that
the change process will be unique to your context; however,
there are established models and strategies to support what
you want to achieve.

Consolidation-Innovation Cycle

The future doesn't just happen--it requires careful strategising
for success. An organisation's innovation, development and
growth often follows the "Consolidation-Innovation Cycle"
(Lindsay, 2016). Consolidation of a shared vision and
organisation-wide strategies work to enable vision for
innovation and renewal. This relates to leadership strategies
within an institution.

                                                                   The Change Process | 107
Figure 1: Consolidation-Innovation Cycle Leadership Approach
(Lindsay, 2016).

Learn, Plan, Do

When aspiring to institutional digital transformation and, more
specifically, HyFlex learning and teaching, the simple mantra
"learn, plan, do" provides an organised structure.

   Learn, Plan, Do is shared here as a simplified version of the
5-step Design Thinking Process as a strategy for you to
organise change.

   Learn (about consolidation):

   Define and share what it is you are trying to achieve e.g.,
      HyFlex learning as an embedded learning and teaching
      approach

108 | The Change Process
   Identify what is already happening at your institution e.g.,
      who is already partly or fully HyFlex? What technologies
      and processes support this already?

   Identify potential barriers to further planning and
      implementation (barriers to change)

Plan (for innovation and change):

   Assess your institution's capabilities and aspirations
   Set goals and develop a roadmap for implementation
   Communicate the need for change and foster positive

      excitement and a shared vision

Do (apply innovation that leads to consolidation):

   Implement plans according to the roadmap and timeline
      in collaboration with stakeholders

   Evaluate the success and impact
   Realign and continue the `Learn, Plan, Do' cycle when and

      as needed

ADKAR model for change

Another model for change that might be useful in your
institution is the Prosci ADKAR model (Hiatt, 2006). This model
provides a systematic approach to change at an individual
level.

   Remember: individuals want the new picture painted and
then support strategies to be painted into the picture.

   Once a change is identified, the ADKAR model provides a
framework and sequence for managing people and change.

                                                                   The Change Process | 109

        here:
        https://usq.pressbooks.pub/hyflex/?p=258#h5p-25

When implementing HyFlex learning, the ADKAR model would
be useful for mapping out the stakeholders in relation to
communication strategies focused on affecting change. As we
have already discussed, HyFlex adoption involves educational
technologies that are often comforting for teachers and
learners to understand and use. ADKAR provides a pathway
for communicating what may happen, the impact, and how
knowledge will be identified, measured and collectively built.
It also provides for two-way communication and subsequent

110 | The Change Process
strategising around stakeholder ability to make the change
and how this will be reinforced. If applied appropriately, it
opens the doorway to 2-way conversations about the change.

Study

This case study shows how change process characteristics are
being applied at the University of Southern Queensland
through the "Artificial Intelligence Pedagogy Project" (AIPP),
an initiative focused on integration of Artificial Intelligence into
learning, teaching, assessment and research.

Building a Community of Practice for
change

Refer to `Elements of Digital-First Design' a chapter of Section
IV to review Wenger's Communities of Practice (CoP) model.

   The Artificial Intelligence Pedagogy Project revolves around
a CoP called the Artificial Intelligence for Learning and
Teaching Collective (AILTC). It is through this structure that
members of the UniSQ community come together around the
broad challenge of integrating AI into learning and teaching.

   The Domain

112 | Change Process Case Study
   The AILTC is an inclusive community of practice that aims
to represent a wide range of perspectives, including those of
educators, researchers, developers, students, policymakers and
other stakeholders. The shared concern is how best to leverage
AI within the higher education context. Key shared challenges
include how to integrate AI into assessment, to support staff
efficiency and to provide opportunities for all stakeholders that
are equitable, ethical, and accessible.

   The Practice
   Under the umbrella of the AIPP, the AILTC holistically
encourages connected and collaborative sharing of ideas,
experiences and resources. The development of "champions"
aims to inclusively provide support for the individuals and
groups applying AI tools and affordances into learning and
teaching. Collectively the goal is to learn how to use AI for
the greater good and raise awareness, support the desire,
knowledge and access to new ideas and practices, and foster
ongoing collaboration to reinforce the change. The key mantra
is that no individual should be expected to embrace change in
isolation from others or be left to fend for themselves during an
evolving change process.
   The Community
   As a CoP the AILTC provides ongoing virtual and in-person
networking opportunities. It offers participants avenues to
interact with peers, industry experts, and practitioners, thereby
fostering collaboration and potentially catalysing new projects
or research endeavours. A regular symposium brings the CoP
together, including external AI thought leaders, to showcase
AI-powered educational innovations, share best practices, and
disseminate research findings to the broader academic
community.

Implementation
logistics

When designing for HyFlex implementation, it is important to
consider all variables, such as logistics. There may be specific
considerations for your context; however, most can be
categorised under the headings of technology, faculty, and
design.

Technology

The technology requirements will be crucial to implementing
your HyFlex environment. You may design your environment
based on institutional technology restrictions or choose to have
the technology put in place for you.

   For a hybrid / HyFlex environment, you will need technology
integrated into your on-campus environment, preferably so
that the online and on-campus students feel connected to
each other and the faculty member.

   In a less integrated environment, students will still need to
have an online presence through effective technology that
may not be fully synchronous with the on-campus cohort.

   For a fully online HyFlex model, a range of educational
technology tools may be required for teaching presence,
interaction, and collaboration in mostly asynchronous mode.
This is where starting with tools like Voicethread and Padlet
provide a base for developing a toolkit appropriate to your
learning and teaching needs and expectations within the
HyFlex environment.

   Check with your Information Technology department and

                                                             Implementation logistics | 115
Learning and Teaching advisors about the requirements you
have to ascertain what they have and can provide.

Faculty

When organizing and designing curriculum and activities, the
staff and students who will participate in the HyFlex
experiences need to be considered.

   Individual mindsets will impact the success of your
implementation. If staff and students are open to trying new
things, you are more likely to be successful. They will accept
that not everything will work the first time and see this as part
of the process rather than a reason not to continue.

   However, consider whether the staff and/or students need
support before, during, and after implementation. Also,
determine how you will work with people who are the "noisy
naysayers." This can quickly disrupt any attempt to introduce
new approaches. Come armed with examples and research to
help counteract the negative responses in the initial stages and
reinforce (ADKAR) positive progress.

   Approaches to implementation:

   A staged pilot is recommended to build up positive
      experiences among faculty to share, discuss, and problem
      solve.

   Find and encourage some fellow champions of the idea
      (often `early adopters' of technology). Doing this by
      yourself is hard and can be demoralising.

   Start a community of practice or find one to join. It is also
      helpful to involve management to get them on board to
      support innovation.

116 | Implementation logistics
HyFlex Mindset

The adoption of a common mindset enables educator
readiness and a capacity for and disposition towards HyFlex
learning initially as an innovative idea and then as an
embedded practice. A mindset (belief or disposition) is either
the enabler or the barrier to new ideas and practices. The
model shared here (modified from Lindsay & Redmond, 2022)
suggests that an iterative process empowers educators to
develop skills, enables participation in online activities, and
potentially further influences pedagogical approaches and
shifts practice.

   Key attributes of the HyFlex mindset are connection,
openness, autonomy and innovation. These collectively
represent a foundational structure that is instrumental to
innovative practices and change.

   Connection: the attribute of connection and connectivity
implies digital fluency and an ability to work in online and
blended learning environments. Connectivity enables the

                                                            Implementation logistics | 117
educator to develop a network of like-minded colleagues
supporting virtual working relationships by confidently
applying both synchronous and asynchronous communication
modes.

   Openness: an educator who is "open" is understanding and
receptive to other ways of knowing, as well as willing and able
to adopt practices that embed sharing of ideas, resources and
collaborations around learning. An open approach leads to a
shift in pedagogy, a more flattened learning environment, less
hierarchy in the learning process, and a shift in teacher-student
relationships.

   Autonomy: the attribute of autonomy relates to choice. An
autonomous educator is able to make independent decisions
in their learning environments about access to and use of
digital and online technologies and the adoption of alternative
pedagogies. More broadly, autonomy enables educators to be
acknowledged as resilient leaders and risk-takers who cope
well with change by adopting a flexible and agile approach.

   Innovation: an innovative educator cultivates new
approaches to learning among students and peers, with a
focus on the sociability of learning, both online and offline.
The focus is on processes, not just outcomes, for learning and
assessment. Innovation in the HyFlex classroom when teaching
and for learning is the new paradigm and is expected and
acknowledged.

Design

Good design will help with implementation. Map out what you
are doing and why. Identify the problem and let that guide
your decisions. Always consider the user and design with an
empathetic approach towards what they need and how you
will support them.

   When considering technology, faculty and design for your

118 | Implementation logistics
HyFlex innovation, working in collaboration and partnership
with others will be essential. This includes the institution's IT
team and learning and teaching units (including learning
designers and professional learning leaders). These
partnerships could be crucial to success or at least to smooth
stages of implementation.

Recommendations for Implementation

We have organised some key elements that we believe are
necessary for successful integration under three approaches -
Small, Medium and Full Scale.

Supporting HyFlex

HyFlex is about choice, flat learning and access, and this applies
to how it is implemented and supported. What choices will
teachers have when they start to embrace HyFlex about
technology, design of learning, and support systems? Will
access to support and tools be assured? How? How will flat
learning be assured?

   Moving into HyFlex learning and teaching means teachers
must understand the affordance of educational technology
and how to apply these for the aspects of HyFlex they are
adopting. Two support structures may be useful: levels of
readiness and the HyFlex mindset.

Levels of readiness

As part of the implementation, the people you work with will
be at different levels of readiness across the stages of planning
and implementing. Jacka (2015) found that a guide is a useful
way to ascertain where a faculty member is in relation to
engaging with new and emerging processes. As a "pre-test",
this level of readiness guide can help in the planning stages
to support what actions may be needed to best facilitate the
implementation of HyFlex courses. This aligns with the ADKAR
model's stages of desire, knowledge, and ability (Hiatt, 2006).

   The tables below describes the characteristics that will be
evident in the faculty in relation to each level.

                                                                      Supporting HyFlex | 121

Final Reflection

Now you have reached the end of this resource...what next? We
suggest you compile your thoughts into a final reflection.

   Here are some ideas:
   Write a 500 word description of the benefits of HyFlex

      learning and teaching for colleagues to discuss at a school
      or faculty meeting
   Prepare a memo to go to a key leader in your context
      detailing advantages of the HyFlex approach and why
      your institution should consider implementation
   Consider the three attributes of HyFlex (Choice, Flat
      Learning, Accessibility) and how this impacts your
      approach to teaching and your students
   Reflect on how online learning will continue to evolve and
      the imperative of approaches such as HyFlex and AI
      integration to support the future of higher education
Whatever you do now, make sure you share your new
understandings with others. Start conversations, debates, and
focus on change for better learning outcomes.
