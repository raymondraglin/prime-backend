Preface

I first read Romeo and Juliet in my 9th grade English class. It was hard and I hated it. I got as far as "A rose by
any other name would smell as sweet" before I threw down the book. I could not believe that Shakespeare was
so famous--it was all clichés! (What I did not yet realize was that those clichés came from Shakespeare.)

This edition of Romeo and Juliet was edited by students for students. We believe that reliably edited versions
of the play should be available for free online. But we wanted ours to be easy to get in other ways as well. The
editors--Oregon State University students who remember, far better than their professors, what it was like to
read the play for the first time--carefully considered every pronoun, punctuation mark, and indent. Our goal: to
make a friendly, confidence-building edition that supported classroom activities at the high school and college
level. (For example, we wanted speakers' names to be bold so that students reading aloud or performing in class
would not miss their cues.)

One of the most radical things about this textbook is its minimalism: it has fewer marginal glosses and footnotes
than most other scholarly editions. This was a deliberate choice: the editors felt that important conversations
were more likely to happen in the classroom than in footnotes, and they wanted our edition to resist pushing
readers toward specific interpretations. As a result, our edition features a lot of white space. If, like us, you find it
helpful to take notes (and to doodle) while you read, we hope you'll print it out and make it your own.

The edition may look simple, but it's not. In order to avoid overwhelming the page with notes--but still help
the reader understand the sixteenth-century language--my students went word by word through the play,
comparing three early modern printings to select the clearest language. Emboldened by the knowledge that
there is no "authoritative" version of the play (we don't actually know what Shakespeare wrote), they also made
their own minor adjustments, typically in the less culturally iconic scenes and passages. For example, in Act 3
scene 5, Juliet's father is angry that she does not want marry Paris on Thursday. In the first printed edition of the
play (known as Q1, and printed in 1597), he says:

               But if you cannot wedde Ile pardon you.
               Graze where you will, you shall not house with me.
               Looke to it, thinke ont, I doe not vse to iest.
               I tell yee what, Thursday is neere,
               Lay hand on heart, aduise, bethinke your selfe,

In the second printed edition (Q2, printed in 1599) he says something slightly different:

               But and you will not wed, ile pardon you.
               Graze where you will, you shall not house with me,
               Looke too't, thinke on't, I do not vse to iest.
               Thursday is neare, lay hand on hart, aduise,

Our edition modernizes spelling and punctuation, but makes other minor adjustments as well:

               But if you will not wed, I'll pardon you!
               Graze where you will; you shall not house with me.
               Look to't, think on't; I do not often jest.
               Thursday is near. Lay hand on heart. Think well.

Here, the student editors have retained Q1's "But if" instead of Q2's now-archaic "But and." They have replaced

viii | Preface
the potential confusing phrase "use to" (which does not mean "used to" and would have required an explanatory
note) with "often," a word that retains the original meter of the line. Similarly, they swapped out "advise"--which
today tends to mean "give advice" rather than consider it--with "think well," a phrase that also picks up on Q1's
"bethinke your self."

This project would not have been possible even a decade ago: in the past, if you wanted to compare the early
printings up close you had to gain physical access to rare book libraries. Now, there are wonderful resources
online--my students made use of digital images and transcriptions of the early editions of Romeo and Juliet
on the invaluable website Internet Shakespeare Editions. Other essential sources included online dictionaries
(including the Oxford English Dictionary), print editions (especially those printed by Pelican and The Folger
Shakespeare Library), the No Fear Shakespeare website, and David Crystal and Ben Crystal's Shakespeare's
Words (Penguin, 2002). In preparation the editors took a course devoted to the print history of Shakespeare's
plays and studied recent scholarship on editing practices. They also interviewed high school teachers and
students about their experiences with the text.

We believe that there is no one "perfect" edition of Romeo and Juliet--different readers need different things.
This edition is ideal for first-time readers, and especially those of you who are young: its editors literally speak
your language. That said, more seasoned readers of Shakespeare will appreciate its readability and the editors'
obvious respect for Elizabethan language. During the editing process I served as a resource to my students,
lending my expertise on Shakespeare's time period as needed. I checked my students' work against the
early modern editions to ensure that they had not misconstrued particularly archaic passages and that they
preserved the play's famous iambic pentameter. They did a really good job.

Update December 2020: As is appropriate for a Shakespearean text that has existed in various versions since
the late 16th century, and in keeping with larger trends in the delivery of open educational resources, we have
revised this open textbook with the specific goal of improving access. The course in which we completed the
revision was scheduled and designed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and when I found out that we would
be learning remotely Fall term, I worried that our inability to meet face to face would inhibit collaboration
and creativity. I needn't have worried: if anything, the events of 2020 gave new urgency to our task. In the
months prior, protests over the murder of George Floyd by police and ongoing pandemic mismanagement,
among other events, had made our society's great inequities even more visible. Like many white people who
teach and research Shakespeare, I committed to a more serious and sustained interrogation of the ways that
my own practices have supported white supremacy and contributed to disparities in access to education. The
new group of student editors--many of whom plan to teach, and some of whom already are--were just as
committed to finding new, more socially just ways to engage future students in material that might be part of
a mandated curriculum.

And so we spent the Fall considering--in online discussion boards and via Zoom--how to translate antiracist
teaching practices advocated by early modern scholars of color into editing strategies; how to improve our
textbook's readability; and how to handle particularly harmful aspects of the text, including the explicit
misogyny of the play's first scene (which also happens to be the first lines of Shakespeare many young people
ever read). For ten weeks, we also debated the extent to which editing can or should mitigate Shakespeare's
status as "team captain" of a Western literary canon that marginalizes the vast majority of today's students.
The editors' introduction explains in more detail how these conversations resulted in specific updates to the
text. What I learned from working with these dedicated and incredibly resilient students is that editing is
itself a profoundly social act: they have helped me understand that the effective editor is one who makes
the reader marginalized by the text feel seen. Their edition recognizes the misogyny and racism that goes
unremarked upon in other editions; it anticipates which sentence constructions are most difficult for new
readers of Shakespeare; and it even reaches out to help overworked teachers who are interested in designing

                                                                                                                                                                          Preface | ix
culturally responsive Romeo and Juliet lesson plans but don't know where to start . To say that I wish this was
the edition I had read in ninth grade is an understatement.
In the preface to the first collected works of Shakespeare--printed after the playwright's death in 1623 and
known as the First Folio--his colleagues John Heminge and Henrie Condell suggest that if you do not like
reading Shakespeare's plays, it is probably because you do not understand them. If that's the case, "his Friends,
whom if you need, can be your guides": in other words, if you want to enjoy Shakespeare, read his works with
people who already get it. As an experienced teacher of Shakespearean drama, I can vouch that the opposite is
also true: I did not love Romeo and Juliet until I read it with students.
I hope to hear from our readers--please reach out to me with your questions, suggestions, or thoughts about
the text at rebecca.olson@oregonstate.edu.

Introduction

                                                                               

Shakespeare is largely considered to be the greatest writer in the English language. Though we may find his
writing an eloquent maze of prose today, we must remember that he was writing to every class and creed. 400
years in the future, a literary scholar may marvel over the complexity of rhyme and rhythm of a Jay Z song as we
marvel over Shakespeare's Sonnets. In his lifetime, William Shakespeare wrote thirty-nine plays, most of which
are still read and performed today. Romeo and Juliet is one of the best known, and yet Shakespeare did not
invent the story. The tragic tale of two star-crossed lovers existed for a few hundred years before Shakespeare
took a stab at it, and audiences in the early modern era were familiar with the story before setting foot in
the theater. It might seem surprising to modern audiences that this story wasn't treading any new ground at
the time of its "conception," and some might wonder why the brilliant and mighty Shakespeare might have
retold a story whose twisted ending came as no surprise to its audience. Shakespeare apparently felt driven to
write the narrative all over again, and something about his version impacted audiences so intensely that it is
today considered one of the greatest stories ever told. Why is it that Shakespeare's version affected his audience
deeply enough that it is still firmly lodged in the literary cannon? What about this story is so enduring? And
most importantly: why is it so popular?

The time period in which Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet debuted was one of particular distress and turmoil.
At the time, England was ravaged by the Bubonic Plague, which had a fatality rate of 50%. Theaters were
closed during mass outbreaks, which likely impacted Shakespeare financially, since he lived off the revenue
from theater admissions to his plays. England was also in the grips of the Catholic-Protestant divide, which
often erupted into violence. Romeo and Juliet was written, directed, and enjoyed during a time characterized
by fear, tension, and disease, effectively making it a play for people of any era, who grapple with their own
catastrophes and terrors. The role of theatre and literature (in society at large. and in...ahem...classrooms) is hotly
debated, and we cannot claim to have a definitive answer to this age-old question. We can, however, assert
that the endurance of plays such as this one speaks to their ability to move people, to speak to them in ways
that inspire their preservation through the ages. And so, we became inspired to make this age-old classic more
readily accessible to you, both in the digital format that has made its way onto your screens, or paper copies

                                                 Our Process

In an effort funded through Open Oregon State and with support from Oregon State's School of Writing,
Literature, and Film, a group of 20 students, led by Dr. Rebecca Olson, crafted this edition of Romeo and Juliet
with the vision that it be easily read and accessed by high school students everywhere. As a group, we decided
upon a set of guiding principles, which included an effort to modernize spellings that are no longer in use,
encourage your interaction with the text, and support the Shakespeare-related Common Core educational
goals. Above all, we hope that this edition will allow you, the reader, to move through the text with little need
to stop and look up an unfamiliar word, or to try and figure out what in the world a "Lanthorne" is (it's an old-
fashioned word for "lantern." Could you imagine using that word for a lantern? Neither could we, so we changed
it).

To put all this together, we created a set of guidelines to get us started. We decided which text versions of the

                                                                                                                                                                   Introduction | xi
play to use as primary sources and we settled on using one Quarto and the First Folio1. We decided that we
wanted to include some very important things like footnotes--necessary to clarify some words and concepts,
but often intimidating and numerous--but we determined that we'd keep them brief and use them only when
necessary. We also decided on some more mundane things, like the font we wanted, which is clean and easily
readable instead of that nasty Times New Roman. What ever happened to Times Old Roman anyway? We made
countless other decisions at the outset of this project, and after establishing these ground rules we separated
into editing groups, each focusing on a particular act within the play.

When the groups had completed their edited acts, we met again as a large group to review all the work
together. It was at this time that we discovered how differently each editing group had approached our
individual edited acts and scenes, while still following the same set of established guidelines. Should we use
bold for the character names? How much white space should we include? Should there be one space after a
line of dialogue, or two? How far should we indent the stage directions? What is the impact of these seemingly
trivial questions on the experience of the reader? The team set out to analyze these and many other questions.
Our deliberations were lengthy, and at times unexpectedly heated. We learned much about ourselves (and
about our apparent passion for uniform margins and un-bolded character names).

After arranging our edition into a single, consistent document, we set out to consider the other requirements
that go along with creating a new edition of an old work. We again separated into groups to address the facets
of this project. There was a group to draft out scene and location summaries; a group to establish the technical
formatting of the finished work; a group to reach out to high school teachers and students to better understand
their needs and concerns when engaging with a canonical work such as Romeo and Juliet; and a group to
ensure that there was consistency in formatting throughout the edition. We also created a group to draft this
introduction. We also identified individuals to work on creating the cover of this edition (which, we are sure you
will agree, is top notch). With the groupings settled, and the work underway, the edition that you hold in your
very hands (or upon your very screen) began to take shape.

In 2020, another class, led by Dr. Olson, has endeavored to recraft this edition. We have added sensitivity
footnotes to represent changing opinions and social standards. We have also put a lot of energy into creating
supplemental material for students and teachers alike as they become more familiar and comfortable with
reading Shakespeare.

We recognize that there are numerous other editions out there, and fervently hope that this one will be
effectively suited to your educational needs. But this may beg the question: why are there so many editions?
Why not just use the original? Great question! The answer is that there not just one original edition. The
idea of a singular "original" Shakespeare text is a common misunderstanding. Shakespeare was a 17th Century
playwright, so he didn't necessarily intend his works to be published for broad literary audiences-most
published versions were printed after his death. This being the case, there is much debate regarding the
authority of different published versions. In the particular instance of Romeo and Juliet, there are multiple
versions, all of which can be seen as authentic or "original," but are dissimilar from each other in sometimes
slight and sometimes significant ways. Some scholars believe that people who attended the play numerous
times and recorded the dialogue in writing produced the earliest versions of the texts. Others believe that these
texts were generated by a few of the play actors. Theories abound regarding the original production. Maybe
several of them are correct, maybe none, but whatever the case, this allows modern editors to have a selection
of authentic Shakespearean texts to draw from, which leads to some distinct differences from one edition to
the next. (Spoiler alert!) Did Juliet awaken before Romeo was fully dead? The text seems to indicate that she
didn't, but others have interpreted it differently. This play has passed through the hands of many, many editors
through the centuries, all of whom have left their own distinct marks; our hope is that our varied perspectives

xii | Introduction
and orientation toward our readers' needs will result in an edition that is relatable in the events and motivations
of characters that you will encounter.

                                        Shakespeare's Language

Shakespeare is famous for his plays. He is famous for the emotions and the responses that these plays inspire
in those who interact with them. He is credited with creating over 1700 original words alone in the English
language (you're welcome, Jessica). And so, when we're considering Shakespeare, we're not looking just at the
play, or the performance, or its history--we're looking at the language.

Language has acted as Shakespeare's central tool in creating some of the world's greatest literary compositions.
Both a powerful playwright and literary icon, the fundamental aspects of what makes Shakespeare's work
Shakespeare's work in the first place--and what continues to perpetuate his worldwide fame--can be
understood in some of his most recognizable moments. The average North American high school student can
identify Romeo and Juliet as the source of "Wherefore art thou, Romeo?" as easily as they can fail a math test.

When we started out to create the world's most accessible version of Romeo and Juliet, the biggest question
that we were tasked to answer was: how do we treat the language? What needs to be changed? Should the text
be completely modernized--removing early modern English altogether? What about iambic pentameter--the
rhythmic meter that makes poetry of Shakespeare's words? Is it necessary to preserve a rhythm that doesn't
seem so universal without the archaic pronunciation of the words within? Where does the line between
historical preservation and accessibility meet, and how do we land at that crossroad?

The language in this edition is thus a compilation of the First Folio and Quarto, as well as the collective minds
of dozens of students working diligently to achieve clarity and ensure comprehension. The language has been
only slightly altered, so as to maintain Shakespeare's original intent, and in order to also appeal to a more
modern audience; punctuation has been updated where appropriate; spellings have been modernized. But the
story is the same. The famous, dramatic, moving story of a forbidden love and its original contexts remains. If
we have changed anything, it is so that such a story can be loved and adored (though, perhaps with a bit more
reserve than either Romeo or Juliet display toward one another) and can be read by many, many more people.

                                     Romeo and Juliet On Stage

"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks" is probably one of the most quoted and easily recognizable
lines of Shakespeare. Good ol' Romeo and Juliet have been around for centuries, brought to life again and again
through the text that houses them. This text is read in high schools, watched on the stage, adapted for film, and
even re-written in terms of a text conversation. But where did it all begin?

Originally, Romeo and Juliet was designed to be played on a thrust stage, which extends into the audience,
allowing viewers to watch from three sides. Scenery was sparse to allow for quick action and a focus on the
carefully crafted language. There was a rear balcony staged as Juliet's window and a trapdoor for her tomb.
The play ran briefly in London following the Restoration of Charles II when William Davenant, acclaimed "son of
Shakespeare" (whether literary or biological, we're still not sure), presented it at Lincoln's Inn Fields.

Several adaptations made their way around, including a version set in ancient Rome and a version in which a

                                                                                                                                                                 Introduction | xiii
father and daughter played the titular characters in 1744, which was not widely accepted (for obvious reasons,
we think). In 1748, David Garrick, a man renowned in the world of theatre, staged a production of Romeo and
Juliet at Drury Lane and removed all sexual references and jokes present in the text. Why someone would take
the best bits out we do not know. However, this version became the standard for the next century.

When Shakespeare was staging performances of Romeo and Juliet, most all actors were men, which means
that Juliet was traditionally played by men dressed up as women. This tradition persisted until the late 17th
century. By the 19th century, playing the role of Juliet became an actress's marker of success in the theatrical
world, and by the mid-19th century women were even allowed to take on the role of Romeo as well.

Throughout the 1900s, several noted playwrights and producers adapted and toured the play. William Poel
of the Elizabethan Stage Society created a version chock-full of fast-paced action and complicated stage
directions, or blocking. Before directing the 1968 film version of the play, Franco Zeffirelli created an adaptation
of the original script for the stage, and then his film premiered in 1968 at the Old Vic Theatre in London. The
Old Vic was traditionally a venue for live theater, and had never before hosted a film screening. The Italian
renaissance setting at the Old Vic was so realistic and natural that audience members were awed by the never-
before-seen representational style of stepping into a virtual snapshot of Verona.

The film was adapted again for Baz Luhrman's 1996 Romeo + Juliet, a lush cinematic experience that
exemplified Lurhman's decadent style. This version, starring Leonardo DiCaprio, brought the tale of tragic
romance to a whole new generation of teenagers. To this day, the play is read, performed, and referenced at a
massive scale, but echoes of the original production linger.

                                 Reading Romeo and Juliet Today

The challenge presented to us in our editing of the second edition was simple: How to edit the text in a way that
creates total accessibility. We were then presented with articles and journal entries speaking on the implied
biases rooted deep within historical texts, including the one we present to you now. The task proved to be
much more difficult than anticipated. The questions had much more nuanced solutions that required extensive
discussion on how to effectively combat this biased writing. Questions like: Do we change the vocabulary? Can
we remove iambic pentameter? What do we do with insensitive language? Through much deliberation, we
decided to keep the core language used while adapting footnotes expressing the problematic usage of specific
words and phrases. These "sensitivity footnotes" are meant to explain exactly why and how the noted section
exercises human biases. We don't want to ignore the problems of the past but recognize them and learn from
them.

While everyone in the class acknowledged discomfort at passages that use human beings as a comparison
base for worth, there was also a discomfort in changing the language. The language was problematic, but
why hesitate? Through this awkward period, we decided to keep the language as a learning opportunity. It is
important to look back on the problems of the past and see the harm caused by the bias infused writing. In
order to counter those biases, the sensitivity footnotes have been added in their respective passages. These
footnotes are meant to inform you where and how biases are slipped into the pages that have been read for
centuries.

While we're on the subject of important social ramifications of the play, we feel it's important to talk about the
crux of the play's tragedy: the choice Romeo and Juliet make to die by suicide. To some it can seem strange,
absurd, or even silly. Why would anyone kill themselves over someone they met only earlier that same week?

xiv | Introduction
The suicides of Romeo and Juliet suggest that their love and subsequent marriage were more than the result
of the exaggerated emotions of a first love. What other, less obvious factors were at play? What would drive
someone to make the worst and most permanent of all mistakes? Rather than attempt to answer this question
that has followed this text around like a phantom, we'll leave you with some questions that help us contemplate
the complicated tangle of intention and action in this play: How did Juliet view her future after being forced to
marry someone she barely knew? Maybe Romeo felt locked into the family feud and was looking for an escape?
By seriously considering the motivations that led these characters to a tragic end, can we learn how to better
respond to those situations that inspire feelings of powerlessness?

We also wanted to recognize the medium of this work. A play is more than words on a page; a play is a story
full of feelings and experiences that the actors and the audience bring to the table. A play like Romeo and
Juliet is an experience that captivates and challenges the imaginations of people across generations, across
centuries. Romeo and Juliet is not a static story about a boy and a girl. It is an open story about love between
two people--a story that adapts and changes in the minds and bodies that contemplate and reenact it. We
believe this play offers a chance to explore what love can actually mean, from a wide variety of genders, sexual
orientations, and experiences. It is a story about the tragedies and triumphs of love, and its special power lies in
its ability to inspire contemplation of these ideas in all who encounter it.

Slowly but surely, our world is warming up to the idea that love is universal regardless of the identity of
the bodies involved with it. More and more, people are exploring characters with more flexible categories
of analysis, opening up new (or centuries-old) avenues of sexuality that challenge a heterosexual-dominant
narrative. Actors of all ages are subverting historically gendered roles to inspire audiences to question their
implicit assumptions. Players and playgoers are not disregarding what these stories were, but are imagining
new possibilities for what these stories could be. In other words, it can be tempting to think that the script is
rigidly set, but in actuality there is a real freedom in the performance. We encourage students and teachers
alike to embrace that freedom, to widen their perspectives and see Romeo and Juliet (and plays in general) as
tools to help explore what it means to be human.

In any case, we'll leave the answering of those questions to you. Just as we have enjoyed Romeo and Juliet in
its many forms, and from the many angles through which we have viewed it, we hope that you will enjoy this
newly revised edition!

Sincerely,

The Editors

CHORUS

       Two households, both alike in dignity,
       In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
       From ancient grudge, break to new mutiny,
       Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
5 From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
       A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life,
       Whose misadventured piteous overthrows°
       Doth with their death bury their parents' strife.
       This fearful showing of their death-marked love,
10 And the exhibition of their parents' rage--
       Which, but their children's end, naught could remove--
       Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage

       That which-if you with patient ears attend--
       Here goes unsaid, our toil shall strive to mend.

                                                                               

ACT 1, SCENE 1

       Servants of the Capulet family start a fight with Montague family servants. Benvolio, a Montague, draws
       his sword and attempts to break up the fight. Tybalt, a Capulet, sees the drawn sword of Benvolio. Tybalt
       draws his sword and, after Benvolio tries to avoid conflict, Tybalt attacks. The fight escalates. Montague
       and Capulet enter the scene. The Prince enters and commands the fight to end. Frustrated with the family
       feud, the Prince declares a death sentence on anybody who starts more trouble.

       In the aftermath, Lady Montague asks Benvolio if he's seen Romeo, her son. Benvolio tells her that he saw
       Romeo earlier, but Romeo seemed troubled. Later, Benvolio approaches to ask Romeo about the mood
       he's in. Romeo replies that he is in love with Rosaline, but saddened that she doesn't seem to love him
       back.

On a street somewhere in Verona:

GREGORY

       Aye, while you live, draw your neck out of collar.2

SAMPSON

5 I strike quickly when moved.

GREGORY

       But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON

       A dog of the house of Montague would move me.

GREGORY

       To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
       Therefore if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON

10 A dog of that house shall move me to stand;
       I will take the wall3 of any man or maid of Montague's.

GREGORY

       That shows thee a weak slave,4 for the weakest go to the wall.

1. To not carry coals: to bear no insults
2. Collar might refer to a hangman's noose.
3. take the wall: There were no sidewalks at this time, so when passing one another on the street one person would "take the

   wall," forcing the other to walk in the gutter.
4. slave: meant as an insult to someone's class. See also note to 1.5.55

       The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

       `Tis the same. I will show myself a tyrant. When I have fought
       with the men, I will be civil with the maids, and cut off their
       heads.

       Aye, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads°; take it in
       what sense thou wilt.

5. Sensitivity Footnote: Thrust...wall is a phrase alluding to sexual assault; in the context of this line, the speaker is saying
   because women are weak they are "thrust to the wall." This is an example of victim blaming and misogyny.

   PRINCE

           Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
    70 Profaners with your neighbor-stainèd steel!

           Will they not hear? What, ho! You men, you beasts,
           That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
           With purple fountains issuing from your veins.
           On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    75 Throw your mistempered weapons to the ground,
           And hear the sentence of your movèd prince.
           Three civil brawls bred by an airy word
           From thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
           Have thrice disturbed the quiet of our streets,
    80 And made Verona's ancient citizens
           Cast off their gravely-styled ornaments10
           To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
           Cankered° with peace, to part your cankered hate.
           If ever you disturb our streets again
    85 Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
           For now, all you rest depart away.
           You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
           And Montague, come you this afternoon
           To know our further judgment in this case
    90 To old Free-town, our common judgment place.
           Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

           Speak, nephew. Were you here when it began?

  BENVOLIO

           Here were the servants of your adversary
   95 And yours, close fighting ere° I did approach.

           I drew to part them; in the instant came
           The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
           Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
           He swung about its head and cut the winds,
   100 Which, nothing hurt at all, hissed it in scorn.
           While we were interchanging thrusts and blows
           Came more and more who fought on part and part,
           Til the prince came, who parted either part.

  LADY MONTAGUE

           O, where is Romeo? Saw you him today?
   105 Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

  BENVOLIO

           Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun
           Peered forth the golden window of the east,
           A troubled mind drove me to walk abroad
           Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
   110 Which westward rooteth on this city-side,
           So early walking did I see your son.
           Towards him I made, but he was `ware of me,
           And stole into the covert of the wood.
           I, presuming his affections as my own,
   115 Which then most sought where most might not be found,
           Feeling one too many with my weary self,
           Pursued my humor,12 not pursuing his,
           And gladly shunned who gladly flew from me.

  MONTAGUE

           Many a morning hath he there been seen,
   120 With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew,

           Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs.

11. abroach: in action or agitation
12. humor: fancy, whim; can also refer to mood
           And all so soon as the all-cheering sun           °of a warning
           Doth in the farthest east begin to draw
           The shady curtains from Aurora's13 bed,
    125 Away from light steals home my heavy son,
           And private in his chamber pens himself,
           Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out,
           And makes himself an artificial night.
           Black and portentous° will his humor prove
    130 Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

   BENVOLIO

           My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

   MONTAGUE

           I neither know it nor can learn of him.

   BENVOLIO

           Have you importuned14 him by any means?

   MONTAGUE

           Both by myself and many other friends.
    135 But he, his own affections counselor

           Is to himself--I will not say how well--
           Keeping himself so secret and so close,
           So far from sounding and discovery,
           Like the flowerbud bit by an envious worm
    140 Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
           Or dedicate his beauty to the same.
           Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow,
           We would as willingly give cure as know.

BENVOLIO

       Good morrow, cousin.

ROMEO

       Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO

150 It's newly struck nine.

ROMEO

       Aye me! Sad hours seem long.
       Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO

       It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO

       Not having that, which having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO

155 In love.

ROMEO

       Out.

BENVOLIO

       Of love.

ROMEO

       Out of her favor where I am in love.

  BENVOLIO

           Alas that love, so gentle in his view,15
   160 Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof.

  ROMEO

           Alas, that love, whose view is blinded still,
           Should without eyes see the path to our will.
           Where shall we dine? Gods me, what fray was here?
           Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
   165 That's much to do with hate, but more with love.
           Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate,
           O anything that nothing first creates!
           O heavy lightness, serious vanity!
           Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms,
   170 Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health,
           Still-waking sleep. All is not what it is!
           This love feel I, for that who feels no love in this.
           Dost thou not laugh?

  BENVOLIO

           No, coz, I rather weep.

  ROMEO

   175 Good heart, at what?

  BENVOLIO

           At thy good heart's oppression.

  ROMEO

           Why, such is love's transgression.
           Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast
           Which thou wilt propagate to have them pressed
   180 With more of yours. This love that thou hast shown
           Dost add more grief to too much of mine own.
           Love is a smoke raised from the fumes of sighs;
           When cleared, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
           When vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears.

       Wait, I will go along
       And if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO

190 Tut°, I have lost myself. I am not here.
       This is not Romeo; he's some other where.

BENVOLIO

       Tell me in sadness: whom is it that you love?

ROMEO

       What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO

       Groan? Why no, but sadly tell me who.

ROMEO

195 A sick man in sadness makes his will,

       In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

           For when she dies, with beauty dies her store.

  BENVOLIO

   210 Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

  ROMEO

           She hath, and in that sparing, makes huge waste.
           For beauty, starved by chaste severity,
           Cuts beauty off from all posterity°.
           She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
   215 To merit bliss° by causing me despair.
           She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow,
           Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

  BENVOLIO

           Be ruled by me: forget to think of her.

  ROMEO

           O, teach me how I should forget to think!

  BENVOLIO

   220 By giving liberty unto thine eyes:
           Examine other beauties.

  ROMEO

           `Tis the way
           To call hers exquisite, in question more.
           These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows,
   225 Being black, puts to mind that they hide the fair.

ACT 1, SCENE 2

       Paris, a member of the Prince's family, speaks to Capulet about marrying his daughter Juliet. They debate
       about whether or not Juliet is old enough, at age thirteen, to be married. Elsewhere, Romeo and Benvolio
       are talking about Romeo's love of Rosaline. One of Capulet's servants invites them to a party Capulet is
       throwing--not knowing they are Montagues. Benvolio encourages Romeo to go, thinking that it will be a
       good chance to take his mind off of Rosaline. Romeo agrees to go because Rosaline will be at the party.

                                     Enter CAPULET, COUNTY PARIS, and PETER, the servingman

CAPULET

       But Montague is bound as well as I,
       In penalty alike, and `tis not hard, I think,
       For men so old as we to keep the peace.

PARIS

       Of honorable reckoning are you both,
5 And pity `tis you've lived at odds so long.

       But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET

       But saying more that I have said before,
       My child is yet a stranger in the world.
       She hath not seen the change of fourteen years.
10 Let two more summers wither in their pride
       Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

            Younger than she are happy mothers made.

            And too soon marred are those so early made.
            Earth hath swallowéd all my hopes but she.
    15 She's the hopeful Lady of my earth.
            But woo her, gentle Paris; get her heart.
            My will to her consent is but a part.
            And she agreed within her scope of choice
            Lies my consent, and fair according voice.
    20 This night I hold an old accustomed feast,
            Whereto I have invited many a guest.
            Such as I love, and you among the store,
            One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
            At my poor° house, look to behold this night
    25 Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light.
            Such delight as do lusty young men feel
            With well-appareled April on the heel
            Of limping winter steps. The same delight
            Among fresh fennel buds18 shall you this night
    30 Inherit at my house. Hear all, all see.
            You'll like her most, whose merit most shall be
            Which one more view of many, mine being one,
            May stand in number, though in reckoning none.
            Come, go with me.

       Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO

       Tut! You found her fair none else being by,
       Herself poised, with herself in either eye.
95 But in those crystal scales there let be weighed
       Your lady's love against some other maid
       That I will show you, shining at this feast,
       And she shall scant° show well that now seems best.

ROMEO

       I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
100 But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

                                     Exit all

                                                                               
ACT 1, SCENE 3

       After a humorous exchange with the Nurse, Lady Capulet asks for Juliet's thoughts on marriage. Juliet
       hasn't thought about it much. Lady Capulet hints that Juliet should consider marrying Paris, who will be
       coming to the party tonight. Juliet agrees to observe him and consider the possibility.
Somewhere within the Capulet estate:

                                     Enter LADY CAPULET and NURSE

LADY CAPULET

       Nurse, where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.

NURSE

       Now by my maidenhead, at twelve year old I bid her come.
       [Calls to JULIET] What, lamb! What, lady-bird!
       God forbid, where's the girl? [Calls to JULIET] What, Juliet?

                                     Enter JULIET

JULIET

5 How now, who calls?

NURSE

       Your mother.

JULIET

       Madam, I am here. What is your will?

LADY CAPULET

       This is the matter.--Nurse, give leave a while.
       We must talk in secret.--Nurse, come back again,
10 I have remembered thou may hear our counsel.
       Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

NURSE

        Faith, I call tell her age unto an hour.

            Lammastide?25

   LADY CAPULET

            A fortnight° and a few odd days.

   NURSE

            Even or odd, of all the days in the year,
            Come Lammas-Eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    20 Susan26 and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
            Were born that day. Well Susan is with God.
            She was too good for me. But as I said,
            On Lammas-Eve at night shall she be fourteen,
            That shall she. Marry, I remember it well.
    25 `Tis since the earthquake now eleven years,
            And she was weaned (I never shall forget it),
            Of all the days of the year, upon that day.
            For I had then laid worm-wood27 to my dug°
            Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall.
    30 My Lord and you were then at Mantua.
            Nay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,
            When it28 did taste the worm-wood on the nipple
            Of my dug, and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
            To see it tetchy,29 and fall out with the dug.
    35 "Shake," quoth the dove-house. `Twas no need, I trow
            To bid me trudge:30
            And since that time it is eleven years,
            For then she could stand alone. Nay, by the rood°,
            She could have run and waddled all about
    40 Or even the day before, she broke her brow,
            And then my husband--God be with his soul,

25. Lammastide: August 1st
26. Susan: the Nurse's daughter, who died
27. worm-wood: a bitter plant used in medicine and alcohol
28. When it did taste: Through here, the nurse refers to the infant Juliet as "it."
29. tetchy: irritably or peevishly sensitive
30. `Twas no ned...to bid me trudge: i.e., I didn't need to be told twice to leave
           He was a merry man--took up the child,
           "Yea," quoth he, "dost thou fall upon thy face?
           Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit,
    45 Wilt thou not, Jule?" And, by my holidam,31
           The pretty wretch quit crying and said, "Aye."
           To see now how a jest shall come about!
           I warrant that should I live a thousand years,
           I never should forget it. "Wilt thou not, Jule?" quoth he.
    50 And the pretty fool stopped crying and said, "Aye."

   LADY CAPULET

           Enough of this. I pray thee, hold thy peace.

   NURSE

           Yes, Madam. Yet, I cannot choose but laugh,
           To think she should stop crying and say, "Aye."
           And yet I warrant she had upon her brow
    55 A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone.32
           A perilous knock, and she cried bitterly.
           "Yea," quoth my husband, "fall'st upon thy face,
           Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age.
           Wilt thou not, Jule?" She stopped and said, "Aye."

   JULIET

    60 And stop thou too. I pray thee, Nurse, say "Aye."

   NURSE

           Peace, I am done. God mark thee to his grace.
           Thou wast the prettiest babe that e're I nursed,
           If I might live to see thee married once,
           I'll have my wish.

   LADY CAPULET

    65 Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
           I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
           How stands your disposition to be married?

31. by my holidam: similar oath to "by the rood"

           It is an honor that I dream not of.

   NURSE

           An honor! Were not I thine only nurse,
    70 I would say thou had'st sucked wisdom from my teat.

   LADY CAPULET

           Well, think of marriage now. Younger than you,
           Here in Verona, ladies of esteem
           Are made already mothers. By my count
           I was your mother much upon these years
    75 That you are now a maid. Thus in brief:
           The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

   NURSE

           A man, young Lady! Lady, such a man
           As all the world. Why, he's a man of wax.33

   LADY CAPULET

           Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

   NURSE

    80 Nay, he's a flower, in faith°, a very flower.

   LADY CAPULET

           What say you? Can you love the gentleman?
           This night you shall behold him at our feast.
           Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
           And find delight writ there with beauty's pen.
    85 Examine every several lineament
           And see how to each other lends content,
           And what obscured in this fair volume lies
           Find written in the margent of his eyes.
           This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    90 To beautify him, only lacks a cover.
           The fish lives in the sea, and `tis much pride

33. man of wax: as perfect as a man fashioned from wax
       For fair without,34 the fair within to hide.
       That book in many eyes doth share the glory
       That in gold clasps locks in the golden story.
95 So shall you share all that he doth possess,
       By having him, making yourself no less.

NURSE

       No less? Nay, bigger. Women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET

       Speak briefly. Can you like of Paris' love?

JULIET

       I'll look to like, if looking liking move.
100 But no more deep will I endart35 mine eye,

       Then your consent gives me strength to make fly.

ACT 1, SCENE 4

       Romeo, along with Benvolio and their friend Mercutio, leave for the party. As they go Romeo claims, among
       other concerns, that he will not dance. Mercutio twists Romeo's melancholy comments into sexual jokes.
       Romeo, not interested in Mercutio's humor, says that a dream convinced him that attending the party is
       a bad idea. Mercutio launches into a speech about Queen Mab, the fairy queen, who visits people in their
       dreams. Though the speech begins in a lighthearted manner, it takes a dark turn. Romeo snaps Mercutio
       out of his speech. Benvolio convinces them to get moving and get to the party.

On a street somewhere in Verona, near the Capulet estate:

                                     Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six other maskers, torch-bearers

ROMEO

       What speech shall be spoken to excuse us?
       Or shall we move on without apology?

BENVOLIO                                              °scarecrow

       The date is out of such prolixity.36
       We'll have no Cupid, tricked and blindfolded,
5 Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,37

       Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper°.
       But let them measure us by what they will;
       We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO                                                 °dancing

       Give me a torch, I am not for this ambling°.
10 Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO

       Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO

       Not I, believe me. You have dancing shoes
       With nimble soles; I have a soul of lead

36. The date is out of such prolixity: i.e., such boring excuses are unfashionable
37. Tartar: ethnic group known for shooting arrows while moving on horseback. Bow of lath: cheap wood used for pretend

    bows. Benvolio is saying they won't have someone dressed up as Cupid introducing them to the party while holding this
    item. Sensitivity note: Tartar is any member of several Turkic-speaking peoples that lived mainly in west-central Russia. But
    in this line, used as a way to describe Romeo's "unacceptable" appearance. This oppressive language exhibits harmful
    representation.

                                                                                                                                                                                   Act 1 | 25

                                                            °mask
MERCUTIO

15 You are a lover: borrow Cupid's wings
       And soar above a common bound.38

ROMEO

       I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
       To soar with his light feathers, and so bound
       I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe.39
20 Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO

       And, to sink in it, so you burden love:
       Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO

       Is love a tender thing? It is too rough,
       Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO

25 If love be rough with you, be rough with love,
       Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
       Give me a case to put my visage° in,
       A visor° for a visor. What care I
       If a curious eye doth note deformities?40

30 Here are the beetle-brows41 that shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO

       Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
       But every man betake him to his legs.42

38. common bound: a normal jump, which was a popular dance move
39. bound a pitch above dull woe: i.e., muster any feeling but woe
40. Sensitivity note: deformities is used here to mean "flaws." The diction displays ableism, and suggests that disabled folks need

     "fixing."
41. Beetle-brows: Mercutio's mask has beetle-brows (thick eyebrows)
42. betake him to his legs: i.e., let's start dancing

       I'll be a candle-holder, and look on,

MERCUTIO

       Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word,46
       If thou art done, we'll draw thee from the mire°
40 Or--save your reverence47--love, wherein thou stickest
       Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO

       Nay, that's not so.

MERCUTIO

       I mean, sir, in delay
       We waste our lights in vain, like lights by day;
45 Take our good meaning°, for our judgment's fit
       Five times in that, ere once in our fine wits.

ROMEO

       And we mean well in going to this masque°,
       But `tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO

       Why, may one ask?

ROMEO

50 I dreamt a dream tonight.

43. wantons light of heart: i.e., carefree partygoers
44. For I am proverbed with a grandsier phrase: i.e., I know an old proverb that applies here
45. The game was never so fair, and I am done: i.e., it's best to leave when the party is best
46. Mercutio has interpreted "done" as dun: a reference to the game "Dun the horse is in the mire," in which players would try to

     lift a large log from the mire (mud). He refers to the phrase "dun's the mouse" (meaning "quiet as a mouse"), saying this is an
     appropriate saying for a useless policeman. Basically, he mocks Romeo for being mouselike and a stick-in-the-mud.
47. save your reverence: a phrase used to replace a rude word

                                                                                                                                                                                   Act 1 | 27

55 O, then I see Queen Mab has been with you.
       She is the Fairies' midwife, and she comes
       In shape no bigger than an agate-stone,
       On the forefinger of an alderman°,
       Drawn with a team of little atomies°

60 Over men's noses as they lie asleep.
       Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs°,
       The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers,
       Her traces° of the smallest spider web,
       Her collars° of the moonshine's watery beams,

65 Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of philome°,
       Her waggoner, a small gray-coated gnat
       Not half so big as a round little worm
       Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid.48
       Her chariot is an empty hazelnut,

70 Made by the joiner° squirrel or old grub,
       Time out o' mind49 the fairies' coach-makers.
       In this state she gallops night by night
       Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
       On courtiers' knees, that dream on curtsies straight,50

75 O'er ladies' lips, who strait on kisses dream--which
       Oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues
       Because their breaths with sweetmeats° tainted are.
       Sometime she gallops o'er a lawyer's nose,
       Then dreams he of smelling out a suit.

48. Sensitivity note: lazy finger of a maid is inherently sexist and undermining to the hardworking women of the time period.
49. Time out o' mind: for as long as anyone can remember
50. dream on curties straight: immediately dream about curtsies

     28 | Act 1
80 And sometime comes she with a tithe-pigs tail,51      °ambushes
       Tickling a person's nose that lies asleep,              °breast
       Then he dreams of another benefice.52
       Sometimes she drives over a soldier's neck,
       And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,

85 Of breaches, ambuscados°, Spanish blades,
       Of healths five-fathom deep,53 and then anon
       Drums in his ears, at which he starts and wakes,
       And being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two
       And sleeps again. This is that very Mab

90 That plaits the manes of horses in the night
       And bakes the elklocks in foul sluttish hairs
       Which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes.54
       This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
       That presses them and learns them first to bear,

95 Making them women of good carriage.
       This is she--55

ROMEO

       Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
       Thou talkst of nothing.

MERCUTIO

       True, I talk of dreams
100 Which are the children of an idle brain,

       Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
       Which is as thin of substance as the air,
       And more inconstant than the wind, who woos
       Even now the frozen bosom° of the North;
105 And, being angered, puffs away from thence,
       Turning his tide to the dew-dropping South.

51. tithe-pig: to pay a tax to their church, people would often choose to pay one pig out of ten
52. benefice: i.e., giving tax to a church
53. healths five-fathoms deep: The soldier would dream of toasts ("healths") that go on and on; basically, cups of alcohol that

     never run dry.
54. This is that very Mab...which, once untangled, much misfortune bodes: Mab secretely tangles horses' manes at night, which

     bring bad luck when untangled.
55. Sensitivity note: Mercutio's description of Mab plays into the concept of "woman as myth," where men describe women as

     beings with bad intentions, such as the witch/the seductress/the Medusa. This mythological aura of women is a direct
     acknowledgement that men do not understand women, and instead of trying to recognize their ignorance they instead
     portray women as unknowable.

                                                                                                                                                                                   Act 1 | 29
BENVOLIO

       This wind you talk of blows us from ourselves.
       Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

ROMEO

       I fear too early, for my mind misgives
110 Some consequence yet hanging in the stars

       Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
       With this night's revels, and expire the term
       Of the despised life closed in my breast
       By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
115 But he that hath the steerage of my course,
       Direct my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!

ACT 1, SCENE 5

       The party begins. Capulet greets guests, encouraging them to dance and have a good time. Romeo sees
       Juliet. For him, it's love at first sight. Tybalt recognizes Romeo as a Montague, and wants to fight. Capulet
       hears this and rebukes Tybalt. Capulet wants no disturbances at the party, and explains that Romeo is a
       respected youth in the community.

       Romeo approaches Juliet, touching her hand. They flirt back and forth and eventually kiss. The Nurse
       finds Juliet and beckons her away. Romeo asks the Nurse who Juliet is. The Nurse tells him she's Capulet's
       daughter. Juliet is intrigued by Romeo, and convinces the Nurse to find out who he is. The Nurse finds out,
       and tells Juliet that Romeo is a Montague. Romeo and Juliet are each crushed to find out the identity of
       the other. They both feel powerful longing for one another despite their family conflict.

Inside the Capulet estate:

                                     Enter SERVINGMEN with napkins

PETER

       Where's Potpan, that he does not help us clear away? He took a plate? He eats from it?

30 | Act 1
FIRST SERVINGMAN

       When good manners are found in just one or two men's hands,
       and they unwashed too, `tis a foul thing.

SECOND SERVINGMAN

5 Take away the joint stools, remove the sideboards, and the plates
       too, good thou, save me a piece of marzipan,56 and if thou loves
       me, let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.57

                                     Enter ANTHONIE and POTPAN

       Anthonie and Potpan!

ANTHONIE

       Aye, boy, ready.

PETER

10 You are looked for and called for, asked for and sought for in the
       great chamber.

POTPAN

       We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys,
       Be brisk for now, then the longest liver takes all.

    25 And quench the fire. The room has grown too hot.
            Ah sirrah, this unlooked-for sport feels well.
            [To COUSIN] Nay sit, nay sit, good cousin Capulet,
            For you and I are past our dancing days.
            How long is `t now since last yourself and I
    30 Were in a mask?

   COUSIN CAPULET

            By'r Lady,59 about thirty years.

   CAPULET

            What man, `tis not so much, `tis not so much.
            `Tis since the nuptial° of Lucentio,
            Come the years as quickly as they will,
    35 Some five and twenty years than last we masked.

   COUSIN CAPULET

            `Tis more, `tis more, his son is older, sir.
            His son is thirty.

   CAPULET

            Will you tell me that?
            His son was but a ward° two years ago.

   ROMEO

    40 What lady is that which does enrich the hand of yonder Knight?

   SERVINGMAN

            I know not, sir.

59. By'r Lady: an exclamation derived from the phrase "by our Lady"

45 Like a rich jewel in an Ethiop's° ear,
       Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear.60
       So shows like a snowy dove trooping with crows,
       That yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
       When dancing done, I'll find her place of stand,
50 And touching hers, make blessèd my rude hand.
       If my heart loved till now, forswear° it sight,
       For I never saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT

       This by that voice, should be a Montague.
       Fetch me my rapier,61 boy.

55 How dares the slave62

       Come hither covered with a masked face,
       To laugh and scorn at our ceremony?
       Now, by the stock° and honor of my kin,
       I'll strike him dead, and hold it not a sin.

CAPULET

60 Why, how now, kinsman? Wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT

       Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe.
       A villain that is hither come in spite,
       To scorn at our ceremony this night.

CAPULET

       Young Romeo, is it?

60. Sensitivity note: Ethiope is a shortening of "Ethiopian," which in the period written implies a Black person. The word evokes
     contrast: according to this language, rich jewelry stands out on a Black person's skin, as the moon against the night. This is
     an example of how language is used in an oppressive way without an overt statement of racism.

61. rapier: a thin, sharp sword
62. Sensitivity note: the word slave was probably meant as an insult to his class or as a way to say rascal. America, specifically the

     United States, has a very radicalized history of slavery; when this play was first performed, modern ideas of race were starting
     to develop and England was at the start of a long period of colonization and engagement in the Atlantic slave trade.

                                                                                                                                                                                   Act 1 | 33
   TYBALT

    65 `Tis he, that villain Romeo.

   CAPULET

            Content thee, gentle cousin. Let him alone.
            He bears himself like a real gentleman.
            And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
            To be a virtuous and well-governed youth.
    70 I would not, for the wealth of all this town,
            Here in my house do him disparagement.
            Therefore be patient, take no note of him.
            It is my will, so if this thou respect,
            Show a fair presence, and give up those frowns
    75 Which are ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

   TYBALT

            It fits, when such a villain is a guest.
            I'll not endure him.

   CAPULET

            He shall be endured.
            What, lordful63 boy! I say he shall. Go to.
    80 Am I the master here or you? Go to.
            You'll not endure him. God shall mend my soul!
            You'll make a mutiny among my guests:
            You will set chaos here. You'll be the cause!

   TYBALT

            But Uncle, he shames us.

   CAPULET

    85 Go to, go to.
            You are a saucy boy. Is't so, indeed?
            This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what.
            Must you contradict me? Marry, `tis time-
            [To GUESTS] Well said, my hearts -- [To TYBALT] You are a young fool. Go.

    90 Be quiet, or -- [To SERVANTS] More light, more light! -- [To TYBALT] For shame,
            I'll make you quiet. -- [To GUESTS] What, cheerly my hearts!

63. lordful: lordly. Tybalt is being chastised for his presumptive attitude.

    34 | Act 1
TYBALT

       Patience forced, with willful choler meeting,
       Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
       I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall,
95 Now seeming sweet, convert to bitterest gall.

ROMEO

       If I profane with my unworthiest hand
       This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this:
       My lips, two blushing pilgrims, readily stand,
       To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JULIET

100 Good Pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much.
       Such mannerly devotion shows in this,
       For saints have hands, that pilgrims' hands do touch,
       And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO

       Have not saints lips? And holy palmers too?

JULIET

105 Aye, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO

       O then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do,
       And pray. Grant thou, lest faith turn to despair?

JULIET

       Saints do not move; they grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO

       Then move not while my prayer's effect I take.
110 Thus from my lips, by thine, my sin is purged.

                                     They kiss

CHORUS

       Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
       And young affection gapes° to be his heir
       That fair for which love groaned for and would die,
       With tender Juliet matched, is now not fair.
5 Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
       Alike bewitched by the charm of looks,
       But to his foe supposed he must complain,
       And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
       Being held a foe, he may not have access
10 To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
       And she as much in love, her means much less
       To meet her new-beloved anywhere:
       But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
       Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

BENVOLIO

5 He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall.
       Call, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO

       Nay, I'll conjure° too.
       Romeo, Humors, Madman, Passion, Lover,
       Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh,
       Speak but one rhyme, and I'll be satisfied:
10 Cry out at me, "Aye me," pronounce but "love" and "dove."
       Speak to my gossip° Venus one fair word,
       One nickname for her pureblind° son and heir,1
       Young Abraham: Cupid-he that shot so true,
       When King Cophetua2 loved the beggar maid.
15 He hears me not, he stirreth not, he moveth not.
       The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
       I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
       By her high forehead,3 and her scarlet lip,
       By her fine foot, straight leg, and quivering thigh,
20 And the domains that there adjacent lie,4
       That in thy likeness, thou appear to us.

BENVOLIO

       And if he hears you, that will anger him.

MERCUTIO

       This cannot anger him. It would anger him
       To raise a spirit in his mistress's circle,
25 Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
       Till she had laid it, and conjured it down.

1. Sensitivity note: Cupid is the Greek god of love, often portrayed as a young winged boy wearing a blindfold and carrying a
   bow and arrow. This is meant to symbolize the randomness of love and attraction, and is where we find the phrase "Love is
   blind".

2. King Cophetua: An African king who had no interest in women until he fell in love with a beggar woman outside his palace.
3. high forehead: a sign of female beauty
4. Sensitivity note: In referring to and openly discussing Rosaline's body, Mercutio is being purposefully crude in order to draw

   out Romeo. This type of bawdy humor was a mark of Shakespeare's comedy, and was often done at the expense of the
   female characters.

   40 | Act 2
       That were some spite. My invocation°                                                                 °appeal
       Is fair and honest, and, his mistress's name,                                                        °humid
       I conjure only but to raise him up.

BENVOLIO

30 Come, he hath hidden himself among these trees
       To be comforted by the humorous° night.
       Blind is his love, which best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO

       If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
       Now he will sit under a medlar tree,5
35 And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit,
       As maids call medlars when they laugh alone.
       O Romeo, that she were-O that she were
       An open arse, and thou a "poperin" pear.6
       Romeo, goodnight, I'll go to my trundle bed,
40 This field bed is too cold for me to sleep.
       Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO

       Go then, for it is in vain
       To seek him here that means not to be found.

                                     Exit BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

ROMEO

       He laughs at scars that never felt a wound.



ACT 2, SCENE 2

       Juliet appears in a window above Romeo, and she thinks she's alone. She talks to herself, lamenting
       Romeo's nature as a Montague. She wishes he would abandon his name, or that she could abandon hers,
       so that they could be together. Upon hearing this, Romeo reveals himself and professes his love to Juliet.
       Juliet shares the feelings of love, but worries that Romeo's feelings might be fleeting. The Nurse calls for

       Juliet, and the couple once again declares their love for each other, Juliet promising to send somebody to
       him at nine the next morning.

In the Capulet orchard:

                                     Enter JULIET on balcony

ROMEO                                                                                   °communicates

       But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?
       It is the East, and Juliet is the Sun.
       Arise, fair Sun, and kill the envious Moon,
       Who is already sick and pale with grief
5 That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
       Be not her maid, since she is envious,
       Her vestal livery7 is but sick and green,
       And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off.
       It is my lady, O it is my love, O that she knew she were.
10 She speaks, yet she says nothing. What of that?
       Her eye discourses°; I will answer it.
       ...I am too bold. `Tis not to me she speaks:
       Two of the fairest stars in all the Heaven,
       Having some business, do entreat her eyes
15 To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
       What if her eyes were there and they in her head?
       The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars
       As daylight does a lamp; her eye in Heaven
       Would through the airy region stream so bright
20 That birds would sing and think it were not night.
       See how she leans her cheek upon her hand?
       O, that I were a glove upon that hand
       That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET

       Aye, me.

ROMEO

25 She speaks!
       O, speak again, bright Angel! For thou art
       As glorious to this night, being over my head
       As is a winged messenger of Heaven
       Unto the white, upturned, wondering eyes

30 Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him

ROMEO

[To himself] Shall I hear more or shall I speak at this?

JULIET

       `Tis but thy name that is my enemy.
       Thou art thou self, though, not a Montague.
40 What's Montague? It is nor hand nor foot,
       Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
       Belonging to a man.
       What's in a name? That which we call a rose
       By any other name would smell as sweet.
45 So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called,
       Retain that divine perfection which he owes
       Without that title. Romeo, doff° thy name,
       And for thy name which is no part of thee,
       Take all myself.

ROMEO

50 I take thee at thy word,
       Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized.
       Henceforth, I never will be Romeo.

JULIET

       What man art thou, that thus bescreened° by night,
       So stumbles on my counsel°?

ROMEO

55 By a name, I know not how to tell thee who I am.
       My name, dear Saint, is hateful to myself
       Because it is an enemy to thee.
       Had I it written, I would tear the word.
JULIET                                                                          °fly over

       My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
60 Of thy tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound.

       Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO

       Neither, fair Saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET

       How camest thou hither?
       Tell me, and wherefore?
65 The orchard walls are high and hard to climb
       And the place death, considering who thou art,
       If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO

       With love's light wings did I o'erperch° these walls,
       For stony limits cannot hold love out,
70 And what love can do, that dares love attempt,
       Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.

JULIET

       If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO

       Alas, there lies more peril in thine eyes
       Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet,
75 And I am proof° against their enmity°.

JULIET

       I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO

       I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes,
       And, but thou love me, let them find me here.
       My life were better ended by their hate
80 Than death prolonged, wanted of thy love.

          By love, that first did prompt me to inquire.
          He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.                                                                      Act 2 | 45
          I am no pilot; yet, were thou as far
  85 As the vast shore washeth with the farthest sea,
          I should adventure for such merchandise.

  JULIET

          Thou knowest the mask of night on my face,
          Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
          For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight.
  90 Fain° would I dwell on form°. Fain, fain deny
          What I have spoke. But farewell complements°!
          Dost thou love me? I know thou wilst say "Aye,"
          And I will take thy word. Yet, if thou swear'st,
          Thou might prove false. At lovers' perjuries
  95 They say Jove8 laughs. O gentle Romeo
          If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully.
          Or if thou think I am too quickly won,
          I'll frown and be perverse°, and say thee nay
          So thou wilt woo; but else not for the world.
  100 In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond:
          And therefore thou might think my behavior light°.
          But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
          Than those who have more cunning to be strange°.
          I should have been more strange, I must confess,
  105 But that thou overheard, ere I was `ware,
          My true love's passion. Therefore, pardon me,
          And not impute this yielding to light love,
          Which the dark night hath so discovered.

  ROMEO

          Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow,
  110 That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

  JULIET

          O swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,

ROMEO

       What shall I swear by?

JULIET

115 Do not swear at all.
       Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
       Which is the god of my idolatry°,
       And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO

       If my heart's dear love--

JULIET

120 Well, do not swear. Although I joy in thee,
       I have no joy in this contract tonight.
       It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden,
       Too like the lightning which doth cease to be
       Ere one can say, "It lightens." Sweet, good night.

125 This bud of love by summer's ripening breath
       May prove a beauteous flower when we next meet.
       Goodnight, goodnight! As sweet repose and rest,
       Come to my heart, as that within my breast.

ROMEO

       O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET

130 What satisfaction can'st thou have tonight?

ROMEO

       Th' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET

       I gave thee mine before thou did'st request it,
       And yet I wish it would to give again.

       Friar Lawrence carries a basket of herbs and plants as he contemplates the goodness of the earth. Romeo
       finds the friar. The friar notices that Romeo hasn't slept, and asks if Romeo slept with Rosaline in sin.
       Romeo denies it and describes his new love of Juliet. The friar is concerned at how quickly Romeo's feelings
       have changed. Romeo convinces the friar to perform a wedding for Romeo and Juliet. The friar hopes that
       some good may come of it, perhaps even an end to the feud between the Capulets and Montagues.

45 God pardon sin! Wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO

       With Rosaline, my ghostly Father? No,
       I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR

       That's my good son! But where hast thou been, then?

ROMEO

       I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again.
50 I have been feasting with mine enemy

       Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
       And, by me, wounded. Both our remedies
       Within thy help and holy physic° lies.
       I bear no hatred, blessed man: for now
55 My intervention likewise steads° my foe.

FRIAR

       Be plain, good son, and homely° in thy drift.
       Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift°.

ROMEO

       Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
       On the fair daughter of rich Capulet.
60 As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine,
       And all combined, save what thou must combine
       By holy marriage. Where, and when, and how
       We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow
       I'll tell thee as we pass, but this I pray:
65 That thou consent to marry us today.

FRIAR

       Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
       Is Rosaline that thou didst love so dear

52 | Act 2
           So soon forsaken? Young men's love then lies       °Jesus °salt water; tears
           Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.                             °scolded
    70 Jesu° Maria, what a deal of brine°                                             °advised
           Hath washed thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline?
           How much salt water thrown away in waste,                                    Act 2 | 53
           To season13 love, that of it doth not taste.
           The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    75 Thy old groans ring yet in mine ancient ears.
           Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
           Of an old tear that is not washed off yet.
           If ever you were you, and these woes thine,
           Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline.
    80 And art thou changed, pronounce this sentence then:
           Women may fall14 when there's no strength in men.

   ROMEO

           Thou chidest° me oft for loving Rosaline.

   FRIAR

           For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

   ROMEO

           And bad'st° me bury love.

   FRIAR

    85 Not in a grave
           To lay one in, another out to have.

   ROMEO

           I pray thee, chide me not. Her I love now
           Doth grace for grace and love for love allow.
           The other did not so.

   FRIAR

    90 O, she knew well,
           Thy love did read by rote,15 and could not spell.

13. To season: as in to salt
14. Women may fall: women will fail morally
15. by rote: memorization without understanding
       But come young waverer,16 come, go with me,
       In one respect I'll thy assistant be,
       For this alliance may so happy prove,
95 To turn your households' rancor to pure love.

ROMEO

       O, let us hence. I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR

       Wisely and slow. They stumble that run fast.

                                     Exit all

                                                     

ACT 2, SCENE 4

       Benvolio and Mercutio wonder where Romeo has been. Benvolio found out from a Montague servant that
       Romeo never returned home the night before. Benvolio tells Mercutio that Tybalt has challenged Romeo
       to a duel. Mercutio describes why he hates Tybalt. When Romeo arrives, Mercutio mocks Romeo for being
       weak because of his love for Rosaline. Romeo neglects to tell them about Juliet. The Nurse enters with a
       Capulet servant, Peter. Romeo tells her to pass on a message: have Juliet meet him for confessional at Friar
       Lawrence's cell that afternoon, where Friar Lawrence will marry them. The Nurse agrees.
Somewhere in Verona; morning:

                                     Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

MERCUTIO

       Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home tonight?

BENVOLIO

       Not to his father's. I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO

       Why, that same pale, hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, torments
       him so, that he will sure run mad.

16. young waverer: indecisive young man

5 Tybalt, the kinsman to old Capulet,
       Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

MERCUTIO

       A challenge, I would swear.

BENVOLIO

       Romeo will answer it°.

MERCUTIO

       Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO

10 Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO

       Alas, poor Romeo, he is already dead: stabbed with a white
       wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very
       pin17 of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft.18 And is
       he a man to encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO

15 Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO

       More than the Prince of Cats,19 I can tell you. O, he's the
       courageous Captain of Compliments. He fights like you sing
       pricksong,20 keeps time, distance and proportion; he rests, his
       minim21 rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom. The very
20 butcher of a silk button, a dualist, a dualist; a gentleman of the
       very first house,22 of the first and second cause; ah, the immortal

17. pin: peg marking the center of a target
18. butt-shaft: arrow with no barb
19. Prince of Cats: a figure from a popular story, Reynard the Fox, who is also called Tybalt
20. Pricksong: or "pricked-song," is music performed from written notation, instead of from memory or by ear

       that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies, these
       fashion-mongers, these pardon-me's, who stand so much on the
       new form that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench. O, their

       Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

       fishified! Now is he for the numbers° that Petrarch flowed in.
       Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench; marry, she had a
35 better love to be-rhyme her; Dido, a dowdy;28 Cleopatra, a gipsy;

       two, but not worth mention.
       [To Romeo] Signior Romeo, bonjour! There's a French salutation to
       your French slop°. You gave us the counterfeit30 fairly last night.

ROMEO

40 Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit
       Did I give you?

23. the immortal...the hay: Italian fencing terms
24. pox: exclamation of irritation
25. antic: possibly grotesque or "antique," though due to the era's spelling and the context "antic" is likely
26. their bones: pun on French "bon"
27. roe: fish eggs, or the "ro" in Romeo
28. dowdy: unattractively dressed woman
29. Laura...Thisbe: classical figures who killed themselves for love
30. You gave us the counterfeit: i.e., you ditched us

  ROMEO

           Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was vital, and in such a case
           as mine a man may strain courtesy.

  MERCUTIO

   45 That's as much as to say: Such a case as yours constrains a man to
           bow in the hams.

  ROMEO

           Meaning to curtsy.

  MERCUTIO

           Thou hast most kindly hit it.

  ROMEO

           A most courteous explanation.

  MERCUTIO

   50 Nay, I am the very pink° of courtesy.

  ROMEO

           Pink for flower.

  MERCUTIO

           Right.

           Why, then is my pump well flowered.31

31. my pump well flowered: i.e., my feet are tired from dancing

           Well said. Follow me this jest now, till thou has worn out thy
    55 pump, that when the single role of it is worn, the jest may remain,

           after the wearing, solely singular.

   ROMEO

           O single-soled jest,32 solely singular for the singleness.

   MERCUTIO

           Come between us, good Benvolio. My wits fail.

   ROMEO

           Swits and spurs, swits and spurs,33 or I'll win this match.

   MERCUTIO

    60 Nay, if our wits run the wild goose chase, I am done: for thou
           hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than I am sure I
           have in my whole five. Was I with you there for the goose?

   ROMEO

           Thou wast never with me for anything when thou was not there
           for the goose°.

   MERCUTIO

    65 I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

   ROMEO

           Nay, good goose, bite not.

   MERCUTIO

           Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most sharp sauce.

       And is it not, then, well served to a sweet goose?

       O, here's a wit like cheveril° that stretches from an inch narrow
70 to an ell° broad.

ROMEO

I stretch it out for that word "broad"°, which added to the goose,         °fat

proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO                                                                                                      °idiot

       Why, is not this better now than groaning for love? Now art thou
       sociable; now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art
75 as well as by nature: for this riveling love is like a great natural°,
       that runs lolling° up and down to hide his bauble° in a hole.

BENVOLIO

       Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO

       Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.34

BENVOLIO

       Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO

80 O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short: For I was come
       to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupy the
       argument no longer.

       they say. For the gentlewoman is young, and therefore, if you
140 should deal double° with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
       to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing°.

ROMEO

       Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress, I protest46 unto

       thee--

NURSE

       Good heart, and in faith, I will tell her as much. Lord, Lord, she
145 will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO

       What wilt thou tell her Nurse? Thou dost not hear me.

NURSE

       I will tell her, sir, that you do protest, which as I take it, is a
       gentlemanlike offer.

ACT 2, SCENE 5

       Juliet waits for the Nurse to return. When the Nurse returns, Juliet begs her for information. The Nurse
       delays, saying she's too tired and her body is too sore. Juliet pressures her until the Nurse gives in and tells
       her that Romeo is waiting to marry her at Friar Lawrence's cell.
Somewhere outside the Capulet estate:

                                     Enter JULIET

       The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse.
       In half an hour she promised to return.
       Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so:
       O, she is lame!55 Love's heralds should be thoughts
5 Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams
       Driving back shadows over lowering hills.
       Therefore do nimble-pinioned doves draw Love,56
       And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid57 wings.
       Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
10 Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve,
       Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
       Had she affections and warm, youthful blood,
       She would be as swift in motion as a ball,
       My words would bandy° her to my sweet love,
15 And his to me. But old folks,
       Many feign as they were dead,
       Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead.

                                     Enter NURSE and PETER

       O God, she comes. O, honey Nurse, what news?
       Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

NURSE

55. Sensitivity note: "Lame," as used here, means feeble or slow. Though "lame" is primarily used to describe someone who is
    disabled in their leg or foot, it has evolved to mean "uninspiring" or "slow." It is important to be conscious of using words
    related to disability in a derogatory manner, as it can contribute to a negative connotation surrounding words that are still
    primarily used to objectively describe differently-abled individuals.

56. nimble-pinioned doves draw Love: as doves pull Venus in her chariot
57. Cupid: son of Venus and god of desire, affection, and love

   JULIET

            Now, good sweet Nurse--
            O, Lord, why lookest thou sad?
            Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily.
            If good, thou shames the music of sweet news
    25 By playing it to me with so sour a face.

   NURSE

            O, I am weary. Let me rest awhile.
            Fie,58 how my bones ache! What a jaunt I had!

   JULIET

            I would thou had'st my bones, and I thy news.
            Nay, come, I pray thee, speak. Good, good Nurse, speak.

   NURSE

    30 Jesu, what haste? Can you not wait awhile?
            Do you not see that I am out of breath?

   JULIET

            How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
            To say to me, that thou art out of breath?
            The excuse that thou dost make in this delay,
    35 Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
            Is thy news good or bad? Answer to that.
            Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance.59
            Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

   NURSE

            Well, you have made a foolish choice. You know not how to
    40 choose a man. Romeo, no, not he, though his face be better than

            any man's; and his leg excels all mens'; and for a hand, and a foot,
            and a body, though not much to talk on, yet they are past

ACT 2, SCENE 6

       Romeo and Friar Lawrence wait at the cell. Romeo says his current joy far outweighs any misfortune that
       may come. Juliet arrives. They all exit and the friar performs the wedding.
Friar Lawrence's cell in Verona:

                                     Enter FRIAR and ROMEO

FRIAR

       So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
       That, after hours, with sorrow chide us not!

62. The Nurse is enduring pain so that Juliet may find happiness. However, she suggests that Juliet will soon be the one
     enduring pain for the pleasure of another when she consummates her marriage with Romeo. The implication is that it will
     be Juliet's burden as a wife to please her husband. This fits the comedic albeit insensitive tone typical of the Nurse.

                                                                                                                                                                                  Act 2 | 69

ACT 3, SCENE 1

       Benvolio urges Mercutio to come away with him and avoid the Capulets in the streets. Mercutio brushes
       him off. Tybalt and other Capulets arrive, whom Mercutio taunts. Benvolio tries to move the conflict
       somewhere private, but Romeo interrupts with his arrival. Tybalt challenges him to fight, citing prior
       grievances; Romeo refuses and attempts to de-escalate the situation. Mercutio goads Tybalt into a duel,
       which Romeo tries and fails to stop. Tybalt stabs Mercutio, who in his dying moments curses both the
       Montague and Capulet houses. Benvolio informs Romeo that Mercutio is dead; upon re-encountering
       Tybalt, Romeo fights and kills him. Benvolio convinces Romeo to flee before passersby arrive. The Prince
       and both families then arrive to the scene. Benvolio explains what happened, but Lady Capulet, observing
       Benvolio to be biased, urges the Prince to punish the Montague family by executing Romeo. The Prince
       chooses instead to banish Romeo from the city.

On a street somewhere in Verona:

                                     Enter MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO

       I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire,
       The day is hot, the Capulets are abroad,
       And if we meet we shall not `scape a brawl,
       For these hot days is the mad blood stirring.

5 Thou art like one of these fellows who, when he enters the
       confines of a tavern, claps down his sword upon the table and
       says "God send me no need of thee," but under the influence
       of the second cup, draws it on the drawer°, when indeed there is no
       need.

BENVOLIO

10 Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO

       Come, come, thou art such a Jack in thy moods as any in Italy,

  15 Nay, an there were two such, we should have none shortly, for          °good afternoon

          hast. Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts°, having no
          other reason than that thou hast hazel eyes. What eye but such

  20 an eye would spy out such a quarrel? Thy head is as full of
          quarrels as an egg is full of meat, and yet thy head has been
          beaten as addled° as an egg from quarrelling. Thou once
          quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath
          wakened thy dog that had lain asleep in the sun. Didst thou not

  25 fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet° before Easter?
          With another for tying his new shoes with old ribbons? And
          thou wilt tutor2 me from quarrelling?

PRINCE

150 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO

       Tybalt here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay.
       Romeo that spoke him fair°, bade him bethink
       How nice° the quarrel was, and urged withal
       Your high displeasure. All this--uttered
155 With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bowed--
       Could not make truce with the unruly spleen°
       Of Tybalt, deaf to peace, who straightway tilts
       With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
       Who, just as hot, turned deadly point to point,
160 And, with a martial° scorn, with one hand beat
       Cold death aside, and with the other sends
       It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity
       Retorts it. Romeo, he cried aloud:
       "Hold friends! Friends, part!" and, swifter than his tongue,
165 His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
       And `twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
       An envious° thrust from Tybalt hit the life
       Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled.
       But, by and by, came back to Romeo,
170 Who had but newly entertained revenge,
       And to't they went like lightning, for ere I
       Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain.
       And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and flee.
       This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET

175 He is a kinsman of the Montagues.
       Affection makes him false; he speaks not true--
       Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
       And all those twenty could but kill one life.

       Romeo slew him; he slew Mercutio.
       Who now the price of his dear blood16 doth owe?

MONTAGUE

       Not Romeo, Prince. He was Mercutio's friend.

PRINCE

       And for that offense
       Immediately we do exile him hence.
       I have an interest in your hearts' proceeding---
       My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding.
190 But I'll amerce° you with so strong a fine
       That you shall all repent the loss of mine.
       I will be deaf to pleading and excuses.
       No tears, no prayers, shall bribe away abuses.
       Therefore use none. Let Romeo hence in haste;
195 Else, when he is found, that hour is his last.
       Bear hence this body and obey our will.
       Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

ACT 3, SCENE 2

       Juliet impatiently waits to be with Romeo again. The Nurse returns and is evasive about what happened
       before finally explaining that Romeo killed Tybalt and was subsequently banished. In shock, Juliet defends
       Romeo to the nurse and tries to feel relief that her husband survived rather than the other way around.
       She despairs at Romeo's banishment. The Nurse offers to bring Romeo to her for one final night before he
       leaves; Juliet agrees and sends the Nurse with the token of a ring.

65 O courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,

       That ever I should live to see thee dead!

JULIET

       What storm is this that blows so contrary?
       Is Romeo slaughtered? And is Tybalt dead?
       My dearest cousin and my dearer lord?
70 Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom,27
       For who is living if those two are gone?

NURSE

       Tybalt is gone and Romeo banished.
       Romeo that killed him: he is banished.

JULIET

       O God, did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

NURSE

75 It did, it did. Alas the day, it did.

       O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face.

       Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit

105 But wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
       That villain cousin would have killed my husband--

            But with a rearward following Tybalt's death,

ACT 3, SCENE 3

       Friar Lawrence returns to Romeo, who was hiding in his quarters. He tells Romeo he has been banished.
       Romeo says he'd prefer execution to exile. Lawrence tries to make Romeo understand the Prince's mercy,
       but he refuses to be consoled. The Nurse arrives and tells Romeo of Juliet's grief. In despair, Romeo draws
       his dagger to kill himself, but the Friar stops him and chastises him for being willing to abandon his wife in
       death. He urges Romeo to flee to Mantua until the issue can be settled, and he and Juliet can be reunited.
       The Nurse leaves to prepare for Romeo's arrival that evening, leaving Juliet's ring with him. The Friar warns
       Romeo to leave for Mantua by dawn to escape capture.

       Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man.
       Affliction° is enamored of thy parts°;
       And thou art wedded to calamity.

                                     Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

       Father, what news? What is the Prince's doom?
5 What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand

       That I yet know not?

FRIAR LAWRENCE

       Too familiar
       Is my dear son with such sorry company.
       I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom.

ROMEO

10 What less than Doomsday is the Prince's doom?

            A gentler judgment vanished from his lips.
            Not body's death, but body's banishment.

   ROMEO

            Ha! Banishment? Be merciful, say "death,"
            For exile hath more terror in his look,
    15 Much more than death. Do not say "banishment."

   FRIAR LAWRENCE

            Here from Verona are thou banished;
            Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

   ROMEO

            There is no world without Verona walls,
            But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    20 Hence banishèd, is banished from the world.
            And world's exile is death. Then banishèd,
            Is death, mistermed. Calling death "banished,"
            Thou cut'st my head off with a golden axe,
            And smiles upon the stroke that murders me.

   FRIAR LAWRENCE

    25 O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
            Thy fault our law calls death,29 but the kind Prince,
            Taking thy part, hath rushed aside the law,
            And turned that black word "death" to "banishment."
            This is dear mercy, and thou seeth it not.

   ROMEO

    30 Tis torture and not mercy. Heaven is here
            Where Juliet lives, and every cat and dog,
            And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
            Live here in heaven and may look on her.
            But Romeo may not. More validity°,

    35 More honorable state, more courtship lives
            In carrion° flies than Romeo. They may seize
            On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand,
            And steal immortal blessing from her lips,

29. Thy fault our law calls death: i.e., your crime is punishable by death

     88 | Act 3
            Who even in pure and vestal° modesty                 °virginal

            This may flies do, when I from this must fly,       Act 3 | 89
            And says thou yet, that exile is not death?
            But Romeo may not, he is banished.
            Flies may do this, but I from this must fly;
    45 They are free men, but I am banished.
            Hadst thou no poison mixed, no sharp-ground knife,
            No sudden means of death--though ne'er so mean--
            But "banishèd," to kill me? "Banishèd?"
            O Friar, the damned use that word in hell:
    50 Howling attends it. How hast thou the heart,
            Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
            A sin absolver, and my friend professed,
            To mangle me with that word "banishèd?"

   FRIAR LAWRENCE

            Then, fond° mad man, hear me a little speak--

   ROMEO

    55 O, thou wilt speak again of banishment!

   FRIAR LAWRENCE

            I'll give thee armor to keep off that word.
            Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
            To comfort thee though thou art banishèd.

   ROMEO

            Still "banishèd?" Hang up philosophy,
    60 Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,

            Displant° a town, reverse a Prince's doom,
            It helps not, it prevails not.30 Talk no more.

   FRIAR LAWRENCE

            O, then I see that mad men have no ears.

            How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

30. prevails not: has no effect

       Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel.
       Were thou as young as I, Juliet they love,
       An hour but married, Tybalt murderèd,
       Doting° like me, and like me banishèd,
70 Then mightest thou speak,
       Then mightest thou tear thy hair
       And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
       Taking the measure of an unmade grave.32

                                     There is a knock from within

       Mist-like, conceal me from the search of eyes.

ACT 3, SCENE 4

       Lord and Lady Capulet explain to Paris that Juliet will not see him tonight due to her grieving for Tybalt.
       They agree to marry Juliet to Paris in a respectfully humble ceremony on Thursday. Lord Capulet
       commands Lady Capulet to break the news to their daughter.

Somewhere within the Capulet estate:

                                     Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET and PARIS

CAPULET

       Things have fallen out, sir, so unluckily,
       That we have had no time to move our daughter.41
       Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,

41. we have had no time to move our daughter: i.e., we haven't had time to convince Juliet

            These times of woe afford no times to woo.
            Madam, goodnight. Commend me to your daughter.

   LADY CAPULET

    10 I will, and know° her mind early tomorrow,
            Tonight she's mewed up to her heaviness.42

   CAPULET

            Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender°
            Of my child's love. I think she will be ruled,
            In all respects, by me. Surely; I doubt it not.--
    15 Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed.
            Acquaint her here of my son Paris's love,
            And bid her--Mark you me?--on Wednesday next--
            But soft°! What day is this?

            Monday, my lord.

   CAPULET

    20 Monday, ha ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon.
            A Thursday let it be. A Thursday, tell her
            She shall be married to this noble Earl.--
            Will you be ready? Do you like this haste?
            We'll keep no great ado, a friend or two.

    25 For hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
            It may be thought we held him carelessly°
            Being our kinsman, if we revel much.
            Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
            And there an end.43 But what say you to Thursday?

30 My Lord, I would that Thursday were tomorrow.

CAPULET

       Well, get you gone. A Thursday be it then!--
       Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed.
       Prepare her, wife, against this wedding day.--
       Farewell, my lord.--Light to my chamber, ho!--
35 Afore me,44 it is so very late that we may call it early by and by.--
       Goodnight.

ACT 3, SCENE 5

        In her chambers, Juliet and Romeo go back and forth on whether Romeo needs to leave yet or whether
       he can stay longer. The Nurse enters to warn them that Lady Capulet is approaching. Romeo departs in
       secret. Lady Capulet enters to talk to Juliet. Juliet pretends to hate Romeo while telling the audience that
       she forgives him completely. Lady Capulet tells Juliet that she is set to be married to Paris next Thursday.
       Juliet protests that it is far too soon. Her father enters, just as surprised as his wife that Juliet is still grieving.
       He expects Juliet to be pleased at the news of the marriage; when she begs him to change their plans,
       he flies into a rage, silencing the Nurse who jumps to Juliet's defense. He threatens to disown Juliet if she
       refuses to marry and then leaves. Juliet asks her mother for help; she refuses and also exits. Juliet then goes
       to the Nurse for comfort, who tells her that she should marry Paris and be happy since Romeo is as good
       as dead in exile. Juliet decides to find Friar Lawrence for help, resolving to kill herself if he will not help her.

Juliet's chambers within the Capulet estate, near a window overlooking the orchard:

                                     Enter ROMEO and JULIET aloft

       Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
       It was the nightingale, and not the lark,45
       That pierced the fearful° hollow of thine ear.
       Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
5 Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

44. Afore me: a mild swear
45. It was the nightingale, and not the lark: The nightingale sings at night; the lark sings in the morning

JULIET

       Yond light is not daylight--I know it. Aye:
       It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
       To be to thee this night a torch-bearer
15 And light thee on thy way to Mantua.
       Therefore stay yet; thou needst not to be gone.

ROMEO

       Let me be ta'en°. Let me be put to death.
       I am content, if thou wilt have it so.
       I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye.
20 `Tis but the pale reflect of Cynthia's46 brow.
       Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat
       The vaulty heaven so high above our heads.
       I have more care to stay than will to go:
       Come, death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so--
25 How is my soul? Let's talk; 'tis not yet day.

JULIET

       It is, it is! Begone fly hence away!
       It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
       Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
       Some say the lark makes sweet division°:
30 This is not so, for she divideth us.
       Some say the lark and loathèd toad change eyes.47
       O, now I would they had changed voices too,
       Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray°,
       Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up48 to the day.
35 O, now begone! More light and light it grows.

46. Cynthia: another name for the goddess of the moon.
47. the lark and loathèd toad change eyes: Juliet is referring to the tale that the lark traded its pretty eyes for the toad's ugly

     ones

Act 4

ACT 4, SCENE 1

       Paris meets with Friar Lawrence, informing him that the wedding will be held on Thursday in a supposed
       attempt to soothe Juliet's grief over murdered Tybalt. Juliet arrives for confession, and Paris attempts to
       pressure her into confessing her love for him. After Paris leaves, Juliet tells the Friar she is resolved to kill
       herself if he can offer no solution out of the impending marriage. The Friar offers her a plan: agree to the
       marriage, but drink a poison the night before that will make her appear dead while in reality leaving her
       asleep. The Friar will then send word to Romeo, who will return and rescue Juliet once she awakes in the
       family tomb. Juliet accepts.

Friar Lawrence's cell in Verona:

                                     Enter Friar Lawrence and County Paris

FRIAR LAWRENCE

       On Thursday, sir? The time is very soon.

PARIS

       My father Capulet will have it so,
       And I am nothing slow to stall his haste.

FRIAR LAWRENCE

       You say you do not know the Lady's mind?
5 Uneven is the course. I like it not.

       Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
       And therefore have I little talk of love,
       For Venus1 smiles not in a house of tears.
       Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
10 That she doth give her sorrow so much sway;
       And in his wisdom hastes our marriage2
       To stop the inundation° of her tears,
       Which, too much minded by herself alone,

1. Venus: a mythical goddess often representing love
2. Hastes our marriage: To move quickly with the wedding

15 Now you do know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAWRENCE

       [To himself] I would I knew not why it should be slowed.4
       [To PARIS] Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.

                                     Enter Juliet

PARIS

       Happily met, my lady and my wife.

JULIET

       That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS

20 That "may be" must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET

       What must be shall be.

FRIAR LAWRENCE

       That's a certain text°.

PARIS

       Come you to make confession to this father?5

JULIET

       To answer that, I would confess to you.

3. May be put from her by society: Paris is saying that with company, she might cry less
4. I would I knew not what it should be slowed: Friar Lawrence wants to be heard by the audience, not Paris, and is saying that

   he wishes he didn't know what was to come.
5. Come you to make confession to this father?: Paris is asking Juliet if she has come to confess to the Friar. Confession is a

   common practice in the Catholic religion.

                                                                                                                                                                               Act 4 | 109

JULIET

       I will confess to you that I love him.6

PARIS

       So will ye - I am sure that you love me.

JULIET

       If I do so, it will be of more worth
       Being spoke behind your back than to your face.

PARIS

30 Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

JULIET

       The tears have got small° victory by that,
       For it was bad enough before their spite.7

PARIS

       Thou wrong'st it more than tears, with that report.

JULIET

       That is no slander, sir, when it's a truth,
35 And what I said, I said it to my face.

PARIS

       Thy face is mine, and thou hast slandered it.

6. I will confess to you that I love him: Juliet is using tricky and playful language to confuse Paris and keep him under the
   impression that she does love him. In fact, she is actually saying that she will confess that she loves Romeo.

7. For it was bad enough before their spite: Her face was abused and dirty enough before the tears. She is trying to get Paris to
   leave her alone.

  40 My leisure serves me, somber daughter, now.
          My lord, we must ask for this time alone.

  PARIS

          God shield I should disturb devotion!
          Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse you.
          Till then, adieu, and keep this holy kiss.

  JULIET

  45 O, shut the door! And when thou hast done so,
          Come weep with me - past hope, past care, past help.

  FRIAR LAWRENCE

          O Juliet, I already know thy grief;
          It strains me past the compass of my wits.
          I hear thou must - and nothing may postpone it -
  50 On Thursday next be married to the County.

  JULIET

          Tell me not, Friar, that thou hearest of this,
          Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
          If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help,
          Do thou but call my resolution wise,
  55 And with this knife I'll help it presently.
          God joined my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands.
          And ere this hand - by thee to Romeo sealed -
          Shall be the label to another deed,8
          Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
  60 Turn to another, this shall slay them both.

8. Shall be the label to another deed: That Juliet should be married to both Romeo and Paris.

                                                                                               Act 4 | 111

       Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that,

       Could not to this issue true honor bring.
       Be not so long to speak; I long to die
       If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAWRENCE

       Hold, daughter! I do spy a kind of hope
70 Which craves as desperate an execution

       As that is desperate which we would prevent.10
       If rather than to marry County Paris
       Thou hast the strength or will to slay thyself,
       Then it is likely thou wilt undertake
75 A thing like death to chide away this shame,
       That copes with Death himself to `scape from it;
       And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

JULIET

       O bid me leap - rather than marry Paris -
       From off the battlements of any tower,
80 Or walk in thievish ways, or bid me lurk
       Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears
       Or hide me nightly in a charnel house,11
       O'ercovered quite° with dead men's rattling bones,
       With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;12
85 Or bid me go into a new-made grave
       And hide me with a dead man in his tomb;
       Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble,
       And I will do it without fear or doubt
       To keep myself a faithful unstained wife

       Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death,

       Thou shalt continue two and forty hours
       And then awake, as from a pleasant sleep.
       Now when the bridegroom in the morning comes
       To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead;
110 Then, as the manner of our country is,13
       In thy best robes uncovered on the bier°
       Be borne to burial in thy kindred's grave;
       Thou shall be borne to that same ancient vault
       Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
115 In the meantime, by then thou shalt awake,
       Shall Romeo by my letters know our plan,
       And hither shall he come, and he and I
       Will watch thy waking, and that very night
       Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
120 And this shall free thee from this present shame,

ACT 4, SCENE 2

       Juliet returns to find her family preparing for the wedding. Repentant, she asks for forgiveness and
       agrees to marry Paris. Lord Capulet, in his excitement, decides to advance the ceremony from Thursday
       to Wednesday (tomorrow). Ignoring his wife's protests, he instructs her to be with Juliet while he finishes
       preparations and sends word to Paris of the changed itinerary.

Somewhere within the Capulet estate:

       Therefore he that will not lick his fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET

       Go, be gone.

25 I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning.16

JULIET

ACT 4, SCENE 3

       Juliet sends the nurse and Lady Capulet from her bedroom on the pretext of getting rest. She then
       experiences a series of doubts about the plan: what if the poison doesn't work? What if the Friar actually
       intends to kill her to preserve the sanctity of her first marriage? What if she wakes up too early and
       suffocates? What if waking in the tomb will drive her insane? She rebuts most of these fears and drinks the
       poison, falling into a death-like trance.

       Aye, those attires are best; but gentle Nurse
       I pray thee leave me to myself tonight
       For I have need of many orisons°
       To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
5 Which, well thou know'st, is cross and full of sin.

LADY CAPULET

       What, are you busy - do you need my help?

17. Sensitivity note: housewife in this context represents another example of Shakespeare's assumed gender roles. Keep in mind
    that though this may have been a common phrase in his time, it does not mean it was an accurate or respectful statement.

       For I am sure you have your hands full all
       In this so sudden business.

JULIET

15 Farewell:
       God knows when we shall meet again.
       I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
       That almost freezes up the heat of life.
       I'll call them back again to comfort me.--

20 Nurse!--18 What should she do here?
       My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
       Come, vial.

                                     Takes out vial.

       What if this mixture should not work at all?
       Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
25 No, no, this shall forbid it.

                                     Takes out knife.

                                                     Lie thou there.
       What if it be a poison, which the Friar
       Subtly hath ministered to have me dead,
       Lest in this marriage he should be dishonored,
       Because he married me before to Romeo?
30 I fear it is. And yet methinks it should not,
       For he hath still been tried a holy man.
       How, if when I am laid into the tomb,
       I wake before the time that Romeo
       Comes to redeem me? There's a fearful point:

18. Nurse: Juliet is breaking her soliloquy to call out for the nurse before quickly coming to her senses and thinking to herself
    again.

       O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
       Environed° with all these hideous fears,
       And madly play with my forefathers' joints?
       And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?

55 And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
       As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
       O look, methinks I see my cousin's ghost,
       Seeking out Romeo that did spit° his body
       Upon a rapier's point. Stay, Tybalt, stay!

60 Romeo, Romeo, Romeo! Here's drink; I drink to thee.21

                                     She drinks and falls upon her bed within the curtains.

       dead. Lady Capulet, Lord Capulet, Paris, and Friar Lawrence arrive consecutively and grieve at seeing Juliet
       in her current state. The Friar reassures the family that Juliet is surely well in heaven and urges them to
       bring her to church to begin the funeral rites. After they leave, musicians hired for the wedding linger, and,
       unconcerned by the day's events, joke and banter about music before making their exit.

ACT 5, SCENE 1

       Balthasar, a friend of Romeo's, brings him news that Juliet is dead and lies in the Capulet tomb. Resolved
       to find her and join her in death, Romeo first visits an apothecary and bribes him to obtain an illegal (and
       lethal) poison.
       Trigger warning: Act 5 contains material discussing and portraying suicide.

       If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep
       My dreams presage° some joyful news at hand.
       My bosom's lord1 sits lightly in his throne:
       And all this day an unaccustomed spirit
5 Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
       I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
       Strange dream that gives a dead man leave to think--
       And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
       That I revived and was an Emperor.
10 Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed,2
       When but love's shadows° are so rich in joy!

       How doth my lady? Is my father well?
15 How doth my lady Juliet? That I ask again,
       If she is well, then nothing can be ill.

       Then nothing can be ill, for she is well!
       Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
       And her immortal part with angels lives.

       To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
       I do remember an apothecary--
40 And hereabouts he dwells--which late I noted
       In tattered cloths with overwhelming brows,
       Culling of simples°. Meager were his looks.
       Sharp misery had worn him to the bones.
       And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
45 An alligator stuffed, and other skins
       Of ill-shaped fishes. And about his shelves,

3. post horses: horses for rent, which were kept at inns

85 Than those poor compounds that thou must not sell.

ACT 5, SCENE 3

       Paris mourns at the Capulet tomb, but hides when he hears someone (Romeo) approaching. As he reaches
       the tomb, Romeo commands Balthasar to leave; Balthasar leaves but decides to linger secretly. Paris
       confronts Romeo as he attempts to open the tomb. They fight, and Romeo kills Paris. Romeo enters the
       tomb and lays Paris inside it. Approaching Juliet, Romeo grieves for her death and the luster of her still-
       lively beauty. He drinks the poison and dies. Friar Lawrence arrives and witnesses the scene as Juliet wakes,
       offering to hide her away among a convent of nuns. She refuses. Hearing guards approaching, Juliet kills
       herself with Romeo's dagger. The Prince, the Capulets, and the Montagues are summoned by the guards.
       Friar Lawrence summarizes the events leading to this point and is corroborated by Balthasar and Romeo's
       letter to his father. In remorse, lords Capulet and Montague make peace.

           Why I descend into this bed of death
           Is partly to behold my lady's face,
   30 But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
           A precious ring, a ring that I must use,

       And she, there dead, that's Romeo's faithful wife.
       I married them, and their stol'n marriage day
       Was Tybalt's doomsday, whose untimely death
240 Banished the new-made bridegroom from this city,
       For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.25

       Betrothed and would have married her perforce°
       To County Paris. Then comes she to me,

       To rid her from this second marriage,
       Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
       Then gave I her, so tutored by my art,
       A sleeping potion, which so took effect,
250 As I intended, for it wrought on her
       The form of death. Meantime I wrote to Romeo

22. And lead you even to death: i.e., be your leader in grief
23. let mischance be slave to patience: i.e., let patience guide your misfortune
24. make: give evidence
25. For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined: i.e., Friar implies Juliet only care about Romeo and cares nothing for Tybalt.

    255 But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
            Was stayed by accident, and yesternight
            Returned my letter back. Then all alone
            At the prefixed hour of her waking
            Came I to take her from her kindred's vault,
    260 Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
            `Til I conveniently could send to Romeo.
            But when I came some minute ere the time

            The noble Paris, and true Romeo, dead.
    265 She wakes, and I entreated her come forth
            And bear this work of heaven26 with patience.
            But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,
            And she, too desperate, would not go with me
            But as it seems, did violence on herself.
    270 All this I know, and to the marriage her Nurse is privy.

EDUCATIONAL RESOURCES FOR
TEACHERS

The following materials were created by Oregon State Students in the Fall of 2020. The undergraduate team
has created an annotated bibliography of accessible resources, all selected for their potential usefulness to
instructors and/or students, and specifically those who want to explore the play's representation of race,
disability, and class.

148 | Educational Resources for Teachers
Racism

Erickson, Peter, Hall, Kim F. "`A New Scholarly Song:' Rereading Early Modern Race." Shakespeare Quarterly, vol.
   67, no. 1, 2016, pp. 1-13. https://doi.org/10.1353/shq.2016.0002.

In their scholarly article, Erickson and Hall call for a recentering of race when discussing Shakespeare's works,
arguing that "ignoring [...] race will not make it go away as a question for our-or Shakespeare's-time" (3). Race
in Shakespeare's works should not be ignored solely because understandings of race during his time were
different than those now. Nor should conversations surrounding race be shut down by over-emphasizing
Shakespeare's universality (i.e., his works' importance or relevance to modern audiences). Rather, discussions in
the classroom should be open and accepting of diversity in backgrounds, dissenting opinions, and general
worldviews. Teachers can find suggestions on how to further promote diversity in the article's exploration of
different sources and media that might be used to analyze race in Shakespeare.

joubin_romeojuliet_history.pdf/.

This study of the role of ethnicity and culture in Shakespearean works acts as an exemplary model for students
in using an allegorical perspective to extend the themes and issues within Romeo and Juliet into cultures
outside Italian Verona, seen through an Elizabethan perspective. Students may be influenced or guided by the
procedural re-contextualization of Shakespearean topics to incorporate the setting and discussions regarding
Romeo and Juliet into their own or outside cultures in order to develop a more worldly understanding of the
play's central themes. Furthermore, it provides an indepth and insightful alternative perspective that broadens
the appeal and meaning of the famous tale through the historical and cultural lens of Taiwanese Ethnic
history to encourage students to engage in a more well-rounded critical perspective towards the play in newly
presented, or unrealized, contexts.

Karim-Cooper, Farah. "Anti-racist Shakespeare." Shakespeare's Globe, 26 May                           2020,
   https://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discover/blogs-and-features/2020/05/26/anti-racistshakespeare/.
   Accessed 20 November 2020.

Professor Karin-Cooper's article speaks on the historical significance of the polarity of light and dark, including
the placement of light over dark in terms of beauty and behavior. It dives deeper into the purity aspect of
light and dark by speaking on the Christianity and monarchy that was happening in Shakespeare's time. Using
poetry, paintings and some of Shakespeare's own work, the article does an effective job of describing the racism
happening in Shakespeare's work without it actually being said outright.

   AONEu=s8405248&sid=AONE&xid=f18618f9. Accessed 20 Nov. 2020.
This essay highlights the phrase "Ethiop's ear" used in Romeo's speech in Act 1, scene 5 of Romeo and Juliet.
Although this essay examines Luhrmann's 1996 film adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, it is still important to
recognize racism in Shakespeare's text. Many teachers have their students watch this film, pointing to the
importance of including this source. Visual media can often help students have a better understanding of
the material. Since this film is different in some respects, it is important to have your students watch out for
differences they may see. Even though light and dark metaphors can be seen in many pieces of literature across
history, there is no excuse to extend such a metaphor into a racial context. When teaching or reading this play
it is important to recognize the racial implications of the play. The term "Ethiop's ear" is one of the most racially
motivated terms used in Romeo and Juliet, making it a great learning opportunity for students.

Ableism

Cheyne, Ria. Disability, Literature, Genre: Representation and Affect in Contemporary Fiction. Liverpool
   University Press, 2019. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvsn3pp7.

Throughout the play of Romeo and Juliet, the love language between the two star-crossed lovers is oftentimes
depicted through metaphors of disability to convey and evoke an emotive response to the volatility of the
characters' emotional state. In this open access resource, Cheyne highlights the effect that associating a
central romantic protagonist, especially in tragedies, with disability has on audience reception to an author's
attempt to achieve a sense of emotional justice, or reader satisfaction, through social perceptions towards
disability. In Romeo and Juliet, much of this language is expressed by or in reference to Romeo and the
metaphorical blindness or madness his love inflicts upon him. In her work, Cheyne provides an analysis on why
the implications of disability would play a more prominent role on the male protagonist in a romance and its
suggestion towards the undesirability of the shared romantic future between the romantic protagonists.

Lapointe, Grace. "Finding Alternatives to Ableist Language." Medium, 5 December                     2019,
   https://gracelapointe.medium.com/finding-alternatives-to-ableist-language-627f8680810. Accessed     20
   November 2020.

This blog post is an easy to understand explanation of what ableist language is and how it is often used
unknowingly or in a metaphor. The author specifically mentions Shakespeare in her blog post when speaking
on clichés that have ableist language. Sensory metaphors (mostly blind ones) are scattered throughout his
work, especially when speaking about love or decision making. The blog post also uses modern examples of
ableist language to help relate to students more effectively. This is a great way to introduce the concept of
unnecessary ableism and even get discussions started on other ways Shakespeare could have written the line
without it.

Schor, Naomi. "Blindness as Metaphor." differences: A Journal of Feminist Cultural Studies, vol. 11 no. 2, 1999, p.
   76-105. Project MUSE https://muse.jhu.edu/article/9603.

Throughout Romeo and Juliet, there are frequent nods to blindness. However, it is attributed as a metaphor
rather than an actual disability. When using the term "blind" rather than, for example, "ignore," ableist language
is being used. By equating blindness to a conscious decision to ignore a problem, Shakespeare is participating
in the social prejudice against people who are blind. This essay goes into how harmful ableist language is to
people who are blind. Although it does not directly cite Shakespeare's work, it is easily applicable to his plays as
he frequently uses the term "blind."

Ableism | 151
Wood's scholarly article details three representations of disability that can be identified in Shakespeare's works:
demonstrable forms of disability (e.g., limping), covert forms of disability (e.g., chronic pain), and performance-
histories of disability (e.g., staging decisions). Exploration of disability representations allows for larger
conversations surrounding stigma, oppression, and otherness within Shakespeare's writing. While the
Shakespearean works pointed to in this article do not include Romeo and Juliet, students can attempt to
identify examples of Wood's representations of disability in the play. In doing so, students will be able to have
conversations centered around such topics as desirability that are innate to the romantic tragedy.

Classism

Gillings, Matthew. "Shakespeare and Social Status." Encyclopedia of Shakespeare's Language, 5 June 2017,
   http://wp.lancs.ac.uk/shakespearelang/2017/06/05/shakespeare-and-socialstatus/.

This website is host to a plethora of blogs about Shakespeare. Gilling's blog in particular explains the importance
of class in Shakespeare's work. Although this source does not particularly discuss classism, it specifies the
parameters of class in the early modern time period. This source can serve as a great starting point for the
discussion of class in Shakespeare's time period. Not only could this blog bemused by teachers, but teachers
would be able to give it to their students to read as it is easily approachable for high schoolers.

Hoffman, T. J. "Talk of Peace with Swords Drawn: Romeo and Juliet as a Cautionary Tale of Hierarchy and
   Sacrifice." no date. Florida State University, 2004, https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu%3A182205/.

In this free to access thesis, Hoffman examines the function of René Girard's sacrificial crisis theory in Romeo
and Juliet's social order in relations to the cultural perceptions and restrictions of gender, marriage, and
class. Hoffman presents an interpretive argument to broaden the mind of the audience into considering the
importance of the family feud and its consequential violence as a social commentary upon the danger of
adhering to the rigid, factionalized, hierarchy and reflecting upon the culture that would appropriate such
violence in the supposedly civilized Elizabethan society. The mediums of cultural violence and gendered
perspectives of this violence that Hoffman analyzes are the rites of festivity, marriage, and sacrificial justice in
the context of patriarchal capitalism.

   Shakespeare Quarterly, vol. 42, no. 3, 1991, pp. 276-290. https://doi.org/10.2307/2870844.

Moisan's scholarly article explores the ways in which moments between members of superior and inferior
social class standings work to accomplish a kind of comedy in Shakespeare's works. Although Moisan does not
explicitly inspect Romeo and Juliet, instances of class differences can readily be identified in the play. Therefore,
having students analyze features of classism in Romeo and Juliet can provide opportunities to ponder such
questions as how creative works can effectively perpetuate or challenge various social realities. Additional
implications of Shakespeare's representation of class can be found in the article for teachers to pursue in class.

This text uses sexism and classism to explain some of the characters in Romeo and Juliet. The character of
the Nurse and the Apothecary bring to light the classism happening in the play. Explaining the force that the
upper class (i.e., the Capulets and Montagues) bring to the table that make lower class people bend to their

relationships to the upper class in terms of what they can and cannot get away with when disobeying the upper
class.

works of Shakespeare. For students interested in examining the language through its Elizabethan influences,
this resource provides in-depth descriptions and contexts for outdated terminology of everyday society, roles,
titles, objects, conduct, and other aspects of language and life in Shakespeare's time. If the footnotes are
not adequate to satisfy student curiosity towards the former meaning or contextualized meaning behind old
language, then this text may provide them a more rounded perspective on the usage and history of that term.

SUPPLEMENTARY LESSON PLANS

The following materials were created by Oregon State Students in the Fall of 2020. The graduate team offers
complete and carefully scaffolded lesson plans suitable for secondary education and informed by up-to-date
scholarship for each act of the play, complete with suggestions for further reading.

Romeo and Juliet Teaching Guide

This selection of materials is designed to deepen students' engagement with the Oregon State University open
source edition of Romeo and Juliet. However, these lesson plans can be adapted to any edition of Romeo and
Juliet engaged in the classroom.
The structure and pacing of reading the play is up to the teacher. These supplemental lessons are designed
to 1). Lead students towards a deeper understanding of the play's content, and 2). Engage students in critical
thinking about the play's cultural context, as well as the connections students can make to their own modern
experiences.
These supplemental lessons can be peppered in throughout the reading or incorporated at the end of each
act. There are extensions partnered with the lesson plans that can point more rigorous or higher-level classes
towards additional literary connections, academic readings, and modern references to themes that the lesson
plans address.

156 | Supplementary Lesson Plans
Act I Focus: Family Dynamics and
Misogynistic Language in the Early
Modern Period

       Learning objective: Students will understand the role family dynamics play in the context of Romeo
       and Juliet and the wider context of Early Modernism. Through a close read and hands-on activity,
       students will critically examine the misogynistic language that is present in Shakespeare and in the
       Early Modern period.

Lesson: "Depicting Character Relationships Through Scene
Tableaus"

1. Have two different colored sticky pads or two sets of different colored paper available. One color will be used
to represent characters within the Montague household. The other color will represent characters within the
Capulet household.
2. Put students into groups of three and give each group one of the following passages (if needed, more than
one group can be assigned the same passage):

  · Scene 1 lines 35-59 Samson and Gregory fight with Abram and Balthasar
  · Scene 1 lines 178-213 Romeo explains his heartache to Benvolio
  · Scene 3 lines 68-108 Romeo and Benvolio read the letter from the servant and decide to attend the ball
  · Scene 5 from stage directions after line 16- 35 Dancers appear and Capulet gives a speech
  · Scene 5 lines 102-118 Romeo and Juliet meet

3. Have students reread their assigned passages. Explain that each group will create a tableau or a "still image"
that represents the action in their assigned passage. All students must be a part of the tableau, even if they are
just representing setting. Students will wear the color (either a colored sticky note or the taped piece of colored
paper) that is associated with the family they are representing.
4. After students have had time to craft their tableau, have everyone spread out around the room.
5. Have all groups who are NOT depicting their tableau close their eyes until the tableau is set. Once the
presenting group indicates they are ready, the teacher can instruct student viewers to open their eyes.
6. The teacher or a student in the presenting group can offer a brief overview of the actions of the scene.
Students will then take a moment to observe the tableau.
7. After each group has presented, discuss these questions:

  · What is an image that stood out to you?
  · What did the visuals show us about the relationships between the Montagues and the Capulets?
  · What did the visuals show us about Romeo as a character?

                                                                                                                                                                   Act I Focus | 157
  · How was the tableau of Romeo and Juliet meeting different from the others?

Lesson: "Close Reading Misogynistic Language in Sampson and
Gregory's Exchange"

1. Divide students into groups of two or three, or ask students to return to their groups from the "Depicting
Character Relationships Through Scene Tableaus" activity above.
2. Provide groups with a printed copy of Sampson and Gregory's exchange from Act I, Scene I (lines 1-27). The
text's corresponding footnotes should be printed at the bottom of the page or readily available to students on a
separate sheet of paper.
3. Ask each group to read through the passage slowly--referring to the footnotes when directed by the
text--and circle or highlight any words, phrases, or lines that they believe are referring to gender. Remind
students that it can take a few readings to get used to the cadence and terminology of Shakespeare. If they are
not sure whether a word, phrase, or line references gender, ask them to highlight it in a different color or make
a note on the side of the page.
4. Read the passage out loud to students, inviting them to identify any words, phrases, or lines related to gender
that they may have missed on the first read-through.
5. Now, ask groups to consider how gender is referenced in this passage, guided by their highlighted
observations and the questions below:

  · What specific terms does Sampson use to describe the women of the Montague household?
  · What distinction does Sampson make between how he prefers to treat the women of the Montague

      household and how he prefers to treat the men?
  · In line 16, Gregory reminds Sampson: "The quarrel is between our masters and us their men." What does

      this line tell us about the role of women within family politics during the Early Modern period?

6. Inform students that the Oxford English Dictionary defines misogyny as "Hatred or dislike of, or prejudice
against women."*
7. Ask students to further consider:

  · In what ways are Gregory and Sampson's jokes misogynistic?
  · What does this tell us about how women were viewed during the Early Modern period?

8. Ask each group to share some of their observations with the class. Once all groups have shared, ask the class
to collectively consider:

  · How do these senses of misogynistic language in the Early Modern period help us understand the
      expectations placed on Romeo and Juliet as a young man and woman during this period?

  · How do the moments when we are first introduced to Romeo and Juliet (respectively) seem to reflect
      some of the gender stereotypes that we have identified in Samson and Gregory's misogynistic joking?

Final objective: Students should consider how Romeo and Juliet's behavior is restricted by certain gender
stereotypes of the Early Modern period. This will give students a foundation to understand decisions the
characters make later in the play, as well as their interactions and responses to characters of the same and
opposite sex throughout.

Act I Lesson Extension

Both chapters below come from the same text: The Youth of Early Modern Women.
The first article, by Eleanor Hubbard, could easily meet the needs of this lesson guide's thematic concerns for
Acts I-III. This source provides useful context for the balcony scene in Act II by exploring early modern youth
culture and courtship norms. This can help us contextualize Juliet's motivations in the play, her disdain towards
marrying Paris, and her ability to consent, refuse, or otherwise manage Romeo's advances and patriarchal
authorities.
The article also provides space for thinking about the dangers and uses the night provided to different genders
and to different members of social classes. Additionally, this article provides a deeper consideration of how
setting contributes to the agency of the characters. Recommended grade levels: 10-12.

The below source uses court documents from two ecclesiastical courts in England and uses testimonials dated
to the 16th and 17th century to explore child marriage in the Early Modern period in England. This source allows
students to gain a deeper appreciation for the intricacies of this practice and the means by which marriages
could be resisted, challenged, and dissolved due to unsatisfactory or illegitimate pairings. Most crucially, this
source means we do not have to treat the marriage plot of Romeo and Juliet in a vacuum. Rather, we can
appreciate Juliet's initial disdain for marriage and her resistance to Paris as operating within, and part of, a
complicated and nuanced social practice which may now seem totally foreign to American students.

Act II Focus: Representation of Class
Through Language

       Learning objective: Through scene illustration and close reading, students will examine the
       relationship between class and language alive within Shakespeare's plays and the wider context of
       Early Modern England.

Lesson: "Drawing Language Into a Scene"

 1. Divide students into groups of three. Each group should have one blank piece of paper and colored pencils
      or markers.

2. Give each group one of the following passages (if needed, more than one group can be assigned the same
      passage):

  · Act 2, Scene 2 lines 27-55 Romeo arrives at Juliet's home
  · Act 2, Scene 2 lines 171-213 Romeo and Juliet say goodbye
  · Act 2, Scene 4 lines 150-175 The nurse talks to Peter, the servant
  · Act 2, Scene 5 lines 33-70 Juliet asks the nurse about Romeo's message

 3. Explain to students that one student in each group will draw the action of the passage, one student in
      each group will draw the setting of the passage, and one student in each group will add a line of text that
      they believe best exemplifies the scene. Invite students to take a moment to choose roles.

4. Give students time to complete the tasks assigned to their chosen role, with all members of the group
      working on the same piece of paper. Once each group has finished, create a gallery walk, hanging the
      images around the classroom.

 5. As students observe the images, they should consider and/or write down comments addressing the
      following:

  · What immediately catches your eye in the images?
  · Are the settings similar? If yes, how? If not, how are they different?
  · Is the language that the Nurse and Peter use different from the language Romeo and Juliet use when

      addressing each other?

6. Encourage students to discuss their findings as a class.

Final objective: Students should begin to consider that the language preferred by upper class characters
incorporates more complex diction and syntax than the language preferred by the working class characters.
They should also be encouraged to notice that the content addressed by upper class characters is different than
the content addressed by working class characters (for example: courtly love versus dirty jokes).

160 | Act II Focus
Lesson: "Close Reading Class"

 1. Now that students have considered the language variances across characters of different classes, they will
      contrast these speech and language patterns more deeply through a close read.

 2. To begin, ask students to reflect on what they already understand about the class distinctions between
      characters (as developed in the "Drawing Language Into a Scene" lesson above). Remind students of these
      distinctions by encouraging them to consider:

  · How would you describe Romeo and Juliet's class?
  · Does the Nurse belong to a similar class? A different one?

 3. Divide students into groups of three to four. Provide each group with a printed copy of two passages:

         Act 2, Scene 2 lines 1-36 Balcony scene
         Act 2, Scene lines 124-141 Nurse addresses Peter

 4. Ask groups to carefully read both passages, designating one group member who will read the passages
      out loud so that the group can hear the dialogue spoken.

 5. Encourage students to begin by coming to a consensus on the action of the passage. Invite them to
      consider:

  · What is being discussed between the characters in the scenes?
  · Who are the major characters in the passage and what do we know about them so far?

 6. Instruct students to set the passages side-by-side on their tables. Ask them to begin by circling any words
      or phrases that are repeated in the passage between Romeo and Juliet that do not appear in the
      exchange between the Nurse and Peter.

 7. Next, ask students to put a box around any figurative language that they notice in either passage.
 8. Finally, ask students to reflect on repetition and sentence structure. Invite them to take a careful look at

      both passages individually, noticing any repeated phrases, repeated themes, favored sentence structures,
      or breaks from iambic pentameter. They should take notes on their observations.
 9. As a group, ask them to reflect on the effect that this language variance has on their sense of the
      characters represented in the scene. Students should answer:

  · Does one passage feel easier to follow or understand?
  · Does one feel more poetic, or more easily visualized?

10. Come back together as a full class and invite groups to share their reflections.

Final objective: Students should consider how variances of language work to establish Romeo and Juliet as a
different class than characters like the Nurse and Peter, with a different level of education. Students should also
begin to reflect on how Shakespeare's representation of these class differences affects the clarity and imagery
of different passages in the play.

                                                                                                                                                                   Act II Focus | 161
Act II Lesson Extension

The below source presents a means for thinking through filmic representations of Romeo and Juliet and the
different approaches directors have taken with the story over the years. Engaging with film allows students to
think critically about the mass media they consume while practicing skills that critique, analyze, and question
the directorial choices that create/communicate the characters' actions and intentions. This could also be used
in Act V, wherein we think about adaptations and how students could adapt characters, worldviews, or plot
occurrences to be more representative of their lives and circumstances. Recommended for students in 9-12
grades.

162 | Act II Focus
Act III Focus: Gender Dynamics and
Storyline

       Learning objective: Students will examine and analyze how gender dynamics in the Early Modern
       period inform both the action and language of Romeo and Juliet.

Lesson: "Exploring Character Interactions Through Physicalization"

1. Divide the class into groups of four.
2. Give each group one of the following passages:

  · Act 3, Scene 1 lines 35-57 Benvolio and Mercutio encounter Tybalt
  · Act 3, Scene 1 lines 57-86 Mercutio antagonizes Tybalt
  · Act 3, Scene 1 lines 89- 100 Romeo tries to break it up, Tybalt stabs Mercutio
  · Act 2, Scene 1 lines 129-145 Romeo fights Tybalt and kills him

3. Ask students to reread their assigned passage with their group members. Each student will choose a role: two
or three students will choose a character from the scene and will be physicalizing it, and one or two students
will be reading lines during the physicalization.
4. In their groups, ask students to make decisions about how they want to physically portray the action of
their assigned passage. Ask each group to also select a key excerpt that they believe exemplifies the action
of their assigned passage. This excerpt will be the one read out loud by group members during the group's
physicalization.
5. Groups will present their physicalization and line reading in chronological order, physicalizing the scene while
the key lines are being read. The rest of the class will observe each group.
6. After each group presents, check that the class has a grasp on what is being portrayed in the scene.
7. After each group presents, have students write responses to the following questions or discuss as a full class
(students might want to refer to the text as they answer):

  · What is the mood of this scene? What contributes to the mood? Specifically, what key words contribute to
      the mood?

  · How is both the action and language different than other key parts of the play (say, scenes with Romeo
      and Juliet)?

  · What could this scene possibly tell us about gender dynamics (especially between men) in this time
      period?

  · How is this scene similar or different from contemporary scenes in movies or TV involving only men?
      Provide specific examples.

                                                                                                                                                                 Act III Focus | 163
Lesson: "Contrasting Representations of Gender"

1. Spend a few moments asking the class to reflect on gender within the acts of Romeo and Juliet that they
have read so far. This can be done in a think-pair-share format or included as a full class discussion. If the class
participated in the Act I lesson "Close Reading Misogynistic Language in Sampson and Gregory's Exchange,"
remind them of the gender stereotypes they noticed during that activity.
2. Tell the class that they will be building on these initial thoughts to consider how gender directs the play's
physical action and storyline.
3. Ask the class to get into groups of two to four. Give each group one of the following passages:

  · Scene 1, lines 1-30 Mercutio comments on Benvolio's temper
  · Scene 1, lines 68-79 Mercutio and Tybalt begin the fight
  · Scene 1, lines 112-128 Romeo and Tybalt fight
  · Scene 2, lines 37-45 The Nurse tells Juliet about the fight
  · Scene 2, lines 46-63 Juliet's confusion
  · Scene 2, lines 74-94 Juliet mourns Romeo's role in the fight

4. Invite each group to read through their assigned passage slowly, then answer the following questions:

  · What is happening in the scene?
  · How would you classify the emotions of each character in the scene?
  · If you were going to act this passage out, what kind of body language would you choose for each

      character?

4. Ask students to read their assigned passage once more as a group, highlighting or circling any words or
phrases that refine their sense of the characters' emotions and motivations in the scene. Give groups a few
minutes to further discuss their findings.
5. Invite representatives from each group to physicalize their passage in front of the class, incorporating the
emotion and body language that their group believes reflects each character. Alternatively, ask each group to
summarize their findings for the class and write these findings on the board.
6. Once all the groups present, ask the class to identify contrasts they are noticing between the motivations and
emotions of characters in Scene I and Scene II. Ask students to draw on specific examples from the text as they
consider:

  · How do the men in Scene I talk about fighting? How are these attitudes similar or different from the way
      Juliet and The Nurse discuss fighting?

  · How do both sets of characters (men and women, respectively) respond to grief?
  · How active or passive is the role of the characters (both the men and the women) in the events that

      unfold?

7. Close out this activity by asking students to consider the events of the play that they have encountered so far.
Ask the class to consider:

  · Are the differences between the gender they observe in this scene reflective of what we see elsewhere in
      the play?

Final objective: Encourage students to reference specific previous events or dialogue in the play to consider
how these gender differences have functioned elsewhere. This should lead students to reflect on the level of

164 | Act III Focus
agency of young men and young women during the Early Modern period, as well as how the events of Romeo
and Juliet express these levels of agency.

Act III Lesson Extension

The below source is recommended reading for teachers who want to learn more about the historical context
of the play; it would require careful framing for classroom use even in higher education. Specifically, the piece
resurrects concerns over sexual violence that the story of Romeo and Juliet often tapers over, especially through
the play's prestige as one of the greatest love stories in English. In this reading, Romeo becomes a source of
concern and confusion to Juliet, who must manage his romantic and sexual advances while preserving her own
safety and reputation. The article focuses on the allusions to sexual violence from classical antiquity in the play
as communicating a culture and society wherein sexual violence is always a threat. The article also recasts the
Act III sword fights as examples of missplaced sexual violence. The "Tereu" of the title is a reference to a figure
who sexually assaults and mutilates his sister-in-law in Ovid's Metamorphoses.

Act IV Focus: Language Variance Across
Editions

       Learning objective: Students will examine the language variance within the different versions of
       Shakespeare's texts by comparing their edition to the quartos and folio. They will also play with
       contemporary language by portraying Romeo and Juliet in "Twitter posts."

Lesson: "Comparing and Editing Editions of Romeo and Juliet"

1. If students have not already been introduced to the textual variance of different editions of Romeo and Juliet,
inform students that Oregon State University's edition is part of a long history of editors adding their own
voice(s) and editing preferences to Shakespeare's plays. Offer a brief overview of the dialogue differences that
students might encounter as they move between editions of Shakespeare, all of which are inspired by variances
in the quartos and folios. Tell students that they will become editors themselves today.
2. To begin, have the class read Juliet's speech in Act IV, Scene III of Oregon State University's edition out loud. If
possible, encourage every student to read a line so that they can get a feel for the speech's subject and cadence,
stopping at each punctuation mark.
3. Divide students into groups of three to four. Provide each group with a printed copy of Juliet's speech. Inform
students that the full speech in Oregon State University's edition is 45 lines.
4. Ask students to work together in groups to edit Juliet's speech into 25 lines or fewer while retaining a
coherent scene. Tell them that this editing work will require careful close reading. In groups, they should look at
every line of the speech and consider:

  · What is the line's effect in the speech (as a way of furthering action or exposing Juliet's mental state)?
  · Is the line as effective as other lines in the speech?
  · Should the line be edited out during this activity?

5. Once the class has had time to edit Juliet's speech down to 25 lines or fewer, ask one representative from
each group to read their edited version to the class.
6. As a class, discuss the differences and similarities that students are noticing across groups. Have the class
consider:

  · Which lines (if any) did most or all groups choose to keep?
  · Which lines (if any) did most or all groups choose to edit out?
  · Did any of these editing decisions affect our sense of Juliet's emotions as a speaker? How so?
  · Did any of these editing decisions affect our sense of the scene's action? How so?

7. Now, provide each group with printed copies of Juliet's speech in Act IV, Scene III as published in both Q1 and
F. Ask students to closely read through Juliet's speech in both of these editions.
8. First, ask the class:

166 | Act IV Focus
  · Which edition did Oregon State University's editors follow most closely when editing Juliet's speech?

9. Then, invite the class to compare the four editions before them--Q1, F, Oregon State University's edition, and
their own edition--in their groups. Ask each group to compare the effects of each edition and make a decision
about which they prefer as readers.
10. Have each group report their findings to the class.

Lesson: "Recapping Romeo and Juliet Through Twitter Posts"

1. Students will work independently or with partners for this activity.
2. Recap how the class has been examining the different versions of Shakespeare's texts. Remind students that
Shakespeare's stories are actually fluid and that the language and the presentation of the play can be adapted
by the editors to reflect the audience and mode (as explored in the "Comparing and Editing Editions of Romeo
and Juliet" activity above). Students should keep this in mind for the following activity.
3. Inform students that for each of these scenes, they will create a Twitter post from the point of view of a
character in the play. This can be done in a document, on a sheet of paper, or through a worksheet. Each "post"
should:

  · Include a maximum of 140 characters
  · Include a recap of the main action of the play
  · Be only from one character's "Twitter" perspective (each post can be a different character's perspective or

      students can repeat characters)
  · Be reflective of the tone and voice that the character would use in contemporary times. Students do not

      have to use Elizabethan English -- the language should reflect contemporary English.

Students will create a post from a character in each of the following scenes:

  · Act 1, Scene 1
  · Act 1, Scene 2
  · Act 1, Scene 5
  · Act 2, Scene 2
  · Act 2, Scene 5
  · Act 2, Scene 6
  · Act 3, Scene 1
  · Act 3, Scene 5
  · Act 4, Scene 1
  · Act 4, Scene 5

4. To close, discuss how creating these Twitter posts can be similar to editor and editor making decisions
depending on their audience and mode they are utilizing. As students of Shakespeare, they also have agency
to make adaptations for their own audience and mode.

                                                                                                                                                                 Act IV Focus | 167
Act IV Lesson Extension

Engaging variations of Romeo and Juliet should also alert students to the various audiences that the play might
reach. To that end, the below sources are provided to challenge assumptions that the play can only profit white,
cisgendered, heternonormative, middle to upper-class identities.
Ressler uses instances in Romeo and Juliet wherein the dialogue becomes queer to provide readings of sexual
and gender inclusivity in a play often characterized as entirely heteronormative. She goes over practices and
a workshop framework she uses in her own classroom to get students to engage with the text and consider
the boundaries that Romeo and Juliet crosses. Such reading practices can also lead to more comfortable
discussions of gender, fluidity, class boundaries, and sexual orientations as students bodily conceptualize being
in the positions Romeo and Juliet inhabit. This source might be of more use to the instructor as a way of working
through the text than a text worth exploring in class. Recommended grade level is 8-12.

Straughan's article is admittedly dated and short, but chronicles one ESL teacher's strategies for reading Romeo
and Juliet in their classroom. Such an article, again, allows us to think about non-white populations that this
play may reach and diverse audiences it might interest. Straughan provides an overview of the information
and texts that helped her to craft an engagement with the play and the different modalities that allowed her
students to be successful in understanding both Shakespeare's language and the overall plot and characters
present. Again, this might be of more use when crafting lesson plans than being incorporated as a source
students examine within the classroom. Recommended grade level is 8-12.

168 | Act IV Focus
Act V Focus: The Narrative of
Shakespeare

       Learning objective: Students will set themselves in close conversation with Shakespeare by close
       reading a scene and reframing the narrative into a modern context. Through this activity, students
       will see how Romeo and Juliet--despite its lofty status as an educational right of
       passage--incorporates themes, storylines, and relationship dynamics that are relevant to their
       everyday environments and experiences.

Lesson: "Writing Ourselves Into the Narrative of Shakespeare, Part
I"

1. Have students break up into groups of three or four.
2. Write "Shakespeare" on the board and ask students to spend a few minutes thinking in their group about
what immediately comes to mind when they see or hear this word. Ask each group to come up with between
3-4 associations that they will be comfortable sharing with the class. Tell them that thinking about the names
of Shakespeare's plays or their most famous characters could be a good starting point, but that these should
not be included as one of the groups' associations.
3. Once they have had some time to think, invite groups to come to the board and write out their associations.
4. When all groups have had time to write on the board, prepare the class to discuss "the story of Shakespeare"
that they have collectively built. Circle any terms that are identical, and then ask students to identify any
common themes, synonyms, or clear dissimilarities that they observe.
5. After the class has had time to identify and discuss patterns, clearly write these patterns out on the board
and tell the class that this is "the narrative of Shakespeare" that they are identifying now (for instance, students
might identify terms like "old," "historical," "theatre," "romantic," or "academic").
6. Now, assign each group a scene from Romeo and Juliet or ask each group to spend a few minutes choosing
a scene (at least 100 lines in length) that they would like to explore further.
7. Ask each student to read through their chosen scene once, circling or highlighting any moments in the scene
that stick out to them. You might ask students to consider:

  · What moments made them feel emotionally invested in the scene or the characters?
  · What moments made them laugh?
  · What moments felt the most poetic or stylistically interesting?
  · What moments might have been confusing?

8. Give each group time for students to talk through their observations. Ask each group to take note of any lines
where students had similar reactions.
9. Then, ask each group to summarize the actions and environment of the scene. Have each group identify:

  · Where are the characters?

                                                                                                                                                                  Act V Focus | 169
  · What major actions are taking place?
  · What is the emotional tone of the scene?

Lesson: "Writing Ourselves Into the Narrative of Shakespeare, Part
II"

(This can also be engaged as a larger, multi-day project)
1. Reinforce the idea that the relationships, themes, and storylines found in Romeo and Juliet and other works
by Shakespeare are universal and relevant to students' everyday experiences.
2. Students will work individually with the scene they chose for Part I of this lesson. Explain that they will be
writing themselves into the narrative. They will do this by rewriting the scene's dialogue into modern speech,
incorporating senses of their own language preferences and the language preferences of people in their own
life. Inform students that the guidelines are as follows:

  · The original scene should be at least 100 lines in length
  · The new scene should reflect the action of the original scene (However, it does not have to be exactly the

      same. For instance, instead of a sword fight that results in a death, the scene could depict an argument
      between friend groups.)
  · The new scene can either be something that has truly happened to the student, or something they
      imagine could happen in their life
  · The student should write themselves into the scene, representing themselves speaking some of the
      dialogue
  · Other people in the student's life should be speaking the remaining dialogue
  · The new text does not need to be in line format or meter
  · The new text should reflect modern speech patterns
  · Students will type their modernized scene

3. After students have completed their scene adaptation, discuss the following reflective questions:

  · Was it difficult to write yourself into Shakespeare? Why or why not?
  · What themes or relationships reminded you of your own narrative?
  · Did this activity change your understanding of Romeo and Juliet? How so?

Act V Lesson Extension

The below source may not be as accessible to instructors as those on JSTOR, but it provides some interesting
questions regarding where an edition ends and an adaptation begins. Quite possibly our distinction between
the two is not even productive. Fischlin analyzes the commodification which creates and reinforces
Shakespeare--his works, courses devoted to him, filmic and written adaptations, and long-lasting intellectual
and authorial debates--as a brand and object of market value. Such a work is useful in discussions of class, labor,
and commodification. Recommended grades are 11-12.

The below link allows students to consider the ways in which a given story can be expressed through multiple
mediums in an effort to gain greater popularity and commercial success. It uses the Star Trek franchise, for
instance, to articulate how failure or middling success in on genre (i.e., TV for the original series), does not
necessarily mean that the same story will fail in a different genre (comics and novels, in this instance, after the
end of the original series). We can easily connect this to Romeo and Juliet by considering the ways that the story
has been adapted, changed, rewritten, and used as raw material for other love stories from West Side Story to
High School Musical.
