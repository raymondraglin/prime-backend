PERSPECTIVES ON WRITING
Series Editor, Susan H. McLeod

The Perspectives on Writing series addresses writing studies in a broad sense.
Consistent with the wide ranging approaches characteristic of teaching and
scholarship in writing across the curriculum, the series presents works that take
divergent perspectives on working as a writer, teaching writing, administering
writing programs, and studying writing in its various forms.

The WAC Clearinghouse and Parlor Press are collaborating so that these books
will be widely available through free digital distribution and low-cost print edi-
tions. The publishers and the Series editor are teachers and researchers of writ-
ing, committed to the principle that knowledge should freely circulate. We see
the opportunities that new technologies have for further democratizing knowl-
edge. And we see that to share the power of writing is to share the means for
all to articulate their needs, interest, and learning into the great experiment of
literacy.

ORIGINS, AIMS, AND USES

OF WRITING PROGRAMS

WORLDWIDE: PROFILES OF

ACADEMIC WRITING IN MANY

PLACES

By Chris Thaiss
University of California, Davis (US)

To introduce Writing Programs Worldwide, this essay describes and
analyzes major reasons for this project to be undertaken and its pri-
mary goals. It also presents findings and analysis of the ongoing (since
2006) International WAC/WID Mapping Project, specifically of its
"international survey" of writing programs and initiatives, which has
received responses from more than 330 institutions on six continents.
The essay describes how the survey results led to the choice of the univer-
sities invited to contribute profile chapters to this collection, as well as
to the topics and emphases in the profiles themselves. The essay suggests
reasons why teachers, program developers, administrators, and scholars
might benefit from exploring the "many places" described and reflected
on in the array of contributions to this ongoing project.

   We intend this book, in its print and online versions, to inform decision-
making by teachers, program managers, and college/university administrators
in regard to how writing is conceived of, managed, funded, and taught in higher
education. We intend it, also, to contribute to the growing research literature in
the shaping of writing programs.

   In our title, "Writing Programs Worldwide," and in our subtitle, "Profiles of
Academic Writing in Many Places," we have tried to join three aims of schol-
arship. The first of these, embodied in the term "worldwide," is to further the
effort to build a transnational community of writing scholars, teachers, and
program administrators who can share for their mutual benefit the discoveries
of individuals and small teams. This aim has been exemplified by the growth

of such collectives as the European Association for the Teaching of Academic
Writing (EATAW), the International Writing Centers Association (IWCA), and
the newly-formed (2011) International Society for the Advancement of Writing
Research (http://www.isawr.org), formed by the transnational scientific com-
mittee of the conferences on Writing Research Across Borders.1

   The second aim is to identify generalizable trends, patterns, and models
that may be said to characterize initiatives in the teaching of academic writing
at tertiary and postgraduate levels at this point in the transnational history of
this growing movement. A main purpose of this introduction and of the three
essays (at the end of the volume) by individual editors is to synthesize examples
from many of the profiles toward such responsible generalizations. Later in this
essay, for example, I will report trends from the International Survey of the In-
ternational WAC/WID Mapping Project, this survey being instrumental in the
development of this publishing project.

   The third aim, embodied in the term "many places," is to honor the variety and
rich complexity of persons, languages, traditions, geographies, conditions, and
purposes that both inspire and constrain the writing pedagogies and research of
these individuals and teams. To recognize the uniqueness of each effort described
in this project, as the writers and editors have striven to do, works against the ten-
dency to homogenize, hence reduce, all such efforts to a few "typical" principles
and practices, motives and mechanisms. While there is, of course, value in the
well-reasoned generalization, the presence of (in the case of this project) more than
forty profiles of individual locales offers an alternative to reductio ad absurdum.
The French winemakers' principle of terroir might be invoked to capture the feel
of this respect for the local. Even if the palate--or the ability to read for nuance--
limits one's ability to appreciate that uniqueness, accepting terroir means that, to
read one of these profiles, one gains insight into the geographic, cultural, and per-
sonal histories and ambitions that have gone into creating each of these complex
experiences. That this project makes use on our Web site of photos by our authors
of their locales is meant to heighten this respect and feel for difference.

   In "programs" (or its variant "programmes")2 we've embodied our focus on
how an institution--or at least some of its members--conceives of the needs
of its students in regard to learning a discipline, "writing," that in basic ways
crosses all disciplines and aids learning in all of them. Some of our essays de-
scribe individual classrooms and subjects; a few are able to describe individual
students. But our overriding aim as individual (or team) writers has been to
understand and to attempt to convey to a transnational readership how and
why the universities in which we labor attend to (or have neglected) "academic
writing" as a complex set of skills to be learned by students--and to be used as
a vital tool in their learning of their major disciplines.

                                             Origins, Aims, and Uses of Writing Programs Worldwide

   To look at the teaching of writing at the programmatic level is to engage in a
rich subfield of writing research. This inquiry differs from, though it draws from,
such other subfields of writing research as individual student learning and cog-
nitive/social/emotional development, or description and assessment of specific
teacher interventions. In regard to continental Europe, it is not much of a leap to
say that the interest in how higher education systematically organizes its literacy
education, including writing, goes back at least to Quintilian's Institutio Oratoria
of 95 CE, and to Plato's much earlier critical comparison (e.g., in the Protago-
ras) of Socrates' school with the methods of the Sophists. In China, the ancient
tradition of the written exams for the civil service, beginning before the sixth
century CE, provoked intense interest in formal preparation for these exams and
institutional structures to support it (Man-Cheong, 2004). Would that we could
discover how the Mesopotamian bureaucracies of the fourth (and earlier) millen-
nia BCE organized instruction in the learning of the earliest extant transcription
system, the variously-shaped clay "counters" that Schmandt-Besserat (1996) has
described as the first writing. We do know that by the third millennium BCE
Sumerian culture had built a formal education system for scribes, young men
(and some women) from wealthy families (Veldhuis, 1997; Robson, 2001).

   In more recent centuries, in the United Kingdom, the highly-valued "tu-
torial system" of individualized/small-group teaching in place at Oxford and
Cambridge historically has ensured that at these elite institutions students are
provided with continuous feedback on their academic writing and that their
writing develops in tandem with their disciplinary knowledge and learning
(Palfreyman, 2008). In the United States, deep interest in the characteristics
of organizational structures for the teaching of writing go back to well before
the founding of the National Council of Teachers of English in 1919 (see, e.g.,
Brereton, 1996; Miller, 2011; Russell, 2002). As the reference lists of the indi-
vidual profile essays show, research and theory from diverse traditions have been
brought to bear in designing and sustaining these initiatives.

   However, recent and truly international concern about structures for teach-
ing writing has emerged from two primary sources: the internationalizing of the
teaching of English for academic and professional purposes and the explosion of
internet-accessible resources and models for the teaching of writing. In Europe,
the Bologna Process, begun in 1999, has been another spur to transnational
sharing of structural ideas, as universities have made their curricula accessible
to students from across Europe.3 These three related phenomena, of which the
power of the internet is arguably the most important, have made possible and
perhaps necessary the rise of the international organizations named earlier, as
well as a burgeoning number of international conferences on many aspects of
literacy. Further, national literacy-focused organizations have, because of the

                                                                                                   7

web and email, become de facto transnational, while the regional and even local
have become noticed and relevant much outside their original terroir.

   Particularly pertinent to this publishing project is the example of the former
National (US) Network of Writing-across-the-Curriculum (WAC) Programs,
which began in 1979 with a handful of US colleges and universities, gained Ca-
nadian members in the 1980s, and was centered on annual meetings at the (US)
National Council of Teachers of English conventions and the conventions of
the Conference on College Composition and Communication (Thaiss, 2006).
It became the International Network after 2005, when it partnered with the
Web-based WAC Clearinghouse (http://wac.colostate.edu) to extend its visibil-
ity across the digisphere. The research initiative spun off from the Network and
named the International WAC/WID Mapping Project (http://mappingproject.
ucdavis.edu ), which began in 2006, has been to this point an almost-purely di-
gispheric entity: the surveys, survey responses, requests for essays, essays them-
selves, Skype calls, photographs, and countless other messages traverse cyber-
space and are "housed" in digital databases. The Mapping Project has come to
terra firma only for physical presentations at conferences in Europe and North
America. The transnationality of the group of editors and contributing writers
and the translinguality of the survey and survey responses could only have hap-
pened through web reality.

         WHY INTEREST IN THE SHAPES OF WRITING
                   PROGRAMS ACROSS BORDERS?

   A basic question to ask about this cross-borders interest in writing programs
is why? -as in why should anyone be interested in how the teaching of writing
is organized and formalized in settings outside one's own nation or region? (Edi-
tor Lisa Ganobcsik- Williams also takes up this question in her section essay
in this volume, while the section essays by editors Gerd Bräuer and Paula Car-
lino describe specific transnational collaborations.) The whys may be obvious
to those already convinced of the value of learning from traditions and practices
in other cultures, or to those who see themselves helping to shape educational
policy at a national level. But they may not be obvious to teachers focused on
student learners in a given place, or to literacy scholars immersed in the meth-
ods of design in specific inquiries, or even to university and college department
heads and administrators trying to understand and manage particular faculties
and contend with ominous directives from supervisors.

    The basic why is the increasing transnationality of most education, wher-
ever it occurs. For example, many profiles in this project deal at least in part

8
                                             Origins, Aims, and Uses of Writing Programs Worldwide

with the imposing presence of learning English, even if that language is not
the medium of instruction in the university and the methods described in the
profiles are not devoted to teaching writing in English. Moreover, the drives to
become literate and, therefore, to teach literacy, usually in advanced forms, is
sparked in almost every case by student and staff desires for academic recogni-
tion in the international research community or by desire for career success
in the global economy. Third, the students and teachers in the universities
profiled here, while sometimes representing a fairly homogeneous ethnicity,
more often exemplify a range of linguistic and cultural backgrounds. Fourth,
even in those locales where language and ethnicity are fairly uniform, students
and teachers bring every day to their learning the internet and other mass cul-
ture influences that shape the writing educations they desire and are offered.
Global social networking is but the latest dramatic manifestation of a long
trend to bridge distances, borders, oceans, and mountains. Yet, its immediacy
and its multi-sensory power, aided by translation software, to bring billions of
individuals into literate contact with one another means that we cannot ignore
how literacy is taught and learned around the world.

   Other reasons also make a collection such as this intriguing and, we believe,
useful:

   · The desire of universities throughout the world to internationalize their
       student populations, whether through the Bologna Process or other forc-
       es, should spark interest in the cultural attitudes toward written literacy
       that students bring with them to new places and to very different learn-
       ing environments.

   · Transnational collaborations between universities that encourage move-
       ment of students and teachers, as well as creation of joint curricula and
       credit standards, need to be informed by understanding differing tradi-
       tions and practices in literacy education.

   · Lead teachers, administrators, and curriculum planners can learn from
       the experiences of their counterparts in different areas of the world who
       have faced struggles similar to their own--and the Internet makes sur-
       prisingly easy transnational and transoceanic conversation and collabo-
       ration. Language differences are somewhat of a barrier, but two factors:
       (1) the spread of versions of English and (2) the increasing accuracy of
       free or low-cost translation software, are making it much easier for will-
       ing and persistent conversants to overcome language differences.

   · The profiles in this project describe a great variety of subject (course),
       modular, tutorial, collaborative, formal and informal organizational
       structures that can be adapted to different universities and learning envi-
       ronments. These may have derived from local conditions and traditions,

       but reading about a successful curricular experiment in, say, the Nether-
       lands, Canada, Argentina, China, South Africa, or Australia (among the
       28 countries represented here) can spark the imagination of teachers and
       administrators in any country toward changes to better support student
       writing and learning development in their own universities.

                THE MUTUAL INFLUENCES OF THE
                       LOCAL AND THE GLOBAL

   As you read the profiles, you will note how each of the authors tries to
achieve this balance between, on the one hand, generalization and, on the other,
concentration on the specific and local. While we have asked the writers to try
to convey to our international audience, what is distinctive about institutional
history, locale, and mission, and distinctive about the people of their particu-
lar university, the question itself asks for generalizations about these matters.
Though we have not asked for a higher level of generalization, the authors fre-
quently place their universities within their sense of the national or broader
cultural and historical context: these writers conceive of their universities as not
local or regional institutions only, but as having national and even international
relevance--and striving for more.

   Moreover, as scholars of literacy, they frequently explain their motives, theo-
ries, and practices within national, regional, or transnational research. Indeed,
as you read these profiles, you will see that in most instances the writers are
either explicitly aware of the transnational writing research community or are
implicitly adapting goals and techniques that exist elsewhere. In order to give
priority to their descriptions of place, history, and program structures, we have
asked writers to be sparing in their citations. Nevertheless, even in profiles that
offer very short lists of references, the influence of trends and models from other
places is clear, though perhaps implicit within the body of the profile.

 THE QUESTIONS AND TOPICS GUIDING THE PROFILES

   In giving guidance to the authors who accepted our invitation to submit
profiles, we asked that their essays address at least several of the following ques-
tions and topics. Items 4 through 7 derive directly from the International Sur-
vey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project (http://mappingproject.
ucdavis.edu). All of the questions and topics reflect the three aims described
earlier. Given that we were restricting the profiles in length, we allowed authors

10
                                             Origins, Aims, and Uses of Writing Programs Worldwide

to choose which of our questions and topics they would not be able to ad-
dress. Moreover, we encouraged authors to focus more narrowly, if they wished,
on specific initiatives within a larger program, or to explain their efforts more
broadly but less deeply within the short-essay limits. Hence, some of the pro-
files clearly address many of the guiding questions, while others follow our
guidance in spirit but list headings that fit their more specific focus. Neverthe-
less, in working with our authors on refinement of their drafts, we ensured that
every essay addressed implicitly, if not explicitly, most of our guiding concerns.
The questions and topics are as follows:

   · The size, brief history, and mission of the institution
   · Most salient geographic, economic, and cultural features of its location
   · What "literacy" and especially "writing" mean to students and teachers

       in this institution: why they write, in what languages and dialects, in
       relation to what goals?
   · Where and what students write in the institution--disciplines, genres,
       assignments*
   · Who "cares" in the institution about student growth in and through
       writing? How is this concern--or lack of concern--shown in funding,
       requirements, attitudes, actions?*
   · When and how have groups of teachers met to discuss and perhaps plan
       ways to help students grow as writers? What has resulted?*
   · On what models, theories, authors, and principles have courses or meth-
       ods been based?*
   · What have been your and the institution's successes in teaching writing?
   · What have been your unfulfilled ambitions in regard to student literacy/
       writing?
   · Can you describe individual students or events that embody or illustrate
       these successes and frustrations?

            WAC/WID Mapping Project

          EMERGENCE OF THE PROFILES FROM THE
              INTERNATIONAL SURVEY RESEARCH

   The profile essays in Writing Programs Worldwide allow not only rich con-
text, but encourage personal voices to emerge and the sense of the locale, the
terroir, to come through. The profile essays may be thought of as delving more
deeply into the evidence from the more than 350 responses (from 54 coun-

                                                                                                 11

tries, 2007-10) to the International Survey (http://mappingproject.ucdavis.
edu/preliminarysurvey), much as interviews of a sample of respondents typi-
cally follow the collection of survey data. The question structure of this survey
gives promise of a regularity and comparability of responses and language that
encourages generalization, even as it also hints at the diversity and uniqueness
beneath. While the survey responses did encourage generalizations (as shown
in the following paragraphs), the profile essays, as described above and in the
section "Choosing the Profiles" to follow, elaborate on the responses to the
survey questions and encourage further questions from the reader. Where the
survey responses to the five open-ended questions varied greatly in the depth
and detail of the answers, and suggest a complexity that the question format
did not allow, the profile allows the writer not only to address the questions
more fully, but also to create an integrated essay with a vision of past, present,
and future.

                Background and Methods of the Survey

   The idea of the survey began in 2005, as an offshoot of the National (US)
WAC Network's becoming "international" in name as well as in fact, this
change itself a result of the increasing attendance by scholars and teachers from
diverse nations at the annual WAC Network meetings at the Conference on
College Composition and Communication. I had begun planning survey work
on characteristics of US and Canadian writing programs earlier that same year
(Thaiss & Porter, 2010), and extending this work internationally seemed not
only interesting but possible, given Internet accessibility. I asked the help of
two colleagues, Terry Myers Zawacki (of George Mason University) and Chris-
tiane Donahue (now of Dartmouth College) in designing an appropriate in-
ternational survey, and, following two very helpful focus groups conducted by
Donahue in Europe in 2006, the questions and topics on the survey emerged.

   With help from graduate student researchers Erin Steinke and Melissa Mack
and from web designers Paul Nozicka and Elliott Pollard at the University of
California, Davis, the survey established a presence on the web and began to
attract respondents in 2007. It had been my intention from the beginning to
have the survey available in multiple languages, and between 2007 and 2009, I
was fortunate to have the assistance of the following colleagues in making the
survey available in Spanish, German, French, Russian, and Chinese: Paula Car-
lino (Universidad de Buenos Aires, Argentina), Constanza Padilla (CONICET,
Universidad Nacional de Tucumán, Argentina), Manuela Cartolari (CONI-
CET, Universidad de Buenos Aires. Argentina), Ana Brown (Universidad de
Buenos Aires, Argentina), Annette Verhein (Hochschule für Technik, Rapper-

swil, Switzerland), Céline Beaudet (Université de Sherbrooke, Canada), Sylvie
Plane (Université Paris-Sorbonne, France), Nina Shevchuk-Murray (University
of Nebraska, US), and Huahui Zhao (Umeå University, Sweden). Thus far,
82% of responses have been in English, with 15% in Spanish and 3% divided
among the other four languages.

   Recruiting respondents (2007-09) was handled in several ways:
   · A paper survey completed by participants in a Mapping Project work-

       shop in 2007 at the EATAW Conference in Bochum, Germany, plus
       several interviews conducted by Zawacki, Donahue, and me gave us the
       first twenty-five respondents.
   · The initial email contact list was built by graduate researcher Steinke
       (2007) from the EATAW and European Writing Centers Association
       (EWCA) listserves and the speakers list from the 2008 Writing Research
       Across Borders conference (Santa Barbara, California, US)
   · Study of university websites by Steinke and graduate researcher Melissa
       Mack (2008-09) added further contacts.
   · By far the most successful method of recruiting respondents has been
       through friends and colleagues of respondents in professional and re-
       gional networks.

                Analysis of Responses to Each Question:

   Analyzing the responses by question allows the generalizations that follow.

1. Where are students writing in your institution, either in a first language of
instruction or in English? In what genres and circumstances?

   Seventy percent (70%) of the responses, from across countries, indicate that
much writing is being required of undergraduate (tertiary) and graduate (post-
graduate) students in all or most disciplines. This proportion may actually be
higher, because in the remaining 30% of responses half (15%) either (1) focus
their remarks on only one or two disciplines with which the respondents are asso-
ciated (approx. 10%), or (2) do not address this question (5%). Only 10% of the
total explicitly say that little or no writing is required of undergraduate (tertiary)
students across their fields, or that writing is required only in language courses.

   The length of the response largely determines the range and specificity of as-
signments named. A longer response, such as the following, might name several
genres, differentiated by area of the curriculum:

         Technical and business writing predominate. Science and
         engineering students . . . are writing reports, experimental
         plans, and the rare essay. Business students are also writing
         reports. Academic essays are used in the social sciences and
         the humanities. In 2009, an academic writing course (a.k.a.
         FYC) will be required of all bachelor of arts students for the
         first time. Creative writing is taught as an elective to English
         majors and as a requirement of students in the bachelor of
         communications (a joint humanities and business degree).
         Oral communication is taught in many of the same courses
         as writing. There are, of course, variations on this quick gloss,
         but this is the most obvious profile of student writing.

   Typical brief responses are the following:

         (Response 1) All departments, all engineering disciplines, in
         groups and individually, BSc-MSc-PhD level (i.e., writing in
         English)

         (Response 2) All years of study--1st to 5th. Genres: Essays,
         research papers, theses, (articles and web-)

14
                                             Origins, Aims, and Uses of Writing Programs Worldwide

   Most respondents, even in shorter responses, describe writing in academic
genres, usually appropriate to the discipline; for example, "essays" and "reports"
of various kinds are mentioned, as well as "seminar papers," another popular
term. "Exams" and "theses" are two other terms used in many responses. Writ-
ing for publication in disciplinary journals is frequently mentioned in responses
that focus on postgraduate programs.

2. Who cares in your institution about the improvement of student writing
or student learning through writing? Is improvement in student writing an
objective of certain courses/modules/subjects in a discipline or of the overall
curriculum? How and why?

   Ninety-nine percent (99%) of responses are from language professionals
who teach and/or conduct research in linguistics and/or literacy in various lan-
guages, are in teacher education, or work in academic writing/language sup-
port, such as writing centers. More than 50% of respondents feel that their
own concern--"care" --for student writing development is not shared by many
others in their institutions--even though, as the responses to Question 1 show,
most of these institutions do require writing in most disciplines--and even
though many of these universities have some form of writing support service.

   What is important to keep in mind about these relatively negative responses is
that lack of "care" is most often interpreted as lack of active attention or funding for
programs--not as lack of awareness or concern. The following responses are typical:

         (Response 1) A few people: student service center: often a
         non-obligated course, for the "weak" writers, not related to
         curricula, for a few students. Language center: some courses,
         in other languages not related to the curricula, for a few stu-
         dents. We have a very small writing center, run by one of my
         colleagues (with no funding!), a couple of tutor-sessions per
         week. Some subject teachers here and there. Some managers
         here and there. Great diversity, no one and everyone.

         (Response 2) There is much complaining in our university
         about how the level of . . . student writing at the univer-
         sity level has deteriorated. Yet little is being done about the
         problem in the departments nor are there sufficient resources
         given to address the issue. The Language Centre of the uni-
         versity is mainly seen as the responsible element and yet we
         get insufficient money to create new courses.

                                                                                                 15

   In sharp contrast: in almost 40% of cases reported, writing growth is noted
as an institutional goal and can take many curricular forms: tutoring, work-
shops, elective courses/modules, writing embedded in many disciplinary cours-
es, modules attached to disciplinary courses, required courses/modules. Indeed,
respondents from several countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, the
Netherlands, and Norway, frame their own institutions' commitment within a
national goal of building student communication competence.

   As might be expected, the profiles in this book were more frequently invited
from among this almost 40% of respondents, though not always so. We have
striven to include a significant fraction from institutions where the authors per-
ceive their concern for student writing unshared by most colleagues and rare in
the region.

3. Have any teachers in/across disciplines met to talk about these issues or
made an effort to plan curricula in relation to student writing?

   Note that this question is very different from Questions 2 and 3, and gets
at a precise concern related to an institution's sense of shared responsibility
for student writing. It asks about explicit cross-faculties planning, not about
programs or initiatives for writing instruction in the institution. Positive an-
swers to Question 4 reflect collaboration by different faculties and offices rather
than, for example, administrative funding of a writing initiative carried out by
one unit or establishment of a student service. Thus, whereas almost 40% of
responses to Question 2 were positive to enthusiastic, only 25% of responses to
Question 4 were mild to emphatic "yeses"--and the responses to this question
tended to be the shortest among the five categories surveyed, because, presum-
ably, the respondents have relatively little to report about cross-departmental
collaboration in planning for student writing instruction.

   What I call "mild positives" include such statements as
   · "A few teachers in ___ are talking"
   · "We have regular meetings with__"
   · "We co-plan with staff in ___ ___ ____"
   The emphatic "yeses" (roughly 10% of the total) describe staff/faculty work-
shops, collaborative curriculum planning, and/or collaborative research.
   In contrast, negative responses (75%) tend to be short and sharp, from terse
"No" to mildly hopeful "Not yet" to more hopeful "Meetings are planned be-
tween . . . . "
   Overall, taken together with the responses to Questions 2 and 3, the respons-
es to Question 4 indicate that in this sample of 330 institutions, active attention
to student writing development is most often carried out by staff and faculty

16
                                             Origins, Aims, and Uses of Writing Programs Worldwide

members working independently or in small clusters or units. Truly collabora-
tive efforts within an institution stand out within the sample. Again, the profiles
in Writing Programs Worldwide tend to highlight such examples. Nevertheless,
several of the profiles show individual teachers or small groups working mostly
alone. These profiles show how the authors and perhaps a few colleagues have
created structures to support student writing even in difficult circumstances.

4. What is the source of their interest and what models of student writing/
learning development (e.g., articles, books, other documents), if any, help
guide these discussions?

   This question produced by far the most varied responses by type, though,
as in answers to the other questions, responses varied greatly in length, and,
therefore, in detail. Fifteen percent (15%) of respondents did not answer this
question.

   A shorter response might merely credit, for example, "books, articles, web-
sites" as influences on the thinking of staff about teaching methods, whereas a
longer response would name specific scholars or textbook authors. Indeed, close
to one hundred authors were named in the approximately 25% of responses
that include names, with no single author being named more than seven times.

   Much more significant than specific texts or authors, and much more in-
dicative of influences on the respondents' thinking, were two types of responses
that follow from the phrasing of the question:

   1. reasons for interest in student writing by teachers and administrators,
       and

   2. theoretical/pedagogical models that guide the work of those designing
       centers and other initiatives.

   In those responses that addressed reasons for interest, easily the most com-
mon (approx. 30% of total responses) was perception by teachers across disci-
plines of deficits in student writing proficiency. This perception was sometimes
coupled in responses with explicit mention (10%) of certain pressures (profi-
ciency exams, disciplinary accreditation, expectations of employers) that raised
teacher anxiety about writing performance in disciplines. Less often mentioned
(5% of responses) were the need to prepare students for publication in their
fields and faculty members' awareness of the value of writing as a tool of learn-
ing in their disciplines. Thus, the drive to improve student writing proficien-
cy within their disciplinary courses dominated teacher interest in supporting
structures for writing.

   When respondents articulated the theories that guided their work with col-
leagues across disciplines and their students, two terms appeared most frequent-

                                                                                                 17
Thaiss

ly: "process" (10%) and "genre" (10%), with both sometimes appearing in the
same response; for example,

         For engineers on their way out to industries, the programmes
         have needed to provide the necessary skills, like report writ-
         ing and oral presentations. Predictably, they often assume
         there is a template. Our unwillingness to provide such
         templates has pushed us in the direction of genre-informed
         pedagogy and, of course, writing process pedagogy.

   "Academic literacies," "English for Academic Purposes," "WAC," "ESL," and
"linguistics" were among other terms appearing in a few responses in relation
to guiding theories and methods. However, fewer than 50% of all responses
named either a well-known approach or an author. Equally common were men-
tions of highly practical materials produced by a center or by a group of teachers
for use only in the local context: e.g., sample student essays and reports, "writ-
ing guides," citation models, "teaching methods."

   Overall, what comes through most strongly in answers to Question 5 is
the respondents' conviction that they are trying, using whatever theoretical
and practical means they know and can learn, to address a massive need in an
atmosphere of anxiety about student preparedness. The responses across all the
questions reinforce the sense of great variation in how well institutions are ad-
dressing this need. The profiles in Writing Programs Worldwide, while reflecting
this range, in almost every case provide models intended to help institutions in
this effort.

                           Choosing the Profiles

   In building from these 350+ respondents the list of contributors to Writing
Programs Worldwide, each of whom was invited by at least one of the editors,
we were guided by several principles. Recognizing that the number of potential
profiles far exceeded the scope of a print book and a reasonable publication
schedule, we chose as a target forty articles, with no more than two from a given
country, as a reasonable and representative number. We also kept in mind that
in coordinating with the WAC Clearinghouse we were making possible and, we
hoped, systematic, a way to expand the list of profiles after publication of the
print volume.

   Second, in striving for a representative collection, we wanted essays from six
continents. Though, as you can see from our map (pp. 2-3), Western Europe
is easily the most heavily-represented region in the book (as it is in survey re-

18
                                             Origins, Aims, and Uses of Writing Programs Worldwide

sponses), writing initiatives on all continents are represented, and, we hope, will
increase interest in "filling in the map" through further publication.

   Third, we wanted our collection of profiles to include (1) some that might
serve as models for an institution's steady and thoughtful building over years
of strong and diversified services to students and staff; (2) others that focused
on a more recent initiative and its plans for expansion; (3) still others that saw
themselves as new and quite limited, striving by small steps to affect a university
culture in which "academic writing" was not yet regarded as a subject for seri-
ous study--or for university spending. Even in the case of the most-established
programs, we wanted writers to convey honestly a sense of struggle, of unful-
filled ambitions, lest any reader think that any multi-faceted program had been
born that way! Thus, even the contributors from the most successful programs
clearly convey a realistic sense of the stability of their funding, especially in bad
budget times.

   Fourth, almost all the profiles come from among the 350+ respondents to the
International Survey of the International WAC/WID Mapping Project, though
some of those whom we invited were also previously known to one or more of
the editors through their publications or their presentations on their initiatives
at conferences. Several were invited based on the uniqueness of their initiatives
or in order to broaden the geographic representativeness of the collection.

   Fifth, we strove for balance and diversity in the features of the initiatives
portrayed. It is safe to say that each profile is unique in its history and in the
details of the functions described. However, we also strove to represent a range
of broader structural categories: among them,

   · Writing centers (with diverse remits and components)
   · Subjects/courses/modules in aspects of writing
   · Workshops and modules for specific faculties
   · Peer tutoring and writing fellows
   · Informal tutoring and consulting
   · Writing instruction embedded in disciplinary courses
   · Training for disciplinary teachers in how to assign and respond to stu-

       dent writing
   · Writing "minors" and "majors"
   · Postgraduate courses/subjects in theory and pedagogy
   · Regional networks and consortia of universities
   Individual profiles illustrate major differences within these categories. For
example, there are described in the collection numerous "centers" that directly
reach students in support of their growth as writers in their major disciplines.
So it has been important for us that these "writing centers" be individualized in
the profiles to show how really different they are in their histories, functions,

                                                                                                 19

and motives--how they address their specific student and staff populations,
concerns, and political realities, even as they share some common practices.

and digital formats (as part of the WAC Clearinghouse at http://wac/colostate.
edu) signifies our intent to continue to build profiles of initiatives in the teach-
ing of writing after publication. For many years, the Clearinghouse, under the
imaginative leadership of Mike Palmquist, has served the WAC/WID move-
ment in the US as a destination site for descriptions of college and university
WAC/WID programs. De facto, the Clearinghouse is an international site, as
its ever-increasing body of materials is accessed by users from many countries.
We see Writing Programs Worldwide significantly augmenting the transnational
content of the Clearinghouse--and providing a template for profiles of more
and more institutions. Moreover, the online version of Writing Programs World-
wide will give us the flexibility to publish profiles in diverse languages, just as
the WAC/WID Mapping Project has encouraged responses in several languag-
es. In these ways, both this research project and the Clearinghouse will help to
expand the international community of writing scholars, teachers, and program
designers.

       A NOTE ON VARIANTS IN SPELLING AND USAGE

   The editors have retained as often as possible variants in spelling, as well
as elements of syntax and usage, that reflect the different versions of English
("Englishes") most often used by our authors (or their translators) in their aca-
demic writing in that language. In most cases, readers will find a particular
variant (e.g., "centre" or "center") used consistently within an essay. In a few
instances, uses of more than one variant in an essay reflect the author's "code
meshing" (Canagarajah, 2006) from different cultural contexts in the essay.

TEACHING ACADEMIC

LITERACY ACROSS THE

UNIVERSITY CURRICULUM AS

INSTITUTIONAL POLICY: THE

CASE OF THE UNIVERSIDAD

NACIONAL DE GENERAL

SARMIENTO (ARGENTINA)

By Estela Inés Moyano and Lucia Natale
Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento (Argentina)

The aim of this chapter is to briefly outline a genre-based academic
literacy program (PRODEAC) across the university curriculum. Its
major goal is to promote students' academic performance through the
development of advanced literacy in institutional environments. From
the theoretical perspective selected (systemic-functional linguistics), a
genre-based pedagogy influences knowledge construction in disciplines
and empowers students to engage academic, scientific and professional
social activities. Two of the critical resources of the program's design
will be described: the modality of implementation, which is a device
called "negotiation among peers," and the institutional support dur-
ing the process of installation. Some results in different areas of impact
will be also summarized, such as the progress of the students and the
university professors involved, as well as the progressive growth of the
program itself to its present stability, plus new challenges this program
faces.

   The aim of this paper is to present an institutional program, developed at
Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento (UNGS), for teaching academic
and professional literacy across the university curriculum. The UNGS is located
in a suburban town 30 kilometers from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Most of the
students of the university (around 60%) belong to the working class, with very

low economic resources to cover basic needs and that do not satisfy either cul-
tural or recreational needs. Their parents have had access only to the first levels
of education: 55% of them have done complete or incomplete primary studies
and 30% have finished secondary school (UNGS, 2003).

   At the moment of its foundation, in 1993, UNGS highlighted the need of
developing pedagogic strategies to enhance students' abilities in reading and
writing in order to promote their success in obtaining a degree. As a result,
two academic literacy courses have been implemented at the beginning of the
university studies: the first of them as a mandatory condition to enter the
university, as part of the University Adaptation Course (CAU); the second as
a freshman subject that is part of the mandatory curriculum for all degrees.1
These courses, the main goal of which is to develop students' skills in aca-
demic literacy, are taught by teachers of Spanish who hold university degrees
and who also do research. Achievements in those mandatory courses, although
very important, seem not to be enough to sustain five years of university stud-
ies, according to statements of professors and students themselves. First of all,
texts students deal with during the first course have a low level of scientific
or technical language, since the students can't yet handle more difficult aca-
demic texts. The second course--which meets thirty-two hours throughout
the semester--offers them some examples of research articles from different
disciplines and pays attention to structures and some prototypical formula-
tions to be recognized in reading. It also reinforces some types of writing they
have learned in previous courses. Students need to internalize generic models
of academic writing, but this happens only after several opportunities to read
and write them, which is not possible during the term of these two valuable
experiences. On the other hand, academic activities increase in complexity
through the university curriculum, demanding new genres not only to accom-
plish needs of the degree, but as preparation for professional life. These new
genres--e.g., literature review, research projects, research reports, case analyses,
and different types of professional reports--demand specific teaching-learning
processes. Finally, the literature students have to read is highly specialized: they
have to deal with density, abstraction, and technicality, specific grammar and
discourse configurations as well as schematic structures they haven't experi-
enced before (Halliday & Martin, 1993). It seemed to be necessary, therefore,
to create a different stage of the teaching-learning process to meet the needs of
students' academic literacy development.

   After three (3) years of institutional negotiation, in February 2005 the Su-
perior Council of the University, the higher collegiate organ of the university
government, approved an institutional program with recurrent financial re-
sources to promote students' increasing their academic and professional lit-

eracy. It was named "Program to Develop Academic Literacy across the Cur-
riculum" (PRODEAC). 2

         PRODEAC'S FOUNDATION: A BRIEF HISTORY
                 OF AN INSTITUTIONAL PROGRAM

   During 2002, professors of subject matter in the degrees of Engineering and
Economy taught in the Institute of Industry 3(UNGS) decided to take into ac-
count aspects of the students' writing when marking their assessments, in order
to contribute to the development of their academic skills. As these lecturers
found difficulties in achieving their goals, at the end of the year the head of the
Institute of Industry consulted Estela Moyano, researcher in academic discourse
analysis and educational linguistics at the Institute of Human Development
(UNGS). In February 2003, a project designed by Moyano for the Institute
of Industry was submitted to the university government. The project consisted
of a proposal of joint work between subject matter professors and a linguist in
order to teach academic literacy inside the subject matter classes, doing with the
students detailed and reflexive analyses of the genres they had to write, helping
them to plan their texts and to edit them until they had a final version that was
good enough to be graded. However, this first proposal failed: the university
denied financial support for this Program.

   During this period, groups of students from different Institutes asked for
advice from Professor Moyano to solve problems they found during the course
of earning their degrees: new challenges required the development of higher
literacy skills. As more lecturers expressed the same concern, the heads of the
other Institutes in the Degree Cycle started to be worried about this issue. Nev-
ertheless, a second presentation of the same proposal made at the beginning of
2004 was also rejected.

   Two events contributed to the success of the third and last submission in
2005: (1) the determination of the three Institutes in the Degree Cycle to sup-
port the proposal, but now as a program to be applied to all university degrees,
and (2) the presentation of a letter from students of the four (4) Institutes, ask-
ing for more opportunities to develop literacy skills. It is clear that the process
begun in 2002 brought about this effect: the Superior Council includes the
chair of the university, the heads of the four institutes, and representatives of the
different university clusters: professors and assistants, students and graduates,
administrative staff. The proposal had been discussed by these actors in their
role as councilors, and probably the discussions went beyond the council meet-
ings, thus creating consensus.

                                                                                                 25

   In 2005, PRODEAC was installed in the Degree Cycle of all the degrees at
the UNGS, under the condition that it had to be evaluated during its first ap-
plication. Since then, it has been monitored by research-action projects.

                              THE PROGRAM

   PRODEAC is based on Systemic-Functional Linguistics (SFL) (Halli-
day & Mattiessen, 2004), genre and discourse theory in this frame (Mar-
tin, 1992; Martin & Rose, 2007 [2003]; 2008) and the Sydney School's
pedagogic proposals (Martin, 1999; Martin & Rose, 2005) that have been
adapted to Spanish and specific educational contexts (Moyano, 2007). It
takes into account research on language of disciplines (Halliday & Martin,
1993; Martin & Veel, 1997; Wignell, 2007) and the dialogue between SFL
and new Bernstenian sociology (Christie & Martin, 2007). The Program
also acknowledges the very rich traditions of teaching academic writing and
their theoretical bases in Writing Across the Curriculum, English for Spe-
cific Purposes, and experiences in Brazil and Argentina (Bazerman, Bonini
& Figueredo, 2009; Carlino, 2005, 2006; Hyland, 2002; Hyon, 1996; Kar-
woski, Gaydeczka & Brito, 2006; McLeod & Soven, 1992; Swales, 1990;
UNLu, 2001).

   The Program assumes a collaborative design that includes linguists or
language teachers4 and lecturers of the specific subject matters of each de-
gree curriculum. It carries out with students detailed and reflexive analysis
of genres they have to write and the cultural contexts and social practices
involved; it takes into account schematic structures of the texts and the
characteristic uses of language in specific fields of knowledge.

         Three main goals are pursued by PRODEAC: (a) to enlarge aca-
demic literacy abilities of students for improving their learning at the uni-
versity and preparing them across the curriculum for future professional
social activities; (b) to give assistance to lecturers of specific disciplines in
planning and assessing written tasks proposed to students; (c) to prepare
subject professors for teaching academic and professional literacy in their
disciplines to impact the learning process and future professional perfor-
mance. This work doesn't mean increasing curricular hours: the proposal
implies doing the job as part of the subject and in the classes designed to
teach its contents.

   The modality of implementation supposes a partnership between a lin-
guist/language teacher and a lecturer of a specific subject matter. These two
actors are partners in the construction of particular activities in the class

26
                                              Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento (Argentina)

that are agreed on in a statement, or "device," of negotiation between peers,5
whereby the partners discuss the reading and writing tasks to be proposed to
students, the nature of the genres and their structure as well as the partici-
pation of the linguist partner in some classes and the criteria for evaluating
students' texts. Further study is made in the Program to describe the genres
selected to teach and the vocabulary of disciplines in Spanish.

         This pedagogical project allows the improvement of ways of com-
munication through interaction between experts of different disciplines in
order to initiate students in a discourse community (Swales, 1990) and to
enrich the scope of genres written at the university. Moreover, this process
makes possible a profile of graduates the UNGS is interested in produc-
ing: a professional used to working inside inter- or multi-disciplinary
teams for intellectual or technical production. This Program contributes
to knowledge construction in disciplines, ways of producing and compre-
hending discourse, and strategies for cooperative work by modeling and
scaffolding.

         The work of each linguist-and-subject-matter-lecturer team lasts
three periods of six months, until the subject-matter lecturer is able to do
the job on his/her own, consulting the PRODEAC team when needed.
Then, a similar process starts in other subject matters, until the entire uni-
versity educational offering is covered. Nevertheless, some activities with
different actors become recurrent, to enlarge experience across time.

         There is consensus regarding the need for institutional support
to implement literacy programs across the curriculum (Carlino, 2005;
UNLu, 2001). A program proposing collaborative work inside subjects
requires a high degree of institutional compromise to accomplish its goals
and promote changes in teaching of disciplines. In fact, several layers of
institutional actors participate in the process of determining particular
implementations of the program in each Institute, and in tailoring the
distribution of applications according to the needs and possibilities of each
degree.

                 SOME RESULTS OF APPLICATION

   Since its first implementation, PRODEAC has grown in several respects:
in its institutional relevance, in the subject lecturers' and students' generic and
linguistic awareness, and in the progress of the linguist-partners in developing
strategies of implementation as well as their knowledge of academic and profes-
sional genres and discourse.

                                                                                                 27

                          Institutional Relevance

   During the second semester of 2005, the first implementation of the Pro-
gram took place in only six subjects of different degrees, while in the latest years
PRODEAC has intervened in 20 subjects each semester, covering 16 of the 17
degrees offered in UNGS. This expansion has resulted from the high degree of
institutionalization obtained and has been possible due to the creation of new
posts of permanent researchers in linguistics that participate in the Program as
linguist-partners. In 2005, the Program had assigned only two permanent re-
searchers and two hired ad hoc language teachers; there are currently 7 research-
ers and two hired language teachers.

Subject Matter Lecturers

   At the beginning of the implementation of the Program, most of the subject
matter lecturers had been in some way compelled by authorities of the Institutes
to participate in the Program. In many cases, they were reluctant to increase or
systematize writing tasks across the subjects. The activities they usually proposed
to students consisted of applying formulae, answering lists of questions, or writ-
ing traditional exams, with the only purpose being evaluation of knowledge re-
production. Most of these lecturers had low expectations of the possibility that
their students could write long and complex texts in the subject. On the other
hand, some expressed belief that genre-based teaching would limit students' cre-
ativity or freedom in writing. These kinds of resistance to the Program came
from naturalized assumptions about the writing process and about teaching
reading and writing that differed from the principles proposed by PRODEAC.

   During the second semester of application in a subject some changes were
noticed in lecturers' attitudes: they decided to demand more and different written
tasks from students; for example, to produce more complex genres. These changes
have been attributed to two main factors: (1) their finding students notably im-
proved in their writing abilities because of their participation with the Program
in teaching activities, and (2) the development of generic and linguistic awareness
due to the negotiation process with their partner ( Moyano, 2009; Natale, 2007;
Natale & Moyano, 2006). At that point, the subject lecturers started to value in a
positive way the role of the knowledge of genres in accomplishing social practic-
es, especially for academic and workplace activities (Moyano, Natale & Valente,
2007). Due to this evolution, there is progress in performing the negotiation,
which in turn impacts the process of collaborative teaching of literacy.

   In fact, after one or two participations in the Program, some subject profes-
sors have made significant progress in relevant awareness. Consequenly, they

28
                                              Universidad Nacional de General Sarmiento (Argentina)

started to intervene productively earlier in the teaching-learning process pro-
posed by PRODEAC and were able to take on the teaching alone after the first
cycle of collaboration. Nevertheless, lecturers can always consult with the PRO-
DEAC team when needed, and may ask for a new intervention after a while.
Also to speed the learning process, other professors have written descriptions
of genres or materials for written tasks, and these have been prepared by the
linguist-partners as bibliography in their subject matter programs.

Students

   Students who have participated in the Program have experienced similar
evolution. Although some of them recognized their need for systematic assis-
tance in writing academic texts, others at first expressed that the Program meant
an "extra load" to their duties. Their concern about writing had to do with the
"content" of the texts, in the traditional sense of the term, disregarding the in-
fluence of writing on their process of construing knowledge. Nevertheless, their
texts presented problems in both form and content. After several participations
in the Program, when they could appreciate the benefits they received from the
kind of intervention involved and their own progress in writing, students began
to give positive value to PRODEAC and showed increasing understanding of
the meaning of writing in disciplines.

   These reactions have been observed through the consultations the students
made in class as well as the comments they made on the texts of other students
and on their own texts after a learning process. Students' awareness increased
from considering graphical aspects and formalities of presentation (e.g., num-
ber of pages) to taking into account matters of information flow or register.
They started to pay attention to social context and the need of adjusting dis-
course to it, the structure of the text, the kinds of information to include, and
its organization. Moreover, they start to make spontaneous demands on such
complex genres as research projects or reports and show awareness of some
characteristics of written mode and particularities of language of different dis-
ciplines. This level of consciousness has consequences in the evolution of their
abilities in writing (Giudice, Natale & Stagnaro, 2008; Giudice, 2009a, 2009b;
Giudice & Moyano, 2009; Stagnaro & Natale, 2009).

PRODEAC Language Teachers

   One challenge of the Program is the special training of the teachers of Span-
ish involved, who are expected to be familiar with descriptions of academic and
professional genres and with accurate strategies for teaching academic and pro-

                                                                                                 29
Moyano and Natale

fessional literacy in different areas of knowledge. As linguists, they need to be
capable of doing further and detailed descriptions of those genres and special-
ized language in Spanish. They also need interpersonal and professional skills to
participate in the negotiation device and to respond to lecturers' and students'
demands in a productive way.

   This profile is not easy to find, so the Program provides space for discussion
in seminars, where members of the team share their experiences in different
interventions, descriptions of the genres the students were asked to write, prog-
ress made in negotiating with subject lecturers, and problems in written texts of
the students involved and improvements made by them. These instances make
room for collective knowledge construction about matters related to PRODE-
AC, its development, and systematic work.

                              CONCLUSIONS

   PRODEAC has been designed with the main goals of promoting improved
students' performance in the university and preparing them for professional
lives. According to Systemic Functional Linguistics theories of language, cul-
ture, knowledge construction, and learning, these goals are related to develop-
ment of meaning potential and academic literacy skills.

   The Program's original features include involving institutional actors of dif-
ferent hierarchies and disciplines, who provide institutional support of differ-
ent kinds. The high commitment shown by these diverse individuals has been
possible due to the fact that one of the main concerns of UNGS is to develop
pedagogical tools, including reading and writing programs, which contribute
to education of students who have grown up in disadvantaged social contexts
(Coraggio, 1994).

   This institutional support allowed the Program to expand their application
field from six subject matters in the first semester of intervention to 20 in each
of the latest semesters. In order to promote this expansion, the institution pro-
vided funding to create posts in PRODEAC to incorporate researcher-profes-
sors in linguistics. This action resulted in the formation of a group that controls
the activities and ways of intervention and produces knowledge about different
relevant aspects: e.g., accuracy of the pedagogic proposal, genre descriptions,
features of academic writing in Spanish, evolution of students' abilities in aca-
demic and professional literacy, and evolution of linguistic and generic aware-
ness by different disciplines' lecturers. Some of these developments have been
made in the frame of new research projects in UNGS and in association with
universities from abroad.

   The challenge now is to continue research to improve performance in all the
mentioned aspects of the Program, to produce teaching materials and publish
them on the PRODEAC website,6 and to produce knowledge about the lan-
guages of disciplines in Spanish as well as in other academic and professional
genres.7

                                    NOTES

1. Complete degrees in Argentina last five years or 10 semesters. In the Universidad
Nacional de General Sarmiento, each degree has two cycles: the General University
Cycle (the first five semesters) and the Degree Cycle (5 semesters more), with excep-
tion made for Teaching Degrees for the Secondary School Level, for which the Degrees
Cycle lasts three semesters. Before starting their studies, students have to pass a manda-
tory University Adaptation Course (CAU), consisting of three subjects: Mathematics,
Science, and a 92-hour Reading & Writing course (cf. http://www.ungs.edu.ar/areas/
in_oferta_academica/n/academic-offer-.html).

2. The name of the Program in Spanish is "Programa de Desarrollo de Habilidades de
Lectura y Escritura Académicas a lo largo de la Carrera".

3. UNGS is not organized in faculties but in institutes. One of them, the Institute of
Sciences, is part of the General University Cycle of all the degrees and the other three
are the responsibility of the Degrees Cycle, according to groups of degrees: Institute of
Industry, Institute of Metropolitan Area Studies, and Institute of Human Development
(cf. http://www.ungs.edu.ar/areas/in_inicio/n/home.html).

4. In Argentina, teachers of Spanish working at the university level must have at least a
university degree or equivalent qualifications. Most of them (all of them at UNGS) are
devoted to research in linguistics, applied linguistics, or literature.

WRITING TO LEARN BIOLOGY

IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A

DIDACTIC-CURRICULAR

CHANGE IN THE FIRST YEAR

PROGRAM AT AN ARGENTINE

UNIVERSITY

By Ana De Micheli and Patricia Iglesia
Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina)

Reading and writing are essential practices for learning disciplines.
Based on this idea, at biology courses of the first year at University of
Buenos Aires (UBA) we have been working for ten years with writing
to learn cellular biology. In this article we present the difficulties that
students face when writing about biology, we describe our work dur-
ing the classes with writing tasks and also we mention the challenges
we continue to face as professors committed to our students' learning.
Giving writing a space in the classroom represents an effort not only
for students, but also for the teachers, especially when our teaching is
done in large classrooms. Nevertheless, the results that we are obtaining
in terms of the number of students who pass the class, in the quality of
texts they write and in the students' commitment to their own learning
are evidence that it is a worthwhile endeavor.

   In order to understand the concepts of any field of knowledge and educa-
tion, it is necessary to appropriate languages and specific ways of explaining,
relating, representing, debating and communicating them. In contrast to what
most university professors hold true, we believe that the practices of reading
and writing--which are essential to the learning of any discipline--cannot be
learned until the student experiences situations of written production and bib-
liographical research within the area (Carlino, 2005)

   Based on this idea, in our Biology course within the Basic Common Cycle
(CBC) at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA), we have been working for more

than a decade on activities that incorporate writing as resources for learning about
cellular biology, the discipline we teach. In this article, we present the difficulties
that students face when writing about biology, the advances that we have made
in implementing the didactic strategies aimed at facilitating such tasks, and the
challenges we continue to face as professors committed to our students' learning.

                  THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

   In 1985, the CBC was instituted as part of the democratic processes begun
in 1983 in Argentina after a seven-year military government. The CBC is the
first-year curriculum for the 70+ degrees offered by the UBA, the largest free
public university in Argentina and also one of the most prestigious. At the
CBC, twenty-two subjects are given each quarter; each student must take six
of these subjects, based on the degree program that he or she has chosen. The
student body of the CBC is heterogeneous in terms of its sociocultural level. In
fact, the more than 50,000 students who enter the CBC each year come from
both private and public high schools whose educational levels vary greatly. The
students are distributed among ten different branches of the CBC in the capital
city and Greater Buenos Aires. At each branch, the courses are organized by one
or two professors and coordinated by a professor who is entrusted with estab-
lishing the educational guidelines.

   In the last few years, CBC professors have reported that their students find
reading and writing tasks more and more challenging. In spite of this problem,
which can partially be attributed to the educational crisis at the high school
level in Argentina, little has been done at the university to address it. Maybe
one exception is the reading and writing workshop for students who choose a
degree in the social sciences.

   One of the subjects that is given at the CBC is biology, a class that is mainly
focused on cellular biology. This subject is obligatory for all who are studying
towards degrees related to living creatures, agricultural production, and health.
Approximately 8,000 students take Biology each quarter at the ten branches of
the CBC; the groups generally include over seventy students each. From the
beginning, the teaching of this discipline was based on a reductionist approach
to living structures and a transmissive didactical tradition. These concepts take
form in lectures that involve scarce participation on the part of students, a great
quantity of information on the subject and student examinations that are gen-
erally multiple choice.

   This traditional approach to teaching biology sparks little interest among
students, leading them to drop the class and evaluate the subject with disap-

36
                                                                Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina)

proval. Due to our discontent with the results and our belief that what was
being taught and the way it was being taught contributed little to educating
students as citizens and future professionals, in 1996 the Biology professors at
the North Region Branch of the CBC decided to work towards an innovative
reform of the curriculum. This reform has been based on political, epistemo-
logical, and didactical considerations.

             BASES FOR THE DIDACTICAL CHANGE
                         IN THE CURRICULUM

   First, we understand that as teachers committed to public education, it is
our responsibility to facilitate the accommodation of a heterogeneous student
body in the university sphere. At the same time, we should promote the learn-
ing of content important to their future careers and help them develop the
cognitive abilities they require to do so.

   Second, innovation is based on a systemic conception of living beings which,
unlike the reductionist approach, conceives of them with a two-fold epistemo-
logical approach: as a whole with a historical, spatial dimension that interacts
with its environment, and as the result of a great number of metabolic and
physiological processes (Meyer et al., 1979; Morin, 1990; Lewontin, Rose, &
Kamin, 1996). Our curriculum is based on analyzing cellular processes in order
to understand the properties of the living beings, the relations among living
beings, and connections between such beings and their environment. In this
regard, instead of emphasizing the acquisition of a great quantity of informa-
tion and terminology applicable to cellular biology, we organize relationships
in hierarchies (organisms, cells, molecules) and on the articulation of different
curricular topics in order to explain specific biological events. We are thus able
to establish a dialectical relationship between theory and practice (Lucarelli,
2009).

   Finally, our teaching rests on a constructivist conception of learning, which
we understand as an event that results from continual, repetitive interaction
between the experience of the subject, the student's previous knowledge, his/her
emotional and cognitive structure, and the object of learning. In the process of
learning a discipline, the following all play fundamental roles: the significance
of the content to learn, its functionality, and the development of cognitive and
meta-cognitive abilities and strategies (Giordan & De Vecchi., 1997). In ad-
dition, and based on the idea that the construction of disciplinary knowledge
is a social event that involves appropriating a conceptual and methodological
system, the learning of an area of knowledge requires that students develop a

                                                                                                 37

verbal language for the communicative interaction with others (Jorba, Gómez,
Prat, 2000).

                 COMMUNICATION PRACTICES IN
                     THE BIOLOGY CLASSROOM

         Given the importance that we assign to communication in learning a
discipline, we have organized different channels for oral and written commu-
nication in our classrooms. With respect to orality, we alternate moments of
work-related lecture with small groups whose productions are then discussed
in the lecture hall. These strategies make the class more dynamic and give
students a feeling of belonging, facilitating the flow of information. How-
ever, there are several obstacles that make it difficult for individual learning
to occur in large classes. On the one hand, few students dare to express their
ideas before their classmates. In addition, oral communication allows for little
time to reflect on what is heard and said. This feature of oral communica-
tion is counterproductive for a population of students who are unaccustomed
to thinking before giving their opinions and to answering questions whose
response requires some type of elaboration.

   For their part, reading and writing are two important methods for access-
ing knowledge at the university level. However, it is generally believed that
students at this level do not require guidance in order to read class texts or to
produce academic papers. In our subject, we have been focused for many years
on helping students utilize the written word in an interpretative way, and not as
a labeling system that involves an endless list of processes, structures, and mol-
ecules (Sutton, 2003). To achieve this interpretive learning within the subject of
the school and our assessments, we confront students with different problems
and challenge them to write about these problems. Some of these activities are
aimed at relating a certain molecular process with other events that occur in
the same cell, in other cells within the organism, or in other living beings. Oth-
ers are meant to have students explain biological events and/or justify whether
statements on certain disciplinary issues are true or false. We believe that in
activities of this kind, writing can become a practice with epistemic potential,
an unbeatable resource in learning the subject from a systemic viewpoint.

   For the biology professors, analyzing the texts of students and reflecting
on the contributions that we can make to facilitate writing was a process of
denaturalization, one that involved critical reflection on our own practices as
writers and editors of biology-related texts. On this path, we established fruit-
ful contacts with other university professors who incorporate writing practices

38
                                                                Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina)

when teaching their subjects. At the same time, some of the professors began
post-graduate studies on writing and reading. Thus, through a recursive process
between reflexive teaching practice and theory, we worked to construct a corpus
of knowledge and questions that guided our work as professors.

       WRITING IN BIOLOGY: OBSTACLES, DIDACTIC
         STRATEGIES, SUCCESSES AND CHALLENGES

   For a long time, our only access to the written productions of students was
through written examinations. By evaluating these products, we were able to
identify different kinds of difficulties related to (a) the construction of disciplin-
ary concepts, (b) the use of these concepts to explain specific biological cases, (c)
the lack of knowledge of ways to explain that were characteristic of the natural
sciences, and (d) linguistic problems that do not allow the professor to under-
stand what it is that the student wants to communicate.

   With the goal of helping our students confront these difficulties, five years
ago we began to promote writing assignments throughout the quarter. This
task was accompanied by suggestions on the possible strategies to be utilized
as resources to plan the assignments. Some strategies are geared toward coming
up with guidelines for relating different subject-related concepts. These include
putting together a network that functions as a textual plan and the drafting of
a conceptual aura of a certain term, a concept used by Giordan and De Vecchi
(1997) to refer to expanding a concept. Other strategies are aimed at clarifying
the characteristics of explicative tests and putting them into practice to stream-
line their use.

   Experience has shown that students become committed to writing when
the teacher is able to explain the importance of the task, provide students with
continual feedback, and thus convince them and stimulate them to write. We
are currently working with two types of texts written by students: (a) produc-
tions that are the result of some of the activities of the course material, geared
to connecting subject-related concepts and (b) questions that the professor asks
students to prepare after completing each subject unit in order to gather infor-
mation on pending doubts and/or questions. With respect to the first type of
writing, the assignments are returned with comments by the professor. Over
time, we have varied the kind of feedback we provide as professors: at the begin-
ning, we simply made corrections, but we now avoid intervening in the texts
and instead make footnotes with suggestions, encouraging students to rewrite
when necessary. Most of the suggestions are related to conceptual errors, lack of
relevance, cohesion and/or coherence of certain parts of the text, and the lack

                                                                                                 39

of punctuation. For their part, the questions posed by the students are a very
useful resource for the professor because questions give him/her a view into
the aspects that have not been sufficiently explained during classes. After being
analyzed, the questions are answered in the following class.

   The students who respond favorably to the writing instructions and who
read the professor's feedback express that writing helped them learn biology.
Through semi-structured surveys, some of them stated that writing was useful
when learning concepts, because it made them familiar with the subject-related
vocabulary; for their part, the teacher's observations assisted them in detect-
ing their mistakes. In addition, "When preparing the texts, it is necessary to
reread the concepts and better understand them, and relate them with other
processes." To put it differently, writing this type of text "helps [me] to relate
the terms and thus better understand the concepts." Other students mentioned
that writing offered them a different way to study than that which they were
accustomed to; generally, they were limited to studying "book texts without
providing my own explanations"; in these cases, texts were "simply memorized
if I couldn't understand the explanation." On the other hand, this systematic
work "helps me to avoid postponing." In addition, students admitted that writ-
ing helped them "be clearer and more coherent in terms of determining what is
most important, what is least relevant, and also to express myself better." Simi-
larly, teacher comments helped them "give the reader a context...not just act as
if they already knew things, but explain everything." Finally, students valued the
chance to prepare questions on the aspects they had not understood about each
area and get answers to these questions because "I may have some of the same
doubts as the other students."

   In spite of the success in establishing writing as a way to learn biology,
there are at least two challenges that remain which merit additional actions
in the future. In the first place, we still have not managed to get all of the
teachers in the course to address writing with their students. It appears
evident that it is difficult for professors to diverge from the teaching mod-
els they learned and that doing it requires much critical reflection on the
teaching practice. In this process, the joint work of two professors in each
classroom proved highly useful. However, having two teachers in a class-
room is not always possible due to institutional limitations; making this
possible would help professors who are not as committed to their students'
writing learn the strategies used by colleagues who are more aware of the
importance of writing to learn.

   The second challenge is related to the comments we make on students' writ-
ten assignments. The form and content of the comments vary from professor
to professor, depending on their own experiences as writers and their implicit

40
                                                                Universidad de Buenos Aires (Argentina)

or explicit conception of the role of professors in facilitating student tasks. This
disparity necessitates activities aimed at reflection, perhaps in conjunction with
specialized professionals who can help us give a name to the methods used by
different professors in order to discuss and prepare a more rational strategy on
which professors all agree.

                              CONCLUSIONS

   The construction of knowledge is a social process in which communication
and dialogue play fundamental roles.

   The experience of professors and students suggests that in response to
guidelines established in the subject in the framework of a didactical-curricular
change, the practice of writing can have important epistemic value. This val-
ue grows when writing is inscribed in a dynamic dialogue: students write and
professors return the papers with comments and/or suggestions or with verbal
answers.

   By concerning themselves with the writing of their students, the challenge
for professors is twofold: it involves making students familiar with the kinds
of writing within our subject area and denaturalizing our practices as "expert"
writers to identify the strategies that we use and thus be able to teach them.

   Finally, giving writing a space in the classroom represents an effort not only
for students, but also for the teachers, especially when our teaching is done in
large classrooms. Nevertheless, the results that we are obtaining in terms of the
number of students who pass the class, the quality of texts they write, and the
students' commitment to their own learning are evidence that it is a worthwhile
endeavor.

DEVELOPING STUDENTS'

WRITING AT QUEENSLAND

UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY

By Karyn Gonano and Peter Nelson
Queensland University of Technology (Australia)

Identifying who is responsible for academic writing at QUT is a
challenge. The message gained from many years of experience is that
any writing program needs to be implemented from an institutional
perspective and be both top down and bottom up. It must be well
planned, well funded, and well integrated within the teaching and
learning framework of the university. Written from the perspective of
the Language and Learning Unit, whose work in prior years has pri-
marily benefitted international students through various services, this
profile essay outlines the Unit's more recent approach to meeting the
writing needs of all students. As a central provider of academic writing
the Unit is using the Australian government's DEEWR/AUQA Good
Practice Principles in a multifaceted approach with faculties to posi-
tion writing, not only as a core skill required to satisfactorily complete
assessment tasks, but over the longer term, as a key graduate attribute.

                          QUT--AN OVERVIEW

   Queensland University of Technology (QUT) is an Australian university with
an applied emphasis on courses and research. Based in Brisbane, QUT has an
enrolment averaging 40,000 students in undergraduate and postgraduate courses,
including 6,000 from overseas. QUT has close links with industry, which com-
plement theoretical learning with a practical perspective. Industry professionals
contribute to course development, while academic staff also consult in industry.

   QUT has three campuses. The main campus is located in the Central Busi-
ness District while the Kelvin Grove campus (10 minutes by shuttle bus) houses
the Creative Industries Precinct, Australia's first site dedicated to creative experi-
mentation and commercial development in the creative industries. The Institute
of Health and Biomedical Innovation is also at Kelvin Grove. Caboolture is one

Gonano and Nelsons

of Australia's newest campuses and is situated half-way between Brisbane and the
Sunshine Coast.

                What literacy and writing mean at QUT

   QUT is structured to enhance students' learning and academic skills. Its ap-
proach to teaching and learning is articulated in the Manual of Policies and Pro-
cedures (MOPP), and the QUT Blue Print articulates the university's vision and
goals to strengthen its reputation as a leading Australian university for quality
teaching and learning, as well as to strengthen its distinctive national and inter-
national reputation by combining academic strength with practical engagement.

          Who is responsible for academic writing at QUT?

   While the importance of effective written and oral communication skills is
identified broadly in the MOPP, it is not articulated clearly as an integral part of
what academics should do in their daily teaching. It is not an uncommon expec-
tation among academics that students should arrive at university with requisite
written and oral communication skills firmly in place. Students who fail to meet
this expectation are often seen as a problem for the support people in the library,
International Student Services (ISS), or Learning Services. In other words, aca-
demics often see the professional staff as providing a remedial service to "fix the
problem." One academic, who wishes to remain anonymous, confirmed this
duality of teaching roles in a personal conversation in November 2009, when he
stated, "I am a lecturer of economics, not a teacher of writing" (Nelson, 2009).
It is clear therefore that addressing the issues around student writing requires a
multifaceted approach that includes addressing the attitudes, focus, and percep-
tions of academic staff.

   The approach to academic writing at QUT has historically been ad hoc. Apart
from the occasional short-term funded project, there has been no coordinated
attempt by the university to teach academic writing, even though it remains the
most common form of assessment at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. It is
interesting to note that QUT has no school or department of English or English
Literature, and apart from the Faculty of Creative Industries--which offers Cre-
ative Writing and Literary Studies, Journalism, Media and Communication--
there is no tradition of writing classes for undergraduate students. Since 2002,
there has been no Faculty of Arts. Historically, the Language and Learning Unit
within International Student Services has only provided ongoing academic writ-
ing support for international students and those from a non English-speaking
background (NESB; these students in Australia are now referred to as CALD,

culturally and linguistically diverse), while the library has traditionally provided
academic writing support predominantly for domestic students.

   One effort, however, to address the issue of student literacy occurred in 1992,
when Ros Petelin (2002), responding to a University-wide call for Teaching and
Learning initiative proposals, implemented at QUT `the first Writing-across-the-
Curriculum (WAC) program in the Australian Higher Education sector' (Pete-
lin, 2002, p. 98). The program was funded by an initial grant of $45,000 and
identified a need for a writing program through a survey of all full-time academic
staff. As part of the WAC program, writing workshops were conducted "for fac-
ulty eager to learn and share strategies to integrate writing into their disciplines"
(Petelin, 2002, p. 101). Handouts were developed, assessment tasks were rede-
signed for participating academics, faculty champions were brought on board,
and "WAC designed and developed discipline-specific writing handbooks" for a
number of schools (Petelin, 2002, p. 102).

   Although many valuable activities and resources were developed as a result of
this initiative, the program did not last. While feedback was positive, its lack of
sustainability was attributed to a lack of resources for staffing and administrative
support, particularly to maintain the development of materials and workshops
in the classroom (Petelin, 2002, pp. 103-04).

   In retrospect, it seems that writing development projects at QUT, including
WAC, have not continued because they were very ambitious, not supported by
all faculty academics, and rose and fell with the individuals driving them. Ad-
ditionally, in terms of the WAC project, the unwillingness to link WAC with
"the most obvious ally, the service units," meant the project could not capitalise
on existing resources of staff, funding, and administration, a component Petelin
(2002, p. 105) identifies to being critical to the sustainability of an academic
writing program. While ISS today is working hard to remove the remedial tag, it
is one of the major ongoing providers of academic writing support.

   In the search to identify who in 2011 is responsible for academic writing at
QUT, it is apparent that any writing program must be implemented from an
institutional perspective and be both top down and bottom up. It must be well
planned, well funded, and well supported by a champion at a high level within
the university.

           ROLES OF THE QUT LIBRARY AND OF THE
            LANGUAGE AND LEARNING UNIT OF ISS

   The QUT Library now provides more extensive support for more students
in more flexible ways. This model of service and support for learning skills is the

                                                                                                 45

result of restructuring in tertiary institutions that has taken place since 2004.
The emphasis on flexible delivery means that library staff have assumed respon-
sibility for point-of-need support and ongoing development of academic and
information literacy skills. The library also provides valuable generic resources
such as Cite|write and Studywell (http://www.studywell.library.qut.edu.au/).

   At the same time, the Language and Learning Unit in ISS has increased its
role substantially as a teaching unit for academic skills, particularly academic
writing. Since its establishment in 1990, the unit has provided academic writ-
ing support for international students in the form of one-to-one sessions, ad-
junct academic writing classes within faculties (for example MBA, Accounting,
Engineering), and introductory sessions during University orientation at the
start of each academic year. In response to the increasing number of interna-
tional students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds enrolling
in higher degree research (HDR) programs, the unit has also developed a range
of programs to develop students' writing and research skills through intensive
workshops and individual consultations. This central service model is now be-
ing expanded to include collaborative arrangements with faculties to provide
embedded support for all QUT students. Our goal therefore at ISS is to make
academic writing a part of the fabric of the faculties' teaching and learning
practice for both international and domestic students.

     WRITING--DISCIPLINES, GENRES, ASSIGNMENTS

   Undergraduate degrees at QUT are both three and four year, and students
enrol in four units (subjects) each semester. Each unit generally requires three
pieces of summative assessment, including a written assignment and/or presen-
tation; tutorial participation and/or activity; and an end of semester written
examination, though this exam may be limited to short-answer and multiple
choice questions. Academics have tended to leave students to their own devices
when it comes to writing assignments, assuming they already know how to
write and in what genre, and that they know what the lecturer is expecting.
However, the government's Bradley Review, Transforming Australia's Higher
Education System, was implemented in 2009 to widen participation in univer-
sities, resulting in an increasingly diverse range of students--with an equally
significant range of experiences--who have to complete academic writing tasks.

   Yet even today, academics are still reluctant to model examples of essays,
for a variety of reasons, including a fear of plagiarism. Few appear to have the
skills set to deconstruct texts and teach students how to write in their discipline.
International students, however, have had greater access to academic writing

46
                                                       Queensland University of Technology (Australia)

support and can participate in generic academic writing programs presented by
ISS during orientation week and the fourth week of each semester. These inter-
national students can make one-hour appointments to work with the Language
and Learning Advisors in ISS, both face-to-face and online. The online service
requires students to email their writing, task sheet, and criteria sheet to their
Language and Learning Advisor by 9.00 AM on the day of their appointment.
This service is used increasingly by the international students who work part
time and/or find it difficult to access the university in the centre of the city.
Feedback is via Microsoft Word "track changes," and Advisors provide detailed
suggestions to students on how to improve their writing. During busy periods
in the semester, when many assessment tasks are due, it is always a challenge for
the Advisors to balance the urgency of students wanting to have their writing
"checked" before it is handed in with their role as language developers.

         As noted earlier, the support for all students, particularly do-
         mestic, has increased with the new central services provided
         by the library. The library's Information Literacy Coordina-
         tor, Judith Peacock, has statedOne of the greatest attributes
         of this university is the extensive collaboration across the
         university, where the Library and ISS, for example, support
         each other in providing more comprehensive services for stu-
         dents via programs such as AusAid and Peer Mentoring. This
         institutional awareness of what particular groups or teams are
         doing across the university is exceptional, though personality
         driven. [...] However, we no longer have people in silos not
         sharing (Peacock, 2010).

                PLANNING APPROACHES TO HELP
                   STUDENTS GROW AS WRITERS

   A community of practice has played a significant role in how we, as Lan-
guage and Learning Advisors in ISS, meet to discuss ways to help students grow
as writers. Close collaboration among a core team of full-time advisors has led
to the development of a variety of programs. One such program is the Intro-
ductory Academic Program (IAP) for newly enrolled AusAid scholarship stu-
dents. Another is IRIS, the Introduction to Research for International Students,
which was also developed in response to champion academics asking for sup-
port in their classrooms. This program later developed into the faculty specific
Language Development Program (LDP). These programs are detailed below.

                                                                                                 47

         SUCCESSES IN TEACHING WRITING AT QUT

   AusAid scholarships are highly-valued and aim to contribute to the long-
term development needs of Australia's partner countries by providing scholar-
ship holders with leadership skills and knowledge to drive change and influ-
ence the development outcomes of their own country (Australian Government
2009, p. 1). AusAid is a five week course and includes a one week "settling
in" component and a four week intensive academic program. This program is
designed by the ISS Language and Learning Unit and conducted each January
and June prior to each new academic semester. The program enables students to
develop and practice language and learning skills needed for success in their aca-
demic studies. The main academic focus is a project which links directly to each
individual student's intended course of study and leads students through a series
of tasks, which include: principles of effective academic writing; understand-
ing criteria for assessment; starting to research and find references; developing
listening and note-taking skills (with different guest lecturers from faculties in
which the students are enrolled); reading and research strategies; article sum-
mary writing; understanding and exploring their projects--developing useful
research questions; identifying the structure of, and deconstructing a typical es-
say; text analysis; literature review and using literature to support an argument,
as well as using references effectively; report writing, academic language, and
style; learning styles and strategies; oral presentation strategies; and advanced
powerpoint strategies.

    Students are required to present a summary of selected readings, a draft es-
say outline, and a final essay of 2,000 words, as well as an oral presentation of
10 minutes with a five minute question session. The teaching team members
each present different sessions in the program, providing students a variety of
teaching styles and accents.

   Students respond positively to the program and their comments have
included:

         Great facilitation and support from the teachers in academic
         writing sessions.

         These sessions actually made me improve my capacities and
         understanding.

         A lovely program, makes me feel confident to take on the
         QUT challenge.

         IAP is excellent in giving us a better understanding of what is
         expected in terms of academic writing.

         IAP really improved my writing skills including planning
         and structuring. I`ve gained confidence in my work. (Song,
         2010).

   Student responses for the sessions on "Speaking in academic settings" have
included:

         For the first time, I learned how to write my own speech for
         presentations.

         Helped a lot, especially the support and positive criticism was
         amazing.

         Really good session. It gave me a chance to speak my ideas,
         and learn the methods from my peers and the lecturer that I
         can use to improve myself. (Song, 2010).

   Another success story is the IRIS program, established in 2003 to address
the needs of QUT's international HDR students. All eligible students received
an invitation to participate in the IRIS Program of six contact hours each week
over seven weeks. Specifically, the program:

   · supported newly-arrived international research students to adjust to the
       QUT academic culture

   · provided practical experience in core written and oral communication
       skills critical to undertaking research at QUT

   · established a positive and productive student/supervisor relationship.
       (Nelson, 2003.)

   The IRIS Program experienced steady growth each year with 259 interna-
tional HDR students successfully completing the program. Timely, relevant,
and meaningful support was the key element, and content was framed to sup-
port students as they pursued their individual research projects. Engagement
with the IRIS Program early in their candidature meant that these students
developed a greater awareness of the requirements of their research proposal as
well as greater confidence in communication (particularly with supervisors),
plus a vital support network with other research students. The IRIS Program
addressed the added challenges faced by HDR international students in terms

                                                                                                 49
Gonano and Nelsons

of language difficulties, social and family dislocation, financial hardship, and
adjustment to an unfamiliar educational and research culture.

   The IRIS Program was conducted twice a semester over two campuses and
acknowledged the rigours and challenges of cultural adjustment by incorporat-
ing specific sessions on work-study-life balance. The issues of finding direction
at the beginning of their research journey and understanding their new aca-
demic requirements were addressed by adopting a learner-centred approach in
a supportive environment underpinned by the principles and practice of:

   · authentic models of research work
   · guided practice and feedback followed by individual practice
   · active participation and engagement through independent learning
   An IRIS participant in 2008 stated that "the IRIS program helped to clarify
the HDR student process for me. It gave me support so that I don't feel too iso-
lated" (Nelson, Gonano, Lawson, & Reese, 2008). By providing collaborative
learning opportunities, participants understood that they were part of a broader
community of scholars. The Senior Student Forum allowed new and senior
students to share, critique, and reflect on their respective postgraduate jour-
neys. Students also supported "the short and sharp, relaxed cross-disciplinary
environment", and said that "one of the overall strengths of this course is the
opportunity of presenting in front of a large group, and getting feedback for our
writing" (IRIS participant in Nelson et.al., 2008).
   Overall, the IRIS program made a significant contribution to teaching and
learning at QUT and in 2007 won the QUT Vice-Chancellor's Award for Ex-
cellence--in recognition of exceptional sustained performance and outstanding
achievement in learning and teaching, client focus, and innovative and creative
practice. It was subsequently nominated for a prestigious Carrick Award for
Australian University Teaching in 2008.

     THE NEW LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

   However, the rapidly increasing number of international HDR students
caused the Language and Learning Advisors to review the IRIS model. Devel-
oping writing skills is a long-term process and while the introductory programs,
even those of an intensive nature such as IRIS and AusAid, provide a solid
foundation, it was felt that a series of faculty-based programs rather than a
broad-based interdisciplinary program would better target and meet the needs
of this diverse student population.

   The new Language Development Programs (LDP), launched by ISS in
2009, are conducted each semester in the Engineering, Science/IT, Education,

50
                                                       Queensland University of Technology (Australia)

and Health Faculties and target the language needs, both written and spoken, of
the international HDR student population as they work towards the milestones
in their candidature: namely Stage 2 (LDP 1), Confirmation and Confirmation
Presentation (LDP 2), Thesis (LDP 4) and Final seminar (LDP 5). LDP uses
faculty-specific materials and detailed discourse analysis of authentic academic
texts and student writing samples, along with an expanded range of support
that includes oral communication skills, one-to-one (one hour) sessions and
writing circles (LDP 3). These writing circles provide international students
with a supportive peer-centred environment to meet in small groups within
their community of scholars, where they can receive and offer non-judgemental
feedback on their writing-in-progress. Continuing the momentum of the lan-
guage development philosophy as established in LDP 1 and LDP 2, the ISS
Language and Learning Advisors determined that students working together to
support each other and facilitated by an Advisor would enable more students
to become more independent writers. These writing circles are facilitated by an
experienced Language and Learning Advisor who is able to highlight specific
thesis writing tools and strategies.

   Already the programs have been successful, as students understand that their
PhD is actually a three-year research and writing journey. By participating in
LDP they are better equipped to develop and edit their own writing. Professor
Thambiratnam, who supervises a number of international HDR students, not-
ed in an email to the Faculty of Built Environment and Engineering Research
Officer that:

         The English classes have been a tremendous help to these
         students. I and some of my colleagues have seen the marked
         improvement in the English of these students. One of my
         students recently submitted a paper to me and to the other 2
         supervisors for review. All 3 of us agreed that the paper was
         very well written. This student was previously struggling with
         his English. I am writing to thank you and the Faculty for
         organising these classes. They were much needed and I hope
         that they will continue. (Thambiratnam, 2009).

   Students see the programs as timely in terms of acquiring strategies to de-
velop their own writing and speaking (Nelson, 2009). Specifically, LDP focuses
on writing the abstract, introduction, literature review, methodology, discus-
sion, and results chapters as well as on presenting their confirmation and final
defence. The Language and Learning teaching team also value LDP, as more
students are participating in a writing program that is timely and developmen-

                                                                                                 51
Gonano and Nelsons

tal for each student. Contributing to the LDP's success is that one ISS teaching
staff member is assigned to one faculty. The relationships built among the stu-
dents, their supervisors, and the faculty are invaluable in helping students de-
velop early on in their candidature the independence they need to write about
their research. Meanwhile, the staff member develops a detailed understanding
of faculty material, students' supervisors, and faculty organisers (as it is the
faculty who promote the program, enrol the students and book the rooms and
resources) to underpin this model of support.

                 LOOKING TOWARD THE FUTURE

   2011 is a watershed year for academic writing at QUT. ISS staff are looking
at ways to develop further the idea that academic writing is firmly embedded
in the fabric of the university's teaching and learning. In 2010, we changed the
name of our unit to the Academic Writing, Language and Learning Centre,
with our ultimate aim to work as a key provider of academic writing develop-
ment programs and to sustain an excellent level of support to all student writers.

   Currently, the Language and Learning team is collaborating with the facul-
ties of Health and Business on major programs to embed language and learn-
ing development within targeted units. These programs will serve as models of
"good practice" based on the Australian government's DEEWR/AUQA Good
Practice Principles (DEEWR/AUQA), which can be adapted for other ISS-Fac-
ulty collaborations across QUT. Significantly, they position writing, not only
as a core skill required to satisfactorily complete assessment tasks, but over the
longer term as a key graduate attribute.

   These two programs include School-based/Unit-embedded workshops and
activities developed in collaboration with unit lecturing staff and delivered at
timely intervals throughout the semester. Cross-faculty language development
workshops target key areas of need particularly in regard to professional and
graduate skills development. These workshops are supplemented and extended
throughout the semester by individual consultations and small-group writing
circles.

   When ISS and Language and Learning Advisors embed academic writing
programs in the actual classroom or work with academics to incorporate a sec-
ond-language perspective into their teaching, both international and domestic
students benefit. Our goal to become an Academic Writing Centre for all stu-
dents has evolved from our well-established and innovative language develop-
ment programs and strategies.

   Significantly in terms of sustainability, this work has now received funding
from the highest levels of the university and has been included as part of the
university's SISL (Support for International Student Learning) Project, a major
initiative chaired by the Deputy Vice-Chancellor (International and Develop-
ment). This commitment reflects the renewed focus in 2011 on the quality
of education, particularly for international students. This level of support is
also evidence of the growing recognition at the highest levels that writing for
all students is a fundamental process of learning which is inextricably linked
to developing deep learning; it is a process that can be taught and learned as
an embedded skill within a targeted unit where modelling and deconstructing
texts will enhance student writing, hence understanding.

TEACHING ACADEMIC

WRITING AT THE UNIVERSITY

OF WOLLONGONG

By Emily Purser
University of Wollongong (Australia)

Initiatives for the development of literacy at the University of Wol-
longong are growing within an Australian national commitment to
increase overall tertiary enrollment, provide access to students from
less-advantaged groups, and enroll more international students. While
this essay describes successful programs within the Academic Services
Division at Wollongong built to support student literacy, especially
academic writing, it primarily emphasizes the work of a problem-
solving task force on English language proficiency aimed at building
consensus for a collaborative, cross-disciplinary paradigm of literacy
growth that moves away from the traditional idea of separable services.
The essay profiles a new initiative in the Master of Science program
that exemplifies uses of technology to make literacy growth integral to
every aspect of student learning and success, including the design of
mainstream courses. This initiative and others like it depend on the
collaboration of language teachers and researchers with teachers in the
target disciplines.

                  THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

   The University of Wollongong is a mid-sized Australian university, organised
into nine faculties and various graduate schools and research institutes, with a
population of approximately 23,000 students and 1,000 teaching academics at
its main campus, and growing numbers at its various satellite education centres
and offshore operations. In its relatively short history, the institution has made
a good name for itself, and is very comfortably positioned in annual national
"ratings" competitions that attract federal funding rewards for teaching and
research. The institution's official story can be read through its website, but for

the teaching of academic writing, and how specific programs for any aspect of
language development are conceived and funded here, various specific contex-
tual factors need to be outlined.

   One important factor influencing programmed development of students'
literacy is the university's overall educational mission statement on graduate
qualities, which to be meaningful, has to be related to curricular design and
teaching. It expresses the institution's sense of standards, and indicates five types
of ability that students are expected to achieve, including effective communica-
tion. Another important influence on programming for literacy development is
the institution's planning around recruitment. Perceptions of how best to help
students stay, engage, and succeed in their studies depend very much on the
profile and specific needs of incoming students. Other perhaps less well recog-
nised, but equally important, influences on how literacy development needs are
understood and responded to are policies and established practices in teaching
and assessment across the disciplines, and what teaching academics generally do
or do not know about the linguistic nature of academic work.

   This chapter discusses implications of all these factors in relation to the prac-
ticalities of developing students' capacity to do academic work. It reports on
some good educational experiences resulting from collaborative curriculum de-
sign and co-teaching, and responds to frequently asked questions about wheth-
er, when, where, how and by whom various aspects of "language" might need
to be taught in the context of higher education.

          POSITIONING OF LANGUAGE EDUCATION

   UOW expects its students to become informed, independent yet co-opera-
tive, highly articulate and ethical problem-solvers (see http://www.uow.edu.au/
student/qualities/index.html). This conception of the overall learning outcomes
of any degree program at the university is also explicitly linked to grant and
award incentives, to help teachers develop their own capacity and career around
innovative, and where appropriate, collaborative, curriculum design and peda-
gogy. Creating a very visible profile for oneself as a teacher whose practice re-
alises national goals and provides the sorts of measurable outcomes upon which
good institutional ratings and funding currently depend is rewarded. Not that
teaching is as valued as research, but it can play an important role in career de-
velopment here, and increasing numbers of teachers participate each year in the
complex and time consuming business of institutionally managed self promo-
tion (see UOW Focus on Teaching--Octal awards webpage). Such emphasis on
the development of teachers' capacity is crucial to the development of students'

56
                                                                    University of Wollongong (Australia)

capacity in all aspects of tertiary level literacy, including writing. The matter of
how students learn to communicate effectively, through all the various forms
relevant to the production of new knowledge, needs to be seen as core business
for all faculties, it is argued in this chapter.

Language as "Separable" from Content vs. a Collaborative Model

   But while written communication may be a crucial dimension of aca-
demic work, discussing it (let alone teaching it), is not easy when "language"
is conceived as separable from the "content" being taught and learned in
the disciplines. So the chapter looks also at the benefits of viewing teaching,
learning, and assessment practices as language development work, and as the
most appropriate site for the application of expertise in language education.
While the collaborative practices described may question some established
assumptions and traditions, they are proving very effective and seem to war-
rant publicity.

   Educators across the disciplines are not generally in the habit of thinking
about themselves as actual or potential teachers of English language. The very
notion strikes many as a ludicrous imposition on, or confusion of, their role
and purpose in higher education. It can also strike a note of strange for many
language teachers, who might feel their roles or job security challenged. But
serious questioning around which aspects of the medium of instruction (Eng-
lish language) need explicit, programmed attention at tertiary level should in-
volve serious analysis of the types of comprehension and performance prob-
lems that actually occur in real educational scenarios, and for that it helps to
have people with expertise in educational linguistics as participant observers.
It is less than ideal when the expertise of language researchers and teachers is
confined to the margins of academic curricula, rather than closely associated
with (or as is sometimes appropriate, positioned firmly within) the processes
of their development and delivery. Such argumentation is quite strong at
UOW anyway, where discussion of everything to do with language education
has intensified recently, in response to moves at the national level.

   The relative ease or difficulty that students experience, as they learn to be
good thinkers, speakers, and writers in academic contexts, depends on how
the teaching here relates to their previous experience. Whether the difference
between their university experience here and their past is slight and exciting
or an intimidating chasm has to do with both the recruitment directions
taken by senior executive and the institution's marketing arm (in response to
a complex range of external forces) and the ability and willingness of curricu-
lum developers and teachers to adapt practices accordingly.

       Means and Meaning of Support for Changing Cohorts

   The federal government in Australia, as in many countries, wants to quite
dramatically increase the overall number of citizens educated at tertiary level
within the next two decades, and to increase the proportion of tertiary stu-
dents coming from "low" socio-economic backgrounds and other tradition-
ally disadvantaged social groups (DEEWR, 2008). At the same time, univer-
sities are required to attract a very substantial proportion of their funding
from other sources. Philanthropic donations might develop into something
of an income stream for some of the older universities with wealthy alumni
(Allen Consulting, 2007, p. 7), but for the most part, the main source of
non-government revenue is tuition fees on international students (Deloitte
Access Economics, 2011, p. 6). And their education needs to be high qual-
ity, lest the international marketing of higher education become unsustain-
able (Phillimore & Koshy, 2010, pp. 1-2; Gillard, 2009). In the university's
current planning cycle, the intention is to increase the overall number of
students, and the proportion from specified equity categories, as well as to
maintain or increase the number of international students (UOW Strategic
Plan, 2011, pp. 6, 10, 17). New markets for our education are constantly be-
ing sought, and any falling numbers in one area (such as postgraduate course-
work programs) are to be met with higher recruitment into undergraduate
and research degree programs.

   Such student recruitment goals have implications for retention and per-
formance, recognition of which is reflected in forms of support being provid-
ed for students' development of academic literacy. But "support" still tends to
be understood in limited terms. It is assumed to have more to do with addi-
tional programs and resources than with mainstream curricula and pedagogy
across the disciplines. A proverbial elephant in the room at many curricu-
lum review meetings, most discussion of such connections occurs in private
conversations and in academic publications shared amongst a small number
of scholars who are already in the habit of formulating such questions. The
challenge remains to get adequate and appropriate support for the literacy
development of current and future students into the design of mainstream
disciplinary learning experiences. The situation is ripe for wider debate that
includes those for whom it actually matters most.

   The national quality auditing agency (AUQA) visited UOW in 2011 with
two agreed questions: how do we support student transition into tertiary level
education, and how do we support our international students? (imPAQT
newsletter, 2010). Audits like this generate extensive documentation of cur-
rent institutional practices, and in our case, urgent need was felt to come up

58
                                                                    University of Wollongong (Australia)

with a coherent and visible statement of overall institutional "strategy" for
supporting development of academic literacy, and responding appropriately
to the various English language development needs of incoming university
students. Funds were allocated in 2010 for a strategic project investigating
English Language Proficiency at UOW, which is framed to check how the
institution does or does not yet well implement the Good Practice Principles
for English Language Proficiency in Australian Universities, endorsed by the
Commonwealth Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Re-
lations (DEEWR, 2009). The investigation behind that document began with
a focus on international students using English as an additional language, but
became a more general set of guidelines seen as relevant to all students.

                  THE DEFINITION OF LANGUAGE

   The slippage between "English language" and "academic literacy" through-
out this discussion of support for diversifying student populations is delib-
erately aiming to draw attention to common ground and theoretical prob-
lems. It is often assumed in discussions across the institution that separate
discourses and sources of funding around notions of social inclusion and
internationalisation relate necessarily to different sub-groups of students and
separate educational programs. These assumptions tend not to be challenged
when "language" is understood to refer only to vocabulary and rules of syn-
tax, spelling, and punctuation. Such narrow definition of language goes hand
in hand with the view that the conceptual "content" of a discipline is non-
linguistic and disembodied (put "into" language, but existing independently
of any specific socio-linguistic processes through which people come to know
and negotiate meaning), and with the conception of language education as
error correction and training in "generic skills," which might be taught out-
side the mainstream curriculum by "service" staff. When, on the other hand,
language is understood to operate on multiple inter-related levels simultane-
ously, and to be the substance and instantiation of complex social contexts,
fields of knowledge, subjectivities, and the ongoing reconstruction and ne-
gotiation of meaning, the very notion that "content" might be something
other than language breaks down. When language education is conceived
as examining the normal teaching and learning of an academic discipline
from the perspective of language development processes, the relationship be-
tween those who best understand a discipline and those who best understand
how language works and develops becomes quite different--and dramatically
more useful to students' learning.

                                                                                                 59

     DISCUSSIONS AND HOPED-FOR RESULTS OF THE
       STRATEGIC PROJECT FOR STUDENT LITERACY

   However broadly or narrowly we define language and literacy in this context,
we at least now have a shared picture of our students' need for, and our provision
of, teaching programs for the development of students' academic "literacy": in
preparation for, alongside, and as part of the various academic disciplines being
taught and learned at UOW. The strategic project formed around questions of
English Language Proficiency at UOW was perhaps the first time that the vari-
ous practices constituting our formal programming for the development of stu-
dents' academic literacy have been discussed and described together. Discussion
has been informative as participants have compared how different providers of
language education operate, considered how the roles of language educators are
institutionalized (and for what purposes their programs are designed), and heard
various views on academic literacy and existing development programs from both
language educators and the faculties. But throwing a spotlight onto questions of
students' preparedness for academic work at tertiary level, and how we help them
develop capacity while doing it, as English, is also political. A long felt sense of
competition between providers of language education is no longer quietly latent,
as the message was given that senior executive will fund whichever "model" wins
the argument. Suddenly language educators sense they have to defend their prac-
tices and fight for their professional lives and income streams.

   The development of students' academic literacy is not, however, simply a
matter of economics, and models and programs are not theoretically neutral--
they represent particular ways of thinking about language. While there is some
shared philosophical ground, there are also interesting conflicts of belief and
interest, and very different types and levels of experience shaping views. An-
other complicating factor is that the report of these deliberations being drafted
appears similar to ones emerging in other universities, rather than to be repre-
senting the words and agreements of the committee here. We live in hope that
the process is just messy rather than undemocratic, and expect to reach, if not
agreement on the meaning of literacy and the role of language in academic
learning, at least a workable compromise on the wording of any institutional
strategy that is to appear online for the world to see.

                          QUESTIONS ARISING

   Meanwhile, to those who think most seriously about it, it is clear there can
be no simple or one-size-fits-all solution to the complex range of issues and

60
                                                                    University of Wollongong (Australia)

questions that emerge around academic literacy, and of what language needs to
be taught if students are to most effectively learn their chosen disciplines. The
situation on the ground at this institution is and will no doubt remain more like
a continuum of positions, hanging between two deeply dug-in poles of belief,
jostled by voices blowing from various institutionalized roles and different his-
tories in the teaching of English language. Language is everyone's business, and
the more we talk about it, from any position, the better.

   But key questions have emerged for this writer as a result of these high level
institutional discussions, and shape the selective reporting of language teaching
practices in this chapter, such as: Can a "free market" like ours, where vari-
ous approaches to language education and learning support simply co-exist,
supply the type and amount of literacy development demanded? Is it best to
allow students and faculties to buy, try, and vote with their feet, or to centrally
command? Should not programming decisions be based on reliable evidence
of what provides students best support for learning the disciplines they come
here to study--in terms of measurable learning outcomes within the students'
target discipline itself? Within which model of practice are language education
providers most likely to gather and report relevant evidence? Within which
model of course design and delivery would academic writing instruction be
most likely based on research into the linguistic reality of the disciplines taught
and learned at UOW--a course provided for a fee by an Arts or Education fac-
ulty, or a project-based program tied to funding released on condition that data
be gathered and outcomes reported to the institution? Are courses provided for
a fee likely to be motivated by the students' actual needs, or by the provider's
need to market their wares prêt-à-por·ter? Where are the target disciplines in
the relationship between those selling and buying courses in language educa-
tion? Whose interests are being served when educational policy and governance
practice does not require mainstream courses in the disciplines to be designed
in ways that are evidently most effective for the given students?

   Perhaps the most important question to emerge out of the ongoing discus-
sion of English language proficiency at UOW is how we model the qualities we
want students to develop--how our own teaching, research, and governance
practices reveal us as being well-informed, independent yet co-operative, highly
articulate and ethical problem-solvers, whose work helps students develop ap-
propriate academic knowledge and practice. The ethical dimension of language
education here is not insignificant. About 30% of the operational budget of the
institution is funded by the fees of international students, so we owe them a
very great deal, and need to get their educational experience right. We also like
to think that education has something important to do with the future of this
nation and its people.

                                                                                                 61

   Collaboration in this problem-solving task force on English language pro-
ficiency at UOW has at least resulted in some broad assessment of risks and a
good statement of principles and responsibilities, which officially represents the
development of students' linguistic capacity as a responsibility to be shared by
the whole university--students, all teaching academics, and systems. And as the
written report morphs into something articulate enough for its harshest critics
to accept, active participants in the process have at least become informed of the
situation and the complexity of responding to it appropriately. The next section
of this essay focuses on what this line of thinking means for academic literacy
development in the disciplines, explaining programming choices that are prov-
ing particularly good for student learning.

          THE TEACHING OF ACADEMIC WRITING IN
  MAINSTREAM CURRICULA ACROSS THE DISCIPLINES

   Before zooming in on specific programs and practices developed with and
for a particular discipline, it might help to quickly see the range of choices avail-
able to students at UOW for learning "about" academic writing and developing
capacity to write academically: There are programs offered by a commercial
college on campus as preparation to studies at the university proper (see UOW
College website). There are some credit-bearing courses in academic writing
provided by the Arts faculty on campus, which can be taken as electives within
some degree programs (see ELL program webpage). And there are various op-
tions provided by a centrally-funded unit within the Academic Services Divi-
sion (ASD) without charge to students. The ASD exists to support teaching
academics and their students across the disciplines; the programs and services
offered by its Learning Development unit range from introductory level extra-
curricular workshops on specific aspects of common academic genres, to indi-
vidual consultations about any aspect of academic work (and it is usually their
writing that students want to talk about), to team-teaching arrangements in
the disciplines and very varied and extensive curriculum development projects.

   The more complex projects tend to be supported by additional funds allo-
cated by senior executive, or by federal government grants, for specific strategic
purposes, such as development of programs, scholarly discussion and publi-
cation of reports around first-year experience and transition, social inclusion,
appropriate support for indigenous students, career development/work inte-
grated learning, internationalization of curricula, and English language profi-
ciency (see UOW's Teaching and Learning strategic projects site and its Focus
on Learning website). It is through these sorts of collaborative teaching activi-

62
                                                                    University of Wollongong (Australia)

ties and curriculum development projects, focused as they are on the realities of
learning and teaching academic disciplines here and now, and drawing as they
do on very experienced informants that best practices in teaching academic
writing tend to emerge.

                 USEFUL COLLABORATIONS WITH
                COLLEAGUES IN THE DISCIPLINES

   Students also have various online options related to academic literacy, from
the fairly generic resources for students (see UniLearning), to a wide range of
subject-integrated blogs (on-campus access only) hosting scores of links to on-
line language development resources and providing ongoing feedback. While
there are and may always be situations where some form of add-on literacy devel-
opment program based on some notion of "skills" is appropriate, increasing are
the situations in higher education where it is recognized that a better approach
to academic literacy (and oracy) development is to treat students' mainstream
courses as opportunities for intelligent collaboration between those with exper-
tise in the discipline and those with serious knowledge and experience in the
design of language education that supports disciplinary learning. Much time
and effort of the central Learning Development unit at UOW is devoted to
engineering useful collaboration with colleagues in the disciplines, because while
very many teaching academics are highly attuned to and interested in removing
obstacles to student learning, they often find it difficult to make the changes
that make the difference for students' development of literacy and learning. It is
complex, and it is not possible to focus equally on research and teaching all of the
time. UOW requires academics to prioritise (within limits) on an annual basis
amongst the four elements of their core business (research, teaching, governance
and professional association and/or community engagement), and provides vari-
ous forms of academic support for the curriculum and teaching practice develop-
ment activities prioritized, including its Academic Services Division.

   Though not everyone is currently "singing from the same song sheet" on this
matter or any other, there is growing consensus here as in the UK (see Ryan,
2011 and the Higher Education Academy's Teaching International Students
project) that when the teaching of academic writing becomes a whole-of-insti-
tution approach, learning outcomes for students are bound to be better than
when "writing" is conceived, and its teaching programmed, around notions of
separable "skills" divorced from the dialogue, reading, thinking, and practice
(educational and professional) that constitute an academic discipline. When a
major issue with serious consequence for everyone is at stake, an inter-disciplin-

                                                                                                 63
Purser

ary approach is not only possible and probably more intelligent, it is a must.
Whether the social issue is climate change or the standards of literacy and oracy
across the disciplines through which we formally come to understand anything
in academia, the sum total of outcomes is greater when collaboration between
all stakeholders is well engineered and funded than when we develop and apply
our expertise in silos.

   As in any type of teamwork, the critical factor is professional management
and funding. What we increasingly find at UOW is that big improvements are
made for students when our activity around teaching academic communica-
tions is collaborative and focused on the design of mainstream assessment tasks,
resources, and pedagogy within and for the students' target discipline. When
two or a few informed and experienced heads work together, the development
work is easier, quicker, more interesting, and satisfying for all concerned, and
more fruitful, in terms of student learning outcomes. So this seems a model of
practice providing lasting and exponentially multiplying returns from the initial
investment.

           LANGUAGE-FOCUSED LEARNING DESIGN:
                    AN EXAMPLE FROM SCIENCE

   Post-graduate coursework and research programs currently attract the great-
est proportion of the international students at UOW, and so are a major focus
of attention for some of UOW's Learning Development academics. Detail is
given in other publications (e.g., Purser, 2011; Kupetz, in press), but one case
of a purpose-built subject for post-graduate international students will illustrate
points made throughout this chapter. In 2010, coinciding and aligned with the
English Language Proficiency project, a project was internally funded to help
document the development of learning designs for subjects delivered to inter-
national students. Based on principles developed in the AUTC learning designs
project (2003) that describe learning sequences in terms of tasks, resources, and
supports, the tasks in this case are engineered specifically to expand students'
linguistic repertoire. The questions being asked in designing learning for lan-
guage development in the disciplines are:

   1. What types of assignment and learning activities help students notice
       disciplinary language and develop the academic literacy and oracy ex-
       pected at UOW?

   2. What kinds of learning material most help students complete such tasks?
   3. What types of interaction best help students engage in learning, use re-

       sources effectively, and complete tasks successfully?

64
                                                                    University of Wollongong (Australia)

   The pedagogical plans and resources are adaptable to a range of similar edu-
cation scenarios at UOW or beyond. A subject developed for the beginning
of the Master of Science program illustrates how the teaching of the target
discipline is being approached from a language development perspective--an
approach now shaping the design of other subjects at UOW.

   Rather than the usual logic of course delivery, the approach being taken
here is to foreground the students' learning activity, and to indicate visually
throughout a website how the various informational resources are to be used
to complete tasks, and what support will be given by teachers and peers. What
is normally understood as course "content" is here presented as informational
resources, to be drawn on in the guided process of completing specific tasks.
Academic literacy, oracy and self-management are clearly fore-grounded as the
major learning outcomes of the subject, and not treated as either "generic" or
achievable outside the context of the teaching and learning of the target disci-
pline. The whole science subject is presented to students as sets of inter-related
processes of information searching, critical reading, text re-construction, and
critical reflection on academic language and learning across their curriculum.

   Each module within the eLearning site guides students through a sequence
of necessary steps, scaffolding their awareness and control over the language
involved and leading to greater communicative capacity and independence in
organizing and completing the sorts of tasks routinely required throughout stu-
dents' degree program.

   Within each of these stages, students experience extensive modeling and
guidance through annotated sample texts, process demonstration videos, in-
tegrated group discussion, regular feedback on drafts, and ongoing reflection
on emerging practice. Students speaking voices are recorded and posted for
group feedback and comparison against a model. A very wide range of lexico-
grammatical possibilities in paraphrasing and summarising are demonstrated,
discussed, and tested through the process of translating a published journal
article into a visually supported spoken presentation and a poster.

   In focusing on spoken presentation, students also develop understanding
of good collaborative practice, by selecting one of the journal articles sourced
for their literature review and, positioning themselves as a mock research team,
translating the dense written text into a succinct visually-supported talk, in
which each group member has equal time to speak.

   Throughout the subject, students are guided to carefully observe and reflect
on learning and academic language across the curriculum. The eLearning site
in subjects like these is fundamental rather than ancillary, as it visualizes the
design and guides the learning experience, freeing classroom time for intensive
interaction, dialogue, trial and error, feedback and peer support. This is vital in

                                                                                                 65

the context, as the building of strong social networks in the students' first two
months at UOW has proven a key element in how this type of subject makes
a difference to the subsequent learning experience of the students throughout
their chosen course of study (Purser, in Kupetz, in press). The designs emerging
are quite easily adaptable across different Learning Management Systems, social
networking technologies, and contexts.

                               CONCLUSION

   This profile essay has described a context wherein learning is usually as-
sessed through some form of prose writing, but where students may not "hit
the ground running" when they encounter the realities of academic writing
in the disciplines. It is an environment where a great deal of explicit teach-
ing of academic writing occurs, but rarely in so-labeled classes. UOW recog-
nizes the demands of academic literacy across the disciplines, and several staff
here have developed good reputation nationally and internationally for their
practice and leadership in teaching and research on academic literacy. But
with current anticipation of ever more students finding academic discourse
and practice per se quite new and strange, and a very significant proportion
of students finding the doing of academic work as English to be new and
challenging, it makes less and less sense to increasing numbers of teachers
across the disciplines to address the literacy development needs of students in
separate classes teaching so-called generic academic and language "skills." We
might eventually stop regarding students' writing as evidence of their deficien-
cies altogether, and come to really understand how the teaching of academic
disciplines can limit or liberate the linguistic repertoire of students entering
a course of study.

THE SCHREIBCENTER AT THE
ALPEN-ADRIA-UNIVERSITÄT,
KLAGENFURT, AUSTRIA

By Ursula Doleschal
Alpen-Adria Universität Klagenfurt (Austria)

The writing centre (henceforward: "SchreibCenter") at the Alpen-
Adria-Universität Klagenfurt was founded in 2004 and has since
developed successfully, although it has been allotted only minimal fi-
nancial means by the university. The history of the SchreibCenter is an
example of how it is possible, in spite of minimal funding, to create
an infrastructure and get appropriately entrenched in and acknowl-
edged by the university. As will be shown, important steps to this goal
are to find supporters and partners within faculty, acquire funds for
teaching/courses, acquire funding for small projects, and find external
partners and sponsors.

                            SIZE AND MISSION

   The SchreibCenter at the University of Klagenfurt was founded in order to
enhance the quality of written texts in the university. Its most prominent target
group is of course students, but the mission statement in the statutes of the
university (http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/rechtabt/downloads/Satzung_Teil_A.pdf,
January 6, 2010) explicitly formulates that it is the aim of the SchreibCenter to
"develop a high-quality writing standard in the university, in the first place with
the students, but also with all other members of the university."1

   The range of offers is thus directed at the different groups of university
members and includes courses, tutoring and counseling for students as well as
workshops for teachers and administrative personnel, and counseling for re-
searchers, plus other pertinent measures that might enhance the quality of writ-
ing within but also beyond the university. The SchreibCenter is a rather small
institution. The staff consists of one regular employee--the operative director
(Carmen Mertlitsch) --along with the scientific director (Ursula Doleschal),

who is at the same time full professor of Slavic linguistics. Teaching and tutor-
ing is provided by 13 lecturers and nine tutors on the basis of contracts. These
personnel are paid by the university, which makes available a moderate budget
for daily business and other technical equipment. The university has also put
one office room and one lecture room at the disposal of the SchreibCenter. For
other financial needs, the SchreibCenter relies on external funding/fundraising.

   Nevertheless, the SchreibCenter offers full-fledged courses, workshops, and
individual counseling as well as tutorials accompanying courses in different
disciplines.

   Last year, for example, the SchreibCenter offered 20 courses,2 which were
attended by 230 students, three workshops for university staff, and about 100
hours of individual counseling and tutoring.

                    LOCATION AND AFFILIATION

   Klagenfurt is the capital of the Austrian province of Carinthia (border-
ing both Slovenia and Italy) and is located in a bilingual area of a German-
speaking majority (517,000 people) and a Slovene-speaking autochthonous
minority (14,000). The city has 90,000 inhabitants. Economically, Carinthia
depends very much on tourism, but there is also some industry (microtechnol-
ogy, wood-processing, food) and agriculture. Culturally speaking, Carinthia is a
traditionalist country with a remarkable number of folk musicians and choirs.
As to education and literacy, they do not seem to be highly valued among the
population, let alone among local politicians. In spite of the fact that Klagenfurt
is the native town of Robert Musil and Ingeborg Bachmann, two of the most
distinguished German-speaking writers of the twentieth century, and although
every year a literary contest for the Ingeborg Bachmann prize is carried out, the
city of Klagenfurt has no common public library (beside the Slovene library of
studies, which offers literature in Slovene). Many students at the University of
Klagenfurt come from families without higher education.

   The University of Klagenfurt is a state university and a relatively young uni-
versity; it was founded in 1970 and in the beginning offered only humanities
and pedagogical studies. In 1990, a faculty of economics and IT was added, and
lately, IT was enhanced by microtechnologies such as mechatronics, and a tech-
nical faculty was founded. In this way, undergraduate (bachelor) students can
enroll either for humanistic studies, such as philosophy, philology, history, and
applied cultural studies, or for more socially oriented studies: media communi-
cation, pedagogy, psychology; and for geography, mathematics, economics, and
business studies, as well as information technology studies and microtechnolo-

gies. Besides, all these studies can also be enrolled in as graduate (master) and
PhD programs.

   The working language of the university is generally German. One master
program is taught completely in English (information technology), and English
is also an important working language for some other fields of studies, such as
psychology, and especially for PhD studies. Currently about 10,000 students
are enrolled in the Alpen-Adria-Universität (about 87% of whom are Austrian).
Although Slovene is also an official language in parts of Carinthia, this is not
reflected in language use at the university.

        "LITERACY" AND "WRITING": WHY STUDENTS
        WRITE, IN WHAT LANGUAGES AND DIALECTS,

                  IN RELATION TO WHAT GOALS?

   During their studies, students have to write a number of course assignments
and theses, usually in German, sometimes also in English; in the philologies
they may also write their theses in the language they are studying. The exact
number of written assignments differs significantly in terms of the respective
field of studies; e.g., the undergraduate study of business administration cur-
rently has the least number (one thesis in the beginning and one--the bachelor
thesis--at the end of the program of studies), whereas philological studies, such
as Slavic studies, include at least six theses, including two bachelor theses. The-
ses are a compulsory part of Austrian academic education and aim at making
students acquainted with doing research. As Otto Kruse (2009) contends, this
tradition goes back to the Humboldtian reform of the university and the ideal
of the unity of teachers and students, who in the nineteenth century worked
together in the form of seminars. The course type of seminar is still seminal in
German-speaking academia, although very often it is not a place of research
any more, and neither are seminar theses. As a genre, seminar theses are usu-
ally modeled on the example of research articles. In some fields students also
have to write reports (e.g., after an internship); students of pedagogy moreover
have to master the genre of reflection ("Reflexionsarbeit"). At the Alpen-Adria-
Universität, bachelor theses are usually understood as a form of seminar thesis,
whereas master theses are considerably larger and tend to be seen as an autono-
mous contribution to research.

   In contradistinction to the Anglo-Saxon practice and also to what pupils
usually learn at school, essay writing is not common in German-speaking uni-
versities and not in Klagenfurt either (Stadter, 2003); neither is creative writing,
though very recently there have been attempts in the realm of Germanistics

                                                                                                 71

and Media studies in Klagenfurt; these courses, however, are not part of the
compulsory syllabus.

   In these ways, students usually write in order to get credit for a course or
toward receiving the final degree. It seems that many professors share this view
and understand written assignments as a form of examination and not as an
instrument of learning or research. In the teutonic tradition, writing is some-
thing one learns once and forever at school (cf. Cmejrková & Danes, 1996).
Therefore, professors expect their students to be able to write academic texts
in a correct and adequate language. Students, on the other hand, come from a
schooling system where style is seen as an individual, creative, and even artistic
form of written expression (in the tradition of Leo Spitzer, cf. Fix, Poethe, &
Yos, 2003, pp. 26-32) and where objective exposition has not been taught suf-
ficiently,3 perhaps with the exception of the text type "account." In university,
they are faced with totally new genres, the sense of which is unclear to them,
and so they often feel lost. When they try to transfer what they have learned in
school, especially what they conceive of as "good style," the results do not usu-
ally meet the standards of academic texts. Professors are not a great help either;
they often lack the instruments for adequate feedback on questions of text and
style and therefore in the end resignedly accept what students deliver (cf. the
interviews in Gruber et al., 2006).

                                 THE LOBBY

   Under such general conditions, the dean of the faculty of economics and
informatics, Paul Kellermann, launched the idea of founding a writing centre in
spring 2003, and so assistant professor Helmut Guggenberger from the depart-
ment of sociology mustered a work group of about 10 volunteers--professors
from different fields of study who were concerned and interested in students'
writing, plus one graduate student--who discussed necessary measures and
worked out a conceptual design and a schedule which were presented to the
founding convent4 in autumn. At that time a profound structural reform of
the universities was being carried out in Austria, which proved a felicitous op-
portunity for the founding of new units. After a short period of lobbying by all
members of the work group, the founding convent accepted the writing centre
and included it in the new statutes, which were enacted on January 1, 2004. As
a scholar of linguistics, I volunteered to be the scientific director of the writing
centre, and this idea was accepted by the rector in February 2004, who in a
conference with the work group commissioned us to start operating by the be-
ginning of the autumn term, i.e., in October 2004, allotting the SchreibCenter

a budget of  15,000 for the academic year 2004/2005. It was also decreed that
the writing centre should function as a pilot project for two years, after which
an evaluation would take place.

   Taking into account financial and human resources, the first step, in order
to get started that autumn, was to begin with a course program and to de-
velop other services, especially individual counselling. This approach was also a
natural consequence of the fact that there were some people who were able and
willing to teach writing courses at once. Most of them, especially Maria Nico-
lini, who for years was the only person in the university who regularly offered
seminars on academic writing, relied on experience in this field.5

   They argued for the pedagogical value of discussing the problems and facets
of writing in groups. This teaching concept was built mainly on the findings
of applied linguistics, taking into account on the one hand the academic profi-
ciency of students, on the other disciplinary groupings. This approach draws on
the writings of Ken Hyland (2004) and on projects in writing proficiency (espe-
cially the one carried out in Vienna under the guidance of Helmut Gruber, cf.
Gruber et al., 2006, but also Pohl, 2007). Furthermore the findings of contras-
tive rhetoric (Clyne, 1987; Cmejrková & Danes, 1997; Duszak, 1994, etc.) led
to the designing of special courses both in English and in German for students
with another native language. Last but not least, the differences among aca-
demic, journalistic, literary, and administrative styles, as studied by functional
stylistics in the East European tradition (Fleischer &Michel, 1979; Mistrík,
1985; Riesel, 1959; Tosovi, 1988) led to a differentiation between courses for
academic writing and creative and/or journalistic writing. In the end, the pos-
sibilities and competencies of the people available on the spot were also taken
into account. Therefore, the concept resulted in a pluralistic approach to indi-
vidual teaching methods, which the newly constituted work group fervently
discussed in many sessions and workshops.

   These core concepts have been developed since and have resulted in varia-
tions as part of a three-layered program for beginners, intermediate students,
and (postgraduate) students who are writing a qualification assignment (master
or PhD thesis). This program is further differentiated into fields of studies, aim-
ing at disciplinary groupings including business studies, philologies and history,
technical studies, etc. But there are also courses for all students, regardless of
their field of study, for academic, creative, and professional writing. Recently,
a special form of peer tutoring was added, the "open writing lab" (Offene Sch-
reibwerkstatt, cf. Halfmann, Perschak, & Doleschal, 2009), a course or forum
where students from all disciplines and grades can discuss their problems and
receive input and support from peer tutors. This innovation was designed by
Carmen Mertlitsch drawing on Roth (1999).

                                                                                                 73

   The idea to work with student peer tutors goes back to a workshop with
Gerd Bräuer in 2004, but only in 2006 were we able to start with a pilot project,
and in 2007 with a first version of a training program (see Mertlitsch & Do-
leschal in press). Theoretically the work of the SchreibCenter continues to be
based on applied linguistics. Therefore, the peer tutors, who come from differ-
ent fields, are trained for identifying categories of language, such as text struc-
ture or elements of grammar and style, and design their feedback in accordance.
Peer tutors are deployed for the open writing lab, tutorials, workshops, and
individual counselling for students. The tutor is paid individually (currently 
15 per hour). At present we are educating a group of peer tutors to give support
in English in collaboration with the English department.

   Collaboration and networking have turned out to be the SchreibCenter's
main key to success. In the pilot phase of the SchreibCenter (until 2007), when
there was no regular staff, Carmen Mertlitsch and Jürgen Struger, who had grad-
uated in linguistics and German from the University of Klagenfurt and ran a bu-
reau for counselling and correcting academic texts,6 worked for the SchreibCen-
ter on a contract basis. They initiated a survey of demand regarding writing skills
of students, during which the three of us sought conversations with faculty who
were responsible for course programs. We learned about the concerns of profes-
sors and were at the same time able to make the new institution of a writing
centre known among faculty and to propagate the idea of supporting students'
writing skills. Reactions were very different, but some people were immediately
in favour of the initiative and keen on getting support in their own fields. As a
consequence we organized a workshop for a research group of PhD students and
assistants and a tandem course with a seminar in psychology, both in English.
In 2006, we succeeded in implementing tutorials with peer tutors for seminars,
first in informatics, later in psychology. Furthermore, consultations were given
to professors on how to care for students' writing skills, drawing on the model of
dissemination proposed by Gerd Bräuer (cf. Bräuer, 2007).

   It certainly helped that I was a member of the university senate and thus
had the opportunity for informal talks with full professors and the rector. Both
Carmen Mertlitsch and Jürgen Struger, on the other hand, were active among
peers, trying out all forms of collaboration, such as projects for other depart-
ments (e.g., a practical guide for teachers, Mertlitsch, 2010), workshops for
staff, individual counseling for staff, workshops for external partners, etc. These
projects were at the time a vital source of funding, because until 2007 the Sch-
reibCenter had to finance its workforce with the help of fundraising. At the
same time, all these collaborations became the basis for external relationships,
e.g., with the academies of health care, a post-secondary school, where 10-14
workshops for students have been carried out each year up to now, and which

are financed by the governmental office of the province. Equally important,
such projects were a challenge that called for and stimulated professional devel-
opment in all members of the SchreibCenter.

           SUCCESS AND UNFULFILLED AMBITIONS

   The most sustainable success of the Klagenfurt SchreibCenter is probably
that it initiated a process of consciousness among faculty and students. Espe-
cially younger professors actively take up advice and design their own courses in
a way that includes writing assignments and feedback to the students. Others
invite us to give input on academic writing in their seminars. As to students,
they show a constantly growing interest in the courses and consultations of the
SchreibCenter, especially in the open writing lab.

   The second main success, to my mind, is that the SchreibCenter as a perma-
nent and autonomous institution of the university is now beyond question. This
was not always the case, since the idea that writing as a key competence should
be learned before coming to university is still very much alive among professors.

   Thirdly, it is a great success for me personally that Jürgen Struger got a regu-
lar job as assistant in the AEEC Deutsch ("Österreichisches Kompetenzzen-
trum für Deutschdidaktik") in 2006 and Carmen Mertlitsch was regularly em-
ployed at the SchreibCenter in 2007. Similarly, I consider it a great success that
we can train students as peer tutors and advisors, and in this way give them the
opportunity to do a job that is in demand--and earn money with linguistics.

   Of course, there are also unfulfilled ambitions as to writing skills of students.
Usually, students who have attended any activity of the SchreibCenter feel em-
powered and confident in their newly acquired skills. This is not congruent
with my own rating of their competence; e.g., two of my own students went to
workshops and tutorials and were convinced that they had learned a lot. The
master theses they handed in, however, did not reflect this self-assessment; they
were still rather badly written. On the other hand, I have to admit that they
were able to revise their papers on the basis of my comments and then signed in
very good theses. Reactions by faculty show that all people who attend courses
of the SchreibCenter benefit from their learning of the revision process.

Ziel des SchreibCenters der Universität Klagenfurt ist die Entwicklung eines quali-

aber auch bei allen anderen Universitätsangehörigen. Dies wird durch ein entsprech-
endes Kursangebot, durch Beratung sowie durch interdisziplinäre Zusammenarbeit
gewährleistet. " (http://www.uni-klu.ac.at/rechtabt/downloads/Satzung_Teil_A.pdf,
January 6, 2010).

2. Courses were financed by other departments, but organized and supervised by the
SchreibCenter.

3. Although the syllabus for German in grammar schools gives equal significance to
both subjective and objective text types (cf. Lehrpläne der AHS-Oberstufe http://www.

bmukk.gv.at/medienpool/11853/lp_neu_ahs_01.pdf ), it seems that both teachers and
pupils are on the whole more inclined to the genre of interpretation of literary texts
(Saxalber Tetter, 2008).

THE ACADEMIC WRITING

RESEARCH GROUP AT THE

UNIVERSITY OF VIENNA

By Helmut Gruber
University of Vienna (Austria)

In this paper, I describe 10 years of research on students' academic
writing conducted at the University of Vienna. Furthermore, I de-
scribe the (small) success my team had in implementing the results of
this research as a university-wide writing support program for doctoral
students. Since 1999, I have carried out three successive research proj-
ects on students' academic writing. In the first two projects, textual
characteristics of seminar papers, students' and instructors' views of
students' writing, and student-instructor interaction in selected courses
were investigated following the academic literacies approach. In the
third project, the results of this previous research provided the basis for
developing an academic writing course for students in a blended learn-
ing environment. We also developed a detailed concept for establishing
a writing center at Vienna University that could not be realized in
the intended form, but that at least resulted in establishing a series of
university-wide writing courses for doctoral students.

   I started my academic career in 1986 as an assistant professor ("Assistent") at
the Applied Linguistics section of the Department of Linguistics at Vienna Uni-
versity. The first course I taught there was an "Introduction to text linguistics."
Although I have never viewed text linguistics and discourse analysis as "applied"
subfields of linguistics, students seemed to expect me to have an applied angle
towards my teaching (and research) subjects, simply because I was part of the
"Applied Linguistics" team at the department. So it was no surprise that every
now and then students who had difficulties in writing their seminar papers1
approached me in order to help them. And time after time, I also heard com-
plaints from students who told me that "you are the specialist on text linguistics
here at the department but you never teach us anything which we could use to
improve our own writing." At first, I was a bit baffled about these complaints

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2012.0346.2.07                           79

because my course had never been intended to teach students anything else
than the basic concepts and theories of text and discourse analysis, but also be-
cause for me writing in academia had never posed a problem. Whenever I had
had to master a new genre during my time as a student at university, I simply
looked for texts which seemed (to me) to be good examples of the respective
genre and then tried to bring together the demands of my actual writing task
with the features of these texts--somehow I produced a text. From the feedback
(or in most cases from the lack of feedback) and from the grades I received, I
learned that I must have succeeded somehow in acquiring the relevant genres.
But my students' complaints made me think about the way students learn to
write academic texts in more general ways; they made me curious to know more
about students' academic writing in the Austrian university system.

   Up to the late nineties, the Austrian university system had much in common
with the description of the German university system that Foster (2002) pro-
vides in regard to students' writing. The course system consisted of two major
groups of courses: "lecture" courses in which an academic teacher presented
the course content to their student- audience and in which students received
their grades either through an oral or through a written exam; and (roughly
speaking) "non-lecture" courses in which a lecturer could demand students to
engage in several kinds of activities during and after the course which all could
be made relevant for receiving a grade. In many of these latter courses, students
had to write some kind of text (literature reviews, field or lab reports, shorter
or longer seminar papers, etc.), which were in principle due at the end of the
semester in which the course took place. However, a general regulation in the
Austrian university law stipulated that written papers which served as a course
requirement could be handed in up to four semesters after the end of a course;
i.e., in principle students had two years for finishing their papers. Of course,
some departments found ways to bypass this regulation by creating strict entry
conditions for courses in subsequent semesters, which demanded students to
provide evidence of positive grades from courses in the previous semester, etc.
But in principle (if they could afford it in whatever respect) Austrian students
had much time for fulfilling their writing tasks--time which they could use
to experiment with new academic genres, revise their texts, seek model texts,
or seek advice from peers and lecturers--or decide not to write the demanded
paper when they found an equivalent course in which they could fulfill course
requirements in an easier way. Thus, for dedicated students the Austrian system
offered the opportunity to acquire new genres in a self-guided way, but for the
other students it did not offer any support (except style-sheets which are pro-
vided by many departments and/or lecturers and which detail formal require-
ments like line spacing, margin widths, bibliographical styles, etc.2).

   My own advice to students who had asked me for help with their papers
up to this time had been based on the implicit and explicit knowledge I had of
certain academic genres rather than on any systematic investigation of students'
writing skills and/ or shortcomings. So in the summer semester 1999, I carried
out an exploratory project in cooperation with the department of personnel
management at the University of Economics and Business Administration in
Vienna, in order to deepen my own understanding of students' writing. The
cooperation with this department was partly triggered by methodological con-
siderations, but also by opportunistic ones. From a methodological point of
view, I did not want to investigate students' writing at my own department
in order to avoid my potentially biased view of students' texts influencing the
results of my study. Therefore, investigating students' texts from a different dis-
cipline with a social science background (which made them comparable to at
least a big fraction of Linguistics students' texts) seemed to provide an unbiased
way of investigating students' writing. The opportunistic aspect of this coopera-
tion consisted in the fact that at this time my colleague Ursula Doleschal, who
also has a strong interest in students' academic writing, held a position at the
Business University and established a connection to the department of person-
nel management. This first exploratory project, in which 18 students' seminar
papers from one seminar (i.e., a course for advanced students who would start
working on their MA-theses after finishing this course) were investigated, estab-
lished some themes which are still present in my theoretical and practical work
concerning students' writing:

   · The research followed a multi-methods approach: apart from the stu-
       dents' papers, instructor-student interaction in the seminar was inves-
       tigated through participant observation by two student-research assis-
       tants, and interviews were conducted with all students in the seminar
       and the instructor in order to obtain students' and instructor's subjective
       views on the respective seminar, and on students' writing at the univer-
       sity in general. This approach made it possible to triangulate the results
       of the linguistic text analysis with results from participant observation
       and interview data. This methodology reflects the basic assumptions of
       the academic literacies approach (Jones, Turner, & Street, 1999; Lea &
       Street, 1998), which views students' writing as a complex social practice
       at the intersection of institutional demands, disciplinary constraints, and
       individual pre-dispositions.

   · Textual analysis (and--later on--didactic implementation of the results
       of text analyses) was inspired by Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL;
       Halliday, 1994), and especially by the register and genre approach (Egg-
       ins & Martin, 1997). SFL is a metafunctional approach to language that

                                                                                                 81
Gruber

       assumes that each utterance conveys meaning on the ideational (=con-
       tent), the interpersonal, and the textual level. The register and genre
       approach assumes a strong bi-directional relation between contextual
       variables and textual (generic) features. Genres are viewed as staged, go-
       al-oriented, purposeful activities in which speakers engage as members of
       a culture (Eggins & Martin, 1997) and which are teachable to novices.3
       As no comprehensiv SFL model of German yet exists, the categories of
       analysis were partly taken from other functional approaches to langua-
       ge (e.g., functional pragmatics and rhetorical structure theory; Ehlich,
       1985; Mann & Thompson, 1987).
   · From the very beginning of my interest in students' writing, I dealt
       with the topic under an applied perspective. Thus, I have been interes-
       ted in finding out strengths and weakenesses of students' texts and ways
       of improving students' writing in the institutional context of Austrian
       universities. And from the beginning I tried to investigate both aspects
       under two perspectives: first, by establishing linguistic evaluation criteria
       from the literature on academic writing. This first perspective provides
       an inventory of linguistic features of "adequate" or "well written" aca-
       demic texts that were established in previous investigations of students'
       academic writing. But as the academic literacies approach cautions us
       not to generalize results from one context to another, and as most in-
       vestigations of students' academic writing have been carried out in an
       anglophone context, the results of these studies cannot simply be trans-
       posed to the Austrian context. Thus, to avoid premature generalisations,
       a second perspective is necessary: in the interviews with instructors (and,
       if possible, in their written notes), their assessment criteria for students'
       texts were collected and "translated" into linguistic terms as far as possi-
       ble. Additionally, each paper's grade was set into a relation to its textual
       properties and thus, a set of instructors' implicit evaluation criteria was
       established.
   Because of the lack of personal and financial resources, the 18 students'
papers, the interview data, and the protocols of the participant observation that
were obtained in this first project, were analyzed qualitatively. Results showed
that the departments' writing demands for students' seminar papers were com-
municated rather explicitly, albeit in a very short form and without offering
students any support for their writing process. Results also showed that in this
special seminar, a number of institutional difficulties and hurdles for students'
working and writing processes had occurred, which partly were due to singular
problems of this single seminar but partly were also characteristic of the insti-
tution as a whole. Both kinds of problems, of course, had a negative impact

82
                                                                            University of Vienna (Austria)

on students' motivation. The interview data also showed a mismatch between
the motivations the instructors attributed to students for deciding to attend
the seminar and students' actual motivations: whereas instructors thought
that most students would attend the seminars at their department because of
the high quality of teaching and students' support, all but one student simply
choose the course because it fit well into their timetable. Accordingly, students
did not invest too much time and effort into writing their papers, which in-
structors in turn interpreted as low achievement of (in their view) highly moti-
vated students (Gruber, Wetschanow, & Herzberger, 1999).

   Results of the textual analyses showed that, in their texts, most students
tried to comply with the instructor's (and department's) most emphasized writ-
ing demand, namely to produce an explicit "problem formulation." Many stu-
dents, however, did this in a rather superficial and formal manner and therefore
all but one student produced texts which realized a descriptive, non-empirical
genre which in a later publication was called "taxonomic report" (Gruber, et al.,
2006). In this genre, students describe and/or elaborate some basic concepts
which together constitute the topic of their papers (e.g., "Implementation and
personnel management"). On the macro-structural level, two varieties of this
genre occurred: (1) papers that employ a limited number of semantic relations
("is a," "has a") between headings (=main section) and sub-headings (=sub-
sections), which results in clear and easily comprehensible overall content struc-
tures. In these papers, the content of the sub-sections elaborates the content of
the main sections. (2) Papers that mainly employ an additive relation between
successive sections, be it main- or sub-sections. These papers meander from one
topic to the next without developing a clear overall content structure. As was
to be expected, papers of the first group earned better grades than papers of the
second group.

   The descriptive genre of the majority of the papers resonates also on the
micro-textual level: the major text organizing principle on the paragraph- and
clause-level was called the "list-style" (Gruber, Wetschanow & Herzberger,
1999: 38ff.). In this kind of text organization, the elements of a list may come
from different textual levels, i.e., word, clause, or paragraph, which results in
word-, clause- or paragraph-lists respectively. Wordlists were the most frequent
variant of this style. They resemble outlines, and in fact they were frequently
used to summarize and represent the primary and secondary sources the stu-
dents read. In many cases the terms in the list were hyponyms of those terms
that functioned as "list headings." Word lists resemble also the descriptive tables
of contents found on the macro-level of texts. Thus, similar textual devices
occurred on the macro- and on the micro-level of the texts. The difference
between the two devices is, however, that the table of contents is elaborated in

                                                                                                 83
Gruber

the text, whereas the word-list is the text. In most cases word lists have nega-
tive consequences for the thematic progression of the texts. Especially if several
word lists occur in a series, no systematic flow of information (thematic pro-
gression) can be developed. The resulting texts resemble an elaborate excerpt or
outline, but not a proper text. Clause- and paragraph-lists resemble word lists.
They are, however, constituted by clauses and paragraphs respectively, and thus
allow for more elaborate thematic structures. The use of paragraph lists especial-
ly can result in an ordered and clearly arranged thematic structure, if they are
introduced by topic sentences and closed by resuming sentences or paragraphs.
All in all, the prevalent use of the list style and the lack of argumentation on the
macro-structural level in most papers seem to indicate that most students fol-
lowed a "knowledge-telling-strategy" rather than a "knowledge-transforming-
strategy" (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 1987). Students' use of the list style (and
all other micro-textual features), however, did not seem to have much impact
on the grades the papers received (except in those cases where texts consisted
mainly of word lists, which made the impression that the respective seminar
paper was a compilation of bullet-point lists).

   The results of this exploratory project were used to formulate a couple of
more focused research questions on students' academic writing in the context
of Austrian universities, and a bigger project was conducted (funded by the
Austrian science foundation; FWF project P14720-G03). In this study (Gru-
ber et al., 2006), students' writing practices in three social science disciplines
(social history, business studies, business psychology) were investigated. The
rationale behind this choice was that these three disciplines share a social sci-
ence background and a common research area, namely economy and business,
but they have different theoretical angles towards their research topics. It was
therefore expected that the students' texts would exhibit parallels as well as dis-
cipline-specific differences. Following the multi-disciplinary approach already
employed in the exploratory project, the study combined textual analyses with
interview analyses and participant observation of three courses. The theoretical
framework transcended the register and genre approach and combined Bour-
dieu's concepts of habitus and field (Bourdieu, 1992) with the academic litera-
cies approach (Jones, et al., 1999). Following these theoretical considerations,
a text production model was developed that differentiates between "text types"
(abstract units on a rather general level), which are mainly influenced by the
general social and institutional purposes they serve, and "genres," which are
conceived as (semiotically enriched) realisations of text types in concrete in-
stitutional and social contexts. Text types and genres are related to the field
specific habitus of persons insofar as the knowledge of the appropriateness of
certain text types and genres for certain kinds of tasks in a field are relevant sym-

bolic capitals. One general goal of the project was to investigate if students have
already developed a discipline-specific habitus and hence if they produce texts
which realise discipline-specific genres. A further major goal was to investigate
if and which linguistic features of a seminar paper correlate with the grade it
receives.

   Quantitative and qualitative text analyses of all linguistic characteristics (ge-
neric and rhetorical structures, meta-communication, intertextuality, argumen-
tation, modality, lexis) that were analysed showed that students in the three
seminars produced different genres, which, however, belonged to one abstract
text type which was coined "academic qualification text." This text type is lo-
cated at the intersection of two social fields, namely the field of academia and
the field of the university, respectively (Bourdieu, 1992). The results of the in-
terview analyses showed that students are aware of the double institutional pur-
pose of the text type in differing, yet systematically varying ways. Whereas social
history students mainly oriented towards the academic purpose of a seminar pa-
per and thus display the habitus of "apprentice scholars," management students
and most of the business psychology students orient towards the assessment
character of the texts they produce and thus display a "student habitus." The
relationship between linguistic features of the texts and the grades the papers
received was similar to results from the exploratory study. Most linguistic fea-
tures of the micro-textual level did not show any correlation with the grades the
papers received. Many features of the meso- and macro- textual level, however,
did show rather systematic correlations with grades.

                 AN ACADEMIC WRITING COURSE
              DEVELOPED OUT OF THIS RESEARCH

   In a follow-up project (FWF project L 179-G03), an academic writing
course for (advanced) students, which was based on the results of the previous
project, was developed in a blended learning framework (Apel & Kraft, 2003).
The course design comprised the development of: (a) a web-based entrance
module which consists of a self assessment for students' writing skills, and an in-
vestigation of the extent of their demand of assistance; (b) a general (discipline-
independent) module containing information on academic writing; (c) two
discipline-specific modules offering information on and training in academic
writing (developed for Linguistics and Social and Economic History students).

   The entrance module consists of a series of questions and tasks students
have to complete and is designed to detect the individual students' level of
previous writing experience and knowledge. This module was implemented

                                                                                                 85

on the e-learning platform of Vienna University. The results of the entrance
module were used to decide whether individual students were advised to work
through one (or several) chapters of the general module before attending the
writing course, or if they could attend the writing course without additional
pre-course instruction. For the purpose of developing didactic applications
of the linguistic results of the previous projects, the linguistic concepts and
categories were "translated" into "everyday concepts" of scholarly work with
which students were expected to be familiar. The linguistic categories were
mapped onto didactic domains as shown in Table 1.

                              life and scientific language

The general module covers seven broad areas relevant for a functional under-
standing of the specifics of academic language and academic genres in the hu-
manities and social sciences: "What is science?", "Scholarly work," "Academic
language," "Differences between everyday language and academic language,"
"Structuring a paper," "Perspective," "Describing, Explaining, and Argumenta-
tion." The module was designed as a hypertext and is available online at http://
www.univie.ac.at/linguistics/schreibprojekt/Grundlagen .

   The two discipline specific courses elaborate the language-related aspects
of the general module and comprise the following broad areas: "Structuring
a paper," "Perspective," "Explanation and argumentation," and "The themat-
ic thread." Their development followed a blended learning approach, which
integrates face-to-face and online learning phases, and draws on theories of
computer-mediated communication, cognitive psychology and education. The

following aspects were considered when developing course contents, exercises,
and teaching materials:

   · Mode of communication: face-to-face vs. online
   · Pedagogical practice: instructing (lecture) vs. detecting (group work)
   · Types of knowledge: conceptual vs. procedural vs. meta (linguistic)
   · Types of exercises: detecting, classifying, correlating, sequencing, ab-

       stracting, modifying, focused variation, and composing
   These four dimensions constitute a matrix in which all intended course con-
tent can be located, and which allows the appropriate type of content presenta-
tion to be chosen. Thus, the course design as a whole is based on a theoreti-
cally reflected, interdisciplinary combination of relevant areas of scholarship.
In order to keep dependence on the e-learning platform to a minimum, course
materials were mainly developed as written manuals and as MS-PowerPoint
presentations The learning platform was only used for communication with and
between students and for exercises.
   The first instalment of the writing course was taught by two research as-
sistants during the summer semester of 2008 at Vienna University. The whole
course was evaluated by course participants via online feedback, questionnaires,
and oral feedback at the end of the semester. Results of this feedback were used
to redesign the entrance module and to implement slight changes in both the
general and the two discipline specific modules.

 CONSEQUENCES OF THE ACADEMIC WRITING COURSE

   This project had consequences that go beyond the realm of academic
research:

   The teaching materials which were developed for modules one and two were
used to produce an academic writing guide for German-speaking students of
the Humanities and Social Sciences (Gruber, Huemer, & Rheindorf, 2009),
which is intended to go further than many "how-to-do" writing books on the
market currently. It provides readers with a short account of Merton's concep-
tion of science as a social system and then tries to derive various characteristics
of academic communication and academic style from this (admittedly ideal-
ized) conception.

   Both research assistants developed a competence as academic writing trainers
and received numerous requests for writing courses that were eventually offered
at the following institutions: Department of Linguistics (Vienna University),
Department of Social and Economic History (Vienna University), Department
of Human Resource Development of Vienna University, Competence Centre

                                                                                                 87
Gruber

for the automobile industry (Villach), faculty of interdisciplinary research and
advanced training (Klagenfurt University), writing centre of Klagenfurt Uni-
versity, and Department of Information Technology (Klagenfurt University).

   Furthermore, in summer of 2008, the research team developed a detailed
concept for a writing centre at Vienna University that was sent to all relevant
administrative authorities of the university. Because the team anticipated that
the university administration would not be able to cover all projected costs, they
also contacted one of Austria's major banks and explored the possibility of exter-
nal sponsorship there. As a matter of fact, the bank's public relation department
showed an interest in financially supporting a writing centre, provided the uni-
versity administration would also contribute their share. When the university
officials met, the general feedback was positive, but the realisation of a writing
centre was made dependent on the amount of funding the bank would provide.
In the meantime, late September 2008 brought the international financial crisis
to Austrian banks, and the bank withdrew their (oral) commitment to support
a writing centre. As a consequence, the university administration no longer saw
the whole project of a writing centre as realistic due to the general budgetary
situation of the university.z

          IMPACT OF THE "BOLOGNA PROCESS" ON
                PLANS FOR THE WRITING CENTRE

   However, since 2005, Vienna University has gradually implemented the new
MA-BA-PhD study programs in the course of the so-called "Bologna process."
This means that the traditional tri-partite academic degree structure ("Magiste-
rium" -- "Doktorat" -- "Habilitation") with its rather relaxed time constraints
for students (cf. above) has been replaced by a rather tightly pre-scheduled course
system. But whereas in the Anglophone university system (from which this study
architecture has been transferred) students often receive institutionalised writing
support, this institutional framework is missing at Vienna University. Administra-
tion officials are aware of this problem, but--as mentioned above--the budget
for a university-wide writing centre is not available. As a consequence, a first small
version of institutionalised writing support was implemented in the new PhD
program of Vienna University, which started in fall 2009. In this university-wide
program, the two former research assistants teach several courses on various as-
pects of academic genres (writing a proposal, writing an abstract, etc.).

   Apart from this small institutional success, the research team initiated an
interdisciplinary working group at Vienna University, which comprises par-
ticipants from the faculties of history, philology, education, and the centre for

88
                                                                            University of Vienna (Austria)

translation studies interested in different aspects of students' academic writing.
The working group set up an internet forum (http://homepage.univie.ac.at/
markus.rheindorf/php/) in which teaching materials can be shared and which
is intended to improve communication among interested faculty members of
Vienna University. Furthermore, the group will organise regular meetings in
which single members report on their current work.

                               CONCLUSION

   Looking back on almost 10 years of research on students' academic writing
and on the activities that have been intended to establish some practical conse-
quences of this work, I cannot avoid having mixed feelings: On the one hand,
the research group created some academic output in a research field that virtu-
ally did not exist in Austria before, and that group is now well integrated with-
in the international research landscape (e.g., as part of COST action IS0703,
http://www.cost-lwe.eu, which deals with improving writing on various levels
in the European context). Furthermore, three former research assistants (Birgit
Huemer, Markus Rheindorf, and Karin Wetschanow) teach academic writing
courses in several institutions because they have been part of the academic writ-
ing research group. On the other hand, the degree of institutionalization of stu-
dents' writing support at Vienna University is still low. Apart from the above-
mentioned courses in the new PhD program, which is still in its early phases
and some courses in MA study programs (linguistics, social and economic his-
tory), no institutional basis for students' writing support has been established
so far. This might partly be due to the fact that Vienna University is by far the
largest university in Austria, and with its 74,000 enrolled students resembles a
supertanker which needs a very long time until it changes course.

                                    NOTES

1. For the history and status of the seminar paper in the German university system see
Kruse (2006) and also Foster (2002). Their accounts of the German university system
hold--mutatis mutandis--also true for the Austrian university system.

2. This system has changed dramatically during the last years as Austrian universities
had to introduce the BA-MA-PhD system in the course of the implementation of the
so called "Bologna-study-architecture," an EU program which intends to harmonize
the tertiary education systems of the EU member states. I will shortly discuss the con-
sequences of this new framework at the end of the article.

3. This latter view marks a sharp distinction between the SFL-view of genre pedagogy
and the proponents of the "New Rhetoric" movement who are very pessimistic about
the explicit teachability of genres.

FROM REMEDIATION TO

THE DEVELOPMENT OF

WRITING COMPETENCES IN

DISCIPLINARY CONTEXTS:

THIRTY YEARS OF PRACTICE

AND QUESTIONS

By Marie-Christine Pollet
Université libre de Bruxelles/ The Free University of Brussels
(Belgium)

This profile essay focuses on writing provision at the Université libre
de Bruxelles (ULB), or the Free University of Brussels, a French-spea-
king university situated in the Belgian capital. In 1979, the ULB
established the Centre de Méthodologie Universitaire (CMU) (Centre
for University Learning), the first initiative of its kind in French-spea-
king Belgium. The CMU situates its teaching and research within the
context of the linguistic needs of first-year, French-speaking students.
Through teaching in academic reading and writing, the CMU helps
students to surmount the obstacles in language that are the preserve of
university-level discourse communities, and enables first-year students
to take part in what for them is a new discursive environment. This
profile details the history and remit of the CMU and discusses various
pedagogical approaches through which the centre has moved over the
past thirty years.

                  THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

   The Université libre de Bruxelles (ULB), or the Free University of Brussels, a
French-speaking university situated in the Belgian capital, covers all disciplines,
is divided into 11 faculties, and encompasses all modes of study including un-
dergraduate and postgraduate.1 In the 2010-2011 academic year, it had nearly

24,000 students, among whom more than 7,000 were in their first year of un-
dergraduate study. ULB enrolls students who are native to Brussels, of course,
but also a significant number of provincial students, while 29% of its entire stu-
dent population comes from abroad (Free University of Brussels, 2011). In the
eyes of those who live in Brussels, ULB students are characterized by diversity
in their geographic, cultural, and social origins.

   One can add to this diverse mix the variety of educational backgrounds,
since, as in all institutions of higher education in Belgium (except for the Facul-
ties of Applied Sciences), admission to university is not conditioned by any test
(neither exam nor written application), as long as the student has obtained his
or her diploma of general or technical secondary education ("technique de tran-
sition") through the transition stream.2 Taking into account this particularity,
the first-year student population in French-speaking Belgium is very heteroge-
neous and it is difficult to count on all students possessing more or less identical
pre-requisites, including linguistic competence. This is what, in fact, led to the
granting of ministerial subsidies for universities to improve rates of student
success (The Bologna Accord of March 31, 2004) and then to the "decree de-
mocratizing higher education, working to promote the success of students and
creating the Observatory of Higher Education" (July 18, 2008).

   Therefore, we are currently in a political context where the promotion of
student success has been, for the past few years, regulated by decree, which
makes it possible for institutions to allocate funding for teaching initiatives
which, until then, had not necessarily been amongst their first priorities. The
ULB, however, had not awaited this decree for the university to take interest
in the fate of its first-year students, and established instead Le Centre de Mé-
thodologie Universitaire (CMU) (the Center for University Learning) in 1979,
the first initiative of its kind in French-speaking Belgium exclusively to develop
and support (beginning in the 1990s) disciplinary teaching guidance in most
Faculties.

   Even if, for historical reasons, the CMU is attached to the Faculty of Philoso-
phy and Letters, at least insofar as the management of its personnel is concerned
(hiring, careers, administrative framing), it is a cross-faculty center placed under
the aegis of the Education Authority of the university and thus offers its services
to the whole of the university community. The CMU situates its teaching and
research within the context of the linguistic support for first-year students--
French-speaking students, it is important to specify. It is indeed a question of
helping them to overcome the obstacles in language which the university--and
the new discursive environment that this embodies--has in store for them.

   Originally called the "Center for French Language Improvement" --a
name which speaks volumes about the normative approach and the purist vi-

94
                                                                              Université Libre de Bruxelles

sion of the Center's beginnings--the CMU now states clearly its will to accul-
turate students into university-level discourses, through interventions centered
on the development of linguistic competences in disciplinary contexts. It is
thus anchored resolutely in the theoretical and pedagogic field of Littéracies
Universitaires or "University Literacies," which articulates the teaching and
learning apprenticeship of writing at university in connection with the con-
struction of disciplinary knowledge.3

   This is why the CMU locates its pedagogic reflections and interventions
at the heart of this articulation, as we shall see in what follows. First of all, the
teaching team is made up of linguists and specialists in the various disciplines;
then, the analysis of needs, the research of authentic documents, as well as the
definitions of the main strands of the courses delivered by the CMU, are carried
out in collaboration with colleagues (professors and/or assistants) in the various
departments.

      A BIT OF HISTORY: PRACTICES, QUESTIONS AND
      THE "PEDAGOGIC REVOLUTIONS" OF THE CMU

   The CMU was created in 1979, following the publication by the Faculty
of Sciences of the ULB of a report in which the authors attributed the main
cause of students' failure in the first year to the poor knowledge of the language.
According to their observations, these gaps in knowledge render "the students
unable to follow the complexity of a scientific thought as much in a written text
as in an oral lecture or class, to the extent to which `the negligence of French-
speaking students with respect to their language is such that they find them-
selves disadvantaged in relation to foreign students who have learned French
recently but more rigorously.'"4

   These are the catastrophist comments which led to the creation of a center
called at the time "The Center for French Language Improvement," in charge
of improving the linguistic performance of future students, through the use of
language drills in order for students to master the command of the linguistic
system as part of foundational courses as well as during the course of first-
year exercise workshops. Through the years, these early practices evolved enor-
mously from a logic of remediation to a logic of student education. The next
section shows this evolution, indeed the "pedagogic revolutions" of the CMU.
For a more complete discussion, see Pollet, 2001, 2008.) These changes reflect
the limits of some practices, the teaching dead-ends with which we, the staff at
the Center, confronted, as well as the reflections which led us to follow other
paths. These revolutions at the CMU are the result of our experience, but also

                                                                                                 95

of the evolution of the research into the teaching of French in higher education,
and thus, more recently, in the context of academic literacies, of the research in
sociology and socio-linguistics.

                          The Normative Approach

   For a long time, the command of language was considered from a normative
perspective, through the reproaches formulated against students as well as the
remedial type of solutions offered to them. These reproaches are well-known--
poverty of vocabulary, ignorance of the most elementary syntax, appalling or-
thography--and led to the implementation of exercises whose objective was to
develop micro-level skills.

   However, no matter how generous and well-meant these practices were,
they deserve questioning, First of all, these practices were in keeping with the
so-called "compensatory" programmes, the main flaw of which was clarified
by sociologists such as Jean-Claude Forquin (1990a, 1990b) and Christian
Bachman (1993), who show all the difficulty, even impossibility, of grafting
standard language codes on pupils coming from disadvantaged or notoriously
harsh backgrounds. In other words, according to theorists, programmes based
on linguistic drills are not fully adapted to the student audience that they target
in the first place: on the contrary, they run the risk of discouraging students
rather than aiding them.

   Next, Bernard Lahire (1993) showed that school work on language--the
reasoned exercises, the regulated practice, the perpetual work of repetition and
correction--causes "practical resistance" [6] among those pupils in whose writ-
ing we find the famous spelling errors as well as the wobbly syntactic construc-
tions. Moreover, certain researchers show the over-valuing of the influence of
students' non-command of standard language on the difficulties of training.
Thus, Elisabeth Bautier (1998) invites teachers and researchers not to grant
too much importance to students' lexical or syntactic difficulties, because they
often mask the difficulties "which represent deeper issues that differentiate pu-
pils even more since they concern the use of language presupposed by school
practices."

   Finally--and this is not the least of limits to identify--this approach suf-
fers terribly from decontextualization. The strongly reductive aspect of the
teaching that targets the command of the linguistic system causes this type
of remediation to result in the demotivation of students, and consequently in
teaching failure. Obviously, it is not a question of ignoring the problems-or-
thographical, lexical, syntactic--of students, which are quite real. Rather, it is
a question of thinking of other avenues than those represented by the language

96
                                                                              Université Libre de Bruxelles

drill and the imposition of a norm. One such solution consists of locating
the norm in the challenges of communication, by developing the critical and
metalinguistic consciousness of students in relation to this language standard
and its variations (Béguelin, 1998). By raising students' awareness in this way,
they will undoubtedly grow to be more motivated to appropriate the tools that
we can offer them.

                          The Technicist Approach

   The recognition of the limits of the normative perspective such as it has
just been briefly described led to the development of a technicist approach for
achieving mastery of language and for its teaching in higher education. On
the basis of recurring observations that students are not able to "distinguish
the essential from the accessory," nor "to synthesize information," nor "to take
notes," nor "to write a clear answer," the technicist approach acts to develop
"techniques" and "methods," considered--wrongly it must be said--as general
and transverse.

   It is in this way that the programmes centred primarily on the improve-
ment of language moved gradually towards the "working methods," investing
primarily in strategies that concern the summarizing activity (plans, summaries,
syntheses, note-taking). Like the normative approach, however, these practices
also suffer from decontextualization, at least when they do not take into ac-
count the characteristics of the discourse to which they relate nor the analysis
of assignment questions, in other words, when, as it is often the case, they are
focused on the school exercise of summarising and its purely technical aspects
of information reduction. The principal flaw of this approach is "to substitute
a logic of technical skills for a logic of knowing and intellectual work" (Bautier,
1998, p. 22).

   While this type of teaching can instil in students considerable non-negligi-
ble mechanisms such as the selection of important concepts, thanks to the iden-
tification of conceptual fields, it also runs the risk, however, of pushing students
to take refuge behind automatisms. This approach will not support pragmatic
reflection, which would enable them to stay open to the world of the discourse
that surrounds them in the environment of their studies.

                          The Pragmatic Approach

   This last approach, which is currently dominant, consists of developing
writing competences in disciplinary contexts, and according to these contexts.
Thus, the conception of "French in higher education" has been expanded to

                                                                                                 97
Pollet

make room for its discursive and cognitive aspects. Moreover, "the mastery of
the language" is considered from the angle of linguistic practices (reading-writ-
ing) in use in the medium of studies and the disciplinary field, and in connec-
tion with the modes of this disciplinary knowledge construction.

   It is in the context of this pragmatic approach, initially developed due
to the failures of the previous approaches and through a kind of pedagogic
intuition, that the concept of "Littéracies Universitaires" came to be coined
at the right moment. This concept, which made its way into the French-
speaking world from the Anglophone countries, offers a genuine framework
for us to inscribe our reflections, our research, and our practices. Indeed,
this field of knowledge makes us consider the specificities of academic dis-
ciplines, and "taking into account these disciplines (of teaching or research)
obliges us to articulate the analysis of writings and of writing with the vari-
ous institutional spaces of discourse production, of academic or educational
spaces with those of scientific research."5 This also leads us to consider that
it is within this space, of the "complex relation between university writ-
ing and the knowledge and know-how acquired in the disciplines," that it
is appropriate to locate our pedagogic interventions (Donahue, 2010, pp.
43-44).

   It is thus a question of supporting our students through their transition into
their university literacy(ies), for there is more than one single academic literacy
in keeping with the disciplines and types of discourse to comprehend and pro-
duce as part of their various strands of study. More precisely, it is advisable "to
consider the connections between writing and knowledge in a discipline, as well
as the epistemological role of the latter" (Delcambre & Lahanier-Reuter, 2010,
p. 15) because "the writing and the object of the writing cannot be separated,
and the learning of disciplinary writing will need to be done in connection with
the teaching of the discipline itself " (Donahue, 2010, p. 57).

             CONCRETELY: PRAGMATIC TEACHING
                     APPROACHES OF THE CMU2

   The CMU organizes various types of classes, according to the wishes, con-
straints or cultures of faculties and/or courses of study. This provision takes
the shape of exercise sessions, practical work (which can be optional or heavily
guided, or even subject to a "bonus" in terms of credits), or else courses taken
as part of the students' degree programmes. Nevertheless, no matter the form
the CMU teaching may take, certain fundamental principles guide the develop-
ment and organization of its provision.

      The Contextualisation of Interventions: the Analysis of
    Needs, Interdisciplinary Collaboration, and Team-teaching

   The contextualisation of the CMU's teaching interventions involves a close
cooperation with staff in academic departments, a deep analysis of students'
needs, based on interactions with colleagues, but also on the observation of
students' papers and work on authentic documents.

   Moreover, most courses and/or practical work are delivered jointly by two
teachers: one a linguist, the other a specialist in the discipline. This collabora-
tion, which sometimes unsettles students at first, proves very profitable. Indeed,
the complementarity of competences of each specialist renders the seminars
rich, dynamic, complete, and legitimate, both on the linguistic and on the dis-
ciplinary level. The participation of disciplinary colleagues is paramount be-
cause only they make it possible "to clarify from within the epistemological
dimensions of the writing, the interactions between the writing and the research
methods, the challenges and the forms of the scientific communication" (Del-
cambre & Lahanier-Reuter, 2010, p. 15).

         Recognition of the Need for Continued Training in
           Reading-writing, Including in Higher Education

   It is the main tenet of the concept of literacies that is pinned down here,
and that in itself allows for a change in the conception of teaching writing at
university from the idea of remedial tuition to that of formation or education,
at different strategic moments during the student's course of study, a kind of
teaching that is normal with respect to the novelty of the environment. This
also offers us the opportunity to envisage the articulation of reading/writing as
integral to a single pedagogy of writing.

       A Balanced Articulation between Theory and Practice

   While the interventions of the CMU are meant to be especially practical
and to lead students to exercise, above all, competences of reading comprehen-
sion and writing production, my colleagues and I believe, nonetheless, that
the contribution of certain theoretical concepts represents a further means of
developing students' metalinguistic consciousness, and their ability to transfer
what they have learned into their courses. Therefore, it seems important to us to
lead students to reflect on the concepts of discourse genres, textual or sequential
typologies, cohesion/coherence, and enunciative modalities, as well as on prac-
tices of reported speech and problem-raising.

                                                                                                 99

             An Example from the Department of History

    Among the courses or exercises taught by the CMU, we shall give here an
example of a course which already has a long tradition and has recently been
reorganized within the context of the latest reform of programs in the Depart-
ment of History (2010) for it to adhere even more to the specificities of the dis-
cipline. Indeed, the course entitled "Exercises on the construction of historical
knowledge," registered under this name with the programme for five years but
existing informally for more than twenty, usually taught by a historian and a
linguist, has been seen as being entrusted with the mission of anchoring, more
than ever, work on writing in the discipline and its specificities, including those
which are related to the practices of research. This demand for reinforcement
thus led to an increase in ECTS course credits (10 instead of five out of 60 in
total), to an increase in the number of tenured tutors (four instead of two), and
to an enhanced collaboration with the unit teaching documentary research.

   With regard to the implementation of this current draft of the course, a
new analysis of needs was carried out based on three intersecting sources: the
discussion of teachers in the department about their discipline and the students'
needs; samples of the students' perspectives on the writing in their discipline
and on their difficulties when confronted with the reception or the production
of these discourses; and the characteristics of the various types of legitimated
discourse circulating within this discipline (articles, books, and pedagogic dis-
courses produced by teacher-researchers).

   Afterwards, we cross-fertilised the various elements thus observed with cer-
tain reflections by "theorists of the history" of writing, the methods, and prac-
tices of research, from which we attempted to establish some characteristics of
disciplinary discourses that cannot be ignored. The data thus collected make it
possible to determine, besides the notions relevant to the discipline itself, the
linguistic concepts to summon and the linguistic competences to develop in
the students, in order thus to build a course centred on disciplinary writing, in
which epistemological and heuristic specificities guide the choice of content.

       SOME QUESTIONS BY WAY OF CONCLUSION . . .

   The most important question concerns the status of this kind of course. First
of all, do such courses have to be optional (either opted for by the students who
wish to take them, or imposed by the institution on some students, following a
test, for example), or obligatory (which is to say imposed on all the students by
the requirements of the program)? If the pragmatic character and the formative

100
                                                                              Université Libre de Bruxelles

aspect that we privilege cause us to show an inclination toward the obligatory,
experience shows that these courses are not necessarily legitimate in the eyes of
certain students ("I can read and write, nevertheless") nor, sometimes, it should
be said, in the eyes of certain colleagues. We further add to this the problems
which are encountered in all higher education French courses, including "tech-
niques of expression," "methodology," and so on; these "weakened territories,"
to use again an expression of Michel Dabène and Claude Fintz (1998). To pre-
vent this problem, it is necessary for this course to be a true project of the
institution, but also of the department of study, to which all of the colleagues
adhere. Moreover, the disciplinary anchoring must be very visible, which, very
prosaically, implies an important reflection concerning the title of the course,
which must signify this anchoring.

   The question regarding the status of the course also arises insofar as the
proportioning of theory and practice is concerned, and also in the mode(s) of
assessment being used. These points, which require great flexibility and great
adaptability on behalf of the CMU, must be tackled within the department, in
keeping with the demand, the needs, the constraints, and the practices.

   A second question concerns the cost, in all senses of the word: in terms of
time, since the preparations are individualized according to the needs of the
departments, but also in terms of money, since several people become involved
in these courses. Institutional policy, therefore, must thus be very willing from
this point of view.

   The last question to be addressed relates to the most appropriate moments
and objectives in students' courses for the organization of such teaching. In Bel-
gium, the tendency is for such courses to be focused on the first year of study,
and that is justified, of course, by the need to familiarize students with a new
discursive environment. However, research in the field of University Literacies
and our experiences in the field lead us to defend the idea of continuous teach-
ing, focusing on the various genres of written and spoken discourse with which
students are confronted throughout their courses.

ACADEMIC LITERACIES IN THE

SOUTH: WRITING PRACTICES

IN A BRAZILIAN UNIVERSITY

By Désirée Motta-Roth
Federal University of Santa Maria (Brazil)

Paulo Freire (2000, p. 46), the renowned Brazilian educator, once
stated that "one learns to read by reading." To understand what writ-
ing does, we need to experience interaction mediated by writing. In
this essay I focus on the importance of learners' participation in aca-
demic activities for the development of academic literacies: the mate-
rial and symbolic acts that (re)produce verified knowledge, associated
with higher education. I will give an overview of the writing practices
at the Federal University of Santa Maria (Universidade Federal de
Santa Maria or UFSM), where I have been investigating and teach-
ing academic writing since 1994. The essay starts with a brief history
and mission statement about the university. The second section brings a
general description of writing at UFSM in relation to why and in rela-
tion to what goals this writing occurs. In the third section, I analyze
English undergraduate and Applied Linguistics graduate students' an-
swers to a questionnaire about their literacy practices. The essay closes
with a description of the principles for a writing program and a note
on ambitions and frustrations regarding writing pedagogy in my local
context.

     THE SIZE, BRIEF HISTORY, AND MISSION OF UFSM

   Founded on December 14, 1960, UFSM1 (http://www.ufsm.br/) is located
in an area of 4,593 acres on the outskirts of Santa Maria,2 a city of 270,000 in-
habitants, in the geographical center of Rio Grande do Sul, the southern-most
state of Brazil.3

   Through its 152 years, Santa Maria has become an important regional ref-
erence for agricultural and services sectors, especially medical and educational

institutions. The city has education as one of its driving forces: one federal uni-
versity and seven colleges for higher education, a school system (preschool to
high school) that includes 80 city schools, 38 state schools, four federal schools,
and a large number of private schools.

   In its 50 years, UFSM has become paramount to the city's economic, cul-
tural and social organization. Its mission is to construct and impart knowledge
in order to make people able to innovate and contribute to the sustainable de-
velopment of society as a whole, with the vision to become recognized as an in-
stitution of excellence. In the campus (total area of 4,593 acres, with 3,439,697
square feet of edification), 16,663 students pursue a degree in 10 colleges and
76 undergraduate programs in all areas (from Medicine to Education, from
English Teaching to Business) and more than 50 graduate programs, taught
by 1,397 professors organized in 200 research groups. Although UFSM is of
medium importance and size if compared to major Brazilian institutions like
the University of São Paulo,4 some programs such as the ones in the Chemistry
or the Rural Sciences (Agriculture and Veterinary) departments are among the
best in the country.

   Originally a rural university for the study and development of the local
agricultural economic system and the field of medical services, UFSM has
developed competencies in the areas of humanities, science, and technology.
Although scientific publication and technological patent processing are two as-
pects of Brazilian academic life that need to grow exponentially in comparison
to other developing countries like Argentina, publication and authorship have
received a lot of attention. UFSM, in particular, has a policy to foster publi-
cation not only in Portuguese (Brazil's official language) but also in foreign
languages. It allocates budget for each unit according to publication indexes,
among other factors.5

     WRITING AT UFSM: WHY, ABOUT WHAT, IN WHAT
        LANGUAGES, IN RELATION TO WHAT GOALS?

   In departments with post-graduation programs, undergraduate writing for
publishing is strongly advised if not demanded. Even though Brazil has an es-
tablished tradition of publication in Portuguese and of translation of interna-
tional material into Portuguese, UFSM departments tend to encourage reading
of material in English or other languages (e.g., French or Spanish), as a way to
keep updated with international research. Furthermore, some post-graduation
programs (e.g., Chemistry) receive PhD candidates from other continents, so
English is often used as the lingua franca in classes, labs, and publications.

   Evidently the choice of the language is dependent on the object of study and
research. While publishing in English may be the norm in Electrical Engineer-
ing or Physics, in the School of Arts and Languages, where a teaching degree
in Portuguese is offered, reading theoretical/professional material in Portuguese
is the norm. Academic activities for professors working at the Post-Graduation
Program in Literature and Language Studies include publishing mostly theo-
retical books aimed at a readership in Brazil and Portugal, with few research
papers in academic journals or in a foreign language.

   In the Department of Foreign Languages, with teaching degrees in English
and Spanish, and special courses in French, German, and Italian, research papers
appear mainly in journals in Portuguese and Spanish. Writing in Portuguese is
more comfortable, and the goal is to establish a local readership for the work of
nationals and Latin-American colleagues, so that the Brazilian literature can be
used as reference for further development of the area.

   Although publication in international Applied Linguistics journals is a ca-
reer asset, publishing in Portuguese is sometimes an affirmative action, accord-
ing to email interviews with Brazilian applied linguists (Motta-Roth, 2002)
about factors that constrained their academic writing:

         206 - Obviously having a text accepted for publication in
         a prestigious international journal lends high status to the
         researcher, but in a new area such as ours I still think we have
         to democratically impart the results of our research projects
         in Brazil to Brazilian academics and school teachers.

         28 - I'm convinced that especially in applied areas it is more
         important to publish in Portuguese in order to give Brazilians
         access to research results done about Brazilian issues. If not,
         you'll end up having to translate your own texts so that your
         work becomes known in Brazil.

   In a large developing country such as Brazil,7 creating a sense of disciplinary
community for fostering theoretical elaboration is a political move, as is pub-
lishing in the native language.

         29 - Many times, it's a one-way street. Almost no foreign
         researcher makes an effort to know what is being done in
         Brazil ( . . . ), while we are supposed to know what's going on
         in foreign countries (like US or UK). Many times what you
         see abroad is a concept that has been developed here first,

                                                                                                107
Motta-Roth

         but since it has not been published in English, people do not
         acknowledge its previous existence.

   While researchers in many areas aim at publishing in English,8 applied lin-
guists often feel that circulating their work in Portuguese is an act of resistance
to "academic imperialism": the hegemony of Anglophonic scientific publica-
tion that legitimates research paradigms sometimes without further questioning
(Phillipson & Skutnabb-Kangas, 1999, p. 31).

   This "resistance" view can be disputed on several grounds and seldom extrap-
olates to students' discourse on writing. In fact, the average undergraduate has a
relatively commonsensical view of the function of writing in life. A more articu-
late perspective that conceives writing as "social participation" is shown either by
students who take part in undergraduate research opportunity programs with
scientific initiation grants or graduate students doing research for their theses/
dissertations. The answers to the survey conducted at the Reading and Writing
Research and Teaching Laboratory (REWRITE) with undergraduate students
from the English Teacher Education program and graduate students from the
Applied Linguistics Program at UFSM are the focus of the next section.

      WHERE AND WHAT STUDENTS WRITE AT UFSM:
              DISCIPLINES, GENRES, ASSIGNMENTS

   Students have variable perceptions of how writing mediates their engage-
ment in university activities and how these activities are significant to them.
Perceptions of the role of writing in one's academic life depend on the model
of writing and on the kind of learners' engagement in the activity/genre system
that constructs their university environment.

   Two very distinct kinds of undergraduate students' perceptions of the uni-
versity arise: 1) learning mediated by teachers in regular classes and lectures or
2) education mediated by symbolic and material research activities. The kind
of insertion students have in the discipline depends on how much they seek
research opportunities and mentoring, beyond the lecture halls and classrooms.

   "One has to live the process in order to be able to understand and practice
it" (Freire, 2000, p. 46), as indicated by the results of a survey carried out at
REWRITE with 41 students divided among four years of the English Teaching
Degree Program. Questions regarded how often, about what, for what purpose,
and in which situations students wrote, their greatest difficulties, and the rel-
evance of writing activities in Portuguese and English to their everyday univer-
sity or professional lives.

108
                                                               Federal University of Santa Maria (Brazil)

   In their analysis of these data, Assis-Brasil and Marcuzzo (2009) argue that
these undergraduate students have a clear perspective on the everyday written
genres, since they identify them by such names as "e-mails," "letters," "notes" or
"e-scraps." When referring to the production of academic texts, however, gen-
eral terms emerge such as "texts" or "assignments" (p.171). For the authors, this
distinction would demonstrate that these students know the genre-set pertain-
ing to everyday life but lack metaawareness about academic genres.

   Alternatively, I believe that, even though they mention everyday genres,
these students tend to think of writing as a mechanical skill whose general aim
is to "to express oneself " or "to communicate with others." There is no concept
of genre systems exactly because of the lack of a general sense of literacy prac-
tices: the knowledge of the social practices mediated by the use of the written
word (Lea, 1999, p. 106), of how living is mediated by tools and signs (texts)
(Vygotsky, 2001).

   First-year students express an imprecise perception of how often, when and
why they write:

         1/2 - Every day at work, in class, at home9

         1/3 - Normally when I think of something that's controver-
         sial or interesting.

         1/11 - To communicate with people that live far away

   One could ask: to acquire vocabulary in what genre? To communicate with
people in what capacity/role, for what purpose?

         Most answers about writing situations and objectives are general:
"chats" (1/1), "e-mail" (2/8), "assignments" (3/4), "notes" (4/1). At the time
of the survey these students had not taken a course in academic writing and
many expressed their frustration when trying to write an assignment because
they lacked expressive resources. Although a writing course would certainly
have made a difference, engagement in actual social research practices could
have built awareness of the complex process through which written texts
construct disciplinary knowledge. It could also help them understand how the
very act of engaging in written practices specific to the discipline constructs a
particular world of meanings, a particular mode of ratiocination (Bazerman,
1988).

         These students have a "study skills model of writing" focused on
"surface features of language form in terms of grammar, punctuation, spell-
ing, etc," so that writing is considered a "technical skill" (Lea, 1999, p. 106).

                                                                                                109
Motta-Roth

This unfortunately is the writing model generally adopted in Brazilian schools
and at UFSM, with few exceptions, as I will explain in the last section of this
paper. In fact, writing difficulties are credited to lack of vocabulary and poor
command of grammar and text organization skills, showing a structural per-
ception of writing as the application of knowledge about language structures
(Assis-Brasil & Marcuzzo, 2009, p. 173).

         To understand complex academic writing practices and the role of
writing in their everyday and academic lives, these students would need a
model of "academic literacies" (Lea, 1999, p. 107): the social uses of alpha-
betical competencies by those who have appropriated reading and writing and
have incorporated the social practices that demand them (Soares, 1999).

         No respondent mentioned the specific literacy practices or genre
systems that construct their field: essays for course assignments, articles
originated in course papers, book reviews published in undergraduate journals
with an appraisal of the literature in the area, teaching activities for teaching
practice, research proposals submitted for approval, reports to present research
data, final graduation papers, conference abstracts, e-mails with requests (e.g.,
for the copy of an article, for submitting a paper in a conference), letters and
résumés for grant or job application, etc.

   In contrast to this sample, another group of students from REWRITE
were interviewed: two fourth-year students who hold a research scholarship
in the English Teacher Education program, six master's students, and six
PhDs students in the Applied Linguistics Program (who are either about to
or have recently graduated). Of the seventeen questionnaires, fourteen were
returned.

   These students engage as authors in the complexity of academic written
social practices, as part of the knowledge construction system at UFSM. They
mobilize a repertoire of academic genres that allow them to negotiate a position
as newcomers to the discipline.

   The undergraduate students seem to have a precise view of what counts as a
writing situation:

         4/4 - I use writing in the university context: a) course as-
         signments, b) tests, c) teaching material, d) teaching practice
         and research reports for scientific initiation, e) papers for
         conferences, f ) administrative demands, e.g., a memo to ask
         permission to waive prerequisite(s) for an advanced course . .
         . I also write in everyday practices, such as i) notes for family
         members back home, j) messages in MSN, facebook, or to
         friends, . . .m) shopping lists.

110
                                                               Federal University of Santa Maria (Brazil)

   They understand what writing does and how it does it in different contexts
in terms of roles/relationships/purposes for the academic genres mentioned: "e-
mail-- to classmates--to make appointments for study meetings."

   Post-graduate students have to practice academic writing on a daily basis
and hold a clear perspective on the repertoire of genres that construct their
professional activities.

         M/4 - I have been writing final papers for the post-gradu-
         ation courses which later become articles that I submit to
         journals . . . later on they are edited and become parts of the
         thesis.10

         Dr/2 - In my teaching practice I write class plans, teaching
         materials . . ., tests and exams . . . As a researcher, I write
         book reviews..., research proposals, reports, memos, abstracts
         and papers to present results of my research in conferences,
         research articles . . . .

   Although only eight respondents had taken the academic writing course I
teach, those who had and were committed to research seemed to have the most
articulate sense of how writing mediates their participation in the professional
field:

         M/2 - . . . .writing is a way to open a niche from where to
         speak out in the academic environment. . . .

         M3 - . . .I write to maximize my CV and demarcate my
         presence in the academic environment.

   Participation in research literacies generates a sense of authorship, which is
one of the main attainments in academic writing teaching, as discussed below.

  CONCLUSION: AMBITIONS AND FRUSTRATIONS, AND
      AN APPROACH TO THE TEACHING OF WRITING

   The academic writing course whose principles are described here has been
offered once a year since 1994 at REWRITE. Its three objectives are: 1) to raise
novice academic writers' awareness of academic literacy practices, 2) to develop
their reading and writing competencies by implementing a writing cycle that

                                                                                                111

focuses on their own (real) work, 3) to encourage learners to develop discourse
analysis abilities so that they can continue improving their written competen-
cies throughout their academic lives in a cycle of reading/writing/revising/
editing/publishing.

   The course has been developed from three principles. First, academic litera-
cies obtain from reading and writing: one attains a literacy state/condition by
appropriating technologies to interact with the social context as reader/writer in
order to participate in the knowledge society (Soares, 1999). People learn how
to use language because they learn to interact in their social context (Halliday,
1994).

   Second, one learns to write by engaging in literacy practices, by becoming
an author. The course aims at developing learners' authorship by encourag-
ing them to explore disciplinary literacy practices and fostering writing within
events and genres that structure the academic life in which they want to par-
ticipate. Authorship--as the writer's prerogative and responsibility to choose
the aim, content, style, and readership of the text (Ivanic, 1998, pp. 26, 219,
341) --stems from the experience of this awareness. The concept of literacy(ies)
depends on that of authorship.

         Third, one learns to interact through language by becoming a dis-
course analyst (McCarthy & Carter, 1994, p.134), by developing a sense of
how discursive practices are situated as genres (Bazerman, 2005). Students
analyze the connections between contextual features (activity, identity, rela-
tions as well as the role performed by text in the situation) and their respective
linguistic realizations (expression of content, instantiation of relationships
between interlocutors, and organization of text).

   The writing cycle taught in the course completes in three steps:
   1. Context Exploration--collect genre exemplars, observe and report re-

       search practices, genres, concepts and problems from their labs (Which
       roles does language play in knowledge production practices in your
       discipline?);
   2. Text Exploration--learners analyze genre systems for referential mean-
       ings (that make intelligible the activity system of their context), for in-
       terpersonal meanings (that represent the roles and relationships of the
       participants of that activity system), and for language itself (text form
       and content) (How does language construct context and vice versa?); and
   3. Text Production--learners write, revise, and edit their own as well as
       others' exemplars of relevant genres (How is language used for engage-
       ment and participation in academic literacy practices? Who publishes
       where? Who reads what? Do you intend to publish your text? How can
       you do that?)

112
                                                               Federal University of Santa Maria (Brazil)

   In the Context Exploration phase, learners go back to their laborato-
ries to interview colleagues and advisors to identify relevant research top-
ics, concepts, methodological approaches, and academic genres to structure
their work. Learners already working on their dissertations are supposed to
see their advisors in order to establish the writing priority for the course:
to concentrate on writing a paper or one of their dissertation chapters (Ru-
ral Sciences learners, for example, often experience a hard time in writing
their Review of the Literature chapter and tend to choose this text). The
semantic map will evolve into the writing of the objectives and then into
a tentative abstract that will serve as a guide to the writing of the lon-
ger text. The Text Exploration phase offers the learners the opportunity to
analyze genre exemplars for referential meanings (relevant content for their
research), interpersonal meanings (experienced authors' tone and style), and
language itself (which linguistic choices produce these meanings, cohesion,
and coherence).

   We look at research articles from important journals or relevant research
projects learners have identified with the help of advisors during the Con-
text Exploration phase. The whole class analyzes each exemplar together in
order to make contrasts among areas more evident and thus raise learners'
awareness of language, text, and discourse features across disciplines.

   Finally, in the Text Production phase learners write their drafts and bring
copies, so the class reads and comments on them. As texts grow longer, we
divide into revising teams and set a calendar so that every class a number of
people bring their texts to be revised. After that they will have a fortnight
or so to edit their texts and bring a new section or an extended version of
their papers (or other genre). A textbook written especially for this course
(Motta-Roth, 2001)11 offers support for writing academic genres (explana-
tions about aim, form, style, structure and linguistic choices).

   This "Academic writing cycle"12 is successful as long as learners are en-
couraged to experience disciplinary interaction as readers and writers (Rus-
sell, 1997). My academic literacy presupposes understanding how a system
of written genres constructs a disciplinary context in different situations,
how texts work differently in each field depending on the nature of the
activities each area of study conducts and of the relations the participants
maintain to produce knowledge. Awareness about the bi-directionality be-
tween text and context allows students to see how the texts they write are
an integral part of academia so that they can situate their text in the system
of discursive genres (Bazerman, 2005) that structure academic interactions.

   One of my frustrations in relation to writing pedagogy at UFSM is the
general lack of an institutional writing program that fosters undergraduate

                                                                                                113

students' engagement in material and writing research practices from their
very first year. Only sometimes is a special course offered as an initiative of
the central administration or in one of the specific colleges, but no writing
policy has yet been devised to significantly improve our publication levels.
Institutional support of an extensive and inclusive writing program would
be crucial. Specifically in the Language Teaching Program, the ambition
would be to integrate into the teacher education process research and writ-
ing practices in academic genres, so that future teachers begin systematic
thinking and writing from their freshman year forward.

WRITING PROGRAMS

WORLDWIDE: ONE CANADIAN

PERSPECTIVE

By Roger Graves and Heather Graves
University of Alberta (Canada)

The history of writing instruction in Canadian universities differs
markedly from the US experience. In Canada, first-year writing was
never required and even today is optional. Further, it has evolved out
of a literature/composition hybrid course that continues to be taught
in many institutions, including the University of Alberta. The key
moment at the University of Alberta occurred with the establishment
of the Writing Task Force in 2005. The task force made three ma-
jor recommendations: a new Writing Centre; a Writing-Across-the-
Curriculum Program (WAC); and a Writing Studies Program. These
new initiatives joined three existing writing centres at Campus Saint
Jean (the French-language campus); the Augustana campus, located
100 kilometers from Edmonton; and the existing writing tutorial ser-
vice located in Student Services. The directors of all these units come
together regularly at the University Writing Committee meetings to
coordinate plans, share ideas, and listen to the concerns of faculty from
across the institution.

   The University of Alberta (enrollment 37,000; 18 faculties; established
1908; $500 million in research per year) has a long-standing commitment to
improving student writing, but because this commitment arose out of the his-
tory of teaching writing in Canadian contexts, that commitment took form in
ways unlike the pattern in the United States of America. Johnson (1988) sum-
marized the differences, chief among them being the lack of first-year writing
in Canada:

         In contrast to the much documented rise of the "Freshman
         Composition" course in English departments in the United
         States, the twentieth-century Canadian academy has never

Graves and Graves

         embraced the curricular concept of the "Comp" class per se;
         and, with remarkable hegemony, has persisted into the pres-
         ent decade in offering introductory English courses founded
         on a synthesis of composition instruction and training in
         critical analysis--a synthesis which was the distinctive legacy
         of nineteenth-century Canadian adaptations of British-style
         belletristic rhetoric. (869)

   According to Johnson, an eighteenth-century British rhetorical education
focuses on developing mental discipline, and the application of rhetorical
principles to literature ("belles letters") results in the development of mental
acuity and moral discipline. This combination of writing instruction in the
context of literary analysis came to define the first-year literature course in
many English departments in the early twentieth century, including the de-
partment at the University of Alberta (Graves 1994; Hubert 1994; Johnson
1991). This fusion of the two elements continues to dominate this depart-
ment today, as unlikely as that may seem to American readers.

   This tradition has come under pressure in the last few decades. Other uni-
versities, such as the University of Western Ontario, have largely abandoned
the literature/composition hybrid and developed a writing program outside
of the context of an English department. At the University of Winnipeg,
the writing program has now become a department, and it now offers both
undergraduate and graduate degrees, mirroring a trend in the United States
towards "independent" writing programs (Kearns & Turner, 1997, and essay
in this volume). While only one or two universities in Canada require first-
year writing courses (the University of Winnipeg is one notable example),
many offer an optional course or series of courses in writing. Another factor
affecting first-year writing is the trend toward students transferring into a
university after having done one or two years at a two-year college. Two-
year colleges in Canada very often offer and even require a writing course or
series of writing courses. At the University of Alberta, many students attend
Grant MacEwen College/University (a hybrid institution) or Red Deer Col-
lege before transferring to upper-year programs at the University of Alberta.
At Grant MacEwen students may take a two-course writing sequence, the
second of which mirrors the literature/composition synthesis favored at the
University of Alberta. The recent development of exclusively writing courses
has created a problem with assigning transfer credit: until very recently when
the new Writing Studies courses were developed, there was no equivalent
course at the University of Alberta.

      KEY MOMENT: WRITING TASK FORCE (2005-2008)

   As part of strategic planning for the University of Alberta, the Provost and
Faculty of Arts jointly sponsored a large, university-wide task force to assess
writing instruction and writing competencies from across the university. The
task force researched the status of writing both within the university and
across the continent to identify models that it might draw upon when propos-
ing changes. The committee researched the literature/composition first-year
English courses, examined the needs of second language writers, studied how
much writing was being assigned in courses across the university curriculum,
and wrote many documents as part of this process. Many of these documents,
including the interim and final reports, are posted on the web: http://www.
writinginitiatives.ualberta.ca/Writing%20Task%20Force.aspx

   The task force gained widespread recognition for writing on campus and
to some extent across the province because of the ramifications any chang-
es would have for transfer credit from other institutions. Indeed, through
conference presentations and the research of the participants, other writ-
ing studies scholars across the country were aware of its work. The task
force made three major recommendations: a new, full-service, university-
wide Writing Centre; a significant Writing-Across-the-Curriculum Program
(WAC); and an interdisciplinary Writing Studies Program with a teaching/
research mandate.

  WRITING COURSES AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA

   While not officially a "program" (instead we are a "field of study") at the
University of Alberta, Writing Studies offers a number of courses in writ-
ing through the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies (OIS), an administrative
unit formed to house a number of programs, fields of study, and certificates
in the Faculty of Arts, including Religious Studies, Comparative Literature,
Humanities Computing, Middle Eastern and African Studies, and Science
Technology and Society. These programs and fields of study are units housed
in OIS for the purposes of administration, but all faculty who teach in these
units are members of a "home" department; for example, faculty in Writ-
ing Studies have English and Film Studies as their home departments. A re-
cent review of OIS raised questions about the future of this office, whether it
should remain an administrative unit or be converted into something more,
that is, whether it should be reconstituted as an academic unit.

                                                                                                119
Graves and Graves

   In 2010, the Writing Studies unit offered a total of thirteen sections of
six courses that were taught by four tenure-track or tenured faculty and one
instructor--a very small program for an institution of 37,000 students. These
courses included nine sections of the elective first year writing course (made
up of seven sections of WRS 101, Exploring Writing, and two sections of
WRS 103, Introduction to Writing in the Sciences); one section of a com-
bined undergraduate- and graduate-level course that is a practicum for train-
ing tutors in the Centre for Writers (WRS 301/603); and three graduate level
courses, Academic Writing for Graduate Students (WRS 500); Composition
Theory (WRS 601); and Writing and Disciplinarity (WRS 604). Composi-
tion Theory has been offered at the University of Alberta for a number of
years as an English and Film Studies Course; only in the last year or so has it
been converted to a Writing Studies course. The other three courses (Writing
for Graduate Students, the practicum for the Centre for Writers, and Writing
and Disciplinarity) are either brand new or developed and offered in the last
four years.

   This number of courses is typical of our offerings for the past three years.
Although there is significant demand for writing courses at both the under-
graduate and graduate levels (we could probably fill a third section of WRS
103, An Introduction to Writing in the Sciences, and perhaps offer WRS 500,
Academic Writing for Graduate Students, every term), the funding for offering
additional courses is absent in part due to cost-cutting measures associated with
the downturn in the provincial economy. Another factor is the cost of running
20-student courses in writing compared with the current 35-student literature/
composition synthesis course; offering enough writing courses to replace com-
position courses would result in cost increases of about 40%. While we would
like to see something like 30 or 40 sections offered each term, the additional
costs will likely prevent that for the foreseeable future.

                       WRS 101: Exploring Writing

   This first-year writing studies course, developed and supervised by Betsy
Sargent (Director of Writing Studies), focuses on engaging students in the writ-
ing process using workshop and seminars in a small class (less than 20 students)
setting. Students write often in class as well as following a process-driven ap-
proach to produce several larger documents that come together in a portfolio of
writing that is evaluated at the end of the term. Part of the rationale for grading
through portfolios is to delay finalizing the drafts students are working on; this
then extends the time students spend drafting and revising--the invention part
of the writing process.

   The most novel feature of this course, however, is the focus on "writing
about writing." This approach to teaching writing takes the stance that writing
is the subject of study in a writing course; students read academic articles by
composition scholars as their course material. Students here are both novices
who are learning to practice the art of writing as well as students of a content
area that focuses on knowledge about writing.

       WRS 103, An Introduction to Writing in the Sciences

   Writing Studies offered two distinct versions of first-year writing in 2010
because two sections of this course are reserved exclusively for first-year stu-
dents in the Faculty of Science who are enrolled in Science 100. Science 100
is an innovative, interdisciplinary re-thinking of first-year science that was in
its third year in 2010. The Faculty of Science consists of seven subject areas:
Biological Sciences, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Physics, Computing Sci-
ences, Mathematics and Statistical Sciences, Chemistry, and Psychology. This
configuration of areas is an artifact of institutional history. Several years ago
faculty in Science reconceptualized their first year curriculum into Science 100,
a year-long, 27-credit course, in which they take an interdisciplinary approach
to science, introducing students to all subject areas over the course of the year
and taking an experimental/experiential approach to the various topics. The
website describes the course like this: "SCIENCE 100 uses an integrated and
interdisciplinary approach and employs the expertise of top science professors
to deliver material from all seven Faculty of Science disciplines. The focus in
SCIENCE 100's small classes is on in-depth teaching, conceptual understand-
ing and practical mastery of the fundamentals": http://www.science.ualberta.
ca/ProspectiveStudents/SCIENCE100/HowItWorks.aspx . In addition to Sci-
ence 100, these students also take WRS 103, a three-credit course, in the fall
term, which teaches them some of the concepts of writing that will contribute
to their success over the course of their undergraduate education.

   In 2008, the first year that Science 100 was offered, students took a modi-
fied version of WRS 101, Exploring Writing, a course developed for the gen-
eral population of undergraduates at the University of Alberta; it has students
read academic journal articles in writing studies and reflect on the implications
this theory has for their own writing practices. WRS 101, Exploring Writing,
was not well suited to the needs of undergraduate science students because
the course's overt focus was on invention--helping students figure out what to
write about in a given assignment. In fact, the assumption that students need
help deciding on a topic is unwarranted with much science-related writing be-
cause it is experiment- and data-driven. Writers in science come to a text know-

                                                                                                121
Graves and Graves

ing what to write about--their interpretation of their findings. Consequently,
faculty in writing studies developed a version of the first-year writing course
that was tailored to the needs and interests of students in Science 100.

   In WRS 103 students take a process approach to writing, and the central fo-
cus of activities is on analyzing audience, purpose, and genre. Audiences are not
exclusively academic, with students writing for non-specialist and lay readers as
well. Regarding purpose, the course focuses on two major purposes for writing
in science: to inform and to persuade. Finally, assignments in WRS 103 are
not exclusively essay-based, since undergraduates in science in Canada almost
never write an essay of the variety routinely assigned in first-year composition
courses in the US (a research essay). Instead, students in WRS 103 write one
essay (a position argument) that uses explicit argument (in place of writing a
grant proposal, which is the genre in which scientists argue most explicitly),
two reports (that both argue for an interpretation and inform readers), and a
newsletter article (writing for a non-specialist or lay reader). By discussing the
varying requirements for structure, content, and style in these three different
genres, students gain a greater awareness of how these elements shape writing
as the writer moves from one genre to another, which is more useful to them
in their academic careers than mastering the persuasive essay. There is some
collaboration among instructors in Science 100 and the WRS 103 instructor
to ensure connections are drawn between the writing done in both the writing
and the science classes.

                THE PHD PROGRAM PROPOSAL IN
                WRITING STUDIES AND RHETORIC

   Rather than develop an undergraduate writing program, the faculty in Writ-
ing Studies decided to develop a PhD program because there are few doctoral
programs in Writing Studies in Canada. Many writing-related programs in Ca-
nadian universities are staffed by non-academic faculty offered through Student
Services. This situation is partly due to Canadian post-secondary administrators
who continue to view writing as a "skill" that students can acquire with one or
two hour-long workshops on academic writing or a handful of sessions with a
poorly-paid writing tutor who works on a cost-recovery basis. It is also partly
due to the lack of qualified academic faculty who could provide leadership
and intellectual depth to the teaching of writing at Canadian post-secondary
institutions.

   To attempt to address the issue of limited qualified personnel for writing-
related positions in Canada, the faculty in Writing Studies at the University

122
                                                                            University of Alberta (Canada)

of Alberta decided to create a doctoral program that would develop tenure-
line professionals with expertise in three areas: Writing Centre research and
administration; Writing Program research, development, and administration;
and research and program development in writing in the disciplines/writing
across the curriculum. When writing centres are housed in Student Services,
administrators in charge of Student Services tend to lose sight of the fact that
teaching writing has a strong intellectual and research foundation. When tu-
tors and instructors are not equipped or rewarded for conducting research and
expanding the field's understanding of the intellectual development entailed
in the activity of writing, they obviously do not do it, to the detriment of the
students they are charged with helping. Writing instruction that is drawn from
cutting-edge knowledge in the field will be much better equipped to make a dif-
ference in students' lives than uninformed obsession with correcting grammar
and punctuation errors in students papers. The proposed program will attempt
to redress this ongoing issue in writing instruction in Canada.

   Faculty in Writing Studies also decided to capitalize on the support at the
instructional level for writing at the University of Alberta by developing options
for graduate students to conduct research into writing in the disciplines. Recent
research suggests that generic writing courses, such as are offered at the first-
year level in composition, are not effectively generalizable across the academic
disciplines, at least in Canadian universities and colleges. Research that explores
the requirements for writing in various academic disciplines can help the field
to offer instructional resources that better meet the needs of their students who
come from disciplines across the university.

   Early in 2010 Writing Studies faculty learned that the budget crisis at the
University of Alberta would slow the funding of any new programs at any level
of the university. It therefore appears that there is no money for developing this
doctoral program in late 2010. This situation may change as the provincial, na-
tional, and global economies improve, however. In the meantime, the proposal
is going forward with the hope that it might be approved and in place if and
when funding becomes available.

                         CENTRE FOR WRITERS

   When the student union presented its request to the Provost in 2006, he
asked them to identify the one request they wanted most. They identified the
Centre for Writers as their top priority. Now in its third full year of operation,
the Centre for Writers is an established presence on campus. This success came
despite some adversity, a fact that many writing centre directors might see as

                                                                                                123

unremarkable. Now in its fourth year of operation, it has had three directors.
The first director set up the office, hired an administrative assistant, taught the
first peer-tutor training course, and oversaw the first term of tutoring sessions
in Winter 2008 with about 180 students and 300 one-to-one sessions. After her
resignation in the summer of 2008, Roger Graves served as interim director for
the first full year of operations. Over 1300 students participated in a total of
over 2500 one-to-one sessions. A staff of over 20 undergraduate peer tutors and
graduate student tutors worked in the Center, which was relocated to a new,
larger space for the 2009-10 year. During this first year, another permanent di-
rector was hired for the Centre, Lucie Moussu. In her first year as director and
the second full year of operations, the Centre conducted over 4500 one-to-one
appointments for over 1700 students. The web site for the Centre continues
to add resources for students, and the tutoring desks in the Centre all have
computers and print resources (handbooks, style manuals, dictionaries). It has
become the vibrant, well-run, and important resource envisioned by the Writ-
ing Task Force.

   The Centre for Writers is one of four independent (funded and run separate-
ly) writing centres at the university. Bilingual Writing Centre/Centre d'écriture
bilingue (Campus Saint-Jean) works with French-language students at the
French campus of the University of Alberta. The Augustana Writing Centre
works with students at the Augustana campus, which is located approximately
60 miles from the main campus. Writing Resources (Academic Support Centre,
Student Services) offers a similar tutorial service to the Centre for Writers as
well as workshops for both undergraduates and graduate students. Writing Re-
sources existed prior to the establishment of the Centre for Writers, and differs
in that it is a fee-recovery unit: it charges students $20 per half-hour appoint-
ment and various amounts for workshops.

              WRITING ACROSS THE CURRICULUM

   The Writing Across the Curriculum program at the University of Alberta has
engaged in four efforts: teaching about writing to classes in various disciplines
(about 25 in 2009); one-to-one consultations as well as workshops and presen-
tations for instructors, both faculty and graduate (18 workshops or presenta-
tions in 2009); research investigating the kinds of writing students are asked to
engage in at the University of Alberta (5 studies completed or under way).

   In an effort to engage and demonstrate how to teach students about the
writing tasks set for them in courses, Roger Graves has visited classes to teach
the session on getting started on the writing assignment. These sessions gener-

124
                                                                            University of Alberta (Canada)

ally last 50 minutes (or whatever time the professor can allot to this activity)
and involve parsing the assignment description; brainstorming topics for the
assignment; drafting sample thesis statements; constructing evidence-based ar-
guments in support of those thesis statements; writing summaries of research to
include in essays. During these sessions, which are frequently held in classes of
over 100 students, instructors and students talk back and forth about the nu-
ances of the assignment--a conversation that might not take place outside this
exchange or, if it did, sometimes too late in the writing process. Our goal at the
end of these sessions is that students have a good understanding of the assign-
ment; they know what kinds of strategies produce better writing (adopting a
process approach; getting feedback; revising); and they know where to get help
(at one of the four writing centres).

   Invitations to visit classes for those kinds of presentations often come from
writing-across-the-curriculum workshops and one-to-one conversations with
faculty members. These sorts of activities are typical of WAC programs for fac-
ulty development. In addition, we have tried to work less on the broad scale of
campus-wide workshops and more on a focused effort with specific curricular
groups. The Faculty of Science has been an enthusiastic supporter of initiatives
undertaken in Writing at University of Alberta. In additional to the collabora-
tion between Writing Studies and Science 100 instructors, the science faculty
has also been receptive to introducing more writing into some of their under-
graduate science courses. Each department, for example, has a senior capstone
course that involves a research project with a large writing component such as a
senior honors thesis (e.g., earth and atmospheric science) or a work report fol-
lowing an Industrial Internship Program placement (e.g., computing science,
biological sciences) or research report (e.g., biological sciences, including mi-
crobiology). In 2009, five faculty members in science consulted with Writing
Studies faculty about ongoing capstone courses (two in biology, one in earth
and atmospheric sciences) or during the process of developing a capstone course
(mathematics and statistical sciences). In addition, a series of six workshops on
writing-related topics (creating good writing assignments in science; grading
rubrics for writing assignments; teaching writing in science classes, etc.) for fac-
ulty and graduate students in science in winter 2009 were well attended, with
between 20 and 40 individuals at each one.

   The third major component of our WAC work has been research into the
writing assigned to students in various programs. Because most students do not
take an extensive liberal arts component--many enter directly from second-
ary school into their major program of study--and very few have a writing or
composition course, the writing they do is very much discipline-based. We have
conducted studies here based on a previous study at another university where

                                                                                                125
Graves and Graves

we collected every writing assignment from every course (Graves, Hyland &
Samuels, 2010). We have replicated this study methodology for the Faculty
of Nursing; Faculty of Physical Education, Recreation, and Leisure Studies;
Faculty of Pharmacy; Department of Political Science; and Community Service
Program. These data provide profiles of the writing that students in a particular
program must do (Anson & Dannels, 2009). For example, we know that stu-
dents in the RN program write 79 assignments in the required courses over the
four years of the program, and we know which genres appear at each year in the
program. The Nursing faculty has found this research to be extremely useful as
a curriculum reform tool, and it has galvanized interest in writing and turned
that interest into specific outcomes: re-written assignments; more and better
scoring guides; workshops for instructors; writing workshops for peer research
groups among the faculty.

                     STRATEGIZING FOR IMPACT

   Much has been accomplished in the short time since the final report of the
Writing Task Force in 2008. The Centre for Writers is established, effective,
and growing. The WAC program teaches thousands of students about writing
in their courses each year. The Writing Studies program has established writing
courses at the University of Alberta. These new programs join the other writing
centres at the university--at Campus Saint Jean, Augustana, and in Student
Services--when we all meet once a month at the University Writing Council
meetings to discuss strategy and coordinate efforts. In addition, a new group
from across the province has been formed for professional development and
to exchange program development news: the Campus Alberta Writing Studies
group meets twice a year. Ultimately, each of these groups draws its funding
from the government of the province of Alberta. Our hope is to coordinate our
efforts in ways that magnify the impact of our individual efforts, from sharing
costs for professional development events to sharing resources that we develop
for our own writing centres.

DEPARTMENT OF

RHETORIC, WRITING, AND

COMMUNICATIONS AT THE

UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG

By Brian Turner and Judith Kearns
University of Winnipeg (Canada)

The University of Winnipeg's Department of Rhetoric, Writing, and
Communications has the distinction of being the first independent
writing program in Canada. Conceived in 1986 as The Writing Pro-
gram, it underwent a review in 1993, separated from the English
Department to become the Centre for Academic Writing, and then
began offering a communications program in partnership with a lo-
cal college. CAW launched a B.A. in Rhetoric and Communications
in 2003; three years later, with fourteen full-time faculty, a writing
centre, and a peer tutoring program, it was granted departmental
status and took its current name. Evolution in our curriculum and
institutional status have demanded compromise. Our chief concerns
have been to strike a balance between rhetoric and writing and meet
two objectives: to provide first-year students with the rhetorical skills
necessary to disciplinary success, and to develop in upper-level students
facilitas--the ability to assess a variety of rhetorical situations and
respond both ethically and effectively.

   With a population of approximately 670,000, the city of Winnipeg--the
name comes from the Cree word win-nipi, meaning "muddy water" --is Can-
ada's seventh largest municipality and home to more than half the residents
of the province of Manitoba. It is located at the geographic centre of North
America and the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers, on a site where
First Nations people met and traded for centuries. After the Hudson's Bay
Company established a strategic post there in the nineteenth century, the re-
gion experienced steady immigration from Europe and neighbouring Ontario.
Residents of the modern city are mostly of European descent and primarily

English-speaking; however, Winnipeg has considerable ethnic diversity, includ-
ing the largest French-speaking community west of Quebec and the highest
proportion (about ten percent) of First Nations people of any Canadian city (
http://www.statscan.gc.ca). The latter also constitute the fastest-growing ethnic
group in the city and province. Improving the access of Aboriginal students
to postsecondary education has consequently become an increasing concern
for the province, one which the recently-established University College of the
North is designed to address.

   Though modest, Manitoba's diversified economy has remained relatively
stable for decades; given its water resources and potential to export hydro-elec-
tricity, the province seems to have a promising future. Particularly noteworthy
is the cultural life of its capital city. In addition to its several theatres, art gallery,
provincial museum, and symphony hall, Winnipeg is home to an internation-
ally recognized ballet company, to the Festival du Voyageur (the largest French
winter carnival west of Quebec), and to large folk, jazz, fringe, film, and writers'
festivals. Two universities and several colleges offer a variety of post-secondary
options. The largest of these institutions is the University of Manitoba, with an
undergraduate and graduate student population of about 26,000.

       The smaller University of Winnipeg is one of the oldest post-secondary
schools in western Canada. It was established as Manitoba College in 1871,
merged with Wesley College in 1938 to become United College, then re-
ceived its charter as a University in 1967. With approximately 9,000 full- and
part-time students, the University has traditionally been an undergradu-
ate institution, rooted in the liberal arts. In recent years, it has undergone a
number of significant changes, including the development of joint programs
with local colleges, several new departments, graduate studies, and a "global
college" that, in the words of our current president, former Canadian Foreign
Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy, aims to "enhance and promote global citizen-
ship in its many dimensions" (http://www.uwinnipegcampaign.ca/academic/
globalcollege).

            HISTORY OF WRITING INSTRUCTION AT
                  THE UNIVERSITY OF WINNIPEG

   The Department of Rhetoric, Writing, and Communications--the academ-
ic unit with primary responsibility for writing instruction at the University of
Winnipeg--has gone through several permutations over the past twenty-some
years. Formally instituted by the university's senate as the Writing Program
in 1986, it began operations the following year as a subdivision of the Eng-

130
                                                                        University of Winnipeg (Canada)

lish Department, with a faculty of seven full-time instructors. It was seen and
sold by administrators as a means of raising retention rates and of helping the
university to improve access for historically under-represented groups. To this
end, the Program relied mainly on a writing centre (equipped with comput-
ers, coordinated by faculty, and staffed by tutors who were meeting the practi-
cum requirements of Education courses); and on two sequenced, pedagogically
eclectic writing courses (part process-oriented, part expressivist, and part cur-
rent-traditional), at least one of which was a requirement for any student who
had graduated high-school with less than an honours standing in English. These
were modest beginnings, certainly, but in Canada, where writing instruction at
most post-secondary institutions was at best limited and first-year composition
courses did not exist (Graves, 1994), the Writing Program garnered national
recognition. In 1992 Canada's best-selling national magazine described it as "a
model for universities across the country" ("Class options," 1992).

   An extensive review of the Writing Program led to the formation of the
Centre of Academic Writing (CAW) in 1995. This second phase marked an im-
portant advance, not only for the curriculum at the University of Winnipeg but
to some extent for the status of post-secondary writing instruction in Canada,
since CAW became the country's first independent writing program. We had a
faculty of ten, all teaching writing and rhetoric courses exclusively. Guided by
two main premises--that our university's heterogeneous population called for a
diversity of approaches, and that our main task was, nonetheless, academic and
disciplinary acculturation--we radically altered and expanded our curriculum.
Students could now meet the writing requirement through a range of introduc-
tory courses (Academic Writing for broad discipline areas, such as the Social
Sciences; courses with a multidisciplinary focus; courses "linked" with intro-
ductory sections in disciplines such as History and Environmental Studies; and
extended courses, primarily for second-language students). CAW also began to
develop a handful of upper-level writing and rhetoric courses.

   With independence came greater institutional status and opportunities
for curricular growth and diversification. In the second half of the decade, we
teamed with a local college to develop a Joint Program in Communications
aimed at students preparing for careers in journalism, advertising, or public
relations. The enthusiastic response to this initiative, which combined a liberal
arts focus with practical training, suggested further potential for communica-
tions studies. Accordingly, after extensive consultation about the kind of pro-
gram that would best fit our faculty, students, and institution, we began in 2003
to deliver a new degree specialization (a "major") in "rhetoric and communica-
tions." Along with several core courses (in rhetorical criticism, professional edit-
ing, communication theory, and research methods), this major offered a variety

                                                                                                131
Turner and Kearns

of theoretical, analytical, and practical courses in writing and rhetoric. Together,
the major and the Joint Program soon drew enough interest to make our stu-
dent enrolment among the university's largest. In 2006, we appealed for and
were granted department status, entering our third phase as the Department
of Rhetoric, Writing, and Communications (re: http://rhetoric.uwinnipeg.ca).

                THE DEPARTMENT OF RHETORIC,
               WRITING, AND COMMUNICATIONS

   Like any historical synopsis, the above account leaves out many complicat-
ing details. The picture it creates of institutional harmony and steady progress
towards departmental independence may be too sunny. It is true that writing
instruction and instructors have been given unusual, even extraordinary sup-
port at the University of Winnipeg, particularly when considered in the context
of Canadian higher education; however, the evolution of the Department of
Rhetoric, Writing, and Communications has not always been smooth, nor has
its current configuration been anything like an historical inevitability (Turner
& Kearns, 2002). The process of becoming a full academic partner has required
negotiations among competing demands, among them disciplinary ideals (i.e.,
"best practices"), institutional constraints, and local exigencies. Our success
notwithstanding, becoming what we are has involved some compromises.

   In what follows, we describe the current state of writing instruction at the
University of Winnipeg--and in the process, consider some of these compro-
mises--by examining three key topics: the focus on instructional delivery from
within the Department of Rhetoric, Writing, and Communications rather than
across the disciplines; the relationship between rhetoric and writing in the De-
partment; and our Writing Centre.

               Writing Instruction: From a Department
                         or Across the Curriculum

   In a 2006 report on trends in Canadian universities, Tanya Smith identifies
three features of strong postsecondary writing instruction: the delivery of at
least one course, early in the undergraduate programs of most students, focused
mainly on academic writing, and of one or more additional writing courses
at an advanced level, with a disciplinary or professional emphasis--in other
words, a writing across the curriculum (WAC) component; a degree specializa-
tion or program devoted to academic or professional writing; and a supportive
institutional culture. We are fortunate to enjoy an element of all three at the

132
                                                                        University of Winnipeg (Canada)

University of Winnipeg, but we have faced some push and pull between the first
and second features, even with institutional support. Commitment to a special-
ized degree program has necessarily reduced our capacity to foster advanced
disciplinary writing instruction and similar WAC initiatives.

   WAC once seemed a viable, even appealing option for the university.
Writing Program and CAW faculty in the late 1980s and the 1990s produced
a newsletter to promote the exchange of information about classroom prac-
tices and discussion of disciplinary rhetorics; we designed research projects on
disciplinary grading practices; and, under the guidance of an interdisciplinary
committee, we mounted writing workshops, arranged visits by prominent
writing specialists, and began to define criteria for writing intensive courses.
Rhetoric became a topic of interest, and colleagues spoke enthusiastically
about "writing to learn." Early success of this kind is, however, difficult to
sustain; attempts to foster WAC must be constantly re-invigorated, as many
scholars have noted. Moreover, coming as they do from outside traditional
departmental structures, such efforts depend heavily on "the individual com-
mitment of faculty members" (Russell, 2009, p. 164). The burden for junior
faculty working in a small Canadian university like ours proved especially
demanding (Kearns & Turner, 1997). We were climbing mountains with-
out much assistance or adequate equipment --struggling simultaneously to
effect institutional change and to begin professional lives that might include
research, even as we worked in a discipline for which we were not trained and
in a country that lacked WAC models, strong national venues for rhet/comp
scholarship, and "a concrete center for scholars to meet and exchange ideas"
(Clary-Lemon, 2009). Tenure was waiting at the peak.

   Professional survival meant that CAW needed to re-invent itself, in ways
that drew more effectively on our strengths. This (and the increasing popularity
of our courses) prompted the decision to design three- and four-year bachelor
of arts degrees in Rhetoric and Communications (not, for instance, "Composi-
tion" or "Writing Studies"). Since most of us had, like the preceding generation
of American compositionists, come to the teaching of writing from the study
of literature,1 it seemed sensible to emphasize courses that bridged the gap be-
tween text analysis and production, using the former as a means of facilitating
the latter (see below). Movement in this direction was to some extent simulta-
neously a movement away from WAC and the constant, concomitant demands
of work-shopping and consultation. Given our theoretical conviction about the
value of WAC, this was, for some of us, a considerable loss.

   But WAC was never abandoned altogether. Our first-year writing courses
remain grounded in WAC principles (the versions of Academic Writing de-
scribed above); and we continue to offer advanced courses such as Commu-

                                                                                                133
Turner and Kearns

nicating Science, Strategies for Technical and Professional Communication,
Professional Style and Editing, and Rhetoric in the Humanities and Social
Sciences, which collectively appeal to students from across the university. It
seems, moreover, that many of our colleagues are still committed to writing. A
recent in-house survey indicates that faculty in nearly all departments (includ-
ing such unlikely sites as math and physics) use writing assignments. Many
report the allocation of class time to writing instruction (e.g., suggesting strate-
gies or showing examples of effective student writing); an awareness of writing
as process (giving opportunities to write multiple drafts, offering feedback on
drafts, facilitating revision through conference and peer response); and the
use of writing-to-learn activities (such as informal, exploratory writing). Our
Writing Centre is also multi-disciplinary, both in the students who come seek-
ing assistance and in the tutors who provide it. In this institution, writing is
not seen as a concern of only the Humanities or the province of an English
Department.

   We suspect that, even without a full-fledged WAC program, the presence of
an independent writing department helps sustain a climate of interest in writ-
ing. But we are aware that efforts of the sort just described may be primarily
a happy consequence of the University of Winnipeg's traditionally small class
sizes. Unfortunately, as in many universities, this is beginning to change, as sev-
eral respondents noted. Indeed, caps for our own first-year writing classes have
risen to 28--well over the number (20) recommended by the (US) National
Council of Teachers of English (NCTE).

   The decline of WAC, and with it the kind of oversight that WAC committees
can provide, may be responsible for one further problem. When the Associate
Dean recently analyzed first-year syllabi in the Arts, a somewhat startling fact
emerged: the amount of writing and the proportion of final grades determined
by writing assignments vary widely from section to section, even within a single
department. Such inequities --certain to be noticed by students at some point,
and rightly so--may undermine the attitudes to writing we are trying to foster.

                           Rhetoric and Writing

   As much as the literature refers companionably to "rhetoric and composi-
tion" (or even "rhet/comp"), the relationship between the two has, in the US,
often been vexed. In the 1970s, one scholar called it "obscure at best" (Douglas,
2009, p. 85); another described it in the 90s as "unstable" (Goggin, 1995). Be-
ing situated in Canada--and, we would add, in geographically isolated Winni-
peg--has had its advantages in this respect. The very lack of a strong disciplin-
ary tradition in writing or speech communication has given us greater license,

134
                                                                        University of Winnipeg (Canada)

making it possible to avoid some of the difficulties faced by American writing
programs, even as we drew heavily on American theory and practice.

   The key terms in our department name suggest our comfort with the rhet/
comp relationship: they are intended to advertise our emphasis on rhetoric even
as they reaffirm our long-standing commitment to writing. Indeed, the Depart-
ment of Rhetoric, Writing, and Communications sees the two as inextricably
linked, and still considers itself a "writing program." All our first-year courses
and almost one third of our upper-level courses focus on academic writing.
Despite differences in specifics, they have a larger common purpose: increas-
ing our students' rhetorical awareness of academic and/or disciplinary styles,
genres, and epistemic criteria in order to improve their own writing processes
and written products.

   In this sense, consistent with the classical tradition of "hermeneutical rheto-
ric" (Leff, 1997), a concern for student writing is also deeply embedded in
the remaining two-thirds of our department's upper-level courses. In these,
interpretive analysis and theory are not ends in themselves but a means "to
enhance the reader's inventional skills as writer and speaker" (Leff, 1997, p.
199). Moreover, consistent with the tradition of small, liberal arts universities,
we see the goal of enhanced inventional skills in broad, civic terms rather than
discipline-specific or professional terms (Turner & Kearns, 2002). One of our
main goals is to develop what Quintilian called facilitas--the ability to assess
any rhetorical situation and respond appropriately, which is to say both effec-
tively and ethically. For this reason, the focus of our rhetoric courses is as likely
to be non-academic as academic discourses. Students may, for instance, analyze
new journalism, nature essays, or magazine writing with the goal of produc-
ing a piece of their own; they may develop a communications strategy for an
institution; or they may work with community organizations to produce other
practical, "real-world" texts for a variety of audiences. 2

                                Peer Tutoring

   The presence of student supports for writing is a feature we share with most
Canadian universities. In fact, the ubiquity of writing centres in Canadian uni-
versities led many to think that our former name, "the Centre for Academic
Writing," represented a unit offering primarily tutorial assistance rather than
credit courses and degree programs. That our writing centre has operated under
the aegis of a department rather than within Student Services or the library, as is
common elsewhere, has made all the difference: it has allowed faculty dedicated
to writing to guide its evolution--not administrators, who often have quite dif-
ferent ideas about what such programs can and should do.

                                                                                                135
Turner and Kearns

   This has not, of course, meant complete autonomy. But it has meant a con-
siderable degree of independence, allowing us to fund the writing centre se-
curely and at the same time implement efficiencies that take disciplinary ideals
into account. Originally, for instance, centre administration and the teaching of
tutors required the time of two instructors; when we created a permanent staff
position for the Computer Writing Lab, we not only freed up faculty time but
also gained technological expertise and more efficient management of tutoring
appointments. The decision to rely on paid tutoring also resulted in greater ef-
ficiency and helped compensate for the diminishment of WAC. At one time,
the opportunity to tutor was available only to students taking an array of practi-
cum courses, an arrangement that reduced our pool of tutors to Education and
English students, prioritized the learning of the tutor over the learning of the
tutee, limited tutoring time available to a few weeks each term (usually, Fall
and Winter terms only), and drew heavily on department teaching resources.
Combining paid tutoring with much shorter preparation courses opened the
door to a wider range of students (including those in requirement-heavy science
programs), increased tutoring hours, and significantly reduced the demands on
faculty time. As a result, we now attract peer tutors from across the disciplines,
well-prepared to address the diversity of student need (two-thirds of those who
come to the Centre have been referred by colleagues in other departments).
One faculty member alone is responsible for teaching, hiring, and supervising
tutors and for what we might call "public relations": asking our colleagues to
let good writers know about tutoring opportunities, weak students about op-
portunities for help, and keeping them well-informed about the principles and
benefits of peer tutoring.

         THE CURRENT STATE OF THE DEPARTMENT
                      AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

   The Department now has a full-time faculty of fourteen. Six are instruc-
tors, with no contractual obligation to publish. For them, the development of
a major has been professionally invigorating, providing new opportunities for
research as they prepare for advanced courses. For the eight of us in the profes-
soriate, teaching new courses has been similarly invigorating, and so too has
teaching students who share our passion for rhetoric and composition. But just
as important is that we have been relieved of the constant work of inventing a
place for ourselves in the institution, now that independence, departmental sta-
tus, and the major are faits accomplis. The result has been accelerated research
productivity: we are publishing on visual rhetoric, journalism, gay and lesbian

136
                                                                        University of Winnipeg (Canada)

studies, critical pedagogy, literacy and social action, texting, the history of writ-
ing instruction, and composition--among other things. One of our newest
colleagues was recently appointed editor of Composition Studies.

   As a junior department, we may yet face obstacles from which other depart-
ments are generally exempt. While it is true that our tenure applications now
proceed without undue complication, every one of our professoriate remains
at the rank of assistant or associate professor. Indeed, to this point no one has
applied for full professorship--partly because research productivity has been
attenuated by the burdens described earlier, and partly (the authors suspect)
because the experiences of our earliest tenure candidates has made some of us
gun-shy (see Turner & Kearns, 2002). It seems that departmental status has
been accompanied by greater respect within the university, and that colleagues
from other departments appraise our work as they would their own. But when
the time comes for our first application for promotion to professor, we will
await the results with some trepidation.

   The most recent initiative in the Department is a proposal for a graduate
studies program, with a focus on rhetoric, writing, and public life. Its status
remains uncertain, as does the status of grad studies generally at the Univer-
sity of Winnipeg; resources are an issue, as always, but so too are concerns that
such a shift may undermine the university's real strengths, which lie in un-
dergraduate education. There has also been talk of an undergraduate program
in journalism. The authors feel some ambivalence, mainly for fear that such
initiatives also risk over-taxing our resources. Yet re-invention of this kind
may also prove again to be a stimulus to faculty, and in the case of Grad Stud-
ies, constitute another important step in the progress of writing and rhetoric
studies in Canada.

                                    NOTES

1. The proportion of degrees in English literature has been subsequently reduced, but
it remains the case that most of us were trained in text analysis of some kind and learned
to teach writing largely "on the job." Of eight PhDs, three are in English literature;
three are in English with a focus on rhetoric (two from Canada, with a focus on rhetoric
and/or text analysis, and one from the US, in rhet/comp); one is in rhetoric and profes-
sional writing (also from an American university); and one is in Education with a focus
on cultural studies and critical pedagogy. Our most recent appointment at the instruc-
tor level has an MA in Communication Studies.

2. The meaning of our third key term, communications, is rather harder to explain.
Since it refers to the dimension of our department that has the least to do with writing,

                                                                                                137

we've chosen not to grapple with it here. For a discussion of the difference between
Communication Studies in Canada and the US, see Brent (2006).

XI'AN INTERNATIONAL

STUDIES UNIVERSITY (XISU,

)

By Wu Dan 
Humboldt College at Xi'an International Studies University
(China)

This essay introduces writing practice and related research conducted
at Xi'an International Studies University (XISU), Shaanxi, China.
As a university with foreign languages being the major disciplines,
writing has been in the center of faculty teaching and student learn-
ing. Although the emphasis is more on language acquisition than on
"writing-to-learn" concepts, writing practice and research have been
the traditions here. With all the resources and possibilities provided by
international collaborations, a majority of them being with US-based
universities, XISU set up the first writing center in China, which has
been housed in the School of English Studies and operated quite dif-
ferently from writing centers in the US. This introduction of the US
originated writing center concept and practice is among the new waves
that XISU has contributed to higher education in China, as this model
has begun to be adopted by a number of other institutions nationwide.

                            THE INSTITUTION

   Xi'an International Studies University (XISU), formerly Xi'an Foreign
Language University, was founded in 1952 as one of the first four foreign-
language institutions of the People's Republic of China. It is located in Xi'an
City, Shaanxi Province, with three campuses totaling 263 acres. XISU remains
the only higher education institution in northwestern China that has all ma-
jor foreign languages. XISU was accredited to award master's degrees in 1986,
and in February, 2010, the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council
approved the PhD program application of XISU and granted three years for

preparation before recruiting PhD students. The university also publishes three
academic journals on foreign language education and human geography.

   The major disciplines in XISU used to be only foreign languages, but now
the university has been transformed to offer 39 undergraduate majors and seven
minors in humanities, arts, social sciences, law, business management, educa-
tion, and science. There are altogether 891 faculty members. The current enroll-
ment is about 26,000, with half being undergraduate students and the other
half graduate students, international students, and students in various training

   Writing takes place in all disciplines and majors. Writing occurs in Chinese
and English, as described below, as well as in the various other languages stu-
dents take. Thesis writing is the last requirement for their four-year undergradu-
ate study. They also write in administrative-related activities, such as filling out
forms for their academic study, writing reports or proposals for student societies
and interest groups, and communicating in such personal forms as e-mails,
mobile phone texting, instant messaging, and blogs.

   Foreign language education is the unique characteristic of this institution
that appeals to students and parents, and the language(s) these students write in
depend on their disciplines: students in different language departments write in
both Chinese and the target languages they choose to specialize in. All students
also write in English, the required foreign language for all majors. In all of the
language-related majors, there are writing courses with emphasis on language
skills. In lower-level courses, short papers or compositions are embedded in
reading courses as response to the class content or as part of quizzes or exams. In
upper-level courses, a final paper (in the target language) is often required at the
end of the semester for final evaluation or as a supplement to the quizzes/exams.

   English majors need to choose another foreign language to study; therefore,
they also write in another foreign language in this part of their training, but
with limited vocabulary and length due to the limited time devoted to this
"second foreign language." In some courses such as College Chinese (focused
mainly on literature), College Ethics, and Political Science, which are required
for all majors, the professors normally require a final paper or an essay exam at
the end of the semester; as the instruction of these courses is in Chinese, stu-
dents write the papers and take the exams in Chinese, too.

   Students write in Chinese for administrative-related activities. Student orga-
nizations always need to write proposals, plans, and reports on their activities.

These writing practices are in Chinese. Student organization leaders have more
opportunities to practice their Chinese writing, and consequently their Chinese
writing skills and other communication skills, such as speaking and giving pre-
sentations, are generally more satisfactory than those of other students. In the
foreign-language-related clubs and student societies or interest groups, students
write and speak in the language they choose for their activities. However, par-
ticipation in these extra-curricular activities is voluntary, so not all students get
a chance to practice their writing in these settings.

   Foreign language education gives XISU tradition and prestige. Language
teachers always pay much attention to writing, although sometimes they pay
much more attention to accuracy and skills training rather than to the functions
of writing in knowledge building and social construction. Almost all professors
in language majors care about the improvement of student writing, and some of
the faculty members in other disciplines have started to integrate more writing
assignments into their courses.

   However, because the main purpose for using writing has always been to
evaluate students' learning, writing is still considered an assessment tool rather
than a learning tool. Because a majority of the administrators of XISU have
been promoted from professors in these disciplines, they also care about student
writing. The most representative example of their commitment is the establish-
ment of the Writing Center for English Majors in 2006, which was made pos-
sible by Dr. Hu Sishe, a French professor and President of XISU.

               INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS
                     AND THE WRITING CENTER

   The Writing Center at XISU is the first writing center in China. At present,
it is dedicated to English writing. The establishment was largely due to a long-
standing exchange program between XISU and Bowling Green State Univer-
sity, Ohio, US (BGSU), that began in 1985. Both of the universities have been
sending one or two professors each year to study or teach in the other institu-
tion. The majority of the professors sent to BGSU by XISU have been English
professors, and they were sponsored to conduct their two-year master's study in
BGSU. All of the BGSU participants have taught English courses in XISU, in
areas such as writing, speaking, reading, literature, and American culture.

   There are two recent highlights of this exchange. First, Dr. William Coggin
conducted a semester-long scientific and technical communication workshop
for English faculty members in fall 2004. This was the first workshop of its
kind in mainland China and started a new chapter for the exchange program,

                                                                                                141

as three of the faculty participants in this workshop ended up studying in the
MA program in Scientific and Technical Communication in the English De-
partment of BGSU, which helped in forming an incomparable and promising
faculty basis for possible technical communication courses in XISU. At the
same time, Dr. Coggin taught a graduate seminar on technical communication
to a class of students in the master's program in English studies.

   The second highlight was the establishment of the Writing Center at XISU.
Dr. Hu visited BGSU as part of a trip to the US in 2006. He was invited to
visit the BGSU Writing Center and was convinced that this concept would be
very beneficial to student learning and would help EFL (English as a Foreign
Language) students in XISU. Thus, in 2006, XISU became the first university
in mainland China to open a Writing Center. A second center has since opened
(June 2010) at Zhejiang University.

   The XISU Writing Center was built on the American model used by BGSU,
but with its own characteristics. The Writing Center operates under the ad-
ministration of the School of English Studies, but without a budget or staff
members. As there has not been a systematic graduate assistantship program
in Chinese higher education institutions by which to hire graduate students to
work for departments, this writing center is run by volunteer faculty members.
The first group of tutors was trained in XISU by Dr. Barbara Toth, Assistant
Director of the BGSU Writing Center, in summer 2006. The following groups
of tutors did not receive formal training as writing center tutors, but most of
them are English professors teaching writing courses to different levels. Their
participation is indeed voluntary, as they only get a very small amount of com-
pensation, which should rather be regarded as a token of their contribution.
Each semester, the Writing Center recruits interested professors to tutor a num-
ber of sessions according to their schedules; only because of the support and
sacrifice of the professors can the Writing Center continue to serve the needs of
the students. The tutoring group has been changing over these several years, but
the passion for and devotion to student writing has remained.

   Because there are no staff members, every week the Writing Center Director
posts available sessions on the door of the office. Students then sign up for ap-
pointments by filling their names on the posted session table. Each session lasts
30 minutes, during which the student and the professor talk about the piece of
writing brought in for improvement. Some of the pieces have been written for
assignments in the courses, but the professors have found an increasing portion
of overseas graduate school applications and job application materials, such as
CVs, personal statements, and writing samples. As this is an English writing
center, the students who come are mainly from the School of English Studies.
Each semester, there are always several students who come to the center quite

142

frequently, as they have found the service very helpful after trying it at the be-
ginning of the semester. Some of them even have preferred professors to work
with, so they particularly pick the sessions that these professors facilitate.

   However, research and publication about this writing center have been lim-
ited by the fact that the director and other professors who work as tutors are
full-time teachers. They do not have time to think about designing studies or
collecting data from their practice in the center. Furthermore, none of these
professors has received training in composition studies; most of them are either
literature or linguistics specialists. Therefore, it is difficult for them to connect
their practice with the theories or practices in composition and writing center
studies without proper guidance or sufficient research interests. Another reason
is that writing center practice has not yet been discovered by most Chinese
higher education institutions, thus making it difficult for the research to find
outlets in the journals published in China.

   Although it has been a great success to have this writing center run without
a budget for five years since its establishment, this condition will greatly impede
its development and related research. And it would be very difficult to include
attention to student writing in other languages, if there is no appropriate and
healthy operation that is powered by research.

             WRITING RESEARCH AND EXCHANGES

   Improvement in student writing has been an objective in various language
courses in all the languages departments, but it has not been stated as an objec-
tive of the overall curriculum. Faculty members discuss writing in the disci-
plines, but not much "across disciplines" practice or discussion has happened.
There is no general education program in most of the Chinese higher education
institutions, so there is little incentive for professors from different disciplines
to come together to talk about teaching. The boundaries between the disci-
plines are clearly drawn, and upon entering the university the students start
their study in the disciplines they choose to specialize in.

   One exception to this pattern in XISU is the business school, in which Busi-
ness English professors discuss student writing and their teaching of writing
with business or management professors, as their curriculum is a combination
of both fields. Therefore, although the faculty members are from the different
disciplines of English and business, they have exchanges on writing because
they work for the same school and the same group of students. However, this
close relationship of two or more disciplines cannot be easily found in other
schools.

                                                                                                143

   Language professors put emphasis on writing because writing is regarded as
one of the language skills for their students, but they do not really conceptualize
writing as a tool to enhance learning and critical thinking, although the learn-
ing of languages is indeed improved through writing. Instead, the emphasis
on writing has been promoted as "practice makes perfect." Professors in other
disciplines employ writing assignments as evaluation tools and consider them as
"by-products" of their courses, not as "writing to learn," as writing researchers
would think of it. However, this seemingly "naïve" emphasis on and attention
to writing has been passed down through generations of language teachers and
should serve as a very solid foundation for introducing WAC (Writing-Across-
the-Curriculum) research and practice. This lack of association of writing with
learning is not a rejection of the concept, but simply evidence that WAC has
not been introduced into China yet.

   An example from a recent study (Wu, 2010) on faculty perceptions of stu-
dent communication skills illustrates this point very well. One of the partici-
pants was a professor of international laws in XISU. He studied and conducted
research in the US and was influenced by the writing components his professors
used in their courses. He found these writing components very helpful for him
in understanding and learning the course content, so he decided to practice in
his own courses after he returned to XISU. However, he was distressed because
his students complained about these "extra" writing assignments in their course
evaluations and some of them even plagiarized by using documents download-
ed from the Internet. He was so disappointed that he said he would not recom-
mend this pedagogy to other professors, but he also said that he still wanted to
try it by making adjustments to the assignments. This example illustrates the
faculty interest in adopting and adapting educational innovations like WAC
into their courses for better teaching and learning. However, it also warns that
faculty interest can become faculty resistance if no proper support is provided.

   Another reason why XISU or similar institutions would be such a good
entry point for WAC research is that faculty and students in the languages dis-
ciplines, especially English, are the gatekeepers of writing research and practice.
Many of the graduates of XISU are now middle school teachers or professors
themselves, as education is the major career path for the students. Therefore, the
introduction of WAC into XISU would not only benefit the current students
but also the students of the students. XISU students will not only learn better
through "writing to learn," but also will become "changing agents" and make
the learning experience better for their students.

   The majority of the current writing research in China has been done by
linguistics professors. Some of the major studies are on ESL writing with focus
on linguistic corpus (Yang, 2000) and China English (Du & Jiang, 2001), and

144
                                                         Xi'an International Studies University (China)

the theoretical influences primarily come from Michael Halliday (1973), Noam
Chomsky (1986), and Graeme Kennedy (1998).

   A major achievement for English writing instruction and research is the
National Award for Excellent Courses in 2009. The writing program in the
School of English Studies at XISU was given this prestigious recognition for
their efforts since 1984. Dr. Yang Dafu is the primary investigator and professor
for this project, and Professor Guo Fenrong, the current Director of the Writ-
ing Center, is also a member of this research and teaching group. Also cited was
a project funded by the Ministry of Education on the quality of English MA
thesis writing in China and strategies to improve it. This project was started in
2009 and is still in progress; it is hoped that the results will be made available
to colleagues in other countries.

       The School of English Studies has also started another exchange pro-
gram, with Raymond Walters College of the University of Cincinnati, Ohio,
and has been sending professors both to conduct research and to teach writing
courses there. This exchange program helps to build a better basis for under-
standing US rhetoric and composition; this better understanding has begun
to influence XISU classrooms through a project funded by Shaanxi Province
that focuses on renovating the curriculum for English majors from separate
reading and writing courses to an integrated course with both writing and
reading components. This curriculum experiment has gone on for two years
in the School of English Studies, and the primary investigator, Dr. Dafu Yang,
has collaborated with several colleagues toward reporting the results in an
international conference. This goal was realized in February 2011, at the Writ-
ing Research Across Borders Conference (Fairfax, Virginia, US), the first time
that writing research in XISU has been shared with the international writing
research community.

   International exchanges have pervasive influence on writing practice and
research in XISU. However, researchers at XISU are finding that our research
should not be limited to sharing with colleagues in China; the international re-
search community might also benefit from these studies. Hopefully, challenges
such as lack of budget and lack of information on research resources will not
impede these exchanges; the unique research being carried out here in XISU
needs to be available to all who are interested in writing and its development.

TRAINING EXPERIENCES IN
READING AND WRITING IN A
COLOMBIAN UNIVERSITY: THE
PERSPECTIVE OF A PROFESSOR

By Elizabeth Narváez Cardona
Universidad Autónoma de Occidente (Colombia)

This paper emerges from the author's trajectory as a professor and re-
searcher in the Reading and Writing field at a Colombian University.
The study features three institutional experiences: teaching reading and
writing in a course of professional training; a training proposal for
professors; and training for beginning researchers as writers. The reflec-
tion on the pedagogic actions and tensions that emerged shows that
the initiatives and trajectories of such experiences are derived from
professional efforts of teaching and researching. Although these experi-
ences are not necessarily dependant on institutional policies, it is evi-
dent that the professional connection between researching and didactic
formation strengthens the existence and visibility of initiatives in the
context of a South American university.

                             BRIEF CONTEXT

   A review of the research literature on reading and writing in Colombia shows
clearly that students need to become academic and professional writers.1 The
curricular policy at universities is for students to attend one or two courses on
reading and writing only at the beginning of their education, in order to address
unresolved issues that remain from education prior to university. The review
shows that the theoretical perspectives that support teaching in these courses
comes from the language sciences, specifically textual linguistics and analysis
of discourse, as traditional research has come from these areas of knowledge.
These courses run from16 to 18 weeks; the textual production of argumentative
papers is encouraged, mainly essays. The activities are organized from a psycho-

linguistic perspective: this means that a text is planned, drafts are checked, and
the last draft is edited (Rincon, Narváez & Perez, 2009).

   In this context stands the Universidad Autónoma de Occidente, which was
founded as the Corporacion Universitaria in 1969 with undergraduates in Eco-
nomics and Industrial, Electrical, and Mechanical Engineering. In the 1980s
it opened undergraduate courses in Social Communications and Electronic
Engineering. With the Development Plan created in the 1990s, the institu-
tion expanded its functions and, from 2003, it holds the academic charter of a
university.2

   The author of this chapter is a professor and researcher from the Languages
Department, which was consolidated in 2004 in the Social Communications
Faculty. She has recently completed the project entitled "Pedagogy and Didac-
tics of Reading and Writing in Higher Education" as a member of an Education
research group. Her duality as teacher and researcher in the university context
has allowed her to develop three training experiences: i) teaching reading and
writing in the Social Communications undergraduate course; ii) a training pro-
posal for professors; and, iii) training for beginner researchers as writers. This
paper presents the characteristics of these experiences, the pedagogical steps
carried out, and tensions that emerged. Reflective analysis of these experiences
reveals the characteristics of educational programs that exist within the distinc-
tive framework of a Colombian university.

      TEACHING READING AND WRITING IN A SOCIAL
      COMMUNICATIONS UNDERGRADUATE COURSE

   In the course "Language," a theoretical foundation compulsory for training
in Social Communication, it was decided to teach the students to "trust" the
theoretical documents and encourage the need to use them in order to directly
understand the authors, instead of working with the professor's oral discourse.
The experience was developed during 2008 and 2009. It was supported by the
teachers' academic background in language science, and their research in read-
ing and writing in college and didactic understanding as a field of action, re-
searching, and theorizing in teaching and learning (Camps, 2001).

     The subject is taken between the third and fourth semesters3 and it can
be taken after a course on reading and writing. If the course is passed, students
are able to enroll in Semiotics 1 and Semiotics 2. The frequency of class is two
hours a week. The course introduces students to a reflection on linguistics as
part of the theoretical foundation of human communication and its complexi-
ties. It employs the following practices in reading and writing:

148
                                                      Universidad Autónoma de Occidente (Colombia)

   1. The reading chapters assigned to the students are accompanied by a
       guide with explanations which the professor added to the author's ideas.
       It is an explanatory and supporting resource for reading as an assignment
       outside of the classroom. For example, a thought in the first chapter
       of "Nature of the Linguistic Sign" by Ferdinand de Saussure says: "(...)
       some people regard language, when reduced to its elements as a naming-
       process only--a list of words (...)." This passage has an addition by the
       professor which says: "Attention, What is Saussure implying with `Lan-
       guage is not a LIST OF WORDS'?"

   2. The ideas which are read in documents have to be used in the written
       explanations in cases related with social communication; for example,
       questions like "how would the pragmatic theory explain the title that
       the journalist chose for this piece of news?" The analysis of the answers
       during the class requires a re-read of the documents and also discussion.

   3. The written explanations of the cases are supported by literal quotes from
       the chapters already read. To help students do this, in class, fragments
       of the documents are re-read in which the intellectual positions of the
       authors are evident.

   4. The explanations written by students are evaluated among those in the
       classroom. The assignments with successful and problematic features are
       photocopied and distributed (without including the students' names),
       listing conceptual strengths and weaknesses related to theory as well as
       the manner in which to write about it.

   5. The lack of understanding and misinterpretation of the ideas during class
       or in the written explanations are respected. During the revision work-
       shops, the teacher underlines the problematic statements but does not
       cross them out, and instead asks the students questions that help them
       clarify and re-write the idea. All the written assignments, including the
       tests, can be re-written. That is why grading is done early in the process,
       starting with evaluation indicators previously presented to the students.

   6. Re-reading and re-writing give the students the capability to question
       the authors and propose, on their behalf, possible alternatives.

   The process achieved in the students the capability to identify misinterpreta-
tions in their writing; through the re-reading of their texts and chapters with
two purposes: one, to make clear the inconsistencies in their drafting and, the
other, to defend their explanations with literal quotes, they became conscious
of the conceptual process achieved.

   This experience shows that in the practice of reading and writing for con-
ceptual learning, chaos and confusion are conditions typical of a discontinuous
process in the clarifying of thinking. For this reason, the effect can be exhaus-

                                                                                                149

tion and a desire to abandon the task (Carlino, 2006; Castelló, 2007; Perry,
1996). This explains some of the opinions expressed4 by the students that show,
on the one hand, the recognition of writing as a necessary and constitutive step
in the process of comprehension of what was read. One student stated that in
this subject they wrote because "writing an idea is much more complicated
than saying it;" on the other hand, given that degree of difficulty, some of the
students recognized the conflictive emotional dimension of the process: "it is
boring but at the same time interesting since one goes through moments of
intense desperation, rage, and relaxation."

   For some students, in addition to realizing that reading and writing helped
them to understand the way they were learning, the effort made was related to
their development as academic individuals, as expressed by one of the students:
"yes, I have learned, since I have understood a theorist's writing and how to take
it apart and explain some phenomena from those perspectives. That is good for,
in the future, facing other more complex theoretical positions that help me to
progress in a study area."

   However, for others, the experience did not have any relation to their iden-
tity as professionals: "regarding the way of reading and writing, I think that it is
good, but I do not believe that to write in this way for a social communicator
is the most appropriate." Effectively, this last student was right, if professional
writing (Morales & Cassany, 2008) is understood as the process and the written
products inherent to the performance of the professions; in the case of social
communicators, for example the journalist writing news, opinion articles, or
chronicles, writing practice differs from the academic genres such as reviews
and scientific articles.

                TRAINING UNIVERSITY TEACHERS

   The command of discipline by university teachers is a very important condi-
tion; however, it is not sufficient for the practice of teaching in higher educa-
tion. The graduate and research background the teacher holds is a plus and
might contribute, but it does not suffice in preparing teachers to design and
respond to reading and writing assignments (Narváez & Cadena, 2009).

   Consequently, a research and training project5 was developed. It included a
program of teachers' training about academic reading and writing in the universi-
ty context. The research teachers also designed and led this experimental program;
they conducted it as a study using educational action research methodology.

   An open call for teachers interested in the training and study within the in-
stitution was made once the proposal was completed. The response was from a

150
                                                      Universidad Autónoma de Occidente (Colombia)

group of teachers who belonged to the schools of Administrative and Economic
Sciences, Engineering, and Social Communication. The teachers attended the
activities during their private time for the duration of two months. The objec-
tives of the proposal were:

   1. To understand that academic reading is a process of constructing mean-
       ing from the documents assigned to support the learning, and the read-
       ing process shows specificities that are not addressed during the students'
       previous educational stage.

   2. To question the idea that a large bibliography and numerous reading ac-
       tivities will by themselves increase the quality of the specialized learning
       and knowledge of a specific field.

   3. To recognize that the assigned papers for academic reading in university
       learning are specialized texts due to the complexity of their structure and
       the conceptual content which characterizes them.

   The educational program showed the necessity of recognizing the value of
academic reading as a practice interwoven with questioning and the oral and
written conversation. For this reason, some activities were designed to place the
teachers as beginners in the field of academic reading, as they tried to under-
stand readings outside their disciplinary or professional areas.

   During the first month of work, we conducted a guided group reading activ-
ity with discussion about two documents. The first document6 presented a per-
spective opposed to this educational experience, in which university students'
difficulties with reading and writing were blamed on "doubtful" training from
basic education. The group expressed opinions about these assertions, some
positive, some negative.

   Subsequently, a second document7 was assigned. It showed the position de-
fended in the experience and argued in support of explicit attention to reading
and writing skills in the university. In order to analyze both arguments, we
asked the teachers to complete a conceptual map during a workshop. Subse-
quently, the teachers were asked to write about how they used the reading in
their subject and to compare their practices with the arguments identified. Fi-
nally, participants were assigned to compare the positions of the documents
with those of the participants and to discuss why and how readings of non-
field-specific texts had been used.

   The teachers who participated in the study identified the reading conditions
that were useful to the "foreigners" in a specific field:

   1. while the amount of reading diminishes, the time devoted to discussion
       increases;

   2. students need to become aware of opposing arguments presented in the
       literature;

                                                                                                151
Narváez

   3. there should be guides with explicit questions that help the re-reading
       and conversation, as well as the contrast with personal experiences;

   4. there should be direct confrontation with beliefs of the "foreigners" in
       the field.

   The analysis of the collected audio and video data, as well as the building up
of field diaries, showed that the planning and development of the first stage of
the study influenced the teachers' beliefs, but that they still did not know how
to transform "what is done" with the reading in the classroom; in other words,
the teachers seemed to agree on the fact that there was "something" that had to
be changed in the development of their subjects. However, they did not know
how to do it. Therefore, this two-month study with eight in-class hours should be
extended and needs support by institutional policy to make time in the teachers´
working schedules; policy should also ensure that other activities can be carried

THE EDUCATION OF YOUNG RESEARCHERS AS WRITERS

   As part of the program "School of Student Researchers" at the Universidad
Autónoma de Occidente, educational experiences organized in three modules
are being developed. One of the modules is academic reading and writing,
which lasts 22 in-class hours and is developed in 11 two-hour sessions, a session
per week, all during an academic semester. The students participate in this pro-
gram voluntarily; it bears no addition to the enrollment fee, they may belong
to different undergraduate -night and daytime- academic programs, and they
may be in different stages of their professional training. The module offers the
participants activities which allow them to put forward some of the reading and
writing processes related to the formulation of a research problem (Narváez,
2009). Practices of reading and writing are developed in the following activities:

   1. Identifying the academic quality criteria to be used for creating
       bibliographies.

   2. Comparing introductions of various scientific articles in order to help
       students develop writing models for the proposal of a research problem.

   3. Critically and meticulously revising each paragraph of scientific article
       introductions published in indexed magazines in order to anticipate read-
       ing and writing processes that precede the writing of a research problem.

   4. Performing workshops in close reading of academic documents. This
       analysis is carried out in three ways: identifying the author(s)'s argu-
       ments; recognizing their attitude, audience, and purposes; and criti-

152

       cally commenting to highlight ideas that were interesting and difficult,
       whether or not these are shared with the author.
   Our study of this training thus far shows that those students who have al-
ready begun enrollment in research groups in order to carry out actual projects
get more out of these structured activities than do those who have not yet be-
come involved in their own research.

             WHAT DO THESE EXPERIENCES SHOW?

   The first experience, teaching reading and writing in a Social Communica-
tions undergraduate course, was based on the ability of a professor to recognize
students as academic individuals in their training. For that reason the collective
practice of reading in depth was introduced, rewriting was encouraged, and the
teacher was obliged to co-evaluate so as to grade the learning. In institutional
contexts in which the amount of information conveyed is evaluated as primary
indicator of teaching quality, maintaining this type of experience is a challenge,
as it decreases the number of issues to be addressed in a course, but increases
the amount of time spent focusing on understanding and teaching the difficult
construction of meaning through writing. Documenting these efforts, however,
is a way to defend their presence and impact.

   To support these kinds of experience, study should focus on how these activ-
ities lead to understanding the contents in a course and to knowledge in read-
ing and academic writing. Such studies would be useful also in the process of
university teacher training to help foster such enhanced learning. Also emerging
from our study of this first experience is the value of considering the curricular
distinction between courses that deal with the training of writers as academic
professionals or scientists and those that focus on the written practices and
genres of interaction with enterprises or companies. In one case, research genres
would be the focus (e.g., research projects, presentations, posters), whereas the
second case would feature business genres (e.g., technical reports, projects for
bids, executive letters).

   Regarding the second experience, the training of teachers in different sub-
ject areas, our study found remarkable power in the consolidation of collegiate
teams. The interaction between teachers of disciplinary and professional fields
and the language teachers was essential to our discussion of the diverse teach-
ing practices with reading and writing. Otherwise, we could not have analyzed
what is viable, possible, and pertinent in these diverse university classrooms.
However, to keep these efforts will depend on the strengthening of institutional

                                                                                                153

policies that treat as a priority the training of university teachers in an interdis-
ciplinary way.

   From the last study, the education of young researchers as writers, it is evi-
dent that training in the skills of reading and writing as part of the research pro-
cess in the university setting is necessary. However, the impact of such training
will differ depending on the public who would be the target, and so different
kinds of training are necessary. One case is researchers who already belong to
scientific and technical communities;8 another is junior researchers. The analy-
sis of this last study with undergraduate students shows that impact is greater
when participants are linked to actual research processes in which academic
writing is imperative.

   In short, these three experiences have arisen from the initiative of the author
of this chapter and colleagues more than from any institutional policy that fa-
vored them. They were made possible by the conjunction between two features
of their own professional training: on the one hand, an interest in research
in academic writing and, on the other hand, the interest in the didactic field
as a discipline that studies relations between teaching and learning in specific
contexts. The intersection of these two interests enabled the development of
these rare experiences, which often are not supported in the context of South
American universities.

your own reading and writing experience in this subject, answer: 1. What did you read
and write in this subject? 2. Do you think you have learned "something new" about
how to read and write in college? What is that useful for? 3. What is your opinion about
the way reading and writing is done in this subject? Is that way of doing it useful for a
social communicator? Justify your answer."

THE PROGRESSION AND

TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE

PROGRAM OF ACADEMIC

READING AND WRITING

(PLEA) IN COLOMBIA'S

UNIVERSIDAD SERGIO

ARBOLEDA

Blanca Yaneth González Pinzón
Universidad Sergio Arboleda (Colombia)

This profile essay describes the evolution and current structure of the
Program of Academic Reading and Writing (PLEA) at the Sergio Ar-
boleda University in Bogota: from its inception in the 1980s as the
"Grammar Program" to its current status as a two-semester compulsory
course focused on university-level academic reading and writing. It
also presents the most important results of the investigation conducted
to recognize learning by the students in this first-year course of study,
and the evaluation of this Program conducted among teachers of these
courses and teachers of other subjects. New aspects of PLEA since the
assessment, to extend the reach of the Program to higher-level students
and to faculty in disciplines, are also described. The profile concludes by
noting the first Colombian national conference on reading and writ-
ing in higher education and the formation of REDLEES, the Reading
and Writing in Higher Education Network for Colombia.

             THE BEGINNINGS AND DEVELOPMENT
                            OF THE PROGRAM

   In the second semester of 2004, the directors of the Universidad Sergio
Arboleda, with the support of a CERLALC consultant (CERLALC: Region-

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2012.0346.2.14                           157

al Center for the Promotion of Books in Latin America and the Caribbean),
proposed to expand the university language program's initial objectives.1 Since
its creation in 1984, the Program had followed a purely normative approach.
Through a resolution of the Rector, a department was created with the goal of
working on the issues of university reading and writing. Tutors were contracted
to meet these new objectives. They were specialists in Language (10) and Phi-
losophy (1); most had experience working with high school students.

   Given that, at the time, there was scarce literature in Colombia about uni-
versity level reading and writing, the Program drew on pedagogical approaches
from various authors who have extensively discussed the topic at the primary
and secondary school level. As is the case with many other institutional propos-
als, the Program's work to address concerns about student performance began
with providing a single course of study. This approach has been questioned
by many authors in diverse contexts (Carlino, 2005; González, 2010; Russell,
1995; Winsor, 1999); however, in 2004 it was seen as the most appropriate
strategy.

   The Program kept its original name, Grammar Program, from 2004 to 2006,
and was scheduled to offer a course to first-year students from all the univer-
sity's academic majors. During the first years of the Program's implementation,
its main difficulty was finding harmony between the old normative-focused
position of the department and the new communications-based approach that
timidly showed its inclination towards professional and disciplinary texts.

   From 2007 to 2009, this course was called Grammar - Academic Reading
and Writing; since 2010: Academic Reading and Writing (LEA). The Depart-
ment now is called PLEA (Program of Academic Reading and Writing).

   It has been compulsory for students and makes up the basic training level
of all the university's majors. While students are free to take the course at any
point during their professional training in the university, the majority of majors
put the course in the list of classes to be taken during the student's first year.

   The course is two semesters long, one level per semester, meeting four hours
per week (two hours per two sessions). The course uses a workshop format,
wherein teachers provide a lecture at the beginning of the session, and then
students do individual work in four basic areas: reading, writing, spelling, and
formal aspects of language. In some assessment sessions, students work in pairs
or in groups to self-evaluate and give each other feedback. Each class has no
more than thirty students that come from the different majors.

   Given that in Colombia there is an accreditation system (that is, students
receive a set number of credits or certifications of approval per course), the LEA
course gives two credits for having theory and practice (each academic course
can provide no more than three credits). To receive these credits, students must

158
                                                                Universidad Sergio Arboleda (Colombia)

attend 56 to 64 hours per course level and demonstrate the same amount of
autonomous work outside the classroom. This last requisite means that the stu-
dent must do homework and/or virtual classroom work, or whatever strategy
the teacher selects.

   At the beginning of the course, the students take a diagnostic test, and low-
level achievers' results are used to personalize their assistance. Personal assis-
tance sessions are a Program support strategy that complements class work.
Every teacher offers ten hours per week of personalized assistance in an appro-
priate space to individually help students who need support. In these sessions,
the teacher and student work with and revise the student's actual productions.
A student can access this personalized assistance by directly asking the teacher,
whether in class, via email, or a phone call. The assistance space lasts at least
40 minutes, and each student can schedule as many sessions as he or she likes.

                  CURRICULUM AND OBJECTIVES

   The course's reading work concentrates on the development of reading logs
and records, which are questionnaire-style guides with fifteen items and/or ques-
tions designed to orient the student in his/her in-depth analysis of the text. The
published document titled "How do I make a reading log?" (González, 2004) is
used to support this process. Reading exercises are supported by a reading plan,
whose required texts are selected by the Program; the list of texts is expanded
by the teacher. These texts include essays, journalistic articles, iconic texts, and
texts about the students' disciplinary studies. Different types of texts are used
to help students learn about different ways to approach a text. The objectives
for the two semesters of coursework are listed in the course's syllabus, and seek
to enable students to be capable of (1) recognizing the structure of ideas in a
text and its argumentative plan; (2) deducing and inferring using textual con-
tents; (3) relating text content to other texts; (4) recognizing their polyphony
and contextualizing the text based on cultural, ideological, historical, stylistic,
linguistic, etc., elements; (5) assuming a critical perspective of text content; (6)
reading with specific objectives, such as research, synthesizing, separating fact
from opinion, delving into a topic, or identifying information to organize in a
text; and (7) gaining ownership of new terms and concepts.

   In the writing section at the first level of the LEA course, the class is focused
on the construction of sentences and, from there, on the production of para-
graphs. Then it is oriented to the production of summaries and argumentative
texts that require a critical position. These texts are produced out of the reading
plan that was previously mentioned. Pursuant to a strict institutional disposi-

                                                                                                159
González

tion, the class has workshops on morpho-syntactic and grammatical aspects,
which do not exceed more than 20% of the course, as outlined in the course
schedule and syllabus.

   In the second level of the LEA course, the teacher accompanies the students
in re-writing exercises to produce an article or essay. They are able to pick from
three topic areas provided for the assignment (themes related to their major,
social issues and problems youth face). The reading plan provides the students
with bibliographic sources and support.

   If the student selects the thematic axis focused on his/her major, the teacher
suggests seeking out support from professors from within the student's depart-
ment. However, students rarely do so. As a strategy to link student writing to
the topics from students' disciplines, the PLEA teachers encourage students
to develop a writing assignment from their major coursework as their LEA
course paper. However, this option has not achieved sustained disciplinary work
because of two reasons: first, students are assigned very limited writing assign-
ments during their first years in school; secondly, if a project in the student's
other class work is identified as useful for the LEA writing process, we observe
that the student often does not carry out the stages of writing that the Program
teacher demands, because the assignment often has short deadlines, at most
two weeks.

   Reading in the second level of LEA continues with a similar process, using
reading logs and records, which should support the production of the writ-
ten document during the course of the semester. The syllabus states its goals
in writing as follows: (1) produce texts with a clear basic structure: introduc-
tion, development, and conclusion; (2) achieve a logical connection between
the thesis statement and the supporting arguments; (3) ask problem questions
to develop argumentative texts; (4) consult, organize, and use a minimum num-
ber of sources for writing, and use standard referencing and citation norms; (5)
balance the contributions coming from sources and the student's purposeful
intention as a writer; (6) own the process of writing a text (documentation,
contextualization, review, correction and rewrite); (7) use punctuation in con-
text; (8) adequately use connectors and other cohesive devices; and (9) review
the semantic precision and correspondence between the terms and concepts
used, given that the student is entering a new profession and/or discipline and
academic culture.

   As a strategy to encourage students' independent writing and the dissemina-
tion of their work in the course, two anthologies have been created: Colombia:
21st Century Utopia (Noguera, L. et al., 2005) and Colombia: 21st Century
Utopia 2 (Ballén, C. et al., 2007) were formed to collect the articles and es-
says produced by students, as selected by PLEA for publication. The electronic

magazine Altus was also created (http://www.usa.edu.co/altus/index.htm). Al-
tus' editorial committee is comprised of students, who select the texts to be
published. Each year, around 1,400 students take the course, and only 40 to 45
(3%) publish their texts.

   To monitor students' progress, rubrics were used for students' co-evaluation
and self-evaluation. These evaluations were centralized in a personalized over-
sight called the Student Reading and Writing Registry (RELEE in Spanish).
The registry and rubrics allowed teachers to share the students' results, their
progress or lack of progress made during and by the end of the semester.

   In PLEA's first years, there was very limited outreach to the rest of the uni-
versity and academic spaces because it was generally considered sufficient to
provide support to students in reading and writing in their first year. This per-
ception, as will be discussed further on, slowly changed with time. This change
was largely supported by the creation of the research group.

                ASSESSMENT, ACHIEVEMENTS AND
                        URGENT ADJUSTMENTS

   From 2005 and through 2010, research projects were initiated, motivated
by the much-needed reflections that permeated the discussions on these top-
ics in Colombia. These discussions came from literature outside the coun-
try, namely from Paula Carlino in Argentina (2005), and from Bazerman
(1988) and Russell (1990) in the Anglo Saxon context. The research papers
included College Reading and Writing Practices: Five Majors as Case Studies
at the Universidad Sergio Arboleda (González & Vega, 2010), and Assess-
ment and Description of the Grammar Program - Academic Reading and
Writing (PGLEA) in Colombia's Universidad Sergio Arboleda (González &
Vega, 2011).

   The second research project analyzed the Program's curricular and guiding
documents, and included structured and semi-structured interviews with PLEA
department members and with faculty from five other departments. Semi-struc-
tured interviews were used with 90 students in their ninth and tenth semesters
from those departments to learn about their perceptions of the course they took
and their own processes. We also analyzed student performance during and
after their participation in the Program by comparing test results. Researchers
compared the students' performance in levels I and II of the course with the
results they achieved on a test similar to the Colombian government's required
test for all students graduating from the university. The research also gathered
tests of different types and from different courses for the analysis.

                                                                                                161

   Perceptions of the faculty in charge of developing the PLEA

   The faculty in charge of the course emphasized the following in their narra-
tives: (1) the absence of a clear position within the university's institutional poli-
cies, given the directors' continuous intervention; (2) that other professors from
different departments are not interested in reading and writing issues, despite the
frequent discussion and exchange spaces promoted by PLEA; (3) that students
are not interested beyond "getting a certain grade" because the courses are seen as
"a burden or obligation;" (4) that students see few transformations during such
a short course; and (5) the small or null transfer of LEA contents to other areas.

   PLEA teachers generally value their work in the Program as being positive.
They state that the faculty is well-suited to the task given their knowledge and
continual improvements in their work on the topic. Many of the faculty mem-
bers compare their experience with the Universidad Sergio Arboleda to previ-
ous jobs and they see glimpses of improvement, new lessons learned, "evolving
processes," and "interesting experiences."

        Perceptions of the faculty from the five departments

   In general terms and among other topics, faculty members from other de-
partments believed that some students (from the ninth and tenth semesters)
show notable progress in communications, while others--the majority --still
demonstrate serious difficulties in reading and "composition." Despite a con-
tinuous demand for reading and writing exercises assigned by professors, and
the high standards placed upon students, the results are not satisfactory. These
faculty members questioned PLEA's effectiveness, and consider several reforms
and complementarities necessary.

   Furthermore, several faculty members stated that they were unaware of the
Program or doubted its usefulness. Faculty members expect students to be able
to read, defend an argument, and continually improve their ability to interpret
texts. They state that developing these skills in students is the responsibility
of PGLEA teachers, and not the teachers within the majors. These professors
rarely participated in discussions on reading and writing, in extension courses
or other calls made by PGLEA with the Academic Vice Rector's support, to
provide information and pedagogical support.

                  Perceptions of last semester students

   Student perceptions are the most abundant data that were gathered about
the Program. The initial categories used to classify the perceptions and analyze

162
                                                                Universidad Sergio Arboleda (Colombia)

the data were the following: weaknesses, strengths, opportunities, and threats2
to PLEA; PLEA's quality, utility, and applicability; changes in reading and writ-
ing after taking PLEA; and contributions and suggestions.

   It should be clarified that what some students mention as positive, other
students classified as negative, and vice versa. This has made us reflect on the
criteria, strategies, methodologies and concepts used in the course. Despite the
clear intention of unifying criteria at the time (2004-2006), each teacher guided
his/her course using his/her own vision about students' needs and the function-
ality of reading and writing.

   When looking at the positive ratings given by interviewed students a full
four years after having taken the course, the students marked positively:

   · The relevance and quality of the Program components and contents
       (grammar, spelling, reading and writing, selections from the reading
       plan). These areas were considered sufficient for a complete and struc-
       tured Program.

   · The coursework was not only useful for the Department's courses, but
       also for other academic spaces and even professional work. Many stu-
       dents interviewed are already part of the workforce.

   · Many stated that they formed habits after taking the Program that in-
       clude checking information, referencing, and being aware of plagiarism.

   · A generic improvement in "comprehension."
   · Improvement in "composition" (they do not distinguish between com-

       position and writing), spelling, coherence, use of connectors, use of para-
       graph types, and text structures (using those terms).
   In contrast, another group of students mentioned negative aspects or weak-
nesses of the course:
   · They easily forgot what they had studied in the Program and they did
       not develop the habit or ability to enjoy reading and writing. Being in
       the process of finishing their capstone projects, some students express
       that they are not able to use any of the strategies from the Program and
       that they did not use skills learned in the Program in other classes.
   · Program contents are too generic and not specific or applicable.
   · Some topic areas were similar to what they studied in high school.
   · The course's timeframe is very short.

               TRANSFORMATIONS UNDERTAKEN

   Building and consolidating a program to strengthen university students'
reading and writing, with a clear integration into the institutional academic

                                                                                                163

dynamic, was a risky bet in Colombia in 2004. At that time, the Universidad
Sergio Arboleda's proposal was a pioneer in its type, intention, and level of ad-
ministrative disposition. This Program is perhaps a representative sample of the
obstacles that need to be avoided or overcome in the country and its institutions
to be able to consolidate an academic culture that supports writing processes.

   Some faculty members' and directors' strong resistance to change has forced
the Program to maintain some of its traditional contents during its develop-
ment. The course's name (Grammar--Academic Reading and Writing) from
2007 to 2009 shows the mixture of the two tendencies (normative and oriented
towards academic literacy). In 2010, the name of the course has been simplified
to Academic Reading and Writing.

   In this scenario, it must be recognized that the presence of a reading and
writing program, such as the one described, gives a different value to these
processes. It reveals reading and writing and saves these processes from becom-
ing unnoticed mechanisms. The fact that research, observation, assessment,
and self-analysis are part of this work justifies that initiatives such as these
exist; any other way would not be worthwhile. However, due to the results of
this evaluation process, the Program has recently undergone some significant
changes:The initial group of eleven teachers was modified. Currently there are
thirteen full-time teachers and two part-time. The seven language specialists
have been joined by two specialists in literature, two specialists in communica-
tions, one philosopher, a lawyer, a psychologist, and a systems engineer. The
intention behind these changes is to promote a cross-disciplinary view of the
program.

   Spaces for dialogue have been created to discuss the risks of understand-
ing reading and writing as just an instructional plane. Often these processes
are mere activity without theory behind them, and they end up mirroring the
practices used in previous educational spaces, which moves them away from real
production situations and instead prioritizes artificial practice.

   Working within one specific Department continues to be the best strat-
egy for consolidating an academic culture in the Universidad. This process has
helped keep the discussion alive. Using the Program's space as an operations
center, members come together to think through the alternatives necessary to
overcome the dominant approach that believes a single course such as LEA
is sufficient (what we call a single-department approach), instead of working
throughout the institution to address reading and writing skills learning. For
this reason, we have carried out alternative actions since 2006, some within
the institution and others with the participation of communities outside the
university, as a strategic mechanism to make the topic visible and to position
the discussion, but which are not solutions themselves. These actions include:

   · Constant review of methodological strategies used in the classroom. This
       review has included spaces in which the Department professors share
       materials and experiences they have in class.

   · Expanding personalized work spaces, so that not only first-year students
       have access to personal assistance sessions, but also more advanced stu-
       dents and professors. The goal is to continue evolving the space into a
       writing center.

   · Two courses held for teachers: Writing for Publishing and Project-based
       Class Work, to bring them closer to reading and writing processes.

   · Publication and sharing of research work on the topic, made by a group
       of the PLEA teachers, under the leadership of the PLEA director.

   · Support of pedagogical campaigns against plagiarism, and strategies to
       reinforce reading and writing skills for State exams.

   · Personalized assistance tutoring to students to review their capstone
       projects for graduation, when they request it.

   · Creation of virtual classrooms with 33 supportive workshops that are
       designed to support the individual tutoring work with online assistance.

   · Forums held with high schools as an institutional outreach project with
       the goal of moving forward the dialogue between secondary schools and
       universities.

   · Development of extension courses to train high school teachers and oth-
       er universities in orienting reading and writing processes.

   · Creation of two elective courses that are academic spaces built to support
       the writing processes of students working on their capstone projects, as
       well as the research processes of research groups, using "research nurser-
       ies" (more than 50). These spaces reflect advanced students' need and
       desire for a work space.

           FORMATION OF THE REDLEES NETWORK

   As a strategy to initiate a broader discussion on the national level, in 2007,
an invitation was sent to sixteen institutions, and with the support of the Co-
lombia Association of Universities (ASCUN), the First National Conference
on institutional policies to develop reading and writing in higher education
was held in the Universidad Sergio Arboleda. The universities that participated
in the meeting formed the Reading and Writing in Higher Education Net-
work (REDLEES, from its name in Spanish), with the objective of promot-
ing institutional policies for the development of reading and writing in higher
education. PLEA's participation in the academic network has contributed to

                                                                                                165

strengthening of our discussion and enrichment of the Program, thanks to an
exchange of experiences and research.

   Precisely, following from the results of this research, members of REDLEES
were invited to participate in an inter-institutional investigation: Initial training
in reading and writing in the university: from secondary education to academic
achievement in higher education, which will continue through 2012.

   For us, the most important strategy implemented so far has been the recent
work of an inter-disciplinary group of twelve professors from different majors
that come from eight of the twelve schools in the university. The group's goals
include thinking together about the basis of institutional policy for reading and
writing in the university, and working together to develop classroom strategies.

FROM WORKING WITH
STUDENTS TO WORKING
THROUGH FACULTY: A
GENRE-CENTERED FOCUS TO
WRITING DEVELOPMENT

By Lotte Rienecker and Peter Stray Jørgensen
University of Copenhagen (Denmark)

In this article we point to the core of the Academic Writing Centre's
teaching of academic writing: a genre definition of research papers,
and the research paper as a main genre. We model our teaching aca-
demic writing practice on a "pentagon model" of basic elements in
the research paper as a highly formatted genre across disciplines on a
structural level. The work with text formats and heuristics ("box- and
fill-in-forms" pedagogy) lays the foundation of our favourite teaching
activities at all educational levels from BA to PhD students. Students
need to recognise standard structures and conventions before they will
be able to break or supersede academic writing conventions successfully.
Lastly, we focus on the current next step in our local version of teach-
ing academic writing across the curriculum: mandatory accreditation
courses for all thesis supervisors at our institution and our work with
assessment-aligned, formative supervisor feedback on PhD students'
drafts.

   This article is about the Academic Writing Centre in the Humanities De-
partment of a big Scandinavian university. We would like to start by sharing
our best advice for the writing programme director or consultant. Our best ad-
vice: align your activities with your institution's most important assessed writ-
ing: genres, formats, criteria of quality, inquiry, reading and writing processes.
Work genre-based: Break down the genres you teach into their basic elements:
text types, structures, argumentation, documentation, language features, etc.
Demonstrate tried-and-true templates that students may depart from as they

develop their rhetorical practices. Your job is to relieve students (and faculty)
from designing "deep plates" all over again. Write and publish textbooks, ar-
ticles, research papers, reports, pamphlets, leaflets, websites. Write at least one
textbook on (an aspect of ) academic writing! Be a writer yourself, not merely
a teacher of academic writing. Take the time for it. The last piece of advice is
based on our experience of the impact our publications on academic writing
and supervision had on our work. Especially our authorship of two textbooks:
Rienecker & Stray Jørgensen et al. (2005): Den gode opgave [The Good Paper, a
research paper manual for students], and Rienecker, Harboe & Stray Jørgensen
(2005): Vejledning. . . [Supervision of MA Theses, a handbook for supervisors],
and the many books and on-line materials that were authored by the Academic
Writing Centre staff 1992--2010, became the foundation of our teaching-ac-
ademic-writing activities today, as we will explore further in this article. These
two publications reflected and set the platform for our work with students,
especially thesis writers, and heralded the work we now do with and through
the thesis writers' supervisors.

         THE FOCUS, THE PROBLEM, THE QUESTION:
       MASTER'S THESIS WRITING AND COMPLETION

   The foremost question that caused our university management to open our
writing programme in 1992 was "How do we bring our master's thesis writers
to timely completion, without selling out on the quality of their inquiries and
their writing?" This is still probably the hottest issue in student writing in the
eyes of university management and staff, even as one major change was imple-
mented by the Research Ministry: a six-month deadline on thesis completion
from the day a thesis contract is signed.1 The six-month deadline was and is
a revolution to a system that never worked under any time constraints until
2007. The role of faculty who supervise thesis writing is very pivotal. In the final
six months of the masters degree program, many students and faculty members
see the real development of the young disciplinary writer truly unfolding. The
transition to writing under deadline pressure is not easy, and it brings to the fore
any discrepancies there may be between supervisor expectations and student
writing and project management competencies. By 2007, when the deadline
was imposed, the writing centre staff was busy with MA Thesis Writers Work-
shops and tutorials. How our centre focuses this advising of students is the main
subject of this essay.

   We will later turn our attention to advising of thesis supervisors: how an ac-
credited, mandatory 30-hour course for all thesis supervisors builds on the con-

tent of what we offer students; namely, research processes and the genre-bound
documentation of the inquiry students do for the MA thesis. We will conclude
this article with an account of the Academic Writing Centre's latest genre-based
project: designing a feedback tool--a rubric--for supervisory feedback on PhD
students' dissertation drafts.

   Facts about Academic Writing and the Academic Writing Centre,
   University of Copenhagen

    · The University of Copenhagen has 35,000 students, including 15,000
        students in the Humanities Department, and approx. 500 faculty.

    · University educations in Denmark build heavily on the writing of
        long term papers, generally one or two long papers per semester.
        The Humanities are a monoculture with very few Danish as Second
        Language-students. Most writing is in Danish, though a substantial
        number of MA and PhD theses are now written in English.

    · There are no general, credit-giving writing courses in Denmark, and
        all activities are on a voluntary basis as extracurricular support ser-
        vices. In all of Danish higher education, there are fewer than 10 small
        units to support student writing (staffing by one to three academics,
        often on a part-time basis, no student tutors) offering courses, work-
        shops, online writing labs (OWLs), one-on-one-tutorials on academ-
        ic writing, study skills, and oral presentations. Subject teachers are in
        charge of writing and writing development, and it is up to their ini-
        tiative to discuss writing during classes, in tutorials or on the intranet
        facilities, and to give feedback on writing. Supervision of major writ-
        ing tasks is provided by faculty (typically two hrs. on a BA thesis, and
        five to seven hours one-on-one supervision on an MA thesis).

    · Student, faculty, and management interest in writing competency
        centers on the writing of the BA (25 pages) and especially MA thesis
        (80 pages) --that is: product- as well as process-centered, academic,
        scientific research paper writing. First and second year papers and es-
        says attract some interest. Creative and professional writing are very
        minor issues.

    · The authors of this article initiated and ran the first writing centre in
        Scandinavia from 1992, with staffing at its high point by four aca-
        demics. Student-centered writing activities are now part of Student
        Services, whereas faculty-centered activities reside in the Academic
        Writing Centre.

                                                                                                171

            THE RESEARCH PAPER GENRE AS A BASIS
             FOR TEACHING UNIVERSITY WRITING

   The core concept of our teaching and supervising is the notion of the re-
search paper as a genre, defined below:

         The research paper should document the research of a
         relevant problem, using concepts, theories, and methods
         from scientific disciplines to argue a case and to convince a
         colleague of the validity of the results and the conclusions of
         the research in an exposition that is acceptable in the targeted
         discourse community. (Rienecker & Stray Jørgensen, 2005)
   Students will be assessed on the degree to which they demonstrate
   · learning and mastery of scientific inquiry and writing
   · knowledge transforming (Bereiter & Scardamalia, 1987)

   · problem inquiry
   · sound analysis
   · explicit or at least clear methodology in data selection and analysis
   · theory- or at least concept-based analysis and discussion
   · documentation
   · use and critical appraisal of sources
   · coherent argumentation
   · language suitable to the purpose
   The master's thesis is meant to be a demonstration of the ability to research
and write a small-scale model piece of conceptually and methodologically sound
scientific work, even if that be not substantial enough to qualify as a "contri-
bution to research." To simplify the core elements of the research paper genre,
we use a pentagon (Rienecker & Stray Jørgensen, 2005) as a graphic model of
the elements and choices every writer needs to consider before getting far into
literature searches, reading, and drafting (Figure 1).
   Figure 2 shows examples of kinds of information that might be in each
corner. The first corner (the problem box) represents the problem to research,
the gap in the field. The second corner (the purpose box) is the rhetorical cor-
ner where relevance to the field and the world at large, purpose, and targeted

audience should be stated. In the third corner (the databox) is an overview of
the data, the objects to be examined. The fourth corner (the tool box) is the
theories, concepts, and/or methods with which to collect, categorize, analyze,
and interpret the data.

   The science in the writing springs from the connection between the data
corner and the discipline's tool corner. Tools from the writer's discipline (or
adjacent, relevant disciplines) are used in the treatment of data (in the humani-
ties: often primary sources, texts) and that connection secures that conceptu-
alizations, points of analysis, results, your argument, and reasoning can be un-
derstood by others. The fifth corner (the methodology box) aims to set up a
research design that is feasible, realistic, and logical. It often depicts the line of
reasoning and argumentation --and the outline of the research.2

   Writers and their teachers/supervisors may use the filling-in of the boxes at
any stage of the design phase of writing a research paper or an extended piece of
research, as a departure point for dialogue, or for more research. It is a planning
and revising tool that has spurred a host of pedagogical activities, reflecting the
need for early planning and supervision of student research. Experience has
demonstrated amply for us that students who will experience serious problems
with an MA thesis almost always have one or more "empty boxes" or vague
formulations a long way into the designated six months' MA thesis time frame.
Issues with genre and with higher order concerns (structure, argumentation,
major elements such as methods, theories, data, etc.) are quite frequently the
major writing issues of students, even at advanced levels; hence, that is where we
have placed major effort. Even the language issues (lower order concerns) that
we have seen presented at the writing centre often relate to the writer's being a
novice to scientific writing, in the sense of having little available explicit knowl-
edge about academic, scientific forms and formats for writing--even though
they may very well have written many research papers prior to the MA thesis.

               THE RESEARCH PAPER STRUCTURE

   Another big concern over our years of tutoring thesis writers has been their
difficulty structuring major written work (on both macro- and micro-levels).
Therefore, principles and possibilities for structuring papers form a theme with
supervisors who often find their students without ready models. Hence, we
have designed a number of activities with students. Again we work with various
fill-in-forms and preformatted standard structures that may later be tailored by
the writers to their individual projects.

174
                                                                   University of Copenhagen (Denmark)

                     Box- and fill-in-forms Pedagogy

   A favourite workshop activity for all study levels, from first year to PhD, has
been and still is for the writer in the planning stage to fill in a sheet or file with a
format for research paper design, and we have made a number of forms (for all
major elements of a research paper within a standard structure).

   Fill-in-forms are on our website, can be mailed to students before tutorials,
and are available to supervisors and can be filled in on the spot and discussed
and shared in writing workshops. A piece of software, Scribo--A Guide to
Research Questions and Literature Search (Rienecker & Pipa, 2009), on the
intranet in many Danish universities and other higher education institutions
represents the digital version of a comprehensive design tool for research papers'
basic elements. The idea is not merely to regularize or mainstream students'
writing, but to get their thinking and planning started within tried-and-true,
working conventional frameworks that the writer can then always develop,
challenge, expand, surpass, or discard if writers have other options that work
better for their topics and material. A filled-in form is a short list that facilitates
supervision and can lead to library searches, to more detailed structuring, draft-
ing, and revision.

              ACADEMIC WRITERS' DEVELOPMENT
                     ACCORDING TO RESEARCH

   A host of recent, major, empirical works on writer development underpins
a genre approach to teaching university writing. Blåsjø (2000), Thaiss and Za-
wacki (2006), and Steinhoff (2007) support the idea that discernible writer de-
velopment occurs from a pre-conventional stage (in which the novice writer is
unaware of existing norms and conventions) to a conventional stage (in which
the writer may rely too heavily on formats and "boxes" for required genres) to
a post-conventional stage, where the student has become an academic writer:
the desired end result of all education, in which the writer is able to use his
or her judgement aptly to produce reader-oriented, suitable text for every oc-
casion, using and transforming formats adequately. The development towards
a rhetorical awareness of a multitude of textual possibilities is in fact aided
by an awareness of genre conventions made explicit; our "boxes" and formats
are helpful tools in passing from not knowing appropriate conventions for any
given target audience to addressing each writing task with a rhetorical awareness
of the specifics of the communicative content, purpose, and audience. Many

                                                                                                175
Rienecker and Stray Jørgensen

students report benefiting from following preformatted schemata at least once:
the template is just good to have in mind in contemplating subsequent tasks,
but not needed as the final structure for the paper.

               THESIS SUPERVISOR'S MANDATORY
                     ACCREDITATION COURSES

   Since 2009, the Academic Writing Centre has employed only faculty. We
have fused with the Teaching and Learning Unit, and have the teaching of
supervision, feedback to students, assessments, and teaching writing, as well as
general teaching skills, as our work area. Part of our teaching portfolio is the
MA Supervisors' Accreditation Course. Accreditation of supervisors is man-
datory at our department and in the Department of Social Sciences at Aar-
hus University, Denmark, but is otherwise unique in Scandinavia. We have
been commissioned by the dean's office to accredit all thesis supervisors at
the department--i.e., the majority of faculty will go on a supervisor's course,
totalling three hours plus preparation and essay writing on theses supervision.
"Mandatory" means that successful completion of the course is a prerequisite
in the department for supervising MA theses in the future. This means that
we now teach, discuss, workshop, inform, and casework on themes related to
academic inquiry, writing, project planning, etc. through the supervisors and
comprehensively, getting in contact with each and every supervisor, as opposed
to reaching a couple of hundred students each year out of the 15,000 in the
department, and having only sporadic contact with staff. Through 2011, more
than 80 out of some 500 supervisors will have been accredited. The supervi-
sors' course focuses on the MA thesis genre and format requirement and crite-
ria; on formative feedback on thesis designs and drafts; on supporting students
through their research, reading, and writing work; on negotiating mutual ex-
pectations, and on problem writers and problem texts. The overall focus is on
what individual supervisors and what departments can do to support timely
and qualified submission. The course activities entail a number of case-based
discussions with the theme "What can the supervisor do to assist the writing
and the writer in this case?"

   Many supervisors report that they adopt some of the activities with writers
that served us so well, particularly using the heuristics of the pentagon model as
the basis for the research paper/thesis. Supervisors request of thesis writers that
they fill in and submit a pentagon for supervision early on, as a point of depar-
ture for the crucial discussion of research design and the alignment of research
question with choice of data, concepts, and methods. Many supervisors also

176
                                                                   University of Copenhagen (Denmark)

bring their own heuristics to the course, their lists of criteria for the good thesis,
their supervisory practices, and their supervisory concerns, and these get shared
in the course. We report the supervisor input back to heads of studies and the
vice dean of education, in the hope that supervisor experiences and concerns
will eventually affect curriculum design. We aim to ensure that every student is
prepared through prior work and writing experiences for thesis writing, before
the student signs a contract with a six-month deadline.

                   In Dialogue with Thesis Supervisors

   How do the thesis supervisors in the Humanities Department--among the
most apt and able writers and teachers of theses and dissertations and a host
of other genres--react to the genre definitions and the rather restricted "box
pedagogy," the formulaic and schematic suggestions concerning what the su-
pervisor might ask for in text planning and production? We meet a range of
supervisor angles and attitudes, from "but you don't quite seem to address the
individual writer who happens to be an original, a young genius in the making,
and who needs to be unbound by conventions and formats to freely explore
his ideas in writing--and to have that very freedom in content and form ac-
knowledged and supported by his supervisor" to "Thank you for this tool, I am
going to use it" --and even further to "Yes, I've read your stuff and used it, and
I have developed a tool myself, and I should like to have the supervisors' course
participants' reactions to it." We welcome all input to the dialogue on writing
from those who really own university writing: the writers and their supervisors/
teachers. The mandatory accreditation of thesis supervisors has made possible
the explicit foregrounding of the department's 500 supervisors as the true col-
laborators with students concerning thesis writing. We aid this process rather
than substituting for absent supervisors. Accreditation courses for MA thesis
supervisors are but one example of our work with academic writing with and
through faculty.

  THE PHD DISSERTATION AS A GENRE--AND A RUBRIC
      FOR FORMATIVE FEEDBACK TO PHD-STUDENTS

   PhD supervision is a targeted area, not just for Danish, but for all Euro-
pean university education, and many institutions are implementing mandatory
courses for PhD supervisors. It is our aim that the PhD dissertation as the most
visible product of the PhD education should be thoroughly addressed in all
supervisor preparation at our department. We want writers to explore textual

                                                                                                177

options before submission rather than get negative summative feedback in the
all-important assessments. We would welcome a systematic and pro-active su-
pervisory style over a more reactive--and possibly more random--style, which
is the local norm. New supervisors need to be prepared for helping their candi-
dates plan, assess, and revise their research and their thesis, to be prepared for
giving formative feedback on PhD drafts, for sitting on assessment commit-
tees, and for writing PhD assessments that are useful to the candidate, to the
university, and to future employers. As a point of departure for PhD supervisor
courses, we now work on a project of alignment (Biggs, 2007) of PhD assess-
ments with the supervision of PhD students and the courses offered from the
graduate school. The PhD assessments (five to ten page long summaries plus
evaluation) and the PhD vivas are the most comprehensive assessments done
in the university system, and when read/witnessed in bulk, give deep insight
into the criteria used to assess, and also the lacunae in the desired learning out-
comes when it comes to university writing. These documents reveal how well
university candidates are able to write and communicate according to scientific
standards, what they have learned and turned into practices of their own, and
what they might not have absorbed. In our department's case, assessments from
the years 2007-2008 show interesting patterns in strong and weaker features of
scholarly writing. We analysed all of the departments' 2009 assessments, from
which we record all evaluative remarks. The patterns emerging from the survey
point to areas of (local? or more global?) PhD supervision and feedback prac-
tices that could be strengthened and reinforced to alert PhD writers to elements
of dissertations that tend to be underdeveloped, and hence attract sometimes
severe and clearly well-documented and justifiable criticism of dissertations.

          Developing a Rubric for Feedback on PhD Drafts

   The analysis of PhD assessments in a genre-frame results in a 25 page rubric
feedback tool for PhD supervisors and candidates, inspired by and adjusted
from Barbara Lovitt's work (2007) with feedback rubrics at the PhD level. The
feedback tool alerts the feedback-giver and receiver to most-used assessment
criteria, and even if all the rubrics in the feedback tool are not filled out or ex-
plicitly addressed in the supervision, they may serve as a reminder or checklist
to be discussed, negotiated, embraced, or rejected as relevant, in each supervi-
sory dyad.

   The feedback tool is still under testing and revision, using several supervi-
sor pairs as test-persons. This piece of work represents a juncture between our
work until now on genre, on feedback and criteria for "the good paper," and on
supervision of academic writing. It is embedded in our local Graduate School's

larger scheme for enhancing the quality of dissertation writing, as well as the
quality of supervision.

   The integration of writing centre support with faculty activities toward stu-
dent writing relies on political and management initiative and a steady drive
from the dean's office to implement new routines, just as this integration relies
on our work.

                  FUTURE TRENDS IN TEACHING
                ACADEMIC WRITING IN DENMARK

   Supervisor education is certainly a central issue for higher education and
for our policy makers. But also in other theatres of the educational system we
observe movements: professional educations (e.g., teachers' and nurses' train-
ing) are becoming "academized," and also at the upper secondary level students
write research papers, sometimes complete with scientific theory, research ques-
tions, data analysis, and discussion of methods. Inquiry and research become
democratised and so does academic writing. Now everybody with a high school
diploma has done mini-research, and with any luck they arrive at university
with experience in writing in many genres--and also with a general knowledge
of genres. In the next generation all our students might be adept not just at
producing qualified work in one core genre but in juggling genres.

                                    NOTES

1. The deadline can be expanded twice with an extra 3 months. This practice, however,
is discouraged.

2. Similarly a pentagon model for the short essay (Signe Skov in Stray Jørgensen &
Rienecker Studiehaandbog [Study skills handbook], 2009 serves as a heuristic and fill-in-
form for essay writers.

THE DEPARTMENT

OF RHETORIC AND

COMPOSITION AT THE

AMERICAN UNIVERSITY IN

CAIRO: ACHIEVEMENTS AND

CHALLENGES

By Emily Golson and Lammert Holdijk
American University in Cairo (Egypt)

This chapter traces the growth of the first department of Rhetoric and
Composition in the Middle East from its initial stages as a six-credit
freshmen seminar (1957) to its emergence as the first Department
of Rhetoric and Composition in the Middle East (2007). The piece
includes a summary of the demographics of the current department,
a description of the pedagogy and philosophy that informs the cur-
riculum, a summary of the creation of the Writing Minor (2009), a
brief description of the Writing Center, and references to ancillary pro-
grams, such as the Undergraduate Research Conference and Commu-
nity Based Learning Courses. The final part of the chapter articulates
current challenges and future plans.

   The American University in Cairo, founded in 1919, is a private university
enrolling approximately 5,055 undergraduate and 1,148 graduate students per
year (About AUC, 2011). The Department of Rhetoric and Composition is
the largest Department in the School of Humanities and Social Sciences. As of
this writing, it serves 4,000 students per year in lower-division courses and 200
in upper division courses, with 34 students enrolled in a new Writing Minor
(Rhetoric and Writing Minor, 2011). A separate English language program,
located in the English Language Institute, serves the needs of prospective stu-
dents whose English language proficiency does not meet entry-level require-
ments (95-102 on the TOEFL iBT total score--Internet Based Test). Approxi-
mately 45% of the students enter the university through the English language

program while the remaining 55% enter into one of three entry-level required
writing courses. Students entering the university come from private interna-
tional schools (American, French, German, British, Dutch) or enter directly
from national schools.

   The Department is responsible for three required writing courses and a
growing Writing Minor. It employs 44-48 full time faculty who teach three
courses per term. Ten percent of the current faculty hold PhDs in Rhetoric &
Composition or related areas. The remaining faculty have degrees in creative
writing, literature, history, theology, film studies, journalism, science, business,
and TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language). The required lower-di-
vision curriculum consists of three required writing courses, which use (US)
WPA (Writing Program Administrators) Outcomes for First Year Composi-
tion as guidelines (http://www.wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html) and
include a heavy emphasis on rhetorical strategies--voice, analysis, audience and
argument--to assist in critical thinking. The first course focuses on voice and
analysis, the second on argument and audience, and the third on formal aca-
demic research. The Department's Writing Center offers tutorials to 3,500 un-
dergraduate students annually and 110 graduate students; the Center sponsors
20 general and 10 discipline-specific workshops per semester for undergradu-
ates and six general workshops and occasional customized courses for graduate
students. The Department also sponsors an Undergraduate Research Confer-
ence, co-sponsors a linguistics conference every other year, and offers several
Community Based Learning (CBL) courses.

                  HISTORY OF THE DEPARTMENT

   As Egypt's national school curriculum rests on rote learning, many Egyptian
students have difficulty with independent thinking. In general, students lack
an awareness of the value of a liberal arts education, have little experience in
reading and writing, have not been exposed to effective reasoning, and are un-
familiar with the concept of plagiarism. Although Egypt's International Schools
provide an American/European education for those who can afford it, many of
the faculty in these schools were not trained to specifically address the writing
needs of students.

   The history of AUC's effort to address these needs began in 1957, when
AUC faculty voted for a six-credit freshman seminar consisting of a two-course
sequence--101 (Freshman Composition) and 102 (Research Writing). At that
time, the writing faculty was composed of three local hires with BAs in the
humanities or social sciences. In the 1960s, the university added a second level

182
                                                                   American University in Cairo (Egypt)

of Freshman Composition (a new 102--three credits) and moved the Research
Writing course to a sophomore offering (201--three credits), resulting in a total
of nine credits for a three-course sequence--101, 102 and 201. In order to meet
this commitment, the university asked English and Comparative Literature fac-
ulty to teach one to two writing courses per year. The most significant problem
during this period was lack of consistency in grading. The need to confront this
problem eventually persuaded the Literature department to consider establish-
ing a Writing Program with specialized faculty teaching composition

   The 1970s saw the beginning of a specialized Writing Program with a coor-
dinator and enough office space for the addition of locally-hired faculty, most
of whom held MAs in literature or TESOL. During this period, it was difficult
to recruit native speakers from the US with specialized training in composi-
tion; consequently, local native speakers of English, with degrees in a variety
of disciplines, provided additional instruction. This marked the beginning of a
unit composed of a mixture of Egyptian, European, and American faculty with
degrees in many different disciplines--this diversity continues to characterize
the department to this day.

   As the goal was to provide an intense writing experience, the three required
English courses were condensed into two courses: ENGL 112, Rhetorical
Modes (four credits) and ENGL 113, Research Writing ( five credits). Grading
for these courses was pass/fail. The above change was followed by the develop-
ment of techniques and materials that drew from the growing body of TESOL
and Composition literature in the US and UK. Recognizing that many of the
students were not prepared to master the level of writing required in the new
courses, the Director of the Writing Program, who was also the Chair of the
committee that was in the process of creating a new Core Curriculum, created
a remedial preparatory course, ENGL 111, later re-labeled ENGL 100, which
eventually became an exit course on writing for the English Language Institute.

                           Change and Evolution

   In the eighties and nineties the Writing Program received limited support
from faculty and students. Although writing faculty were stressing critical
thinking, there was limited follow-up in subsequent academic courses. A survey
revealed that many faculty were giving multiple-choice tests in lieu of assign-
ing papers. Since writing was rarely assessed in humanities or non-humanities
courses, students began to perceive writing as irrelevant to their academic work.
In the mid nineties, as part of an effort to bring writing pedagogy in line with
US composition pedagogy, the Writing Program attempted to introduce Writ-
ing Across the Curriculum (WAC). An expert consultant delivered a weeklong

                                                                                                183
Golson and Holdijk

workshop, but the effort was eventually dropped because there was no incentive
for faculty to change course requirements or delivery. By the year 2000, the
Writing Program, with little support from colleagues in other disciplines, had
become a series of loosely connected required courses on a variety of themes
with, as earlier, no mechanism to assure fairness in grading. Some instructors
graded for "content," while others addressed sentence-level issues, paragraph
structure, vocabulary, and usage.

   The next few years saw renewed attention to writing as a result of the grad-
ing question and several other needs:

   · The Department of Engineering needed an advanced writing course to
       qualify for ABET accreditation

   · Businesses reported that AUC graduates were not proficient in writing
   · Writing pedagogy was not in line with US composition programs
   In 2001, Faculty Senate Resolution 209 called for the restructuring of course
offerings in writing to better reflect current US practices and to allow for easier
integration with the credit-hour structure. This opened the way for a revision
of the Program.
   As the writing faculty began to move away from the influence of both TE-
SOL and literature and toward a pedagogy that was informed by the discipline
of Rhetoric/Composition, a new Writing Program began to take shape. Courses
were streamlined to address differing competencies in language and thought.
Classes were limited to 14 students. The curriculum was revised. ECLT 112
(four credits) and 113 (five credits) were replaced by ECLT 101, 102 and 103
(three credits each), and the name of the program was changed from the Fresh-
man Writing Program to the Writing Program. A portfolio system was initiated.
The grading system was changed from pass/fail to letter grades, with final papers
graded by adjudication. New upper division courses in Business Communica-
tion, Technical Communication and Writing, and Writing in the Humanities
and Social Sciences were created to answer the need for more specialized writing
courses. In 2004, the Writing Program was granted an independent budget.
In 2005, Writing Program administrators took control of hiring. In 2006, as a
result of mandated, campus-wide self studies that called for stronger and more
engaged writing, the Writing Program gained department status. To our knowl-
edge, the Department is the first of its kind in the Middle East.

                           Department Struggles

   In 2007, while the university prepared for extensive restructuring, the new
Department, with full support from both Provost and Dean, began to revise its
identity so that the discipline and the work of teaching Rhet/Comp would be

184
                                                                   American University in Cairo (Egypt)

perceived as equal to the work of other departments. When a new Provost took
office in 2008, and the campus moved from its crowded downtown quarters to
a sprawling state-of the-art desert complex located outside of the city, that ef-
fort intensified. The Department proposed a Writing Minor consisting of three
emphasis areas--business, academic, and creative. Eleven new courses, offered
on a rotating basis, were added to the standard upper division offerings. Faculty
with creative writing backgrounds tapped into a hidden need for attention to
creative expression, and within one year, the minor boasted 34 students, many
of whom were creative writers.

   During this period, those teaching business and technical writing began to
strengthen the conceptual foundation of their courses by articulating rhetorical
outcomes that had always existed below the surface of their teaching. In addi-
tion, Rhetoric and Composition's business writing faculty teamed up with allies
in the Business School to work on a required under-division course for business
majors. New faculty with degrees in Rhetoric proposed academic writing cours-
es that either emphasized the rhetorical foundations of critical thought or fo-
cused on rhetorical engagement that cut across the disciplines. Meanwhile, the
lower-division required courses enhanced WPA outcomes by adding a stronger
emphasis on rhetoric to allow instructors to build on mastery of appropriate
levels of critical engagement. As of this writing, RHET 101 now focuses on
voice and analysis and RHET 102 on audience and argument. RHET 103 has
now become RHET 201, a sophomore level research writing course. Portfolio
requirements now allow faculty to concentrate on process, with low-stakes ac-
tivities and exercises buttressing partial and final drafts. Norming sessions and
outcomes now assure consistency and coherence of the offerings.

   To assist in this transition, faculty take advantage of AUC's generous re-
search, teaching enhancement, conference, and semester-long tenure and pro-
fessional development grants to focus on their own writing and research proj-
ects. Creative writers attend writing residencies, and academic faculty travel to
research facilities throughout Europe and the US In addition, faculty learn from
each other through professional development sessions on the use of digital plat-
forms, such as Blackboard, wikis, Moodle, and blogs, as well as new approaches
to traditional writing classroom practices from fields such as epistolary writing,
film studies, or public speaking.

                                CHALLENGES

   Our faculty faces many challenges. While department status has given in-
structors more authority in the classroom and on university-wide, policy-mak-

                                                                                                185
Golson and Holdijk

ing committees, it has also placed the Department at the forefront of attempts
to introduce western pedagogy. There are few free public libraries in Egypt, and
the public schools do not emphasize reading and writing. Because Egyptian cul-
ture privileges oral exchange over reading and writing, learning is primarily as-
sociated with memorization and repetition. As Egyptian society places a strong
emphasis on conformity, class discussions often feature praise for those parts of
a text that support student beliefs and silence during conversations or text read-
ings that challenge those same beliefs. Even though exposure to the Internet has
opened new possibilities for free-ranging discussion, progress is slow because of
limited engagement with critical thinking, reading, or writing.

   The shift from a Writing Program (often referred to as "English Classes" by
Egyptian students) to a Department of Rhetoric and Composition was accom-
panied by a realization that most students (and most parents) had never heard
of rhetoric and composition and were not familiar with its goals and outcomes.
Therefore, one of the first duties of the new department was to inform students,
parents, and faculty of the connection between rhetoric and critical thinking,
and to introduce the community to the concept of writing as a form of engage-
ment with thought. For the students, however, conversation often focused on
grades. Although most AUC students come from the upper classes and have
more personal freedom, better education, and greater exposure to Western ideas
than their peers, they remain immersed in a culture that strongly supervises
their activities. AUC students live at home and receive daily reminders of the
need for high grades, which are sometimes linked to family honour rather than
mastery of subject matter. For some students, the pressure can become so in-
tense that they ignore learning. In the worst cases, students blatantly plagiarize.
In the best cases, students rely too heavily on sources or turn to more accom-
plished friends for help with writing a paper. Even the best students negotiate to
receive additional points on every completed assignment, no matter the quality.

   The recent changes in curriculum and outcomes in the lower-division re-
quired courses have allowed faculty to take a different approach to issues of
learning and academic integrity. Although the department has always been sen-
sitive to plagiarism and used Turnitin software (an Internet tool that identifies
plagiarized work) as a teaching tool, faculty now employ additional means to
shift student attention from grades to learning. A new emphasis on voice and
analysis in RHET 101 and argument and audience in RHET 102, when used in
conjunction with several low-stakes assignments, now guides students through
several stages of critical thinking. Constant attention to feedback through class
discussion, peer evaluation, and conferencing now allows students to stay fo-
cused on learning instead of grades. And the gradual accumulation of pages
and pages of writing that evidences increased cognitive awareness has helped to

186
                                                                   American University in Cairo (Egypt)

convince students that they are indeed capable of the complex written thought
that accompanies engagement in the writing process.

   The Department also attempts to educate parents by holding occasional
parent conferences. In the event that a student and instructor cannot reach
a resolution during a grade dispute, we request a meeting in which we invite
parents, student, and instructor to meet with the Director or Associate Director
to discuss approaches and goals of the course in conjunction with the student's
earned grade. Although in all instances we have tactfully refused to change a
grade, there has never been an instance in which a parent did not accept our
judgement or leave an office dissatisfied.

   Our second challenge is to make our diversity our strength. A third of our
faculty are Egyptian, a third are from Europe (mainly the UK), and a third are
American. They hold different types of degrees in many different majors. They
come from the corporate as well as the education sector. Many have never taken
a composition course nor have they been trained to teach composition. Al-
though these faculty have much to contribute, they face the constant challenge
of placing Rhetoric and Composition knowledge and pedagogy at the core of
their teaching.

    As a result, the department takes outcomes, normalizing, assessment, and
professional development very seriously. Course co-ordinators meet with fac-
ulty to discuss outcomes at the beginning of each term. The assessment co-ordi-
nator "normalizes" with faculty twice each term and oversees random portfolio
evaluation once a year. A professional development coordinator oversees faculty
development presentations given by those with expertise in a particular area of
rhetoric or composition. And an informal "Seminar/Practicum" in Rhet/Comp
theory and practice supports those with little experience in teaching Rhet/
Comp. Also during the last few years, the Department has hired a Chair with
extensive Rhet/Comp experience and three Rhet/Comp PhDs to assist in pro-
viding a sound disciplinary focus and intellectual resonance to the curriculum.

   A final challenge is to deliver creative, coherent, quality writing instruction
that will keep pace with the rapid changes in the university. We are the first
Department of Rhetoric and Composition in the Middle East. We are housed
in a university that has witnessed the creation of three new schools, several new
graduate programs, and several new professional degree departments in the last
three years. In all instances, there appears to be a shift away from the liberal arts
toward professional degrees.

   Our Provost and our Board of Trustees want to be assured that our approach
is worth the effort invested by the university. Thus, we are under increased pres-
sure to define "who we are" and "what we do." We are currently addressing this
demand by encouraging collaboration with faculty in other AUC Schools as

                                                                                                187
Golson and Holdijk

well as reminding officials of the strong need for training in and articulation of
critical/creative thinking in all professions and disciplines. Thus far, the univer-
sity has supported our efforts, but we are also constantly reminded that we are
a "special" unit and must prove our worth.

                               CONCLUSION
   The Department of Rhetoric and Composition was created to oversee train-
ing in the generation, articulation, development, exchange, and evaluation of
ideas. Working in conjunction with other departments in the university, it at-
tempts to provide a foundation for successful civic and social engagement to
students who will one day take up leadership positions in the Middle East. As
the department develops a deeper understanding of the needs of the students, it
works to create a level of instruction that supports critical thinking and creative
problem solving. Although still in its infancy, the Department has evolved to
the point that it can deliver instruction that integrates disciplinary learning
and understanding with personal, social, and civic engagement, a crucial part
of AUC's mission. We now know who we are, and in order to meet current
demands, we are constantly evaluating and revising what we do.

PROVIDING A HUB FOR
WRITING DEVELOPMENT: A
PROFILE OF THE CENTRE FOR
ACADEMIC WRITING (CAW),
COVENTRY UNIVERSITY,
ENGLAND

By Mary Deane and Lisa Ganobcsik-Williams
Oxford Brookes University and Coventry University (England)

Academic Writing is an emerging area for teaching and research in
UK higher education. This profile essay outlines the work of the first
centrally-funded UK writing centre, the Centre for Academic Writ-
ing (CAW) at Coventry University. The profile looks in detail at why
and how CAW was established, and discusses the CAW model of a
"hub" for three "spokes" of university writing development: student
writing, staff development in the teaching of writing, and staff and
postgraduate scholarly writing. The profile argues that to be effective
and sustainable, writing provision and writing centres must evolve
strategically to meet the needs of university students and staff.

   The phoenix arising from the ashes is the symbol of the city of Coventry,
England (Cheesewright, 2009).1 Heavily bombed during World War II, Coven-
try was rebuilt and now celebrates its heritage as home of the British bicycle and
automotive industry as well as a centre of peace and reconciliation (Richardson,
1972).2 Coventry University, which also takes the phoenix as its emblem, devel-
oped in tandem with the city's regeneration. As one of the "new universities" to
grow out of government changes to polytechnics in 1992, Coventry University
places a strong focus both on teaching and applied research. Today, in 2011,
the university encompasses three Faculties (Business, Environment and Society;
Engineering and Computing; Health and Life Sciences) and the Schools of Art
and Design and Lifelong Learning. The student body comprises approximately

Deane and Ganobcsik-Williams

18,800 undergraduates and 3,000 postgraduates, and 18% are international
students (Turton, 2011). As noted on the university's website, "Coventry is
an evolving and innovative university" that provides "a caring and supportive
environment, enriched by a unique blend of academic expertise and practical
experience" (Coventry University, 2011).

   Within this educational and research environment a leading UK university
writing centre is flourishing.3 The Centre for Academic Writing (CAW), estab-
lished at Coventry University in May 2004, provides writing support for un-
dergraduate students, postgraduates, and academics. From its inception, CAW
has promoted a strategy of "whole institution" writing development whose aim
is to create a shared culture for valuing writing that enables students and staff
to progress along a "continuum of writing development" (Ganobcsik-Williams,
2004, pp. 37-39, 2009). This approach is articulated in CAW's mission state-
ment, in which CAW serves as the "hub" for three "spokes" of university writing
development:

         The Centre for Academic Writing is an innovative teaching
         and research centre whose mission is to enable students at
         Coventry University to become independent writers, and
         to equip academic staff in all disciplines to achieve their full
         potential as authors and teachers of scholarly writing. (CAW,
         2010)

   This profile essay outlines the three spokes of CAW's work: student writ-
ing, staff development in the teaching of writing, and staff and postgraduate
scholarly writing. In doing so, the profile aims to provide readers with a sense
of what writing means to students and academics at Coventry University and of
CAW's evolving role as a hub for Academic Writing development and research.

   HISTORY OF THE CENTRE FOR ACADEMIC WRITING

   The 2003 proposal to establish a writing centre at Coventry University re-
sulted from over eight years of discussion about what could be done to help
students strengthen their writing skills (Williams ,2004). The proposal was
submitted by a committee chaired by the University Librarian and comprised
of staff from the Student Disabilities Office, the English Language Unit, the
Business School, the Library, and the Maths Support Centre. Dyslexia tutors
identified the need for dedicated writing tuition because they had nowhere to
send non-dyslexic students for writing advice, while staff at the English Lan-

guage Unit, whose remit was to support non-native English speakers, increas-
ingly found native English speakers seeking writing support (Williams, 2004;
Wilkinson, 2004). Subject Librarians also reported that students were asking
for help on structuring, argumentation, and referencing for written assignments
(Rock, 2004). These "pockets of provision around the university" became a
major factor leading to the proposal for a writing centre (Rock, 2004).4 The
centre's proposed remit was to improve students' writing skills, and its main
features were to be "a dedicated space for students to visit," "dedicated staff to
provide face to face support", "dedicated resources," and "a realistic budget"
(Noon, 2003, pp. 1-3). The proposal also stipulated the necessity for "a sup-
portive approach and a name that attracts without stigma":

         [A]ny name we give. . . must avoid terms such as "skills" or
         "study skills" and any sense of being a remedial centre . . . .
         If we want students to willingly use the centre either through
         referral or of their own volition it will need to project a sup-
         portive image that encourages students to see it as a normal
         part of their learning experience. (Noon, 2003, p. 3)5

   A new permanent full-time post of Centre Co-ordinator, a set-up budget,
and "a budget to deliver service . . . on a continuing basis" were also outlined
(Noon, 4). The proposal was "strongly supported at Academic Executive and
in the Vice-Chancellor's group" (Pennington, 2003), who decided the writing
centre would run in its start-up phase as a project of the department responsible
for staff development across the University: the Centre for Higher Education
Development (CHED). This positioning within CHED, whose lecturers sup-
ported "the implementation of the [University's] Learning and Teaching Strat-
egy" through collaborations with academic staff, staff development seminars,
and a staff teaching certificate' (Learning, 10), gave the writing centre a staff
development remit to "organise staff development activities to assist academic
and academic-related staff in helping students to improve their academic writ-
ing" that went beyond the original proposal's direct student focus (Coventry
University, 2003, p.1). In August 2003, Vice-Chancellor Michael Goldstein
approved the proposal and allocated funding to found the new Centre for Aca-
demic Writing.6 The proposal's success was made public in the job description
for the Co-ordinator post in December 2003, which announced the Centre
for Academic Writing as "a strategic priority within the university" (Coventry
University, 2003, p. 1).

   In 2004, Lisa Ganobcsik-Williams, co-author of this profile essay, was ap-
pointed Co-ordinator. She brought to the role her US university background in

                                                                                                191

composition teaching, writing centre tutoring, and an MA and PhD in Rheto-
ric and Composition; experience of working in UK higher education as a post-
doctoral research fellow in Academic Writing sponsored by the Royal Literary
Fund and as Co-ordinator of Academic Writing for the University of Warwick
Writing Programme; and links with the international writing research com-
munity. Within the first months of CAW's operation, she appointed two pro-
fessional writing tutors and an administrator, Penny Gilchrist, who had previ-
ously managed the "Learning Zone" at a local Further Education college. Mary
Deane, co-author of this profile, joined this small team as CAW's first Lecturer
in Academic Writing early in 2005. In the seven years since CAW's founding,
its staffing has grown exponentially and now comprises three full-time lecturers/
senior lecturers, 10 part-time professional Academic Writing Tutors,7 two full-
time administrators, and two part-time receptionist/clerical staff. The Centre's
remit has also expanded, not only to incorporate staff as well as student writing
development, but to engage in writing research that is recognised internation-
ally and that grows out of and informs CAW's work.

                           STUDENT WRITING

   The first "spoke" of CAW's mission statement, "to enable students to be-
come independent writers," aims to transform the student learning experience
by teaching students to view writing as a process, including how to plan, struc-
ture, critique, revise and edit their own writing. CAW offers individualised/
small-group writing tutorials focusing on students' own assignments. Fifty-
minute tutorials enable students to meet with an Academic Writing Tutor to
have in-depth discussions of writing assignments and to cover topics such as
essay structure and argumentation. Twenty-minute bookable-on-the-day tuto-
rials are available for students who need immediate advice to clarify a specific
writing issue, problem, or question. Students at all levels of study and educa-
tional preparation attend CAW tutorials. At the conclusion of a tutorial, stu-
dents give feedback via CAW's electronic recordkeeping system. Typical com-
ments include:

         The tutor gave structured comments and feedback at a level I
         could understand. (Student 1, 2010)

         I feel confident to continue with my paper, taking on board
         the writing tutor's comments. (Student 2, 2010)

192
                                                                           Coventry University (England)

   Research undertaken into the impact of individualised tutorials at CAW has
found that these sessions help assist students to move from a writer-based per-
spective on their own work to a reader-based approach (Borg & Deane, 2009,
p. 16). Students gain confidence and competence, and are encouraged to apply
the writing strategies they learn to the rest of their studies.

   Because student demand for writing tutorials is not scalable, and because
CAW aims to provide an array of learning opportunities, CAW also offers cred-
it-bearing writing modules, group workshops, paper-based and electronic writ-
ing resources, and "Protected Writing Time" sessions for students to work on
their writing with an Academic Writing Tutor on-hand.8 The Coventry Univer-
sity Harvard Reference Style Guide, a CAW project Mary Deane carried out in
response to the need for a consistent, teachable system of referencing to be used
in all undergraduate teaching and learning materials, is a resource that is partic-
ularly valued throughout the institution and is used by other UK universities.9

   That CAW's work with students is well-regarded within the university is evi-
denced by the attitudes of students, academics and senior managers. Students
have said: "I am very happy that such a one-on-one tutoring system exists"
(Student 3, 2010) and "CAW is the most useful thing in the university because
they really help students (Student 4, 2010). Colleagues have noted that "`Stu-
dents who have attended CAW before resubmission of their coursework have
improved dramatically" (Davies, 2009) and that CAW's teaching "has resulted
in a higher proportion of doctoral students producing better quality written
work" (de Nahlik, 2009). At a 2009 meeting of the university's Teaching and
Learning Committee, Faculty Deans and other senior managers unanimously
advocated the work of CAW (Watts 2010).

   As part of a university-wide "Add+vantage" initiative to enhance student
employability (Atkins, 1999), CAW also offers a range of undergraduate mod-
ules. Students attend a two-hour seminar each week for ten weeks, and learn
about the theory and practice of writing for assessment, academic genres, and
research, and are expected to apply these topics to studying in their own disci-
plines. As a result, most students gain confidence as scholars in their fields. For
instance, a student gave this feedback:"I thank you for all the help you have
given me, you have certainly made me a better academic writer because I have
not just achieved a good grade in this coursework, but in other coursework as
well" (Student 5, 2011).

   Add+vantage modules are not the only kind of group writing development
CAW offers. CAW lecturers also work in a staff development mode with aca-
demics in the disciplines to support their teaching of writing to undergraduate
and postgraduate students (Deane & O'Neill, 2011).

                                                                                                193

 STAFF DEVELOPMENT IN THE TEACHING OF WRITING

   Staff development to "equip academic staff in all disciplines to achieve their
full potential as teachers of scholarly writing," the second "spoke,' is central to
CAW's mission. By working with academics on strategies for teaching writing,
CAW lecturers reach large numbers of students in a cost-effective way (Purser et
al., 2008). Subject experts who integrate explicit writing instruction into their
courses are well placed to connect generic competencies with discipline-specific
knowledge, so students have the most intellectually challenging and meaning-
ful experience of academic writing development (Monroe, 2003). Furthermore,
collaboration between writing specialists and disciplinary experts can lead to
research and publication on academic genres and pedagogic approaches for
supporting student writers, which can benefit the wider academic community
(Samuels & Deane, 2008).

   CAW lecturers provide nine hours per week of one-to-one staff writing con-
sultancy by appointment. The format of these appointments varies according to
the issues a colleague wishes to tackle, which can include designing written as-
sessments, providing timely and constructive feedback, or supporting students
with academic integrity and avoiding plagiarism. During an appointment, the
Academic Writing lecturer asks the subject-based colleague about the strengths
and weaknesses he or she has perceived in a particular cohort of students, and
together they establish a goal for a targeted teaching intervention to address a
priority issue. For instance, if they plan to improve the students' ability to pro-
duce well-structured written work that addresses the assignment brief, they may
aim to introduce a formative assessment into a course to give students guided
practice and feedback the students can implement in their summative assess-
ment task. Writing specialists recommend readings and resources to support
the intervention, helping to produce tailored teaching materials if required.
Importantly, the discipline-based teaching interventions are led by subject spe-
cialists, because they are authoritative on the content students must also master.
This is a good way to maximise the impact of writing development around
the university, because subject experts develop additional expertise in writing
pedagogies which they share with all the students they teach. This "Writing in
the Disciplines" (WiD) approach embeds writing instruction into disciplinary
teaching, and is beneficial for students because they learn how to construct and
articulate arguments in the genres of their field (Bean, 2006).

   One example of a WiD teaching intervention at Coventry is a collabora-
tion between Law specialist Dr. Steve Foster and Academic Writing lecturer
Dr. Mary Deane, who worked together to support Law students' transition to
university and adoption of legal writing conventions, including referencing,

194
                                                                           Coventry University (England)

analysis of cases, and formal expression (Strong, 2006, p. 8). Foster, in con-
sultation with Deane, taught legal writing to 150 students on Coventry's LLB
Law Degree in their first term at university through an intervention that lasted
for five weeks of the 10-week long autumn term. The teaching was informed
by the premise that academic study involves learning about genres as well as
developing disciplinary knowledge (Monroe, 2003). Foster and Deane were
also influenced by the Australian "Developing Academic Literacies in Context"
(DALiC) approach to embedding the teaching of academic genres into subject
courses (Skillen et al., 1999).

   Compared to the previous year's cohort, the majority of students produced
more structured assignments with more appropriate paragraphing, whilst many
showed an improved ability to cite and evaluate legal sources. There was also
evidence that the students were more capable of addressing and answering the
set question than previous cohorts. Most of the students improved their basic
legal essay writing as a result of this WiD intervention, and encouraged by this,
Foster and Deane shared their methods with colleagues in the Law department,
and Foster developed further resources to address issues they felt they had not
fully resolved. This collaboration has also contributed to Foster and Deane's
research profiles (e.g., Foster & Deane, 2011) and to CAW's eligibility to par-
ticipate in Coventry University's submission to the UK's national Research Ex-
cellence Framework (REF) exercise.10

    STAFF AND POSTGRADUATE SCHOLARLY WRITING

   The third "spoke" of CAW's mission statement, "to equip academic staff
in all disciplines to achieve their full potential as authors of scholarly writing,"
also contributes to the university's applied research and publication agenda
and is valued by many academics and postgraduates. CAW facilitates staff and
postgraduate writing development by offering writing consultations, Scholarly
Writing Retreats and Protected Writing Time sessions that make it possible for
participants to progress their writing projects and publications.

   As noted in the previous section, CAW lecturers offer staff writing consul-
tancy by appointment. In addition to obtaining advice about teaching writing,
academics and postgraduates can attend these appointments for support with
their own research and publication writing, including planning for submission,
targeting publication outputs, responding to peer reviews, managing extended
writing tasks, and preparing grant applications. The Academic Writing lecturer
completes a record of these meetings, noting the main recommendations and
action points. The lecturer reads the colleague's work-in-progress and works in

                                                                                                195
Deane and Ganobcsik-Williams

a facilitative mode, asking questions to encourage the writer to strengthen key
arguments and boost the audience appeal of a text in line with its purpose and
genre.

   In addition to individual staff consultations, CAW lecturers facilitate Pro-
tected Writing Time sessions for postgraduates and academics. Sessions usually
last for two hours and the format is flexible but requires:

   1. A writing specialist available to read work-in-progress
   2. Participants with a plan for the session
   3. A quiet space with no distractions
   Participants are responsible for using this protected time efficiently, and fa-
cilitators have found that writers' productivity increases the more familiar they
become with this time-bound and focused approach to writing (Murray, 2009).
As this type of provision directly addresses CAW's mission to promote writ-
ers' independence, facilitators often adopt a non-interventionist approach (e.g.,
Clark, 2001), which can be surprisingly fruitful once participants have learnt
how to develop realistic writing objectives.
   Scholarly Writing Retreats, which CAW has been running since 2006, are
an extended type of protected writing time that allows participants to establish
a more sustained writing rhythm and the opportunity to fulfill a substantial
writing objective (Murray, 2009). Retreats support writers in becoming more
independent because they foster strategies for managing limited time to com-
plete a specific writing task, and delegates often feel motivated when they realise
just how productive they can be to use the strategies they learn on Retreats to
inform their daily writing routines.
   Participants attend a one-hour planning workshop a month before the event,
where they identify the amount and type of writing they will produce during
each half-day period. Participants are also informed that they will be expected
to deliver a short presentation at the close of the Retreat about the writing they
have produced and the extent to which they achieved their main goal. These
presentations allow delegates to obtain feedback from peers and help them to
stay focused by making Retreats outcome-orientated.

                               CONCLUSION

   Within a national higher education climate in which the subject of "writing
development" has only recently begun to be recognised, CAW has developed
its mission and established writing provision to meet the needs of university
students and staff.11 Arising from this context, CAW has tried to be strategic in
creating forms of provision that are targeted but flexible. The need for a fluid

196

approach to writing development is paramount in the face of economic chal-
lenges that are now affecting the UK, with reduction in government funding for
higher education heralding budget cuts across the sector. Whilst CAW will con-
tinue working toward the aims articulated in its mission statement, CAW staff
are aware that in terms of sustainability, the means of achieving these aims may
need to adapt and change. CAW's provision, therefore, will continue to evolve.
One direction will be writing and technology, as CAW currently is preparing to
introduce its online component, the Coventry Online Writing Lab (COWL),
to offer synchronous and asynchronous online writing support.12

   Another direction will be to launch an "MA in Academic Writing Theory
and Practice," which will engage with the international community of Academ-
ic Writing scholars and practitioners and which CAW staff are taking through
the university's course approval process at present.13 A third direction may be to
begin a student peer tutoring scheme, to fulfil the university's commitment to
providing work opportunities for students and to enhancing students' employ-
ability by providing work experiences to help them to gain graduate jobs.

   This profile essay has outlined the history and mission of CAW as well as the
range of Academic Writing provision offered by this UK-based writing centre.
In detailing the three spokes of CAW's existing activity--student writing, staff
development in the teaching of writing, and staff and postgraduate scholarly
writing--as well as its evolving possibilities, the profile has demonstrated how
the active engagement by CAW staff in both teaching and research is integral
to all areas of the writing centre's work. In each of these ways, the Centre for
Academic Writing functions as a hub for writing development and research at
Coventry University.

As early as 1979 there was an attempt to set up a US-university-style writing cen-

                                                                                                197

tre modelled on those in US universities at Newcastle Polytechnic (now Northumbria
University) (Hebron, 1984, p. 92), and another, in 2002, at the University of Glasgow,
Crichton Campus. CAW was the first centrally-funded UK university writing centre
and has served as a model upon which other universities have drawn (e.g., London Met,
Gloucestershire, Liverpool Hope, Limerick).

4. Staff from Coventry University's Maths Support Centre, established in the early
1990s, contributed their experience of setting up and managing a centre to the univer-
sity's conversation about a writing centre (Reed, 2004).

5. The name "Effective Academic Writing Centre" was recommended by the com-
mittee. Other names considered were "Literacy Centre," "Learner Development Cen-
tre," "Learning Skills Drop-in Centre," and "Academic Writing Skills Support Centre"
(Noon, 2003).

6. A further factor enabling the creation of the centre was the existence of a vacant
space in an old building and the plan to re-locate to a purpose-built suite of rooms upon
completion of the university's new student centre building. This purpose-built space
proving too small, in 2007 CAW was relocated instead to a self-contained annexe in a
central ground-floor position adjacent to the Coventry University Library.

THINKING WRITING AT

QUEEN MARY, UNIVERSITY OF

LONDON

By Teresa McConlogue, Sally Mitchell, and Kelly Peake
Queen Mary, University of London (England)

In this contribution we outline and discuss the work of Thinking Writ-
ing at Queen Mary, University of London. Thinking Writing seeks,
through a focus on writing, to facilitate professional development and
enhanced teaching, assessment and curriculum design. We describe
how the initiative has developed over a 10-year period, the range of
activities it now encompasses, and the theoretical orientations and re-
sources from which it draws. To explain the negotiated way in which
the Thinking Writing team typically works, we give an account of our
involvement with processes of change in a single department of the uni-
versity. We note that our approach does not assume particular models
of writing nor measure success in terms of the "written product"; and
we consider the potential future impact on our work of new strategic
initiatives that articulate "writing" as an explicit goal.

   Queen Mary, University of London is a highly regarded research-intensive
university in east London with 3,000 staff and 16,000 students in three fac-
ulties: Humanities and Social Science, Science and Engineering, and Medi-
cine and Dentistry. Based centrally in the Language and Learning Unit (LLU),
Thinking Writing (TW) is an established team whose activity centres on the
development of writing as a pedagogical tool and outcome within the main-
stream of disciplinary teaching and learning across the institution. The team is
staff- rather than student-facing, its aim being to assist academic departments
with their educational work (designing modules and programmes, setting and
assessing assignments, enhancing student learning) specifically through the lens
of writing. TW was begun in 2001 as a three-year project with a part-time
coordinator. Drawing inspiration from Writing in the Disciplines at Cornell
University, the project was made possible by Teaching Quality Enhancement
funds allocated to UK higher education institutions and, in our case, bid for

internally.1 Since then it has grown significantly and now comprises the coordi-
nator and a team of three permanent advisors.

   The location of TW in the LLU has been a factor in its successful growth
thus far; income-generating foundation programmes for international students
are central to the LLU's remit and these have enabled Alan Evison (head of the
LLU) and Nigel Relph, Director of Corporate Affairs (the organisational area in
which the LLU sits) to demonstrate their commitment to TW's goals through
financial cross-subsidy. Over the period of TW's existence, however, interest
in issues of student writing has also moved higher up the institution's wider
teaching and learning agenda. So in January 2009, for example, the Vice Prin-
cipal for Teaching and Learning created a "Student Writing Working Group"
charged with taking an overview of the current situation at Queen Mary, iden-
tifying priorities and making recommendations for future work. At the same
time, the institution has also formulated a "Statement of Graduate Attributes,"
which includes a commitment to "developing graduates who use writing for
learning and reflection" (QMUL, 2010).

   These recent developments suggest a continuing and perhaps increasingly
significant role for Thinking Writing at QM, and it is timely that we should
have occasion, through the writing of this profile essay, to reflect on the kind of
work we predominantly do, and why.

   As the TW team has grown, we have been able to extend our range of ac-
tivities, and these now include funding and supporting departmental working
groups and professional development schemes, developing models of co-teach-
ing, and conducting small scale research. This year we have begun to run "Ur-
ban Writing Retreats" for staff and postgraduate students, as a way of support-
ing their practice and productivity whilst encouraging reflection on the writing
process and passing on ideas that may be incorporated into teaching. Hoping
to enrich our insights into pre-university learning, we have also used small scale
funding to work on writing with students and teachers in local schools. As
we have done from the beginning, we continue to put on cross-disciplinary
exchange of practice fora, but we have moved away from offering short work-
shops, designed and led by us, taking the view that although they provide some
visibility for our ideas, they tend not to be very effective in establishing collab-
orative relationships over time.2

   Most fundamentally our work is characterised by an ethnographic orienta-
tion; we do not expect to find sufficient meaning in textual objects themselves,
but rather take the complex "natural habitat" in which writing occurs as the
object of our understanding and activity (Geertz, 1983). Theoretically, this ap-
proach draws on insights from UK Academic Literacies work (see Lillis & Scott,
2008, for overview), though we have less focus on individual students than

many studies in that field. In practice our holistic/contextual orientation means
that, in some cases, our work centres on using writing to explore and express
ideas in the subject, while in others it is more concerned with developing ways
of improving students' texts, often by focusing on process. We've found that
overreliance on the "learning to write/writing to learn" division can be unpro-
ductive because it doesn't offer a critique of the "products" students are learning
to write and also detracts from the intense learning (shaping) that often needs
to go on in writing successfully for a disciplinary reader. For this reason ap-
proaches and studies (e.g., Hewings, 2005; Ravelli, 2005) that offer linguistic
explanations for perceived qualitative differences amongst student texts offer
a useful resource for some of our work. More generally, we view learners as
actively constructing their understanding of disciplinary concepts and articulat-
ing these through writing; it is through writing (at least in a UK context) that
students can begin to participate in the discourse community of their academic
discipline (Northedge, 2003).

                   HOW WE WORK - AN EXAMPLE

                                  Background

   This section will bring to life the kind of developmental activity that is key
to Thinking Writing's work with academic disciplinary staff and departments
by presenting a skeleton account of work over the 2009-10 academic year with
colleagues in the School of Biological and Chemical Sciences (SBCS). This
work picks up on earlier involvement of TW with SBCS and is still evolving
as we write. It is fairly characteristic in that it eschews any particular model of
writing or writing development, and involves the negotiation of contested be-
liefs and practices, relating not only to writing but also to the way knowledge is
conceived and curricula are designed.

   When Sally Mitchell came to QM in 2001, an early meeting with the Head
of Biology led to invitations to observe and talk with staff teaching on the In-
tegrated Studies in Biological Sciences module (ISBS). Taught at second and
third year level to all students in small tutorial groups, with the majority of aca-
demic teachers involved, the module aims to help students make connections
across the sub-disciplines of biology. When Sally became involved, however,
there was perceived dissatisfaction amongst staff and students, with the former
disappointed by the quality of the essays students were producing. A plan was
hatched to create a more structured and uniform approach to running tutorials
with sequenced reading, writing and discussion activities; this was piloted by a

                                                                                                205
McConlogue, Mitchell, and Peake

group of volunteer staff. When the overall response was positive, all Biology staff
were asked to adopt the approach. It was also decided to redesign a compulsory
first year "skills" course, Essential Skills for Biologists (ESB), to introduce more
reading and writing tasks. As for ISBS, these tasks, focussed on reasonably gen-
eral, controversial topics, would be part of work in tutorial groups led by almost
every member of the teaching staff. The assumption, incorrect as it turned out,
was that all tutors would be comfortable addressing the chosen topics. The
speedy development and apparent staff buy-in for the approaches and materials
developed for these modules was on the face of it a success for TW. Nonetheless,
Sally had reservations; for TW, "writing in the disciplines" implies that writing
be fully part and parcel of an integrated curriculum, in which, as Barnett and
Coate (2005, p. 56) put it, ``disciplinary content" and "disciplinary skills . . .
take in each other's washing." Separating the development of skills from the
acquisition of disciplinary content and making writing (essays) the subject of
the teaching rather than part of a process of wider learning, she felt that the ESB
module in particular was at best "semi-integrated" (Warren, 2002) and in TW's
terms, therefore, problematic. Once the revised modules were established, how-
ever, opportunities for critical re-engagement with TW dwindled and it was
some time before Thinking Writing was able to re-engage in detailed discussion
about work in Biology.

                     Getting Back into Conversation

   In summer 2009, however, the School initiated a review of ESB and ISBS
and invited TW to participate. Early meetings threw up some key differences in
the way TW and disciplinary staff were thinking about the modules.

   The perception amongst SBCS staff was that the modules needed to cover
more "transferable skills," including critical thinking. On the TW side we were
more sceptical, questioning the educational justification for running modules
focussing on skills (see North, 2005). In particular we were concerned that these
modules were perceived as meeting the School's desire that students "learn to
write," whilst simultaneously narrowing the definition of writing to the skills re-
quired to "write essays." With writing thus "fixed" in these modules, no attention
was being paid to its development and potential uses in other modules; for ex-
ample, in the production of text types such as lab reports, and for purposes such
as developing and checking understanding of disciplinary processes or concepts.

   Another concern of SBCS staff was that ESB in the first year should be
streamlined and linked more clearly and formally to ISBS in the second and
third year--thus emphasising a "vertical" skills development stream through
the Schools' degree programmes. Ultimately ESB and ISBS should prepare

206

students for their final year research project, particularly for undertaking an
extended literature study. TW had reservations about overemphasising this ver-
tical structure, sensing that the more important integration should be "hori-
zontal;" that is, making links between ESB or ISBS and other modules that
students are taking at the same time, particularly as the original purpose of
ISBS had been to foster such horizontal orientation. Placing the onus on ESB
and ISBS to prepare students for the research in the final year might, we felt,
unhelpfully separate out "research skills" from the overall disciplinary develop-
ment of students--leaving all other courses to be perceived as about "content"
alone. The "content" of ESB itself was a further concern--how to find a com-
mon topic relevant to all students and staff from the wide range--ecology to
microbiology--of specialist subfields in biological sciences.

                             Some Pivotal Events

   The TW team felt we needed a longer involvement with SBCS tutors, in
order to better understand their thinking and develop a relationship. So we
sought the SBCS staff group's approval for a two-year plan, to work on review-
ing the current modules and implementing and evaluating changes. Between
October and December 2009 TW staff observed tutorials, had informal chats
and formal audio-recorded interviews with staff and students, and collected
samples of students' writing. Throughout this period, the TW team shared im-
pressions and exchanged ideas on the best way forward. These discussions and
an early analysis of the interview data formed the basis for a short report, pro-
posing changes, which was sent to the SBCS staff group in December.

   In this account we focus only on what happened in relation to ESB, leaving
out ISBS, where more minor changes were suggested. Key Biology staff referred
to are Brendan Curran and Caroline Brennan.

   Caroline had made the suggestion that students' learning in ESB would be
more active if a Problem Based Learning (PBL) approach were introduced. PBL
is widely used in higher education in the UK. In PBL students are presented
with "problem scenarios" (Savin-Baden, 2003, p. 2) which they usually work on
in groups, deciding what information is needed and how they should go about
addressing the problem. Typically these scenarios have no correct answer. Pur-
suing the PBL idea further, Caroline pointed out that in order to introduce PBL
it would be necessary to identify some problems that all staff and students could
relate to--a return to the vexed issue of the common topic. As we explored this
issue, Caroline mentioned that all Biology students need a good grasp of experi-
mental design; this is essential for their third-year projects and is an area that
all staff have expertise in. We proposed therefore that tutors should think about

                                                                                                207
McConlogue, Mitchell, and Peake

a problem within their field and relevant to work in other first-year modules,
present it to students and ask them to think about ways of solving it. The tutor
would then guide students' thinking through questioning; e.g., "You want to
investigate X, what would you do? What makes a good experiment?" and help
students think about interpreting results--"What is this telling you?" To help
students think through experimental design, tutors would devise exploratory
writing tasks, similar to the current short writing tasks in ESB. Thus, we defined
the "common topic" as a way of thinking, rather than a content area.

   Following this discussion, TW organised an exchange of practice that gave
Caroline the opportunity to present her thinking to colleagues from other dis-
ciplines and get their feedback. A further breakthrough occurred when Brendan
secured funding to replace some ESB tutorial slots with an e-Forum, giving
students opportunities for online group interaction. TW facilitated a meeting
between Brendan and Caroline to discuss redesigning the new course, making
aspects of experimental design the topic for online writing and discussion tasks.
These tasks would begin to build towards the kind of thinking and writing
students needed to do for third-year project work, while the new topic would
provide an opportunity to move away from the emphasis on essay writing, and
to introduce a new more discipline-specific text type, a mini-grant proposal.

   At the time of writing this profile essay the proposed changes have been sub-
mitted to the SBCS staff group for approval and we will need a further meeting
with the Head of School to agree on further TW work with Biology, including
detailed planning of the revised module, and evaluation to provide tutors with
evidence for future modifications.

                                  Reflections

   As our example indicates, the primary focus of TW's work is on supporting
the professional development of colleagues involved in teaching and the en-
hancement of disciplinary teaching, curricula, and assessment. We may be dis-
tinct from many of our colleagues in the UK field of staff and educational devel-
opment in that we use our various theoretically--and empirically--informed
understandings of writing to think about issues in teaching and learning. Yet
we have in common with this group an interest in understanding how change
occurs in educational institutions (Wareing & Elvidge, 2007) and how we can
develop thriving collaborative relationships with academic teachers, working
towards creating enhanced opportunities for learning at university.

   We hope the example illustrates what we have found about effective collabo-
ration: that it requires time to establish relationships with tutors, to establish
trust and to understand their concerns and the context in which they work.

208

Observations, informal and formal interviews with tutors and students, and
developing a greater awareness of tutors' teaching contexts through collection
of relevant documents (e.g., module descriptions, samples of students' written
work) all help us to get a feel for the situation and to recognise the knowledge
and expertise of our colleagues in their discipline and as teachers. We expect to
challenge and question our colleagues, bringing in alternative understandings
and ideas; and we expect to be challenged (about, for example, the practical
constraints on teaching in contemporary higher education) and to glimpse (if
not fully grasp) new insights into disciplinary thinking. Such partnership work
is rarely straightforward, steady or completed, but is open to chance, and char-
acterised by the kinds of stops and starts, twists and turns we experienced with
Caroline in identifying a common topic (something we are still not sure will
be acceptable to all tutors). The work is also heavily negotiated: in the example,
some steps we advised, like a larger programme review, were dismissed as op-
tions, but at the same time elements previously unmoveable, like reliance on the
essay as a default text for ESB, became more flexible.

   Although we regard the 2009-2010 academic year as a positive collabora-
tion with Biology we are aware that its practical outcomes remain uncertain.
We have been working with only five SBCS tutors (two most closely), and
plans still need to be formulated and presented to the wider staff for agreement.
Moreover, as with the earlier design of ESB and ISBS, we will not know how
the module structure and materials are actually being interpreted by the approx
25 tutors involved in running small group tutorials. The way in which handed-
down teaching ideas and materials are "domesticated" by individual teachers
is well acknowledged (Mangubhai et al., 2007) and we try to be aware of this
in contributing to their design. It's also a fact that in the frequently changing
structure of departments, staff often rotate teaching responsibilities, and the
teaching materials and practices that are the result of collaboration with one
group of teachers can be differently applied or conceived by new teachers on a
course. At times this may happen in ways that are at odds with the original goals
of the material or with TW philosophy, but may seem more appropriate for the
new teacher or new context.

   These insights bring us to the recognition that the virtue of collaboration
does not so much lie in the artefacts (modules, materials) it generates, as in
the ongoing transactions between individual teachers, students and those like
us in the development role (see Peake & Horne, in press; also Cousin, 2008).
Locating value here steers us away from a sense of "job done, problem solved"
in accounting for our work.

   As writing moves up the institutional agenda at QMUL we are a little cau-
tious that its greater visibility in strategies and documents like the Statement of

                                                                                                209

Graduate Attributes may bring with it reductive demands to "solve the prob-
lem" of student writing, endorsing a view of writing as separate from learning
more generally (see Mitchell, 2010). At the same time, however, our experi-
ence encourages us to be confident of our collaborative, negotiated approach to
working with departments, our rejection of single or simple models of writing,
and our emphasis instead on the potential for writing to play a highly integra-
tive role in the complex jigsaw of university learning. In the next year or so we
will see how the top-down agenda of the institution and the bottom-up practice
in which we daily engage begin to marry up, and what adjustments we may
need to make.

Ganobcsik Williams' 2006 volume on teaching academic writing in the UK (Mitchell

2. Others have reached similar conclusions. Peters (2009) reports on a qualitative
study of staff development providers who report that "formal workshops" have been
unsuccessful; Pilkington (2006, p. 304) suggests the cause may be "`workshop over-
load;"; and Layne et al. (2002) that workshops are often one-off and "isolated" from the
tutor's context, allowing "little interaction with peers."

THE TEACHING OF

WRITING SKILLS IN FRENCH

UNIVERSITIES: THE CASE OF

THE UNIVERSITÉ STENDHAL,

GRENOBLE III

By Francoise Boch and Catherine Frier
Université Stendhal, Grenoble (France)

The article is divided into three parts. The first recounts the evolution
of the teaching of writing skills in French universities since the 1980s
and shows how university traditions in this matter have been subject
to a profound shift in recent years. The second part gives a brief pre-
sentation of the Université Stendhal in Grenoble, which was required
as of 2010, like all other universities, to put in place classes focusing
on writing skills. Finally, the third part seeks to analyze the effects of
a pedagogical measure that has been tested over the past three years at
the Université Stendhal in the context of a class in the methodology of
academic writing for first-year linguistics students. The pedagogical
methods put into practice intend to bring together knowledge (aca-
demic learning), expertise (command of written skills), and interper-
sonal skills (construction of a point of view), whilst at the same time
working both on engaging with the subject and respecting standards,
and on graphic reason and graphic creation.

   THE CHANGING FACES OF THE FRENCH UNIVERSITY

   In France, the question of teaching writing skills at university level is rela-
tively recent.1 Until the 1990s, the teaching of writing skills was considered to
be the remit of primary school (6-11 years old) and collège (12-15 years old).
Pupils were supposed to have mastered all elements of writing, in particular the
formal aspects (spelling and grammar), by the time they entered lycée educa-

tion (15-18 years old). Thus, implicitly, it was assumed that students arrived at
university with the requisite skills in this domain.

   From the 1980s onwards, the situation in France slowly began to change.2
Politically, the national aim was henceforth to attain 80% success at the bac-
calauréat3 (end of secondary education diploma providing entrance to uni-
versity, on a non-selective basis) in order to raise the level of education of
the country within a more and more competitive global scene. In parallel,
the socio-economic situation, characterized by a rise in unemployment, was
pushing young people into a race for qualifications. This led to a massive
increase in numbers of students attending university (referred to as the "de-
mocratization" of "mass" higher education), which in turn entailed a substan-
tial modification of an audience that had hitherto been fairly homogenous.
Henceforth, universities (in the Humanities and Social Sciences in particu-
lar) welcomed students from all backgrounds, including the less advantaged.

   Yet from the mid 1990s onwards a decline in numbers at public univer-
sities began and continued in a worrying manner until 2008, with holders
of the baccalauréat seeming to prefer selective vocational programmes. In
addition, another process has been accelerating since 2000 and causing a
profound shift in the demographics of higher education as it contributes to
the dwindling numbers at university. The Grandes Ecoles,4 formerly reserved
for training the nation's elite, are attracting more and more young people
from the middle and higher classes, who are eschewing university in favour of
the classes préparatoires which offer training for the entrance exams to these
prestigious institutions. In a context strongly affected by the economic crisis,
there is a general desire to choose the right strategy for success. The sacrosanct
university degree no longer affords sufficient protection against the soaring
unemployment that affects first and foremost those in the 18-25 age group.
Furthermore, the progressive withdrawal of state backing of public services
(since 2008, government policy has indicated the aim of the non-renewal of
one civil servant post in two [Conseil des Ministres, 2007]) has perhaps con-
tributed to the deterioration of the image of universities in public opinion.
That said, the most recent figures available would seem to indicate a rise in
numbers for the academic year 2009/2010 (MESR- DGESIP, 2010).

   In parallel, the national curriculum for French in primary and secondary
school education has been far heavier since 1995 than was previously the
case, and this goes hand-in-hand with a significant drop in contact hours
given over to this subject. In other words, teachers are being asked to do
far more in far less time. In such conditions, teachers of French in the col-
lèges cannot have the same expectations regarding the normative correction
of written work.

   Since 2000, we, as researchers in linguistics and writing, have seen a grow-
ing awareness of the fact that students reach university with incomplete writ-
ten skills in French. Indeed, the new students are often very surprised by the
importance that is suddenly given to the linguistic aspect of their studies and
the pressing necessity to improve their level. At the same time, academics, who
often have little training in teaching writing skills, tend to consider that it is not
up to the university to take this side of things in hand, and that it should be
dealt with beforehand. However, failure rates, relatively substantial in the first
years at university (one student in two fails their first year, according to MESR,
2011) have begun to call these assumptions into question. It is undoubtedly
the implementation of the "Réussite en Licence" or `Success in Undergraduate
Degrees' project5 by the Ministry of Higher Education in 20086 that has placed
the question of written skills in Higher Education in the public eye, whereas
previously it had remained in the background.

   Due to a sudden and unexpected influx of funds, this highly publicised
government project led to a large number of pedagogical initiatives within uni-
versities, with a view to better supporting students entering higher education,
in particular through a substantial tutorial system. At least twenty of these uni-
versities chose to place the onus on the question of written expression and in
particular upon spelling, which in France has traditionally been the locus of
debates concerning written ability. This small revolution, echoed in the press at
the start of the 2010/2011 academic year,7 led to different innovative pedagogi-
cal experiments according to the university, with a general view to allowing stu-
dents to better master the written work that they would be required to produce.

   At the Université Stendhal, which will be our focus here, the question of
teaching writing skills is somewhat older and grounded in research carried out
from 2000 onwards by a team of lecturers in linguistics and pedagogy8 (linguis-
tic knowledge and skills, usage and representations) in a pedagogical perspective
centered upon the writing subject, enabling the learner's relationship to writing
to be taken into account and helped to evolve. Before outlining one of the mea-
sures put in place by this team as part of the "plan réussite en licence," we shall
briefly describe the institution in question.

                   THE CASE OF THE UNIVERSITÉ
                      STENDHAL, GRENOBLE III

   Located in the Rhône-Alpes region (South-East France), the Université
Stendhal is a medium-sized institution (approximately 12,000 students) that
offers programmes grounded in the humanities: foreign languages and cul-

                                                                                                215

ture, linguistics, literature, and communication studies. Although, in accor-
dance with institutional expectations on a national level, this university seeks
to diversify and consolidate the professional prospects of its graduates, the skills
envisaged by the study programmes remain traditionally strongly linked with
written skills. Students enrolled in such "humanities-orientated" universities as
the Université Stendhal are often destined for teaching (primary or secondary
education, and language teaching, including French as a Foreign Language),
translation, speech therapy, journalism or business communication. In these
different domains the concours (competitive entrance examinations for train-
ing programmes, or for obtaining the professional qualification in question)
are generally highly selective, and written skills are an essential criterion albeit
a criterion that corresponds to different categories depending on the concours.
In particular, "written skills" refers to the formal elements of writing (overval-
ued in France in comparison with other countries: in France spelling mistakes
are particularly badly viewed) and the generic dimension of texts. Students in
France are trained from the lycée onwards in the production of canonical aca-
demic writing such as essays or summaries.9

   At the Université Stendhal in Grenoble, there was a desire to take this ques-
tion of training in writing skills seriously, by offering courses allowing the com-
bination of work on language (spelling and grammar) and the implication of
the writer, through a measure focusing on a genre rarely used at university:
academic fiction.

   AN INNOVATIVE MEASURE: KNOWLEDGE BUILDING
     THROUGH THE WRITING OF ACADEMIC FICTION

                          Theoretical Framework

   In this section we shall outline and analyse the effects of a pedagogical mea-
sure that has been tested over the past three years at the Université Stendhal in
the context of a class in the methodology of academic writing. This measure
originates in our team's research in reading/writing practices as modes of knowl-
edge building in Higher Education. This field has already given rise to numerous
publications,10 particularly in linguistics and didactics. This research places the
onus on the difficulties facing young students when they are first confronted with
specialist texts in their disciplines, difficulties that are essentially of two types:

   · Difficulty in approaching the "theoretical knowledge," in integrating and
       reconstructing notions and concepts in a precise manner, in problema-

216
                                                                  Université Stendhal, Grenoble (France)

       tizing, in objectivising knowledge and in including the words of others
       in their own discourse (Kara, 2004).
   · Difficulty in taking up a point of view (Rinck, 2004) and in linking
       theory and practical experience in the field (Frier, 2004).
   This research also focuses upon the heuristic function of the written text
and on the reflexive dimension of writing practice that encourages knowledge
building and the "written codification of knowledge" specific to "graphic rea-
son" (Goody, 1979).
   In this context, "graphic reason" is seen as the best tool for implement-
ing the systematic classification of reality that then allows abstraction, distance,
and scientific objectivity. Consequently, non-reflexive writing such as narration,
viewed with some suspicion, is sometimes seen as antonymic to academic dis-
course. This no doubt explains at least in part that such texts are rarely worked
upon at university.
   However, recently another side of didactics is more specifically focusing
upon the role played by narrative in the building of knowledge, and in particu-
lar of academic knowledge: in other words, the didactic function of narrative
in different disciplines (Reuter, 2007). Indeed, studies of various horizons call
into question the restrictive vision of scientific knowledge and how it is built,
by giving a place to narrative in academic teaching.
   Following Bruner's (2005) seminal works, we can formulate the following
hypotheses:
   · "Rational" thinking, imagination, and experience work in perpetual in-
       teraction in the process of elaborating academic knowledge.
   · In order for knowledge to be appropriated, it must be made to have
       resonance with personal experience and understanding: a necessary link
       must be made between the singular and the generic (two spaces that are
       usually hermetically detached in the context of formal learning).
   · It is by activating "ordinary creativity" (Chabanne & Dunas, 1999) that
       the mechanism of appropriating academic knowledge, in all its complex-
       ity and diversity, is set off.

                 The Pedagogical Project Put in Place11

   The project in question is aimed at students enrolled in the first year of Lan-
guage Sciences in a class on methodology of academic writing that entails 48
hours of contact time, divided into 24 sessions of 2 hours. This class is organized
around 6 themes (The Origins of Language; The Acquisition of Language; Birth
and Transformations of Writing; Natural Language Processing; Language and
Deafness). The pedagogical methods put into practice intend to bring together

                                                                                                217

knowledge (building of knowledge in an academic field), expertise (command
of written skills) and interpersonal skills (demystifying theoretical knowledge
and fostering confidence, appropriation of knowledge by the subject and con-
struction of a point of view). Above and beyond these aims, the intention is also
to combat the huge writerly insecurity at the beginning of undergraduate stud-
ies at university, to bring out the "unrecognized knowledge" (Penloup, 2007)
of our students, to encourage their creativity and to get them to engage in and
through writing on the path to knowledge.

   Within this new pedagogical project, the text to be produced includes fic-
tion (invented story) and narrative (situations, fictional characters or staging
of the protagonists of different debates) and is thus supposed to entertain the
reader. However, it is also a narrative showcasing ideas, a point of view on
a question, an academic problem, as well as the fictional aspect. It therefore
also has to inform the reader: the academic information has to be presented in
different forms, and within this piece of writing extracts of academic writing
are to be found: fragments of texts (quotes), notions, reformulated ideas, argu-
ments, theoretical trends, names of authors, dates, etc., are inserted as the story
unfolds. These two requirements (entertaining and informing) have to find a
balance in the text. We chose to prepare students for, and support them in, the
writing of this fictional text using writing workshops.

                             Promising Results12

   The analysis of the corpus of fictional pieces gathered in the context of this
project (2008-2011) shows that academic fiction is largely conducive to a tan-
gible and solid evolution of the written abilities of students, if they are offered
the correct support throughout the process. Each in its own way, these fictional
narratives interweave with more or less competence the elements considered to
be objective parts of academic knowledge (definitions, authors' names, theories,
dates, etc.), the fictional elements supposed to provide a context for the ques-
tion asked by the text, and elements of argumentation (point of view put for-
ward). The systematic presence of these three intentions signifies, in our view,
a considerable evolution of the abilities of the students who authored these
texts, insofar as this capacity to navigate between different stances in language is
progressively constructed through the texts produced throughout the year. The
appendix includes some commented extracts from a text entitled "At the Origin
of Writing," which illustrate this ability.

   After completing this work, the students no longer write in the same way.
Engaged over the long term both on an individual and collective level in a ritu-
alized project of training/support in writing, they progressively become aware

218
                                                                  Université Stendhal, Grenoble (France)

of the formal, but also enunciative and textual stakes of their productions. Para-
doxically, it is through a psycho-affective implication in their writing that they
manage to distance themselves from it in intellectual terms. The final quality
of the texts is often surprising, both regarding creativity and the appropriation
of academic knowledge. This is why this gamble of working in parallel on both
engaging with the subject and on respecting norms, on both graphic reason
and graphic creation, seems to have paid off in part within the context of this
experiment.

   These initial results need, of course, to be both qualified and examined in
more depth. Narratives cannot be seen as a miracle solution that could allow
students' erroneous representations, academic approximations, or methodolog-
ical problems to be erased. However, it could be said that the implicational
function of the narrative (Reuter, 2007) that allows and encourages the writing
subject's engagement with his text makes it an efficient tool for bringing to the
fore representations that can then be formalized, considered on a conscious
level, and discussed with a view to possible evolution.

   Our results show that the narrative, by linking the universe of concepts
to that of the subject's affect, sensory perception, and dreams, contributes to
combining "graphic creation" and "graphic reason." It generates emotions,
sensations, and ideas all at once. This is why it should find a legitimate place
alongside the other genres of writing used in building and assessing knowledge
at university: by putting thought into movement, the narrative creates the right
kind of chemistry for producing results and promoting discovery.

                                  SUMMARY

   The project described above is an example of a pedagogical initiative that
has recently proven its worth. This initiative has become part of the curriculum
for Language Sciences degrees. Moreover, our team is now writing a textbook
for French teachers who would like to implement effective literacy pedagogy
in their classes. However, in France this kind of initiative remains relatively
marginal and localized. In the absence of training centres in teaching writing
skills--unlike many other Western countries--and of national programmes in
the subject, the French university system is not yet ready to respond in an or-
ganized fashion to students' weaknesses in the field of written work. Although
descriptive analyses of students' written production abound in the emerg-
ing field of academic literacy, these only rarely give rise to carefully thought
out pedagogical actions, which, moreover, remain on a local level and are not
shared. We would therefore argue strongly in favour of the training of future

                                                                                                219

higher education practitioners--training that remains insufficiently developed
in France--to take this dimension into account. It is undoubtedly through
training that pedagogical practice in academic writing and literacy has a chance
of progressing.

within the grandes écoles and specialist institutions generally take place over five years,
including two initial years of training for the entrance examinations to these institu-
tions. The very principle of the grandes écoles is controversial. They are criticized in
particular for being a tool for social reproduction. Indeed, although the majority of
grandes écoles are public and free (with the exception of those in business studies), the
funding allocated per student by the state is considerably greater than at university, and
the students in question tend in general to be from higher social classes: a sort of "back-
to-front redistribution" to use Lebègue & Walter's (2008) phrase.

French system, after three years of university education.

                    APPENDIX: TEXT BY JULIE, A FIRST YEAR
                        STUDENT IN LANGUAGE SCIENCES

   The heroine of the story is a student who has been imprisoned following
a raid and who, from the depth of her cell, is trying to understand what hap-
pened: who betrayed her and why. However, her efforts are in vain as, deprived
of everything, and in particular of writing, she is unable to organise her ideas:
"without a medium, I couldn't manage to sort out my thoughts. My anger
got in the way of my ideas, and so did the fatigue. I needed to set things out,
sort through what I could remember and structure my memory." The heroine's
quest is thus to be able to write because writing alone can help her to find her
past, to think and to move forward. The situation-problem raised by this narra-
tive is thus clearly identified from the outset and placed in a double perspective:
the question of finding a way to write and of recovering the primitive source of
writing.

   The explicative aim of the text alternates between two levels of response to
these issues:

   1) the first is grounded in matter and in reverie: "For several days, I had
been mechanically using my spoon to etch small vertical lines into the soft wood
of the old plank that served as a bed for me, so as to count the days and try and
regain some points of reference in time. I had done this without thinking. The
primary graphic scratching was the only way for me to occupy my hands and my

222
                                                                  Université Stendhal, Grenoble (France)

mind . . . I imagined that I was in a prehistoric cave, scratching small mammoths
and sketching out the first steps of writing ...."

   From a psychoanalytical point of view, the resonance of this extract with the
notion of a return to limbo, a return to the original womb that precedes rational
thought, can be underlined.

   2) The second level of response refers to objective knowledge: "I sud-
denly remembered a text by Jack Goody, an English anthropologist who, follow-
ing his imprisonment in Italy during the Second World War, had written a book
about writing. I seemed to recall that he referred to the difficulty of thinking and
bringing together ideas without the medium of writing. In "The Consequence of
Literacy," he had explained the veritable intellectual mutilation that was the im-
possibility of reading or writing . . . I had the remedy for my torture as an erudite!"

   These two extracts illustrate the way this text regularly shifts between a met-
aphorical, dreamlike thinking, grounded in the material nature of the elements
(here soil) and a more rational mode of thinking, working on the basis of stable
reference points (dates, author's name, title of book, concepts) and of objective
facts. Hence the idea of obtaining some soil, in secret, on the daily outing in the
prison courtyard so as to make slabs of clay from it in order to write: "I threw
myself to the ground on my stomach and began to scratch away at the moist soil so as
to stuff large handfuls of it into the pockets of my trousers and coat. . . . With the end
of my bent spoon, I implanted my alphabet into substance. . . . I felt like a modern
Sumerian in Mesopotamia, engraving my clay tablets in 3500 BC!"

   The ending of the narrative excels at this intertwining and contrives to create
an almost inextricable mixture of objective arguments imbued with concrete ex-
perience and traces of the initial reverie: "And so I began again my cuneiform mix-
tures with each of the heaps I had kept under my bed, and once the tablets were full
and dry I hid them beneath my covers, safe from harm. Each grapheme rooted in the
earth freed my mind a little further and made room for a larger reflection. I could
list names, reformulate my notes, and remember details without further cluttering
my memory . . . Everything became more visual at last and far clearer. I could easily
understand how our "civilisation of the written word" had been an intellectual leap
for mankind--I was experiencing this revolution firsthand! The long Darwinian
trains of my thought could now be uncoupled and recoupled on command. It was as
if I were putting my brain in a computer and printing everything that was inside,
so as to then be able to erase from my memory what was now before my eyes, leaving
twice as much space as before! I had understood the technology of words... but above
all, the name of the traitor now sprung to mind with clarity."

LITERACY DEVELOPMENT

PROJECTS INITIATING

INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE

By Gerd Bräuer and Katrin Girgensohn
University of Education, Freiburg, and European University
Viadrina Frankfurt/Oder (Germany)

In this chapter, two literacy development projects will be introduced
as a means of initiating institutional development with regard to the
role of writing in higher education and beyond. In the first portrait
Katrin Girgensohn presents Gerd Bräuer's model of literacy manage-
ment. Through Gerd's eyes, she will shed light on the role of a special-
ist, called "literacy manager," whose profile is taking shape in educa-
tional and professional settings as someone to initiate and facilitate
substantial change not only in the daily practice of writers and readers
but in the literacy culture of entire institutions. In the second portrait
Gerd Bräuer presents Katrin Girgensohn as a pioneer of literacy man-
agement and her model of autonomous academic writing groups in
Germany's higher education. Through Katrin's eyes, he will shed light
especially on the role of the faculty and the writing center in facilitat-
ing such groups of writers.

   When Gerd, who grew up in the former East Germany and had also lived
for several years in Prague (Czech Republic), joined the University of Oregon in
1992 as a post-doctoral fellow, he had no clue about what literacy management
could mean. As a matter of fact, at that time he had barely started to grasp a
notion of writing pedagogy. As he says himself, looking back, at his research on
US writing pedagogy during the early 1990s, writing pedagogy for him at that
time was merely teaching methods and techniques related to creative writing.

Bräuer and Girgensohn

Having worked on a PhD thesis in the late 1980s on the German dramatist
Bertolt Brecht, he adapted Brecht's strategy of handling writing in the differ-
ent literary genres as a means of constructing knowledge for his teaching in the
field of German studies. Already at the time of his PhD thesis (1989), Gerd
understood writing, based on Bertolt Brecht's aesthetic concept (Brecht, 1957),
as a mode of learning that applies to the act of text production as well as to the
act of receiving texts though the audience. While Brecht imagined this collab-
orative learning between those who write and those who read/watch as part of
the theatre as a truly educational institution, Gerd envisioned this learning for
schools and universities. With this vision he went to the US, where he hoped
to learn from the rich experience of Anglo-Saxon writing pedagogy that he had
started to encounter through his academic research.

   It took Gerd about ten years of work and two monographs, one on US
writing pedagogy (1996), one on adapting Anglo-Saxon writing pedagogy for
the existing writing culture in the German-speaking countries (1998), before
his ideas received some attention in his home country. In 2000, he was asked
by a small university of education (Freiburg/Germany) to set up the first writ-
ing center in European teacher education. From the beginning of his work
in Freiburg, his main focus was on "training the trainers" so that the changes
he suggested for the role of writing in teacher education would trickle down
the educational pyramid and trigger similar changes in primary and secondary
education. Early he saw the need for providing knowledge to student teachers
and in-service teachers with regard to strengthening sustainability of outcomes
of individual projects on writing and reading. When Gerd started a certificate
program for writing coaches at the Freiburg Writing Center in 2003, he not
only wanted to foster the development of active writers and readers in various
educational settings, but also intensify the impact of the many creative ideas of
individual instructors in higher education and in professional training.

   Despite the more than 100 graduates of the certificate program so far, he to-
day sees the limitations of training that focuses solely on coaching writers. Too
often in the past years he witnessed his graduates struggling and reaching their
limits of professional development quickly, simply because they didn't know
enough about how to initiate institutional change toward redefining the role of
writing as a mode of learning instead of a mere mode of knowledge reproduc-
tion and presentation. He started to understand that these writing coaches also
needed specific expertise in how to initiate and set up writing programs and/or
writing centers.

   He, therefore, coined the term literacy management (Bräuer, 2011) and
conceptualized a specific training for literacy managers. Based on Gerd's de-
scription in our interview, literacy management aims for the optimization of

226
                 University of Education, Freiburg, and European University Viadrina (Germany)

the individual handling of information and of the flow of texts between writers
and readers within and beyond institutional settings and local cultures of lit-
eracy. The International Literacy Management Consortium, initiated by Gerd
and others, sees literacy management as an "emerging professional field at the
intersection of literacy research, pedagogy of reading and writing, instructional
design, and institutional development" (see homepage of http://www.interna-
tional-literacy-management.org).

   From my own experience as a writing pedagogue in secondary and higher
education, I can clearly see the demand for literacy management is develop-
ing rapidly due to a profound transition from the so-called information age
to the so-called knowledge age that is being initiated and shaped by a growing
variety of literacies and the specific demands of each of them. As with labeling
of any other emerging professional field, terminology to describe the specific
features of literacy management has not been established yet. Therefore, differ-
ent names, such as knowledge worker, writing coach, or educational analyst are
currently in use synonymously to speak of the same area of interest.

   So, what do literacy managers in Gerds's vision actually do? He says the
contour of a field of practice becomes more alive when listing individual tasks
and highlighting those that carve out a specific profile of action. Gerd sees lit-
eracy managers juggle the potential, demands, and challenges of the different
literacies such as "computer literacy," "digital literacy," "multimodal literacies"
(Jewitt & Kress, 2003), "visual literacies" (ibid.), and critical literacy in order to
solve problems with efficient handling of information by individuals within the
larger framework of schools, universities, companies, and/or organizations. For
that, as Gerd tells me in his interview, literacy managers

   1. Analyze the current state of both handling information in general and
       specifically in text production, distribution, and reception, including
       visual, audio, spatial, behavioral aspects of forms of representation of
       meaning, within their home institution and beyond;

   2. Assess the quality of the latter processes and try to determine a price tag
       for any loss of information and/or understanding of texts in order to
       quantify the urgency of change;

   3. Identify the current needs of the main stakeholders with regard to in-
       house communication and the flow of information beyond;

   4. Develop concepts and prototypes for optimizing the management of lit-
       eracies within the organization;

   5. Test and assess procedures, methods, materials, and training programs in
       order to further develop and successfully implement them;

   6. Initiate necessary structural change within the institution and facilitate
       steering groups in this matter.

                                                                                                227
Bräuer and Girgensohn

   (For applications of these principles in various German-speaking institu-
tions, see the Bräuer essay in this volume.)

         Gerd wants us to read this list also as an overview of expertise needed
to support livelong learners in understanding and actively living local and
global differences. In this process, literacy managers make strategic use of
the differences each individual involved contributes to an institution. This
way of seeing opens up not only new opportunities to understand one's own
way of writing, reading, and handling of information, but to optimize exist-
ing literacy resources of an entire institution. Gerd in our conversation also
stressed the role of literacy managers as change agents in shaping local cultures
of readers and writers who interact with global practices. The list provided
by Gerd above can also be read as an overall procedure in managing litera-
cies. This procedure is based on the key principles of instructional design: (a)
Analysis of learner characteristics and the learning environment; (b) Design of
learning objectives and instructional approach; (c) Development of instruc-
tional frameworks and training materials (prototype); (d/e) Implementation
and evaluation of the prototype in action.

         As a result of this overall procedure the following tasks could be
performed as part of literacy management projects: establishment of writing/
reading centers; development of literacy programs and workshops for primary/
secondary schools, colleges, and universities, and professional training; estab-
lishment of (e-) portfolio systems; conducting in-house staff/faculty training;
development of self-learning material for students and instructors; research,
assessment, and optimization of existing literacy processes in the institution;
constructing an overall literacy culture in the institution that is beneficial for
peer feedback and tutoring; development and testing of diagnostic procedures,
methods, and materials.

   To perform those tasks successfully, literacy managers need specialized train-
ing that Gerd several years ago had hoped to establish at the University of Edu-
cation in Freiburg. However, realizing a vision of this scope requires patience
and persistence, and the willingness to work within an institution's constraints.
Gerd's experience at the University of Education/Freiburg illustrates typical chal-
lenges a literacy manager faces and offers an example of slow but steady progress.

   To Gerd, the writing center at Education/Freiburg still plays a limited role in
the institution. While he envisions the writing center as a place of instructing,
coaching, and facilitating writers and readers from different literacy domains,
the university still sees the center fulfilling the service function of providing
hands-on help to beginning students in their status as rather inexperienced aca-
demic writers--despite the wide range of projects, publications, and expertise
that resulted from the effort of the writing center team.

228

   In order to make sense of this limitation, it is important to provide some
information on the University of Education Freiburg, which is located in the
South-western corner of Germany. The region of Freiburg borders France to
the west and Switzerland to the south. The city of about 250,000 inhabitants is
the home to a large research university and several small professional universi-
ties, one of them being the University of Education. There, teacher education
for primary and secondary schools and professional training is offered. Like the
other small professional schools in town, the University of Education puts a lot
of effort into profiling itself against the large university in Freiburg. Instead of
focusing this effort on what is known and performed best here--professional
training--this college tries to raise attention with large-scale pedagogical re-
search projects carried out by a few established faculty. Any entity of the Uni-
versity of Education that would not be able to carry out, for whatever reason,
such large-scale research projects is doomed to stick to a rather limited profile
of a service institution.

   Nevertheless, the center has achieved a vital place in the university's cul-
ture. The writing center itself is a rather small but attractive space right next
to the cafeteria and frequented daily by the majority of students and faculty.
When Gerd accepted the university's invitation to develop a writing center in
2001, he urged the institution to provide this central location, which he saw as
urgently necessary in order to get a new and mainly unknown entity such as a
writing center off the ground. Gerd remembers his first day on campus, when
the provost for teaching showed him around in order to find a decent place for
the writing center:

         After the provost took me to two far-away locations on the edge
         of campus, which he suggested to me as possible places for the
         writing center, he was about to take me for lunch to the cafeteria
         in the heart of the campus. I spotted a room of about 50 qm,
         with all glass walls, right next to the entrance to the cafeteria. To
         my curious question about what this room was for, he answered
         with hesitation in his voice that is was reserved for staff meetings
         of the president's office. When I told him this would be the ideal
         place for getting a writing center started successfully due to its
         central location and its transparency, I noticed his body stiffen-
         ing and he didn't comment at all. The next day, he called to tell
         me that the university president agreed to assign the room to
         the writing center. I was in awe and, at that time, very hope-
         ful to also successfully move writing more toward the center of
         academic life in the years to come (Bräuer, 2002).

                                                                                                229
Bräuer and Girgensohn

   Nevertheless, what seemed promising in the beginning wasn't easy in the
process of defining the role of the writing center beyond a "fixit shop" (North
1987). It was not before the success of an EU-sponsored project called "Scrip-
torium," which Gerd directed from 2005 until 2008 (see also Bräuer, 2009;
and Bräuer, this volume) that the writing center gained substantial attention
among the university's faculty. This project brought together teams of literacy
specialists from eight European countries who developed a modularized train-
ing program for student teachers and in-service teachers in reading and writing
development and support. As a result, high school writing/reading centers ap-
peared in Poland, Denmark, Finland, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Switzer-
land, and Germany. Training materials in the first languages of these countries
as well as in French and English can be accessed through an e-learning platform
( http://www.scriptorium-project.org) where teachers gather not only for in-
house workshops but also exchange ideas and experience across the educational
pyramid and across national borders.

   With this training program in place, Gerd had hoped to lay the foundation
for further steps in institutional development at the University of Education,
Freiburg. The university, unfortunately, was neither able on a financial basis nor
willing in conceptual terms to move on toward a full-fledged WAC and WID
concept. Writing training remained isolated in German studies and in the writ-
ing center, although the latter instituted additional certificate courses on jour-
nalistic education and on portfolio instruction in secondary education. These
courses are sometimes team-taught by colleagues from the German studies de-
partment, foreign languages department, and the departments of education and
psychology. Gerd still hopes that this interdisciplinary effort will, in the near
future, result in a more substantial change with regard to a more central role of
writing in all parts of teacher education in Freiburg.

   Symptomatic of this very slow pace in institutional development is what
has been happening since 2007 with regard to implementing portfolios as an
emerging genre of academic teaching and learning and an alternative form of
individual and institutional assessment. Despite the fact that the university
sponsored the development of a concept and testing of a prototype, the institu-
tion is currently not ready to engage in all consequences necessary to success-
fully implement a college-wide ePortfolio system; i.e., mandating a steering
group by the university president. While some changes have already been made
to the exam rules and guidelines, the university was not willing yet to make a
firm commitment to a well-working ePortfolio web application. While recent
portfolio research (e.g., Baumgartner et al., 2009) does provide enough evi-
dence and guidance on the best digital applications, this research is not being
discussed freely and openly among the faculty. The part of the administrative

230
                 University of Education, Freiburg, and European University Viadrina (Germany)

structure that is responsible for e-learning follows closely the recommenda-
tions provided by a central committee for all teacher colleges in the state of
Baden-Württemberg. Since the discourse of this committee is not communi-
cated openly with local faculty members, many of them feel disempowered and,
therefore, discouraged to contribute to finding a solution that would meet the
real needs with regard to ePortfolio in Freiburg's teacher training.

   A similar situation can be witnessed with regard to further developing the
literacy management approach established already some years ago with the
Scriptorium training program. The development of a necessary MA program
on literacy management has been postponed indefinitely and in the meantime
Gerd has moved his initiative to the Zurich University of Applied Sciences in
Winterthur (ZHAW) (Switzerland), a place much more open to substantial
institutional development, as can be seen in the chapters in this book by Otto
Kruse and Daniel Perrin, both faculty members of the ZHAW. The near future
will unveil whether Gerd Bräuer's hope for Education/Freiburg will come true:
for this new distance-learning program in Winterthur to further shape writing
as a central means of academic training in Freiburg.

             PORTRAIT 2: KATRIN GIRGENSOHN (AS
                   PRESENTED BY GERD BRÄUER)

   Before Katrin started working at the European University Viadrina Frank-
furt/Oder (Germany), she used to hold writing courses and writing groups
outside the university for more than 10 years. These groups sometimes be-
longed to community centers or other institutions for adult and continuing
education. Others started outside the institution and met in cafés or other
places. At that time, Katrin worked with people from different age groups
and levels of writing experience: old and young, female and male, authors
and people who had never written before. In order to meet the different needs
of these diverse groups, she experimented with several methods and settings,
such as presenting and discussing texts at a regular open stage;1 group and
performance work for women only; projects for writing and publishing books
with autobiographic stories.2 Through these projects Katrin expanded her un-
derstanding of different approaches to learning-to-write and to facilitating
writing-practice groups.

   In 2002, Katrin was asked by the European University Viadrina to teach
writing seminars. This invitation followed from the university's realizing a
need to foster academic writing. Since the opening of the university 15 years
ago a stable number of about 30% of the student population at EUV is not

                                                                                                231
Bräuer and Girgensohn

of German decent and therefore represents either foreign or second language
writers. Soon, Katrin realized in her writing seminars that there was low moti-
vation for writing in general and academic writing in specific, and no willing-
ness to freely share drafts and provide peer feedback. One of the reasons for
that, she recognizes, is the teacher-centered seminar format practiced widely
in higher education in Germany--a model that she saw herself obligated to
follow at the beginning of her teaching career at the university. Katrin, from
the beginning, felt the desire to bring to EUV her experience of working
with writing groups outside higher education. When she finally followed her
desire, she was very much aware that there has been no tradition at universi-
ties in Germany--and this is true also for the other German-speaking coun-
tries--with autonomous groups.

   Let's mention a few additional facts about the European University Viadri-
na in order to better understand the circumstances of writing at EUV: this old
university (originally created in the sixteenth century) reopened in 1995 with
a new face, after about 150 years of mainly politically-motivated self-denial.
The university is situated in Frankfurt--the "other" Frankfurt in Germany,
located on the river Oder, which forms a physical border between Germany
and Poland. Frankfurt/Oder is 80 km (about 50 miles) east of Berlin. EUV
is a small public university with three faculties and about 6,000 students
total.3Katrin Girgensohn is still the only faculty member at EUV with a dis-
tinct teaching profile in writing. When Katrin started at EUV, there was no
writing center, no composition classes, nor any other form of writing instruc-
tion. Katrin's students have been mostly BA and MA students of cultural
studies who can choose her writing seminars to obtain credit points in "prac-
tical skills." Besides writing in Katrin's courses, these students do not have to
write very much other than take-home-exams at the end of the semesters and
a thesis at the end of either BA or MA studies.4 Looking back at the beginning
of her teaching career at EUV, Katrin says:

         I worked at my university as an adjunct faculty for two
         semesters and tried to teach academic writing the traditional
         way in front of a class that was restricted to 25 students
         (from about 100 students who initially wanted to join the
         course but weren't allowed to sign up) and with a time bud-
         get of only 90 minutes per week.5 This, to me, wasn't satisfy-
         ing at all. I tried using various forms of group work and peer
         learning and I gave as many tips and tricks about academic
         writing as possible. However, what I was missing was stu-
         dents really thinking about their own writing and practising

232
                 University of Education, Freiburg, and European University Viadrina (Germany)

         writing voluntarily, out of intrinsic motivation, so to speak.
         So, I began thinking about other ways of facilitating these
         writers and how I could transfer the experience I gathered
         with writing group work outside university to my courses at
         EUV (Girgensohn, interview, 2011).

   Eventually, Katrin designed a concept for autonomous academic writing
practice groups and started to experiment with it. Her understanding of writ-
ing practice groups is one that focuses more on writing together at the time
of the group meetings than on giving each other feedback on drafts brought
to the meeting. What follows is a list of aims she formulated for a new model
of writing classes at the university: first of all and very simply, she wants the
students to write more often and learn to enjoy writing. In other words, Katrin
stresses what she calls a hedonistic approach to writing, which focuses first on
the moment of happiness in the creation of texts (Girgensohn, 2007). From
the perspective of instructional design and institutional development, her main
concern is balancing the tendency in traditional German education to tackle
the writers' weaknesses instead of acknowledging and making use of their indi-
vidual strengths.

   In Katrin's concept of autonomous academic writing groups, she wants
   · students to write regularly,
   · to offer encouragement for writing,
   · to help students search for different ways, strategies, and methods of

       writing,
   · to make students aware of their own writing processes,
   · to encourage students to share their writing in progress,
   · to give students a real audience for their writing,
   · to leave responsibility for the learning process with the students

       themselves,
   · and last but not least: to give the teacher a chance to really get to meet

       and know each individual writer in an otherwise large group of class
       participants.
   In her 2005 presentation at the conference of the European Association for
the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW), she named this obstacle of having
to deal with large lecture classes and a very small classroom time budget "How
to make a virtue out of necessity." Her autonomous writing groups are now
offered as a regular credit-bearing course--not only in EUV but also in five
large research universities throughout Germany. The term "autonomous writ-
ing group" follows Anne Ruggles Gere, who defines the term as follows (1987,
p. 100):

                                                                                                233
Bräuer and Girgensohn

         Although groups take a variety of forms, they can be catego-
         rized into three main types--autonomous, semi-autonomous
         and non-autonomous--depending upon locus and degree
         of authority. The voluntary constitution of writing groups
         within literary societies, young men's associations, women's
         clubs, and in a myriad other self-sponsored gatherings identi-
         fies them as autonomous. Authority resides within individual
         members of autonomous groups because they choose to join
         other writers with whom they are friendly, share common
         interests, backgrounds, or needs.

   In Gere's opinion, university writing groups can never be autonomous "be-
cause of the authority invested in the educational institution and its represen-
tative, the instructor" (1987, p. 101). Nevertheless, Katrin Girgensohn had
gained the experience--from her work outside university--that the autonomy
of a writing group is the key for its success and the shaping of the individual
desire to write: All members have to possess equal authority and must be "stage
crew" and spectator at the same time. Katrin reflects on her experience in the
first semester of putting this approach into practice:

         I decided to let the groups meet without me, the "represen-
         tative authority." The groups are teacherless groups, which
         means that they are prepared and moderated alternately by
         all participating students. Furthermore, this decision solved
         my practical needs: I knew that I couldn't supervise several
         groups as a leader. With no more than 90 minutes of teach-
         ing time per week I would not be able to lead even one. At
         the beginning I worried a lot about students' development as
         writers and their willingness to collaborate with each other
         and, even more fundamental, to actually do their work with-
         out being closely supervised by me.

   When Katrin started assessing process and outcome of the groups' work, she
found this: both motivation for giving feedback and the quality of the feedback
provided changed for the better. How come? First of all, she detected a certain
natural curiosity in the students' reactions to each other's writing. Also, students
showed more awareness of the writing process simply due to the fact that one
can see in each other's actions what process writing is all about. There was also
a stronger personal incentive for experimenting with writing strategies, settings,

234
                 University of Education, Freiburg, and European University Viadrina (Germany)

modes, and genres. All in all, Katrin witnessed a change of attitude regarding
the responsibility for one's own writing and that of others.

    How could she make the students work in a way they never did before?
What she expects them to do is a lot. They are asked to constitute small
groups with students they never met before. They are expected to write to-
gether--though most of them usually haven't written on their own initiative
before joining the group. Katrin's concept requires them to read their own
texts aloud in their small group and talk about their drafts as well as about
their personal writing processes. All this they are expected to do without direct
teacher guidance. There is a very important reason why Katrin's concept is
actually working well: the idea of autonomy is taken seriously by transforming
the role of the instructor into one of facilitating writers by challenging them
to build confidence and trust with each other. This transformation is sup-
ported through the following additional elements of her concept:

   · Katrin takes the idea of an autonomous writing group seriously: this
       means that the groups have to be self-elected. Furthermore, the students
       are free to choose the themes and methods or strategies they like. They
       can produce texts the way they like and they do not have to show Ka-
       trin the product of their work until the end of the semester--there is
       no pressure to hand in or publish the results of their work There is no
       doubt for them that they are responsible for their work. They are free
       to meet wherever they want--inside and outside the university. Katrin
       points out: "I don't grade their texts but instead I provide feedback on
       how the students engage in the writing process based on the information
       provided to me through team protocols and personal conversation dur-
       ing my office hours. The textbook they put together during the semester
       in each small group counts as group work. Nevertheless, I don't monitor
       how much each individual member contributes to the book."

   · Her role as teacher is transformed: she becomes a facilitator, a resource
       for the students and their learning processes. She offers them help with
       preparing the group meetings. After the group meetings, Katrin receives
       a protocol, which, based on focus questions, helps students to reflect
       their individual work and the group processes.

   · During an intensive kick-off writing weekend Katrin gives a hands-
       on introduction to writing group work and combines it with efforts
       to build confidence and trust among the students. This is happening
       mainly through a task called "Stationen-Schreiben," where students
       get a chance to explore their individual writing strategies, including
       an analysis of personal strengths and weaknesses. This leads them to

                                                                                                235

       acknowledge not only their own current developmental state as writers
       but also to accept each other in their individuality. This Katrin sees as
       the foundation of individual confidence and trust among all members
       of the group.
   In 2002, Katrin joined a group of writing pedagogues in Germany initi-
ated by the Bielefeld University Writing Lab, with the goal of investigating the
pedagogical potential of peer tutoring. In Bielefeld, Paula Gillespie and Harvey
Kail presented a three-day workshop on peer tutoring. Katrin's experience of
this workshop was one that opened her eyes to the larger community of writing
pedagogues and the writing research related to peer learning in general (e.g.,
Bruffee, 1984) and peer tutoring of writing in specific. This experience, first
of all, had a large impact on the further development of Katrin's concept of
the autonomous academic writing group. It actually provided her with enough
confidence to finally put it into practice in 2003.
   At the same time she started to develop a concept for a peer-run writing
center at EUV, including a training program for student writing tutors. Katrin
wanted to provide a home base not only for the autonomous writing groups
but also for other writing seminars and workshops to come and, last but not
least, for individual peer-tutoring of writing. In the process of preparing for the
opening of the center in 2007, Katrin spent several months visiting US writing
centers. She also profited greatly from German writing pedagogues who had
started their own writing centers in Bielefeld, Bochum, and Freiburg. Katrin
also participated in the certificate program for writing coaches at the writing
center of the University of Education Freiburg. Several alumni of this program
started an informal network where people freely share their experience not only
with coaching writers but also with initiating change with regard to writing in
institutions of higher education.
   After the opening of the writing center at EUV in 2007, Katrin initiated
several developmental projects with great impact on redefining the role of writ-
ing at EUV. The most important for her is a course Katrin developed on collab-
orative writing as a mode of cultural learning. "Intercultural writing teams" is
an innovative seminar model that is integrated into the curriculum of the cross-
disciplinary master's degree in European Studies and arranges cross-cultural en-
counters based on creative writing methods. Students work in interculturally
mixed small groups that meet regularly once a week during the semester. In
addition, every two weeks all small groups join a seminar on academic writing.
This mix of academic and creative-oriented teamwork aims at a more holistic
academic socialization for both the international as well as the German master's
students. Therefore, students aren't just practicing academic literacy skills, but
also intercultural competence and team skills.

   The growing impact Katrin has had on institutional development at EUV
with regard to writing over the years doesn't stop at the gates of the univer-
sity, but bridges the traditional gap between higher and secondary education.
Through the project "high school writing coaches" she initiates and facilitates
the development of high school writing centers staffed with high school stu-
dents, an approach that has been developed in Europe through the Scriptorium
project, led by the Freiburg Writing Center (Bräuer, 2009). Sponsored by the
Robert Bosch foundation, high school students of two different partner schools
visit the writing center at EUV and get a three-day training in peer tutoring
methods. Afterwards, the high school students work for one year as peer tutors
at their schools. They are supervised by two students of the EUV writing center.
After one year a new group of high school students will be trained to become
peer tutors in writing. Teachers of the schools are trained as well. A long-term
goal is to establish writing centers at these high schools.

   With this said, it becomes very obvious that Katrin's initiative for shaping
autonomous academic writing groups laid the foundation for a slowly-changing
role of writing in the university and the formation of new curricular structures
supporting writers and creating sustainable support of writing.

WRITING AT RWTH AACHEN
(GERMANY): LESSONS FROM
"TECHNIK IM KLARTEXT"

By Vera Niederau and Eva-Maria Jakobs
RWTH Aachen (Germany)

This article introduces the measurements and aims of the "TiK" (Tech-
nik im Klartext) project at the RWTH Aachen; the project flourished
from 2001 to 2005 and has been recently restructured. Focused on
popular writing about science, TiK aims to build interest in science
and engineering careers among pre-university students and to teach
university students important skills in reaching wider audiences. Some
chosen components of the (teaching) concept will be presented. The
impact of the project will be reflected on, problems and conditions
discussed, and prospects for the future given.

   Conveying science to a broad audience occupies an important place in Ger-
many. The public as well as research foundations increase their support for it
and it is seen as an essential component of communication. The transfer of
knowledge and research results to society (industry, politics, public) is especially
important for technical universities such as the RWTH Aachen. It should be an
integral part of strategic public relations and academic education. It is crucial
that students develop the ability of knowledge transfer and know about differ-
entiated instruments and measurements for the presentation of knowledge to
various target groups. There is a lack of practical courses in which teachers and
students learn how to teach central skills such as the transfer of knowledge and
the transfer of scientific topics for different target groups.

         One important target group are scholars--pre-university students. On
the one hand, they represent an important source of the rising generation of
engineers; they are also the future social decision-makers. Scholars should be led
to science and technology in order to awaken their interest for technical profes-
sions. Scholars not only gain information through teachers and media: impor-
tant sources for scholars to shape their opinions are the articles of other scholars
at the same age, for example in school newspapers. The subject of this profile is

a project at the RWTH Aachen, which aims at new forms of knowledge transfer
between university and school. The motto is: "Scholars Write for Scholars about
Technology." They are accompanied and guided by various groups (research-
ers, teachers, and students of the university as well as teachers in schools). The
learning places are different as well. One part of the project takes part at the
university, another part at the schools. University teachers and students as well
as teachers in their schools are competent contacts for them. The concept is that
the transfer of knowledge goes from university to the schools.

   The TiK project was initiated, developed, and carried out by the Depart-
ment of Textlinguistics and Technical Communication of the RWTH Aachen
in cooperation with the press office of the university. The department coordi-
nates an interdisciplinary study course--technical writing. It combines system-
atically two subjects: one engineering subject, such as mechanical engineering
or electrical engineering, and communication studies. The intent is to train
specialists for the transfer of technology. The basic idea of the project is to in-
tegrate popular science writing into university and school studies in two ways.
Students learn how to write popular science texts and at the same time learn to
transfer their knowledge to others.

   A basic aim of the project is to awaken interest for technical research by
students, scholars, and teachers. In the centre of the project is writing about
technology and basic skills such as research, phrasing, and revising. The proj-
ect contains several measurements (seminars, workshops, building of networks
etc.), which provide students, scholars (14-19 year olds of all schools), and
teachers with the ability to convey knowledge in a popular-science way and
sensitize them and awaken their interest for natural and engineering science.
Another aim of the project is to make public the innovations, academic plans,
and research results of the RWTH Aachen nationwide.

                 DESCRIPTION OF THE "TECHNIK
                       IM KLARTEXT" PROJECT

   With the "TiK" project the RWTH had successfully pursued new methods
to convey teaching contents. The Department for Textlinguistics and Technical
Communication developed the idea and the concept. The project was realized
in cooperation with the press office of the RWTH and school newspapers from
various German schools. All in all, 800 schools took part in the project. The rec-
tor of the RWTH financed it. The project was supported by an advisory board,
which contains students, upper school scholars, teachers, subject teachers, and
local journalists. The advisory board guided--among other things--the school

newspapers and contributed considerably to the conception of the scholar/
teacher workshops. The concept was realized for the first time in 2002-2003.
The first phase included writing workshops and layout-seminars for technical
communication students; in the second phase, writing workshops and layout-
seminars for scholars and teachers. In agreement with and with support by the
"Lehrerbildungszentrum" of the RWTH, the teachers were trained.

   The project is based on various components. The first component combines
innovative teaching forms (project-based learning) with new information- and
communication offerings addressed to students. Usually the course includes
four credit hours per week. In academic courses the participants have the op-
portunity to learn about the basics of popular science writing, which they have
to use in a realistic context. The topics arise out of the research environment of
the university. Every department with interesting research projects may apply.
The project leader collects the suggested topics and the students decide which
project and department they want to write about. They start research about
their topic and have the opportunity to contact the researchers to gain mate-
rial for their articles, to interview them, to visit laboratories, and to observe
experiments. Their task is to prepare the collected material for writing a popular
science article. The produced articles will be collected in a database for school
newspaper editorials.

   The young journalists from the participating schools have access to a web-
based platform and may use the texts as basic material for their own texts. The
database concept derives from the idea of news agencies; the platform offers rel-
evant and current information about research and teaching in nature and engi-
neering science--from news about innovative developments to current research
projects and perspectives on various occupational areas. The knowledge transfer
is supported by a second format: a newsletter, which is made by students un-
der the guidance of teachers from the department and of journalists from the
RWTH press office. The RWTH Aachen was the first German university to
provide nationwide school newspaper editorials every semester with informa-
tion about research.

   The second component aggregates the academic and scholastic training
in interactive forms. It includes several day-lasting events, where scholars and
teachers learn the basics of popular science writing and layout design for school
newspapers. The third component integrates experience-driven offerings: schol-
ars have the opportunity to visit test beds, factories, and laboratories as extraor-
dinary teaching spaces.

   In the following sections of the profile, some chosen measurements of the
project will be introduced, as well as distinctive attributes of teaching and learn-
ing forms.

                                                                                                241

       DISTINCTIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THE ACADEMIC
              TEACHING AND LEARNING CONCEPT

   The course "Popularisieren: Schreiben in Medien und Öffentlichkeit" [Pop-
ularising: Writing for Media and Public] has four credit hours per week and
additionally a three-day-seminar. The course had been offered for four years
in both summer and winter terms. The maximum number of participants was
30 students. The course was led by a teacher from the Department for Text-
linguistics and Technical Communication and by the head of the press office.
One part of the learning process results from frontal teaching. It was comple-
mented by numerous working sessions of the students' project groups. There
is a huge work involvement by all participants, because the innovative design
of the course requires intensive cooperation. The students are mainly moti-
vated by the possibility to transfer the learned theory into practice and to gain
vocationally-orientated qualifications during their studies.

                     PROJECT-BASED LEARNING

   Project work in this context means a long-term and complex examination with-
in the curricular course. It is a dynamic combination of theory and practice. In the
sense of experienced learning (Gudjons, 1997; Apel & Knoll, 2001) an academic
course should combine theory and practice as equal and mutual elements. The
project-based dealing with the topic requires interdisciplinary consultations and
cooperation. The course participants come from various disciplines of humanities,
nature, and engineering science. The task of the course participants is to process
engineering subjects and humanities research through genuine scientific methods
and measurements. This includes the reception of theory and writing of diverse
texts as well as creating a layout and the allocation of keywords in the database.

   The content of the project, which focuses on "establishing a news agency
by students for scholars," is based on the idea that students write for school
newspapers. The focus of this reality-based situation is the use of knowledge re-
sources (public relations, phrasing, editing, etc.), which--in conjunction with
other activities (such as public relations, event preparation and implementation,
supervision of writing workshops, etc.) --forms a specifically engineered action
system. The basis for practical work in the real-life situation is the development
of theoretical knowledge in science journalism and public relations. During the
seminar the following areas are covered:

   · Goals/ Strategies and features/ techniques of popular science writing (see
       Niederhauser, 1997, 1998, 1999)

242
                                                                               RWTH Aachen (Germany)

   · Analysis of popular science texts as compared to scientific texts
   · Instruments and measures of public relations (Faulstich, 1992)
   · Techniques/methods of information gathering and processing systems

       (Haller, 2001)
   · Writing theory and writing strategies (see Jakobs, 1997, 1999a, 2009;

       Molitor, 1985; Perrin, 1997, 1998)
   Theoretical knowledge is applied in practical work: Participants write short
and long versions of research on the subject. They learn to deal intensively
with their texts to make changes in perspective and to give each other spe-
cific feedback. Students reflect together on their progress and the results of
their work. The role of teachers is to be informative, advisory, supportive, and
encouraging.

           Intensive Seminar with Accompanying Tutorials

         The intensive seminar is based on team-teaching (lecturers, tutors,
students). The project-themes about which the students want to write are
specified and the project teams created. The students' project teams plan
workflow. They determine simultaneously both the individual areas of respon-
sibility of team members, as well as share learning processes such as different
forms of collaborative writing (see Bleich ,1995; Jakobs, 1997; Lean, 1999;
Sharples, 1999; Schindler, 2007). Contents of the intensive seminar are theory
and teaching of writing strategies, as well as training and flexibility through
techniques (Molitor, 1985; Jakobs, 1999; Perrin, Böttcher, & Kruse, 2003).
A major challenge is the border between factual accuracy and entertainment
value of the journalistic text. They learn to deal with discipline-specific dis-
course patterns as well as with conflicts.

   The main aim of the intensive seminar is to revise the articles for the news-
letter. The text revising takes place as simulated editorial meetings. The course
participants discuss the draft texts by using predetermined objective criteria.
The group discussion is held at eye level. Everyone will be taken seriously. In
addition, there is a tutorial for writing for the Internet. The students deal with
the specifics of web formats, and practice by using given materials.

            Combination of Teaching and Public Relations

         A special feature of the project is the substantive and personal link
between teaching and public relations. The strong involvement of the press of-
fice and their staff gives the seminar authenticity and practical relevance. The
students learn about working practices of journalism and get professional ad-

                                                                                                243
Niederau and Jakobs

vice and feedback. The students can also take advantage of the strong contact
network of public relations. Conversely, the press benefits from the perspective
of students and the challenge of adapting discussion of journalistic writing to
the target group scholars. Important impulses arise from the confrontation
between theory and practice. In the journalist's contact with the students, ex-
perienced processes of research and journalistic text production, as well as the
setting of target values and criteria, must be questioned. The task to develop
writing workshops with students and teachers for scholars and their teachers,
as well as discussing the themes, research, and text products, leads to intense
discussions and a repeated change of perspectives. Current topics of the
younger generation will find--stronger than before--the entrance to public
relations. Critical feedback from seminar participants means that instruments
and measures of public relations are considered and analyzed--for the public
relations work of the university, this is a valuable form of evaluation.

   Moreover, the press office can cover many results of student research and
text production. The university is nationally visible through the newsletter. A
secondary effect of the publications through media about the project is the re-
sultant inquiries from interested schools and institutions.

                PROJECT EVENTS: CONGRESS FOR
                  SCHOLARS, WITH WORKSHOPS

   In November 2001, the first TIK congress for scholars was held: scholars
from all over North Rhine-Westphalia took part in four day-long writing work-
shops in which practical tips for work were offered to school newspapers. The
results of the writing workshops were put together in a conference newspaper.
In small groups, specific issues for school newspapers were discussed, for ex-
ample, writing, illustrating, and web-design.

                             Writing Workshops

   The TiK writing workshops give young editors the possibility to practice
journalistic writing about scientific topics. The scholars are introduced to sci-
ence-teaching strategies and techniques of research. In a subsequent research
phase in a research institute of the RWTH Aachen, scholars can visit projects to
experience and learn science in a personal discussion with scientists. For most
scholars this is the first opportunity to look at a university from the inside. The
personal contact breaks down barriers and helps to break down clichés about
science and the work of scientists.

   After visiting the departments, the writing phase begins. In order to initiate
the process of writing, the scholars test methods of creative writing (Böttcher,
1999a, 1999b; Böttcher & Czapla, 2002). The actual writing process occurs
either alone or collaboratively. Each workshop ends with a text optimization
phase. In small groups, participants receive constructive feedback. They use the
notes for the final editing. The output of the seminar is not only new experi-
ences and an increase in skills, but also a number of texts that are the subject of
further processes and workshops.

                              Layout Workshops

   In TiK layout workshops, the participants learn to make their text products
visually interesting. The design is based primarily on printed school newspa-
pers. The workshops also address the needs of online newspapers and opportu-
nities they offer. Graphic designers introduce the participants to the basics of
professional layout design. During the workshop, not only young editors are
addressed, but also their teachers, who work together with the students to learn
innovative methods of design of school newspapers. The theoretical principles
are put into practice with the help of exercises. The guidelines are applied to
the layout of their own school newspapers. This part is especially valued. The
participants receive a briefing on the use of various computer programs such
as "Adobe Photoshop" or "InDesign." In small groups, their own ideas can be
creatively implemented on a computer. All workshops are evaluated and the
results are recorded in a report. The evaluations are used iteratively for opti-
mization of teaching and learning forms and other aspects of information and
knowledge.

                   REFLECTION ON THE PROJECT

   The long-term project approach results in a heterogeneous stock. The proj-
ect's content and method are as extraordinarily successful as its inner and ex-
ternal impact. Negative outcomes include the high costs in time, people, and
finances, as well as the fluctuation of the scientific staff and personnel.

                   Achievements and positive feedback

   The response to the project has been very positive. This is shown by ex-
ternal and internal evaluations, such as evaluations of university teaching by
students, resonance analysis in schools, and the evaluation of the project by

                                                                                                245
Niederau and Jakobs

Stifterverband, the business community's innovation agency for the German
science system.

   The project shows that by working closely with young editors, a long-term
commitment arises: interesting contributions generate curiosity, interest, and
possibly a desire for further information--in some cases to study a science or
engineering discipline. Interest and information are augmented by the personal
approach and the continuous emotional contact. Young people who are inter-
ested in public relations or in science journalism are specifically encouraged.
Some former scholarly editors have decided on the basis of the TIK-project to
study at the RWTH Aachen. By training the target groups, there are also mul-
tiplier effects: the interest in technology will be transported via school newspa-
pers and spread in the schools.

   From winter term 2001/02 to winter term 2004/05, over 180 students suc-
cessfully completed the project course: "Popularisieren: Schreiben in Medien
und Öffentlichkeit." As noted in course evaluations, the students especially ap-
preciated the motivational content of the course, the opportunity to practice
interactive forms of learning within the team, and the close relation between the
theoretical and scientific education and practical relevance.

   The commitment of the students was higher than the average. The registra-
tion numbers for each course were more than 100 applicants. The commit-
ment was above the planned six hours per week. The students volunteered
extensively to support the organization of the student congress by teams who
occupied the conference office and participated in the preparation of the con-
ference sessions, workshops, etc. Some course participants have managed to
write a script for a short film about TiK and to design a radio program, from
manuscript to on-air production. A student group was engaged in sponsor-
ship, another has written a play about TiK and presented it. Since winter
term 2003/04, students took over two sponsorships of newspapers at regional
schools. Another volunteer activity was that experienced students conducted
advice sessions with new students.

   The results of the research and interviews of students in the RWTH insti-
tutes were excellent. Overall, the text corpus includes 250 target group specific
texts in short-and long version (newsletter and database). The response from
the school newspapers is extremely positive. The project convinced the business
community's innovation agency for the German science system: TiK was estab-
lished in 2001 as one of 12 outstanding actions nationwide with extraordinary
marketing efforts and awarded financial support.

   The text products as well as the response show that the cooperation has been
successful on both sides, as well as the learning process for students.

                         Problems and Constraints

   The negative outcome begins with the framework for sustainability and con-
tinuity of the project work. It refers to the heavy workload and the flow of infor-
mation from the schools into the project, as well as the institutional conditions
in universities. The personnel fluctuation for the school newspapers is high; the
constant change leads to social difficulties and the need for ongoing reconcili-
ation and thus intensive contact. Most documents are sent with a considerable
time lag. Specific measures have helped to reduce these confounding factors:
the platform has been made significantly more service oriented. Twinning ar-
rangements between students and school newspapers allow the maintenance of
personal contacts.

   Academic teaching requires a high level of personal effort of teachers, who
are exchanged by temporary contracts. Personnel change always means a loss of
knowledge and networks. On the part of the university, the high level of prep-
aration, implementation, and follow-up effort for such holistic teaching and
learning is often underestimated: successful project implementation requires
substantial financial, time, and personnel resources. The university supported
the project with an initial funding of approximately 10,000 over two years;
achievements of the Institute and the press office were added. Despite the posi-
tive evaluation of all project partners the funding ended in 2005. Overall, the
project ultimately foundered on personnel and financial resources. The latter
is especially important in times where competition among higher education
programs determines the daily work routine. If the payment is oriented on
graduate numbers, funding, and scientific publications, there is no room for a
volunteer commitment.

                   CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK

   Currently we are working at the Department for Textlinguistics and Techni-
cal Communication to take up the project idea again in a changed configura-
tion. The main innovation is a broad national orientation and financial security
of measurements. In the future, the project will rely on a network of stakehold-
ers from business, universities, and schools. The learning places should become
more diverse. The range of topics will be broader. The themes will come from
industry and research. Other changes relate to the methods of media prepara-
tion and writing for various communication channels. The technological de-
velopment shows that printed school newspapers represent only one of many

                                                                                                247

different media variants. All in all, we are convinced that the idea is a very inter-
esting approach to teach text production skills. Added values are created by the
combination of innovative learning environments and themes, the connection
between theory and practice and the diversity of persons involved. Therefore,
we continue: the seminar "Populariseren: Schreiben in Medien und Öffentlich-
keit" was offered again in summer 2010 by the Department for Textlinguis-
tics and Technical Communication in cooperation with the press office of the
RWTH Aachen, with the aim to develop the concept further.

STUDENT WRITING IN THE

UNIVERSITY OF MADRAS:

TRADITIONS, COURSES,

AMBITIONS

By Susaimanickam Armstrong
University of Madras (India)

Writing courses and related initiatives at the University of Madras
make available to the students the skills of writing. According to their
programs and interests, students are trained in many forms of writing,
including professional, creative, and research. This profile describes
some techniques and assignments used as part of these writing oppor-
tunities in various disciplines. It attempts to critically understand the
role of the university in forwarding new trends in writing and com-
munication that play a major role in establishing careers of students
and that are shaping the development of the academic and creative
world. The author describes in detail his own expanded uses of writing
in a literature course. Further, the essay spells out the progress of "soft
skills" programs in several languages, by which students gain new hori-
zons in language acquisition. Finally, it projects a range of new writ-
ing/communications initiatives by which the university can expand its
importance in the burgeoning economy of its region.

   The 153-year old University of Madras (UOM) is the mother of almost all
the old universities of Southern India. It is an affiliated, state university under
the Government of Tamil Nadu. The university area of jurisdiction has been
confined to three districts of Tamil Nadu in recent years. This is consequent
to the establishment of various universities in the state and demarcation of the
university territories.

   Through its long history, the university has diversified its teaching and re-
search. UOM has produced two presidents for the Government of India and
has three Nobel laureates to her credit. The university imparts both under-
graduate and post-graduate education through over 100 affiliated institutions

that are spread over the districts of Chennai, Thiruvalluvar, and Kancheepuram.
Apart from teaching, research activities in arts, humanities, science, manage-
ment, and technology are the main portals of the university.

   The 68 university departments of study and research are spread over four
campuses organized into 18 schools, each of which offers post-graduate courses
in part-time and full-time PhD programs and diploma and certificate programs
(http://www.unom.ac.in/). Addressing education needs of an even larger popu-
lation of the country, the university offers both undergraduate and post-gradu-
ate education through the Institute of Distance Education (IDE). Some of the
courses offered by IDE have no parallel in this country.

                       HISTORY AND HERITAGE

   The Public Petition dated 11 November 1839 initiated the establishment of
the Madras University. In January 1840, with George Norton as its President, the
University Board was constituted, but it was not until 1857 that the university
was established by an act of the Legislative Council. The university was organized
on the model of the University of London (Hunter, 1886; Mahalingam, 1974;
University of Madras, 2001). By 1912, endowments were made to the university
to establish departments of Indian History, Archaeology, Comparative Philology,
and Indian Economics. In all there were 17 University departments, 30 Univer-
sity teachers, 69 research scholars, and 127 University publications in that year.
Later, the research and teaching functions of the university were encouraged by
the Sadler Commission, and the gains of the university were consolidated by
the enactment of the Madras University Act of 1923. About this time, the ter-
ritorial ambit of the Madras University encompassed from Berhampur of Orissa
in the North, Trivandrum of Kerala in the Southwest, Bangalore and Manga-
lore of Karnataka in the West and Hyderabad of Andhra Pradesh in the South.
However, Indian independence in 1947, the setting up of the University Grants
Commission in 1956, and changes in the political, social, and cultural milieu
brought several amendments to the University of Madras Act of 1923 to permit
qualitative and quantitative changes in its jurisdiction and functions.

      MOST SALIENT GEOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC, AND
            CULTURAL FEATURES OF ITS LOCATION

   UOM is located in Chennai, formerly known as Madras, the capital city of
the Indian State of Tamil Nadu. Chennai is the fourth most populous metro-

252
                                                                              University of Madras (India)

politan area and the fifth most populous city in India. Located on the Coro-
mandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, Chennai city had a population of 4.34
million in the 2001 census. The urban agglomeration of metropolitan Chennai
has an estimated population of over 8.2 million people.

   Chennai's economy has a broad base of auto, computer, technology, hard-
ware manufacturing, and healthcare industries. The city is India's second largest
exporter of software, information technology, and information-technology-en-
abled services. A major chunk of India's auto manufacturing industry is based in
and around the city. Chennai Zone contributes 39 per cent of the State's GDP.
Chennai accounts for 60 per cent of the country's automotive exports.

   Chennai is an important centre for folk songs and Carnatic music and hosts
a large cultural event, the annual Madras Music Season, which includes per-
formances by hundreds of artists. The city has a vibrant theatre scene and is an
important centre for the Bharatanatyam, a classical dance form. The Tamil film
industry, one of the largest in India, is based in the city; the soundtracks of the
films dominate its music scene.

   The University of Madras is spread over six campuses, viz., Chepauk, Ma-
rina, Guindy, Taramani, Chetpet, and Maduravoyal. The main campus of the
University of Madras is located in Chepauk. The stately and historic Senate
House, the Library building with its imposing clock tower, the spacious Cen-
tenary Auditorium, and the massive Centenary Building are some of the im-
portant buildings of the university campus at Chepauk. Most of the science
departments are located in the Guindy Campus of the university. The campus
at Taramani houses the Dr. A. Lakshmanaswamy Mudaliar Post-Graduate Insti-
tute of Basic Medical Sciences. The Oriental and Indian languages departments,
the Post-graduate Hostel for Men and the University Guesthouse are located
in the Marina Campus. The University Union for Sports and its pavilion are
on the Spur Tank Road in Chetpet. The Botanical Garden of the University is
located in the Maduravoyal campus.

      WHAT "LITERACY" AND ESPECIALLY "WRITING"
        MEAN TO STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN UOM:
       WHY THEY WRITE, IN WHAT LANGUAGES AND
          DIALECTS, IN RELATION TO WHAT GOALS?1

   By and large, the students and teachers of the University of Madras (UOM)
assume that "literacy" and especially "writing" mean only writing sessional tests
and end-of-semester examinations. Writing practice here is clubbed with exam-
ination of students' memory and understanding of their subjects. English is the

                                                                                                253

medium of instruction at UOM, but is a second language for the students, who
bring with them a broad range of first languages: Hindi (national language),
Tamil (regional mother tongue), Malayalam, Telugu, Kannada, Sanskrit, North
Eastern Tribal languages, Arabic, Persian, and Urdu. UOM also admits inter-
national students who speak English, French, Sinhalese, Chinese, Japanese,
Tibetan, and other languages. Is writing practice different from examination
of subject knowledge? It remains a question here. Proper attention for writ-
ing practice is not professionally administered in universities such as UOM in
India. Students write their three sessional tests per semester and end-semester
examinations in English, except for the students in their respective language
departments. For the most part, the goal of students here is to score top-ranking
marks and not to improve their writing skills. However, there are a few elective
courses in writing, described below, that serve other student goals.

       WHAT STUDENTS WRITE IN THE INSTITUTION:
              DISCIPLINES, GENRES, ASSIGNMENTS

   Though the medium of instruction in UOM is English, students write in
other Indian and regional languages depending upon the respective language
departments in the campuses. Students answer objective type or multiple-
choice questions in one word; they also write short notes in 50 words, para-
graphs in 150 to 200 words, and essays in 500 words or more. This is the
general examination pattern in UOM. In science disciplines, students write lab
experiment reports of two or three pages, do statistical analysis, and submit a
Record Book as a part of general examination writing. Data-based reports, field
studies, interview transcriptions, and media reports are some of the assignments
given in the departments of Archeology, Journalism, Economics, Econometrics,
Statistics, and Management Studies. The departments of Literatures, Languag-
es, Geography, History, Politics, Psychology, and other human sciences assign
book reviews. Some of the Departments of Indian Languages in UOM encour-
age students who are interested in creative writing in their respective mother
tongues, among them English, Tamil, and Malayalam.

   Writing per se is the subject in several courses offered by Journalism and
English. For example, Journalism offers a course in technical communication
that includes manual writing, flier design, and brochure design and writing.
A core course in Journalism introduces writing for radio, television, TV news,
cinema, and the Internet. Peer review is an important element of this course.
The objective of the course in Copy Editing is to introduce the students to the
basic skills of editing as applicable in the field of publishing and journalism. The

254
                                                                              University of Madras (India)

Department of English offers an elective course in Writing Skills that features
thesis writing, proposals, and research writing. Other courses offered by English
will be described in later sections of this essay.

  WHO "CARES" IN THE INSTITUTION ABOUT STUDENT
  GROWTH IN AND THROUGH WRITING? HOW IS THIS

      CONCERN--OR LACK OF CONCERN--SHOWN IN
    FUNDING, REQUIREMENTS, ATTITUDES, ACTIONS?

   UOM does not have an official body in charge of students' growth in and
through writing. The respective research supervisors during the preparation of
research dissertations for post-graduate degrees, the Master of Philosophy in
various disciplines, and doctoral degrees will normally address the writing and
editing skills of the student scholars. For sessional or periodical tests, end-se-
mester examinations, and submitted assignments, the respective course coordi-
nators take care of the evaluation of writing.

   The University Students Advisory Board (USAB), which is funded by the
university and partly supported by the Government of Tamil Nadu, and the
Dr. B. R. Ambedkar Centre for Economic Studies, fully funded by the Govern-
ment of India, conduct writing courses for the socially disadvantaged students
of the university and her affiliated colleges. This Centre periodically conducts
coaching classes for students to take up various job-oriented competitive ex-
aminations. Subject experts do conduct writing practices in their respective
fields. USAB is very much interested in helping students get suitable job place-
ments; they very often conduct job fairs in collaboration with leading Info Tech
companies. USAB also facilitates student-oriented programs, such as remedial
coaching classes, and conducts training for students who aspire for competitive
examinations. Ample writing exercises are given to test students' writing skills.
Neither USAB nor the Ambedkar Centre has a writing program per se, but
developing such courses in the near future is a possibility.

               ONE ILLUSTRATION OF SUCCESS IN
              TEACHING WRITING IN A DISCIPLINE

   I trained a set of 14 pre-doctoral (Master of Philosophy in English) students
who opted an elective course entitled "Discourses of Domination, Resistance,
and Emancipation: Race, Caste, and Gender" during the academic year 2007-
2008. This course focused more on writing skills than others I have previously

                                                                                                255

taught. The students had to prepare two assignments, and then present them as
papers. After presentation, students were asked to share the presented papers for
peer review. After this step, they were asked to interview experts on the topics of
research that they had prepared, presented, and peer reviewed (e.g., Gajendran,
1998; Guru, 1998). These interviews were later transcribed and prepared in a
format fit for publication. My task as the coordinator of this course was to com-
pile all of this work as an anthology having the following features:

   · Broad division of chapters containing individual papers
   · Bibliographic essay on race, caste, and gender (to which three students

       contributed)
   · Compilation of the interviews with experts, relevant to the themes of the

       student papers
   · Compilation of official/archival/gubernatorial documents gathered by

       the students as additional information on their themes.
   For example, a student who presented a paper on trans-gender interviewed
a trans-gender leader in Chennai, who in turn directed the student to the gov-
ernment office where an order issued in favor of trans-gender was available.
The student annexed this document to the proposed anthology for the benefit
of future researchers. This student also contributed to the section of the biblio-
graphic essay on genders.
   For the M. Phil. students of the Department of English at the University of
Madras this was a new educational experience. Normally, students of literature
will not go out for field study here. In this course, students shared that they
had enriching experiences during interviews with subject experts, activists, writ-
ers, critics, and political leaders. One of the students interviewed a Minister
for Social Welfare. For her, it was a thrilling experience. Some of them told
me that they learned the art of interviewing through transcribing the recorded
interviews. Students who felt very shy in the class benefited from going out to
attend seminars and present papers with the help of their peers. I wanted to
give a social science perspective to literary and cultural studies research such as
this. Normally, some of the best social science work will have a literary touch.
I wanted to experiment with this type of research with my team of students,
and this fusion worked out very well, as I could see this in the writings and the
interesting titles given by the students to their papers.
   Through this complex assignment, students developed the following:
   · Interviewing skills
   · Book review skills
   · Research paper writing methods
   · Proposal writing methods
   · Looking at literature through a social science perspective

256
                        University of Madras (India)

· Team research skills
· Self-editing skills

   WHEN AND HOW HAVE GROUPS OF TEACHERS MET
      TO DISCUSS AND PERHAPS PLAN WAYS TO HELP

 STUDENTS GROW AS WRITERS? WHAT HAS RESULTED?

   Though there is no professional group of teachers to teach writing skills to
students of their respective departments, the Department of English has been
offering courses on technical writing and copy editing for the past five years as
electives for the students of all disciplines in UOM. The coordinator of these
courses has received overwhelming response from various departments. Stu-
dents are made aware of the importance of mastering the nuances of the writ-
ten language. Examples are taken from real life work scenarios. For example,
the students are shown examples from the print media where errors have been
overlooked. Thus, they are trained to be sensitive to language use. The students
go through a very result-oriented training program in different kinds of writing
assignments. The results of this training have been positive. Select students in a
class exhibit enthusiasm to become flawless writers.

           NEW INITIATIVES IN TEACHING WRITING

   The University of Madras has been offering the Soft Skills program for its
students. It is mandatory for every student in the MA, MSc, MCom, and MBA
programs of the university to acquire eight credits from this program to success-
fully complete their post-graduation degree. The objective of the program is to
enable students to understand and produce the target language accurately and
fluently. Emphasis is on the four skills/modules--listening, speaking, reading
and writing--with writing given the most emphasis. The Soft Skills program
is offered in English, Spanish, French, German, and Italian. The students learn
grammar rules and new vocabulary. They write answers to reading and listening
comprehension questions and also take a written test. The students are trained
in spelling and punctuation at the level of word and sentence, with later empha-
sis on content and organization.

   In the Communication and Soft Skills program in English, the modules
define the various principles of communication and demonstrate its importance
using the four skills. The objective of the written skills module is to enable the
students to link spoken words and thoughts to writing, demonstrate the impor-

                        257
Armstrong

tance of writing without errors, and discuss the process and result of a written
work. The students are given ample time during the course to practice writing
with precision, accuracy, and clarity of thought. The learners are monitored
closely by the faculty, who guide them to successfully process their ideas. They
practice writing through such tasks as narrating stories; drafting letters, emails,
and reports; writing their resumes and curriculum vitae; writing book reports,
reviews, personal stories, job applications, news reports, etc.

   The University of Madras has recently (July 2010) outsourced this program
to a private educational company. As a University Coordinator for this pro-
gram, I have control over what is taught. On behalf of the university, I prescribe
the syllabus and monitor the company's tutoring; University faculties evaluate
the examination given by the company faculty. Thus far, the program has been
successful, and I have received many positive responses from the students.

           PROPOSED/UNFULFILLED AMBITIONS IN
          REGARD TO STUDENT LITERACY/WRITING

   1. Training in writing for M.Phil. and PhD students: The students enrolled
       in the Master of Philosophy (pre-doctoral degree) and PhD (doctoral)
       in various science, arts, and humanities courses at the University of Ma-
       dras do not have a separate training program for writing skills, and their
       writing activity is limited to writing dissertations with the guidance of
       respective research supervisors. A program related to writing for these
       research students would be an ambitious venture for any member of fac-
       ulty here, and efforts are being made to draft a program that combines
       purposeful and original writing with precise and orderly presentation.

   2. Writing and translation: The Department of English is conceiving plans
       for a program for Writing and Translation in consultation with the au-
       thorities of the university and other volunteering members from affiliat-
       ing colleges of the University of Madras.

   3. Technical writing and content development: To prepare materials such as
       websites, user manuals, training manuals, reports, proposals, etc., there
       is a huge demand for technical writers in software companies, finan-
       cial institutions, and many other organizations. UOM plans to conduct
       courses in the above program shortly for students across all disciplines, in
       collaboration with interested professional and educational institutions in
       India and abroad, particularly with a corporation in the US

   4. Publishing: There is a lacuna in the publishing industry in India due to
       a shortage of copy editors, proof readers, etc. This area requires excellent

       writing skills, error detection and correction skills, and reading compre-
       hension. Opportunities are aplenty in Chennai itself. UOM in collabo-
       ration with leading publishing companies plans to launch a program on
       publishing in consultation with experts in the university and affiliating
       colleges.
   5. Translation: this is an up-and-coming enterprise as part of the publish-
       ing industry. UOM has separate departments for Tamil literature, Tamil
       language, Telugu, Kannada, Hindi, and Sanskrit, as well as programs for
       French, Spanish, Italian and German. Efforts are being made to make
       translation an academic discipline. The faculty has given suggestions on
       how to accommodate translation into the relevant university curricula.
   6. E-publishing: A combination of publishing and technical writing will
       be floated for the students of UOM in future to train them to enrich
       their occupational and professional skills. Writing practice related to E-
       publishing alone will be a focal point of this program.
   7. Writing for the screen: Chennai, home of UOM, is known for produc-
       tion of films of international quality. There are opportunities for students
       to step into the movie industry if they master this form of writing at
       UOM. A proposal has been submitted to the Asian College of Journal-
       ism and the Tamil Nadu Film Institute in Chennai for a possible joint
       venture to float a course on Script Writing for the students of UOM and
       her affiliated colleges.

THE REGIONAL WRITING
CENTRE AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF LIMERICK

By Íde O'Sullivan and Lawrence Cleary
University of Limerick (Ireland)

In April 2007, Ireland's first Regional Writing Centre at the Universi-
ty of Limerick was launched. This chapter outlines the various interna-
tional, European, national, regional, and institutional winds to which
the growing Centre responded. Trailing UL's Regional Writing Centre
through its path from inception to fruition, the profile reveals the in-
fluences that have shaped its ethos, guided its development and served
to sustain it. Furthermore, the profile outlines the Centre's variegated
approach for achieving what it hopes to be a more systematic approach
to undergraduate, postgraduate, and professional writing development
at UL and the region.

   The University of Limerick (UL) is one of Ireland's youngest universities.
Established as the National Institute for Higher Education (NIHE) in 1972,
the institute attained its current university status in 1989. Describing itself as
"an independent, internationally-focused university"(University of Limerick,
2009, p. 1), UL is often referred to as more of an "American-style" univer-
sity. Proud of its record of innovation in education and excellence in research
and scholarship, the university's mission is "to promote and advance learning
and knowledge through teaching, research, and scholarship in an environment
which encourages innovation and upholds the principles of free enquiry and
expression" (University of Limerick, 2009, p. 1). In 2011, 1,300 staff strive to
qualify UL as an exceptional, vibrant learning environment for 11,300 students.

   Astride two sides of the River Shannon, the UL campus ranges over 130
hectares in Counties Limerick and Clare. Its recreational, cultural and sport-
ing facilities are renowned, enhancing the university experience for students,
staff and the wider, surrounding community. Further augmenting the univer-
sity experience, the Regional Writing Centre at UL, formed in April of 2007,
is a relatively new addition to campus life. Central in all aspects, the Writing

Centre is situated in the Main Building, roughly equidistant from all other
campus localities.

   As with most third-level institutes around the world, participation in a
global economy and moves toward a mass education have changed the context
into which learning is facilitated (Ivanic and Lea, 2006). Increased attention
has been given to the link between education and career opportunities. In its
mission statement (University of Limerick, 2009, p. 1), the university stresses
its relationship to Ireland's national goal of preparing its citizens to participate
in a global, highly competitive knowledge economy. In an effort to upskill its
workforce, Ireland's third-level institutes strive to be more inclusive. As a result,
student populations include an ever-increasing number from backgrounds that
do not include the cultural and economic support systems that students from
more traditional backgrounds might take for granted. In order to accommodate
spatial and temporal varieties, such as distance learners, and encourage institu-
tional collaborations, greater emphasis has been placed on teaching with tech-
nology. Additionally, with state aid diminishing, there is a greater reliance on
international students for revenue, infusing the facilitation of learning and, in
particular, meaning-making tasks with further language and cultural challenges.
Funding challenges also inspire a greater interest in the link between scholarly
research and entrepreneurial development. Finally, in an effort to increase en-
rolment and to improve retention rates, attention has shifted to the student
experience. Educators are subject to a mounting pressure to evidence the qual-
ity of their performance. Against this backdrop, the Regional Writing Centre
has taken shape and has thus far survived and, in some respects, even thrived.

                  FROM INCEPTION TO FRUITION

   Prior to the establishment of the Regional Writing Centre, there had been
a growing concern among faculty at UL about the writing competencies of
their students. Initial responses to anecdotal concerns included ad hoc writing
clinics and seminars. Much of that response came via UL's Language Support
Unit. Strong support for a university-wide initiative on writing was evidenced
by the intensity of the interest. An interdisciplinary working group was formed
to investigate the means that this support might take. The disciplinary diversity
of the interest was reflected in the make-up of that initial working group, which
included representatives from each of the four Faculties; namely Arts, Humani-
ties and Social Sciences; Education and Health Sciences; the Kemmy Business
School; and Science and Engineering. The efforts of those interested in develop-
ing a writing initiative culminated in:

262
                                                                          University of Limerick (Ireland)

   · a week-long consultation with visiting Professor Jim Henry of Virginia's
       (US) George-Mason University. Jim led a series of workshops on writing
       and, with interested parties, explored how that university-wide support
       could be translated into a systematic, comprehensive approach to writ-
       ing, while addressing individual, disciplinary concerns;

   · a student and academic staff audit of attitudes to writing, writing prac-
       tices, and writing needs;

   · several submissions for funding for a UL initiative; and,
   · eventually, the establishment of a consortium of higher education insti-

       tutions in the Shannon region and a Higher Education Authority Strate-
       gic Innovation Fund (SIF) award for the establishment of the Shannon
       Consortium Regional Writing Centre in April 2007.
   This UL-led initiative, now located within the Centre for Teaching and
Learning, resulted in two Writing Consultants being employed to run the
Shannon Consortium Regional Writing Centre in UL and to collaborate with
colleagues in Teaching and Learning support services across the Consortium to
develop writing initiatives in each of these institutions: Limerick Institute of
Technology, the Institute of Technology Tralee and Mary Immaculate College,
Limerick. The two Writing Consultants (authors of this article) have always
had an interest in developing their careers as writing developers. Lawrence has
a strong background in writing, including rhetoric and composition, from Illi-
nois State University, while Íde's doctoral research was in the area of applied lin-
guistics, with an important influence from the European tradition in academic
literacies. The combined approach that they bring to the Centre has resulted
in a unique blend of the New Rhetoric (Berlin, 1982) and Academic Literacies
(Lea and Street, 1998), influencing the direction the Centre has taken. This
has led to the Writing Centre practicing a non-invasive, inductive approach
to writing development, utilising peer tutors and experts who work with both
students and staff to identify their writing practices in order to assess and im-
prove strategic effectiveness, thus producing "better writers, not better writing"
(North, 1984, p.438).
   In this national context, into which early Writing Centre initiatives were
introduced, writing was recognised as a central skill in preparing students for
the knowledge economy. All other benefits were, and to a large extent still are,
subsumed into writing's contribution to knowledge creation, dissemination
and storage. Writing Centre support would be student-centred and augment a
positive student experience. Writing Centre support would assist with recruit-
ment efforts and increase student retention. International and non-traditional
students would be attracted to the university by the support, and that same
support would give hope to a population of students that might otherwise have

                                                                                                263

given up. Research students would receive support in the complexities of re-
search writing, and faculty would have somewhere to turn to help them in their
endeavours to enhance student writing development. With more students sign-
ing on and more students staying on-board, more students publishing research
and increased utilisation of writing expertise in classrooms, writing would make
its contribution to the upskilling of the nation.

   In addition to the broader cultural, economic and political contexts inform-
ing the approach that writing development would take, the working group took
into account the results of the student and staff surveys of writing needs. The
analysis of the surveys revealed that students recognised the importance of writ-
ing for both their academic careers and for their future professional develop-
ment. Furthermore, the need and the desire for a systematic approach to the
development of writing became obvious. The multiplicity of writing-related
needs was evident in the surveys, and it was agreed that a writing centre that
would incorporate a multidimensional approach would best meet those needs.

   A Regional Writing Centre at the University of Limerick would be the first
of its kind in Ireland. The Writing Centre would serve as a vital nexus of uni-
versity writing activities at UL and across the Consortium. The factors moti-
vating such a choice are explored in depth in Cleary, Graham, Jeanneau and
O'Sullivan (2009, p. 4.12):

         The establishment of a Writing Centre is an important and,
         in the Irish HE context, ground-breaking step. It provides a
         centralised locus for the provision of a systematic discipline-
         specific writing support and development programme. The
         Writing Centre responds directly to the writing needs identi-
         fied in the staff and student surveys carried out at UL and
         corroborating evidence from students and faculty surveys rep-
         licated in the other three institutions in the Shannon Consor-
         tium. While initial writing support was provided on an ad hoc
         basis, the move now is clearly towards a Writing in the Disci-
         plines approach with elements of the Writing Across the Cur-
         riculum and Writing to Learn approaches being incorporated.
         The academic literacies approach, encapsulating both the study
         skills and acculturation models, has also been influential. Such
         an eclectic approach satisfies the multiplicity of writing needs
         of UL students identified in the online surveys.

   Responding to the multiplicity of demands meant that the Writing Centre
was charged with supporting the development of academic writing among un-

264
                                                                          University of Limerick (Ireland)

dergraduates, postgraduates and researchers and with supporting staff in their
teaching of academic writing. The objectives of the Centre, as set out in the first
phase of the SIF project (2007-2009), were as follows:

   · Improve writing skills of students in the collaborating institutions to as-
       sist them with current studies and future professional lives.

   · Support course and curriculum design/development.
   · Foster meta-cognitive thinking about writing.
   · Bolster recruitment and retention efforts, by supporting students with

       particular needs, specifically mature students, first years, students in Ac-
       cess programmes.
   · Conduct ongoing evaluation of interventions.
   · Initiate a site for action research output related to writing.
   · Share existing expertise and experience to date among collaborating
       institutions.
   Charged with the responsibility to design, deliver and evaluate writing-sup-
port interventions and to assist with the development of an academic plan for
the continued development of the Writing Centre, the two Writing Consul-
tants set about developing Ireland's first Regional Writing Centre.
   A first priority for the Writing Centre was to support student writers. With
the goal of bolstering student recruitment and retention, strong emphasis has
been placed on facilitating first-year students' acculturation into the academic
community, while also reaching out to targeted groups of students with particu-
lar needs. This goal has been achieved through the following media:
   · Writing Interventions in Disciplinary Modules: The two Writing Consul-
       tants have worked closely with subject specialists to design such inter-
       ventions in a significant number of disciplines. Such interventions are
       delivered by the Writing Consultants or trained tutors or teaching as-
       sistants from within the discipline.
   · One-to-one Tutorial Assistance: The number of one-on-one sessions in the
       Writing Centre has been steadily increasing since our inception. In ac-
       cordance with this, the number of tutors and the disciplines they repre-
       sent has also increased. Undergraduate peer-tutors are recruited from the
       module Peer-tutoring in Academic Writing, based on their performance
       in that module. Postgraduates are selected based on an interview and
       an evaluation of their writing and, subsequently, trained in our Writing
       Centre tutoring techniques.
   · Stand-alone Workshops: These generic writing initiatives include essay-
       writing workshops, academic-writing workshops and writing support for
       mature students, facilitated by the two Writing Consultants and trained
       tutors.

                                                                                                265
O'Sullivan and Cleary

   · Online Resources: Online resources are developed by the two Writing
       Consultants, with assistance from the Technology Enhanced Learning
       Advisor from the Centre for Teaching and Learning.

   In addition to the above activities, further initiatives have been created spe-
cifically for postgraduate students, who seek support not only for the devel-
opment of their own writing, but also training in best practice for tutoring
writing. These postgraduate initiatives include writing workshops, for example
thesis writing and writing-for-publication; writers' groups for postgraduate and
post-doctoral researchers; and peer-tutoring and tutor training in writing.

   The third key focus of the Centre has been on faculty development on best
practices for teaching with writing. The aim has been to assist faculty in develop-
ing student writing, while also developing their own academic writing. Events
have been organised to facilitate staff development in teaching with writing; for
instance, writing-in-disciplines and writing-to-learn workshops and a sympo-
sium on writing entitled Research on Writing Practices: Consequences for the
Teaching of Writing and Learner Outcomes. The number of staff participating
in writing-in-disciplines initiatives has increased; equally, Writing Centre staff
have been involved in the training of tutors on several discipline-specific mod-
ules. In 2009, the Writing Centre also made a successful bid to host the 2011
EATAW (European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing) confer-
ence, not only demonstrating the growing international status of the Centre,
but also providing our staff with access to current research on best practices in
teaching writing. Faculty development is an area that would certainly need to
be developed further in order to incorporate writing into the curriculum in a
meaningful way. The Centre would like to provide regular workshops to faculty
on different areas of best practice for teaching and researching writing.

   In relation to the professional development of writing amongst staff, the
Centre for Teaching and Learning has been successfully supporting these writ-
ers for some time prior to the existence of the Writing Centre. This support has
been primarily in the form of staff development workshops and writers' retreats,
for which the theory and pedagogy have been developed by Professor Sarah
Moore (2003), now Associate Vice-President at UL, through her collaborations
with Professor Rowena Murray at the University of Strathclyde, Scotland, who
has provided models for postgraduate and academic staff writing development
(Murray & Moore, 2006).

   Finally, in order to ensure the goal to initiate a site for action research and
publication, Writing Centre staff conduct and publish action research to con-
tribute to the body of scholarship on academic writing and the teaching of
writing (Cleary & O'Sullivan 2008; Cleary, Graham, Jeanneau & O'Sullivan,
2009). Academic writing development in the Shannon region continues to be

266
                                                                          University of Limerick (Ireland)

based on researched best practices in writing and writing pedagogy, as evidenced
by recent Writing Centre staff publications and the Centre's growing national
and international links with writing programme directors and scholars.

   CHALLENGES FOR THE REGIONAL WRITING CENTRE

   As the Centre grew, so did some of the challenges facing the Centre. In-
terestingly, our challenges did not relate to interest in the Centre or issues of
visibility. In truth, the interest was so great, we were struggling to cope with the
demand. At its inception, interest came only from a few departments in each
of the faculties; now requests were coming from a vast range of departments
across all four faculties. However, given the relative absence of a writing culture
or writing programmes in the university, it was difficult to envisage from where
the writing expertise to sustain the demand would emerge. We recognised that
the development of this culture was going to be a slow process. To this end, in
addition to the initiatives described above, it was decided that the development
of writing modules would help to further the development of a culture in writ-
ing from which the required expertise would eventually emerge.

   The development of a writing culture began with the development of a
range of modules in writing, each assigned an individual code commencing
with AW (Academic Writing), thus establishing an important identity for the
Writing Centre modules. Academic Literacies 1 and 2 (AW4001 and AW4002)
are offered to first-year students in the arts, humanities and social sciences. The
aim of these modules is to facilitate the transition to university for students in
this faculty. More importantly, these modules foster an awareness of writing
among students at an early stage of their academic careers. The Writing Centre
is responsible for training the tutors who are recruited from appropriate disci-
plines within the faculty, an activity which again fosters an important awareness
of writing, while equally fostering a systematic approach.

   Another module, Peer-tutoring in Academic Writing (AW4006), is offered
as an elective module to students wishing to enhance their writing skills, while
training to become peer-tutors in the Writing Centre. Again, this accredited
module fosters an awareness of writing among students but, equally, it pro-
vides the Centre with a panel of well-trained peer-tutors to work in the Writing
Centre. The development of two modules entitled Research Planning and Prep-
aration and Scholarly Presentation and Dialogue in Research and Academic
Writing, delivered as part of the Specialist Diploma in Teaching, Learning and
Scholarship, is a third illustration of how expertise in writing is nurtured among
our future teachers.

                                                                                                267
O'Sullivan and Cleary

 SUSTAINABILITY OF THE REGIONAL WRITING CENTRE

   Another responsibility of the Writing Consultants, in addition to devel-
oping student writing, was to assist with the development of an academic
plan for the continued development of the Writing Centre. The most im-
portant aspect of this plan was the sustainability of the Writing Centre in
the post-SIF (Strategic Initiative Fund) period. Throughout the SIF-funded
period, the aim of the Centre was to ensure the development of initiatives
that would be valued so greatly that the institutions would not want to do
without them. However, as the SIF project neared an end in June 2009,
the possibility of further SIF funding to sustain the Shannon Consortium
Regional Writing Centre diminished as the economic climate weakened.
The focus for future funding turned toward the individual institutions for
sustainability. UL contributed matching SIF funding to sustain the Re-
gional Writing Centre at the university for a further year, until June 2010.
The efforts of the Centre staff in that year were to ensure that the funding
for the Writing Centre would come from core budget. Embedding Writing
Centre activity in core curricula, it was advised, was the means to ensuring
sustainability. In addition to continuing the initiatives outlined above, the
Centre was involved in the design and development of further modules to
ensure its presence in the core activities of the university; for instance, the
development of modules entitled Thesis Writing, Advanced Technical Com-
munication for Engineers, and Educational Guidance have been developed
in conjunction with the MA programme in English Language Teaching,
the MEng in Mechanical Aeronautical Engineering and the pre-university
Access programme respectively. It was hoped that these modules, alongside
ever-increasing intervention within disciplinary modules, would be enough
to ensure our sustainability in the university.

   Efforts to ensure the sustainability of the Writing Centre have resulted in the
Centre growing quite rapidly and in many diverse directions. Such diversity en-
sured the visibility of the Centre in its infancy and built goodwill amongst fac-
ulty and staff. However, with limited resources, such diversity and rapid growth
would be difficult to maintain. Following the external evaluation of the Writing
Centre in July 2008,1 carried out by Professor. Terry Myers Zawacki, former
Writing Center Director and currently Director of the Writing Across the Cur-
riculum (WAC) Program at George Mason University, it was recommended
that the scope of activities and initiatives the Centre had developed in the SIF-
funded period be narrowed in order to ensure the sustainability of the Centre
and to grow the Centre in the two areas central to its core mission, namely to
assist students with their writing, through one-on-one and group support, as a

268
                                                                          University of Limerick (Ireland)

way to bolster both recruitment and retention efforts; and, secondly, to assist
faculty across disciplines in their efforts to teach with writing.

   In moving forward and developing new initiatives, we have been careful
to ensure that they do indeed enhance these two areas of our core mission. As
we continue to develop writing interventions in disciplinary modules, we will
recruit postgraduate students from within the disciplines to help create and de-
liver such interventions, a task which will become easier as the culture of writ-
ing is developed. In her evaluation, Professor Zawacki recommended the de-
velopment of a Writing Fellows programme to this end. Equally, we will strive
to help staff to nurture these important writing skills in their own classrooms
rather than always calling on the experts to intervene. This will entail support-
ing disciplinary staff through ongoing workshops on teaching with writing and
by populating our website with useful support materials and resources.

                               CONCLUSION

   The primary research carried out at the inception of the project highlighted
evidence of a non-systematic approach to writing development and support;
it suggested that writing was not getting the attention it needed, despite its
centrality to success at third level and its impact on students' professional lives.
The Regional Writing Centre at UL now provides a coordinated, systematic
approach to the teaching, learning and research of academic writing and to aca-
demic writing support across the region, supporting undergraduate and post-
graduate student writers and collaborating with faculty to expand writing-based
curriculum innovations. The Writing Centre's activities work towards enhanc-
ing the quality and effectiveness of teaching and research across the region,
while enhancing the student experience. In its short existence, the Writing Cen-
tre has become an essential part of the regional landscape and is now recognised
as a unique centre of expertise and knowledge in Ireland.

   All of the efforts to ensure sustainability highlighted herein culminated in
the presentation of a three-year business/academic plan for the Writing Cen-
tre to the University Executive Committee. At the time of the writing of this
profile, it was announced that the Executive Committee, after much time and
deliberation, had agreed to mainstream the Regional Writing Centre at UL.
Consortium partners may wish to invest in the writing expertise offered by
the Regional Writing Centre at UL, following a shared-services model, thereby
benefiting from, yet avoiding the full cost of, programmes developed through
UL writing expertise. Writing Consultants from UL will work with staff in each
of these institutions to develop writing initiatives therein. Such expertise may

                                                                                                269

well be extended beyond the Consortium partners to the National University
of Ireland, Galway, which has recently formed a new alliance with UL. Moving
forward will bring new and exciting challenges for the Regional Writing Centre
in its ever-expanding regional profile.

    NEW WRITING IN AN OLD

    LAND

      By Trudy Zuckermann, Bella Rubin, and Hadara Perpignan
      Achva Academic College of Education, Tel Aviv University,
      and Bar-Ilan University (Israel)

       This essay covers the history of academic writing development in Is-
       rael (vertically) and the landscape and diversity of the present pro-
       grams (horizontally). It explains why Israel was slow in developing
       programs in either Hebrew or English, although there were academic
       institutions in the country even before the establishment of the State.
       It describes the foresight of our first prime minister, David Ben-Gu-
       rion, in his realization that some students need extra support in or-
       der to succeed academically, the contribution of Eliezer Ben Yehudah
       in the development of the modern Hebrew language, and the insight
       of the sponsors of the Wolfson Family Charitable Trust in the need for
       scientists and social scientists to write for the global community. The
       picture is one of slow growth, recent innovations, attempts to develop
       programs in spite of budgetary cuts, and dreams for a better future.
       The establishment of IFAW, the Israel Forum for Academic Writing,
       and the attempts to connect with like-minded educators throughout
       the world through international conferences are bright spots on the
       horizon.

   In preparation for the symposium at the 2007 EATAW conference, "His-
torical Roots of National Writing Cultures," we began doing research on the
state of academic writing and its history in the modern State of Israel. We
were amazed, even then, about how many different programs exist in English
and in Hebrew, and how little we knew about what other people were doing,
even within the same institution. It was this situation that encouraged us to
organize what has become IFAW, the Israel Forum for Academic Writing, and
to continue our research in this area. The following profile essay is one result
of these efforts.1

              THE BEGINNINGS: INSTITUTIONS OF
                  HIGHER EDUCATION IN ISRAEL

   Israel is an old-new country. The history of Israel is at least 3,000 years old;
on the other hand, the modern State of Israel was born only 63 years ago. Even
before the State of Israel was established in 1948, three institutions of higher
education had been founded: the Israeli Institute for Technology (the Tech-
nion) in 1914; the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in 1925, and the Weizmann
Institute of Science (then called the Daniel Sieff Research Institute) in 1934.

   The first universities in modern Israel were based on European models, with
the idea that the cultured, intellectual community should be able to learn and
to spread knowledge to the masses throughout the nation and the world. There
were very few books available in those days; so the system was based mainly on
lectures and discussion, the professors being the privileged few who had already
breathed the air of the European university tradition. In pre-state Israel and
even after the establishment of the State, studying at a university was a privilege
of the very few.

   The Weizmann Institute of Science opened its doors in 1934. This was to
be a different kind of academic institution, namely a research center for gradu-
ate students who would devote their lives to using science for the benefit of
humanity. Scientists and professors were expected to publish the results of their
research, and it was assumed that they knew how to do this. Many of them did.

   Students who did enter Israeli universities were expected to know how to
write academic papers without being trained and without getting feedback on
their writing. It was assumed that if you were accepted to a university, then you
knew how to write academic papers. Thus, Israeli universities never developed
a tradition of Freshman Composition or Writing across the Curriculum, either
in Hebrew or in English. It is only within the last few years that freshman
composition courses have begun to appear in the universities, and that a greater
concern about writing instruction in general has manifested itself among Israeli
educators.

   Today, there are numerous tertiary institutions in Israel. Four additional
universities (Bar-Ilan University, 1955; Tel Aviv University, 1956-1963; Uni-
versity of Haifa, 1963; Ben-Gurion University, 1969) as well as the Open Uni-
versity began operating in Israel during the first decades of the State. In addi-
tion, private institutions such as IDC (the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center)
were established, and numerous colleges have been granted the right to issue
bachelors' and masters' degrees by the Council of Higher Education. In the
Palestinian Authority, twenty institutions of higher learning are listed on the In-
ternet, all established since 1967. Bethlehem University, founded in 1973, the

272
Achva Academic College of Education, Tel Aviv University, and Bar-Ilan University (Israel)

first university established in the West Bank, can trace its roots to 1893, when
the De La Salle Christian Brothers opened schools in Bethlehem, Jerusalem,
Jaffa, and Nazareth, as well as in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, and Egypt.2 Al-Quds
University was established in 1984 with the purpose of providing education to
Palestinian students from Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine. Since then, Al-
Quds University has expanded to encompass 10 faculties and sixteen institutes
and centers, and serves a student body of more than 5000.3

   With such a wide range of tertiary institutions, it is very difficult to ascertain
where there is any type of writing program and in what languages. We have
begun our own mapping project, but it is incomplete. What is clear is that
today's students in all institutions need professional guidance in order to cope
with their writing tasks.

   The remainder of this paper will trace the developments of writing instruc-
tion in Israel, according to the information we have been able to gather thus far,
and will describe the directions and goals of the present programs as well as our
hopes for the future.

 A BIT OF A DIGRESSION: THE STRUGGLE FOR HEBREW

   Eliezer Ben-Yehuda, the pioneer and prophet of the modern Hebrew lan-
guage, was born in 1858 in Lithuania.4 Like most Jewish children of the time
in Eastern Europe, he began learning Hebrew for prayer and Bible study at an
early age in the hope that he would become a great rabbi; instead he became
a product of the "Haskalah," the Enlightenment movement in Europe. Ben-
Yehuda and many other promising young Jews of Eastern Europe at the time
left the Talmudic academy and entered a Russian gymnasium and/or a Euro-
pean university.

274

   Hebrew had been used throughout the ages for religious purposes--prayer
and Bible study--especially by male Jews in Eastern Europe, North Africa, and
Yemen. In addition, even as far back as the medieval period, secular literature in
Hebrew, especially poetry and philosophy, existed. By the nineteenth century,
there were also a number of Hebrew periodicals in Europe, and a few people
were beginning to write poetry, short stories, and essays in the ancient tongue.
Interestingly enough, during all this time, Hebrew was only a written language
and not a spoken tongue. It was Ben-Yehuda's dream to make it a spoken lan-
guage as well. Today the process is reversed. Almost everyone in Israel speaks
and understands Hebrew. What is necessary is to educate people to write in
Hebrew as well.

   When Ben-Yehuda arrived in Palestine in 1881, he had already published
his first article on the importance of reviving the Hebrew language. He imme-
diately began work on his three-pronged plan of action: Hebrew in the Home;
Hebrew in the School, and Hebrew for Adults. It was not an easy plan to car-
ry through. Members of the religious community objected to using the holy
tongue for secular purposes, and the Turks, who ruled the country at that time,
objected to the official use of any language other than Turkish. In spite of many
hardships, Ben-Yehuda and his supporters persisted and eventually succeeded
in their goal.

   In the Ben-Yehuda home, it was forbidden for children to hear any language
other than Hebrew. Others followed his example. As a child, sixty years after
Ben-Yehuda had arrived in the country, Amos Oz writes that his parents knew
many different languages, but they taught him only Hebrew (Oz, 2004). This
was the general trend for many immigrant families.

   Ben Yehuda believed that in order for the younger generation to begin
speaking Hebrew freely, it would be necessary to have Hebrew become the lan-
guage of instruction in all Jewish schools in the country. This was not an easy
task, as there were vested interests in maintaining instruction in French, Ger-
man, English, and Yiddish. Ben Yehuda began by insisting that all kindergarten
teachers learn Hebrew so that very quickly the children would became native
speakers of Hebrew. By 1898, there were six all-encompassing Hebrew schools
in the country, and fourteen part time Hebrew schools, with a total enrollment
of 2,500 pupils. In 1900, the first method book for teaching Hebrew was pub-
lished, and in 1906, the first Hebrew high school was founded in Jaffa (St. John,
1952; Cooper-Weill, 1998).

   With the establishment of the Technion in 1913-14, the first major lan-
guage war took place. The founders of the Technion from Germany insisted
that it was logical for instruction to take place in German, since the language
of science at the time was German and students needed to communicate with

                                                                                                275

the scientific community throughout the world. Many scientific and technical
terms did not even exist in Hebrew at the time. However, the students and in-
structors went on strike and refused to return to classes unless Hebrew became
the language of instruction. They won the battle: the language of instruction in
all universities in the country was to be Hebrew. In 1921, the Mandate author-
ity recognized Hebrew, as well as Arabic and English, as official languages (Bein,
1971; Spolsky and Shohamy, 1999).

   Finally, Ben-Yehuda wanted the Hebrew language to permeate the entire so-
ciety. He had begun publishing his own Hebrew newspaper, called "Hatzvi," in
1884. Here, as well as in many speeches, discussions, and meetings, he propa-
gandized for the use of Hebrew in the home, in schools, in the workplace, in the
marketplace; in fact, all over. However, in a sense, the founders of the Technion
were correct. Not only scientific terms, but also many modern concepts and
ideas did not exist in nineteenth century Hebrew. Ben-Yehuda began introduc-
ing new words in his newspaper. By a careful study of ancient and medieval
texts, he was able to coin new terms from the old roots and to spread his ideas
and linguistic coinages to Hebrew readers throughout the world. The words he
entered in his seventeen-volume dictionary, which was completed only after
his death by his wife and son, followed strict philological rules. Ben-Yehuda
founded the Hebrew Language Council in 1890, the forerunner of the pres-
ent Hebrew Language Academy, which continues to introduce new words and
concepts into modern spoken and written Hebrew, to solve various linguistic
problems in the Hebrew language, and to set acceptable standards for the use
of the language.

   Ben-Yehuda and his followers succeeded in reviving the ancient Hebrew
language into a vital, modern language in everyday use. There is no doubt that
this is an impressive achievement. Unlike most countries, where monolingual
policy originates and is enforced by powerful, political forces (Kibner, 2008),
the Hebrew-only initiative was a grassroots movement, which, for many years,
needed to struggle against the powers-that-be. Today, however, when the He-
brew language is clearly the lingua-franca of most Israelis, the necessity of insist-
ing on Hebrew-only policies is questionable. Was it necessary, for instance, dur-
ing 2009, designated by the Ministry of Education as the year for the Hebrew
language, for the Ministry to instruct schools to begin playing only Hebrew
songs during school recesses and in all school events and activities? Why did
the President of the Hebrew Language Academy express such strong opposi-
tion concerning a proposed graduate course at the Technion to be conducted
in English in order to attract foreign students? (How could this happen at the
Technion, he wanted to know, where the first major battle in academia for the
Hebrew language took place?)

276

   According to some, the imposition of Hebrew only is a mixed blessing (Sho-
hamy, 2009). We shall touch on this problem as we continue to discuss the
development of writing programs in higher education in Israel today.

             WRITING "A NATURAL PHENOMENON:
                   NO NEED FOR INSTRUCTION"

   Amos Oz states in his autobiography, "All Jerusalem, in my childhood, in
the last years of British rule, sat at home and wrote. Hardly anyone had a radio
in those days, and there was no television or video or compact disc player or
Internet or e-mail, not even the telephone. But everyone had a pencil and a
notebook" (Oz, 2004, p.285). Later, even when he moved to the kibbutz, he
found that farmers devoted to manual labor often wrote modest articles and
sometimes even poetry (Oz, 2004, p.468).

   Perhaps one reason for the lack of attention to specific writing skills in
Israel until recently, whether in the elementary and secondary grades or
in the universities, was that writing seemed to be a natural phenomenon,
like sleeping or breathing. Even though most people did not attend univer-
sity, many people wrote. In those days, people wrote in many languages.
However, their children, the second generation, wrote only in Hebrew. No
matter what their occupation at the time, members of the first generation
were, like Ben Yehuda himself, products of the "Haskalah" or "Enlighten-
ment" movement. Others, who had not been exposed to European secular
education, were, nevertheless, products of a literate tradition: the Bible, the
Mishnah, etc. The style was argumentative and sometimes poetic, not the
traditional Western, academic writing we know today. Nevertheless, if these
people entered the university, they were able to survive without a freshman
composition course.

   What has happened since then to the culture of writing in Israel? We know
that many of our students who enter institutions of higher education have dif-
ficulty writing, and some enter with writer's block. Is it because of the failure of
the school system (large classes, discipline problems, matriculation exams, poor
planning, too many subjects, poor teaching)? Is it the conditions of life today:
technology, Internet, TV, many more activities and distractions?

   We do know that higher education in Israel no longer belongs to the privi-
leged few. More students come from non-academic backgrounds. Members of
the Ethiopian and Bedouin communities come from oral-aural cultures where
writing played no part. Students with learning differences are accepted into
colleges and universities. In addition, for some students, Hebrew is a third or

                                                                                                277
Zuckermann, Rubin, and Perpignan

fourth language, and English (which is a requirement for the Bachelors' degree)
may be a fourth or fifth language.

   It is true that professors throughout the ages have always complained that
some of their students do not know how to write properly. But today's concern
seems more acute, both about students writing in their native language, He-
brew, and certainly about their writing skills in English. Those of us who have
worked with such students, whether at the beginning of their college career or
at the post-graduate level, have long realized that those entering higher educa-
tion are in need of professional guidance in order to cope with their writing
tasks.

             BEN-GURION AND THE PREPARATORY
                  PROGRAMS (THE "MECHINOT")

   The realization that some students needed additional support in order to
succeed in higher education came from our first prime-minister, David Ben-
Gurion. One of his dreams was to integrate the many non-Western immigrants
into Israeli society as equal citizens. They, too, should have a chance in higher
education, he believed. In order to do this, these students, who did not have
the advantages of a European education or the educational background of their
peers, needed extra preparation and support before they could enter the uni-
versity. For this purpose, the first preparatory program was established at the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem. It was probably the first place in Israel where
academic writing in Hebrew was taught. The Saltiel Center for Pre-Academic
Studies continues to flourish to this day, as do many other preparatory pro-
grams throughout the country.

   Among the required courses during this preparatory year, all students in the
program take a course called "Scientific Writing." Depending on their level,
students study writing four, six, or eight hours a week. The present student
population is somewhat different from the original group of students in 1968.
It consists both of very strong students who are interested in improving their
matriculation grades so they can enter prestigious departments such as medi-
cine, law, or psychology, and very weak students, some of whom come from an
oral culture where they were never expected to write at all.

   Some students at the Center know how to write, but not academically; some
lack worldly knowledge. For some, it is an embarrassment to take writing cours-
es in Hebrew, which is their mother tongue. The influence of culture on writing
is also very strong. For example, it is very difficult for Arab students to write
summaries without injecting an interpretation of their own.

278
      Achva Academic College of Education, Tel Aviv University, and Bar-Ilan University (Israel)

   In all courses, the connection between reading academic texts and academic
writing is stressed, as the need is felt for students to broaden and deepen their
knowledge before they begin to write. Organization strategies and thinking
skills are taught. Students then study text types and the hierarchy structure
within texts, and practice writing summaries. Before they write definitions of
their own, they analyze different types of definition within texts. They must
learn to give ideas their exact designation. Finally, they work on the develop-
ment of their own ideas through paragraph structure and organization of larger
texts. Later in the course, the use of sources is covered. As a final project, stu-
dents from the higher levels in all divisions and all social science students are
required to write a paper of about 3,000 words.

         ADDITIONAL HEBREW WRITING PROGRAMS

   Many colleges in Israel offer academic degrees today, and in so doing have
attempted to develop academic writing programs in both Hebrew and English.
Students preparing to become teachers are expected to do both conventional,
academic writing and reflective writing within the framework of the academy.
They are often confused when suddenly encouraged to express their own ideas
and feelings and use the first person singular. They see the academic context
and expectations of essay writing established within the wider institution as in-
hibiting their ability and willingness to reflect in writing (Zuckermann, 2007).
In addition to these two different aspects of academic writing, future teachers
must prepare themselves to teach their own pupils how to write. Even native
speakers of a language may find these requirements formidable. For teachers
college students who may be writing in a language that is not their mother
tongue, the task is many times more difficult.

   A varied number of programs have been developed in the teachers colleges.
Some programs are similar to the skills-based program described in the univer-
sity preparatory program above. Others, like the David Yellin College in Jerusa-
lem, have developed experimental programs where students in each department
of the college are required to take an introductory course in their discipline dur-
ing their first year of studies. This course includes a unit on academic writing in
that discipline, a kind of combination of WAC (Writing across the Curriculum)
and WID (Writing in the Disciplines).

   In another institution, the Kibbutzim College, a writing center has been
successfully established in place of the Hebrew academic writing courses. As far
as we know, this is the only fully-developed writing center in Israel in spite of
many attempts to establish such a center in the universities. The SAL'OR Writ-

                                                                                                279

ing Center is one section of the three-tier complex of the alternative learning
centers at Kibbutzim College. These are all housed together in one building,
which contains a concentration of library activities and a counseling center. It is
hoped that students will learn to use the facilities of the center as an aid in their
academic work. SAL'OR and the other two centers in the building are part of
the trend of "alternative learning" or mentoring systems for academic activities.

   The first academic writing program at Kibbutzim College was a one-semes-
ter course for all students, which did not seem to be meeting the goals of having
students properly prepared to do the writing they were expected to do at the
college. In 1995, all academic writing courses at the college were cancelled, and
the staff was moved to the new SAL'OR center.

   The center is open five full days a week. Sessions last one half hour each;
study sessions are arranged ahead of time. Students come on a voluntary basis
as frequently or infrequently as they like. Some come because they feel a techni-
cal need to complete an assignment; some are completely overwhelmed by their
assignments and don't know where to begin; some are more knowledgeable and
want specific guidance. Students do not receive academic credit for attending
sessions; nor is there any grade assessment given at the center for the comple-
tion of assignments: the grade is given by the course instructor. However, both
oral and written formative assessment is given to the students on the process of
their writing, and there is detailed record-keeping of each student's progress. All
the mentors are experienced lecturers at the college, with knowledge and some
training in academic literacy as well as expertise in at least one other subject.
They receive salaries from the original budget allotted to the semester courses in
academic literacy that were cancelled.

   About 10 percent of the students in the regular four-year program come
to the center voluntarily. In addition, special sessions are arranged for students
from different language and cultural backgrounds and those with learning dis-
abilities and other difficulties. Students in the English department also receive
tutoring in English academic writing.

   The staff of the center works to ensure contact with other staff members of
the college. Department heads and lecturers are consulted to coordinate specific
needs and norms of writing in their disciplines. Sometimes mentors from the
center are invited by lecturers to give workshops to groups of students or an
entire class. Often, some of these students arrive at the center afterwards for
individual help. The center has also given courses to other members of the col-
lege staff who are interested.

   A special project was conducted with experienced teachers in the field who
returned to the college to earn a BEd or upgrade their education in some other
way. Many of them felt overwhelmed by the many writing assignments they

280
      Achva Academic College of Education, Tel Aviv University, and Bar-Ilan University (Israel)

received at the college. A combination of group mentoring and one-to-one tu-
toring was used. By the end of the course, most participants had become more
confident about their writing and were very enthusiastic about the work at the
center.

   Colleges other than teachers colleges have also developed writing programs
in recent years. In some cases, it has been difficult to obtain administrative sup-
port for these programs. In other cases, administrators have come to realize the
importance of helping students professionally in their writing tasks and those
they will face after leaving the academy.

              THE WOLFSON PROJECT--ACADEMIC
                         WRITING IN ENGLISH

   In the early days of the State, students had to write seminar papers and
theses, but mostly in Hebrew. Later students were being asked to publish in
English for international journals during their graduate studies, especially in
the sciences. The students, however, wrote only in Hebrew. As there were no
courses in academic writing, PhD advisors were expected to teach their students
how to write in English, how to publish, and how to enter the international
scientific community.

   We know of two courses in English composition, one at the Hebrew Uni-
versity, and the second at Tel-Aviv University (TAU). The Hebrew University
course was taught gratis and served only faculty members, not students. The
TAU course was funded directly from the Rector's office and served a handful of
PhD students and some faculty members. Both of these courses were taught by
teachers with no writing instruction background or experience and with little
or no theoretical framework.

   There were also composition courses in the English literature departments,
but only for literature students whose native language, on the whole, was Eng-
lish. In the early 1980s, a "bridge course" was designed at TAU, the purpose of
which was to help Israeli students improve their writing in English and eventu-
ally be accepted into the English Literature Department. This course ran for
years and was actually one of the first English academic writing courses for for-
eign language students in Israel, but it served only literature and some linguistic
students. Other Israelis who wished to publish in international journals gener-
ally hired English-speaking immigrants to translate and/or edit their work, a
grueling but profitable task for the lucky British, Americans, or South Africans.

   Soon after the establishment of the State, the teaching of English for Aca-
demic Purposes became an established field. However, the focus was primarily

                                                                                                281

on reading comprehension. By this time, there were more books imported from
abroad available, and although courses were taught in Hebrew, students had to
cope with bibliographies and textbooks that were written in English. The uni-
versities reluctantly took on some of the responsibility for helping students do
so, but the dominant attitude was that students who couldn't cope with their
reading assignments in English did not belong in the university. As to writing,
it was assumed that if students could read in English, they could also write in
English. Indeed, if people were studying at universities, they certainly knew
how to write in Hebrew, the national language, and therefore, they could do so
in English.

   These were the dominant attitudes for many years by those who made peda-
gogical decisions. Then in 1986, the Wolfson Family Charitable Trust, which
had previously given financial support in the sciences to institutions of higher
education in Israel, approached the University Teachers of English Language in
Israel (UTELI) and offered to sponsor a pilot project to teach Israeli PhD stu-
dents to improve their writing in English. It seemed to the sponsors that Israeli
academics were losing ground in the international scientific community.

   In its earliest stage, the Wolfson Project consisted of three selected writing
instructors who were to design their own syllabi and create their own instruc-
tional materials, with guidance from the project coordinator. The courses were
originally designed for PhD and post-doctoral students, since undergraduate
courses in Israel are taught in Hebrew. The major aim was to prepare students
to write research papers and minimally to make conference presentations. The
original project was extended to all the universities in Israel, following which
most academic institutions agreed to support the teaching of writing in English
and eventually to take over the financial support. Thus, the first generation of
organized English academic writing courses in Israel was born.

   The program was based, above all, on the principle of authenticity. Students
used real data, no matter the discipline, in the main writing tasks they did. They
wrote authentic abstracts for conferences and/or articles; grant proposals; parts
of their thesis; book chapters; experimental research reports; conference papers;
review articles; even academic correspondence . . . and CVs. Most courses were
geared either to the biological sciences, exact sciences, humanities, or social sci-
ences, but some were mixed. Although the graduate students in the project had
to produce real-world texts, the process approach was used and criteria were
developed for assessment and evaluation without using grades. The project co-
ordinator and participating teachers insisted on individual student conferences
and maintaining contact with subject specialists/PhD advisors. However, many
university administrators were not willing to accept conferences as an integral
part of the course syllabus, an issue of contention that remains.

   Today's practices, based on the original Wolfson Project, reflect the develop-
ment of academic writing research in the twenty-first century and vary some-
what in the different institutions throughout Israel. In general, although class
size is no longer limited to twelve students, emphasis is still placed on one-
to-one student-teacher conferences/tutorials and e-mail. E-learning and virtual
courses have been developed. Today, program evaluation is more systematized
and performed both during the courses and after they end. In addition to in-
structor assessment, peer review is encouraged, and criteria for judging written
work are developed by both students and instructors. There is more refined em-
phasis on audience: readership of journals, members of academic committees,
conference organizing committees, journal editors, etc. Students may choose
their own scientific articles in their specific fields of research to be used as model
texts. Many more genres are dealt with (e.g., grant proposals, thesis chapters,
conference presentations, e-mail, letters to journal editors, CV writing, use
of PowerPoint). Since conference presentations also involve oral presentation
skills, students may participate in mini-conferences where they practice with
PowerPoint and videos. Emphasis is placed on authentic texts based on actual
data which students are intending to publish and on content-based courses
with actual tasks students are required to complete for their subject courses.
There is better contact with subject specialists, student advisors, and university
administrators.

        DEVELOPMENTS FROM 1990 TO THE PRESENT

   Today there is greater recognition of the need for writing courses in He-
brew, as well as in English, throughout Israel. Composition courses for Arabic
speakers writing in Arabic seem to be at a minimum, however. The attitude of
administrators, including those in Arab colleges, seems to be that students will
need to write in Hebrew in order to get along in Israeli society, and in English
in order to publish internationally; so why waste precious resources on teach-
ing Arab composition? In the Arab Institute of Beit Berl Academic College of
Education, whereas Arabic as a first language is scheduled for up to six hours
a week for all three-year BEd students, the emphasis is on reading comprehen-
sion, not writing. It will probably take a few more years to convince the policy
makers that writing in the mother tongue is a necessary prerequisite to writing
in other languages.

   As far as Hebrew writing goes, the necessity for more concentrated instruc-
tion seems to have filtered down into the K-12 school system. Previously, writing
was not mandated to be taught by the Ministry of Education until the eleventh

                                                                                                283

or twelfth grade. Creative writing was not included in the official curriculum at
all. Of course there were some teachers who provided opportunities for written
expression even in the elementary grades, but nothing was mandated officially.

   Beginning in 2010, pupils in the seventh and eighth grades are given a sub-
ject called "Ivrit" (Hebrew) six hours a week, instead of the old language and
written and oral expression courses which were taught two to three hours a
week altogether. In our opinion, this is a positive development, showing an
increased awareness of the need for developing writing skills as early as possible.
There is still a long way to go, but this is a beginning, and we hope that our ef-
forts on the tertiary level will eventually influence the elementary grades.

   In regard to activity in Hebrew on the tertiary level, since 2007 freshmen
in the humanities division of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem are required
to take a course called "Introduction to Hebrew Composition." In the Master's
Degree Program of the Hebrew University Nursing School of Hadassah Hospi-
tal, a Hebrew writing course has been operating since 2008. Other departments
of the university, mainly in the social sciences, require some writing instruction.
Many instructors help their students step-by-step in producing a project or a
research paper, for instance.

   The Rothberg School for International Students of the Hebrew University in
Jerusalem offers a one-year preparatory program for non-native Israeli students.
Since 2000, students in the two upper levels of their mandated Hebrew language
courses are required to take a one-semester course in academic writing in con-
junction with their mandatory history course. Because students are required to
write a paper as a final project in history, they are motivated to learn the skills
necessary for such an endeavor. The instructors in the academic writing courses
are the history teachers who have been trained especially for this purpose.

   Students in the lower levels of the Hebrew language courses also study his-
tory, but in their native languages. In 2006, academic writing was introduced
as an accompaniment to the history course in these languages: Russian, Arabic,
French, Spanish, or English, and taught by former immigrant instructors, PhD
or post-doctoral students from the country of their origin. The final history
paper is written in the language of the course. During the second semester, all
students are required to write a paper in their field of specialty in Hebrew as
well, and if they continue on in the Hebrew University in the humanities divi-
sion, they will also take an academic writing course in Hebrew.

   There are still some negative attitudes toward writing courses in Hebrew,
as exemplified by one of the deans of Ben-Gurion University during our map-
ping project. When one of our members, a faculty member of the university,
approached the dean in an attempt to find out what writing courses are given
and in what languages, he answered, "Of course only in English. We do want

284
      Achva Academic College of Education, Tel Aviv University, and Bar-Ilan University (Israel)

to encourage our students to do research and to publish internationally. Why
would they need to write in Hebrew?"

   There are courses in English composition and academic writing in Eng-
lish departments in colleges and universities throughout Israel, but because of
budgetary cuts, some programs are becoming smaller. Today there is also some
writing done in many EAP courses that have traditionally covered reading com-
prehension exclusively.

                        RECENT INNOVATIONS

   Among recent innovations in various programs are the Technical Writing
Course for the MSc in Engineering developed by Bella Rubin, and the Techni-
cal Writing Course for the PhD in Engineering developed by Prof. Reuven Box-
man, both at Tel Aviv University; courses for biology students at the Weizman
Research Institute taught by a PhD in biology who has also become an expert
in academic writing, and a writing course for chemistry students at Weizman
taught by a lecturer with a PhD in linguistics. At Haifa University, in an at-
tempt to bridge the gap between the fields of composition studies and of EAP
or EFL, an applied linguist, Dr. Hadara Perpignan, was recruited to guide the
teaching of writing about literature to Arabic- and Hebrew-speaking English
majors. At Bar Ilan, in addition to the PhD program, all masters degree stu-
dents who do not show exemption mastery are required to take academic writ-
ing courses in English.

   At the Technion, beginning in 2010, the Graduate School Dean has extend-
ed the PhD academic writing program to the master's level as well. This course
is still an elective as students have to fulfill graduate English reading compre-
hension proficiency requirements as a prerequisite to the advanced course. For
PhD students, the one-semester Academic Writing Course is a requirement as
before. There is also a high level, undergraduate writing course titled Commu-
nication in English for Scientists and Engineers. This is an elective that focuses
on both writing and presentation skills. It grew out of the specific request by
the high-tech industry to offer a course at the Technion that would provide
graduates with the skills they will need when they enter the professional world.

   Since 2000, two graduate-level writing courses were offered by the Dept.
of EFL at Ben-Gurion University at its two campuses in Beer-Sheva and Sde-
Boqer. Students at Sde-Boqer--both Israeli (Jews and Arabs) and international
(from Europe, Asia, Africa, Latin America, and Jordan) --study all their courses
in English. Both academic writing courses were opened as a result of specific re-
quests by the Faculty of Science and the Jacob Blaustein Institute for Desert Re-

                                                                                                285

search/Albert Katz International School for Desert Studies. Both courses were,
in fact, open to all graduate students at BGU, regardless of faculty of study. In
practice, most of the students came from the faculties of technology and social
sciences in addition to the natural sciences, and rarely from humanities. There is
also an undergraduate writing elective for business administration students, and
the School of Business Administration is eager to train students in professional
writing from early on. Unfortunately, because of budgetary cuts, the graduate
course on the Beer Sheva campus did not open in 2010.

   The administration of the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center, a private institu-
tion which opened in 1994, has always paid serious attention to writing skills.
Professor Reichman, the dean, expects law school graduates, for instance, to be
able to write "decent and intelligible" formal legal letters and case notes (briefs),
as well as mini-contracts, short wills, and a research paper, so that students can
learn to utilize the language of law in English fully. Similarly, at the other Her-
zliya programs, the administration has supported programs in academic writing.

   At the Ruppin Academic Center, Business English is a compulsory, semester
(28-hour) course for undergraduate students of business administration in their
third year of studies. It is also offered as an optional course for second- and third-
year students of economics. The course was designed following consultation with
the heads of the Departments of Business Administration and Economics. In ac-
cordance with their requirements, emphasis is placed on writing skills in general,
and on written commercial correspondence in particular. The course is organized
around two main threads, one relating to text types and the other relating to
business content. With regard to major text types, students learn memos, formal
letters, and e-mails, and practice these texts extensively. A wide range of genres
that are most prevalent in the business world defines the content of the students'
writing. These include cover letters, requests and enquiries, notifying and inform-
ing, making and addressing complaints, organizing business trips, etc. Course
requirements include participation in classroom and homework activities, a port-
folio including drafts, final products, and reflection, a mid-term exam and a final
exam. All course content and activities are on the e-learning platform, Moodle.
Student feedback has revealed that the vast majority of participants believe that
the course sets them in good stead for their future business careers.

         RESPONDING TO BUDGETARY CHALLENGES

   Private efforts have also pioneered new directions in business writing and
writing for the high-tech sector. There is increased awareness that beyond the
academy, students will need these skills.

         Because of the present budgetary situation confronting all institu-
tions of higher education in Israel, many official writing programs have been
curtailed. In view of this situation and the continuing needs of the students,
the present head of the EAP department of Hebrew University has initiated
some voluntary activities. Her first step was to train all the instructors in the
department to become writing instructors. She has developed a mini-library
in the staff room with relevant journal articles and books, etc. She has initi-
ated a series of workshops on teaching writing given by people with varied
experience in the field. She has started a journal club in which teachers of the
department, even those with no prior experience in the teaching of writing,
are asked to present material from current journals on teaching writing. In
addition, in order to get a feel for the needs of the students, teachers of the
department give tutorials on a voluntary basis to PhD students in the social
sciences.

         Besides the individual tutorials, workshops in writing are available for
interested students, during which both faculty members and peers have helped
the students revise their work. In addition, two courses in writing are cur-
rently being taught by the EAP teachers.

   The department has presented a proposal to the administration of the uni-
versity to establish a formal writing center with the following possibilities for
students: (a) workshops, (b) individual tutorials, (c) courses in specific kinds
of writing, and (d) supervised group work experience in which a guide would
work with the group, and the students would work together.

                  INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE

   Inspired by the symposium at the 2007 EATAW conference, "Historical
Roots of National Writing Cultures," we decided to establish an organization
for people engaged in academic writing instruction. Its purpose was to share
resources and insights and ultimately provide the best possible writing instruc-
tion for Israel's wide variety of students. We were encouraged by the fact that
our first meeting at Tel Aviv University in November, 2007, was attended by
about forty people from colleges and universities throughout Israel involved

in both English and Hebrew academic writing. It was decided at that meet-
ing to meet several times a year face-to-face and to communicate by email as
well. Since then, our organization has grown--we now have over 150 mem-
bers on our mailing list. We have succeeded in establishing a communication
network and made connections among people in our field. We have had five
face-to-face meetings during each of the first two years of the organization--in
2010, we held only four as we had many more activities in preparation for our
international conference in July. At our meetings, we have had workshops, vis-
iting lecturers, research presentations, practical applications, and discussions,
addressing such issues as responding to and assessing student writing, the use of
technology in the teaching of writing, and how to gain administrative support
for our programs. Members from all over the country, from colleges and univer-
sities, and from Hebrew, English, and German departments have attended. We
have found a home for our organization, MOFET, the Institute of Research,
Curriculum and Program Development for Teacher Education, an already ex-
isting and respected institution.

         The first international conference on academic writing in Israel,
"Academic Writing and Beyond in Multicultural Societies," took place at the
MOFET Institute in Tel-Aviv on July 28 and 29, 2010. Some 200 partici-
pants, from the US, Canada, the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, China,
Russia, Italy, Turkey, and Cyprus, as well as from Israel attended the confer-
ence. One hundred twenty presentations were given in Hebrew and English
and included panel discussions, workshops, and individual papers. Keynote
speakers were John Harbord of the Central European University in Hungary,
Chris Anson of North Carolina State University, Otto Kruse of the Zurich
University of Applied Sciences, and Deborah Holdstein of Columbia College,
Chicago. Topics covered included the development of writing centers, writing
in the disciplines, writing across the curriculum, how to deal with plagiarism,
bridging the gap between high school writing and writing in the university,
the use of technology in teaching academic writing, giving feedback, and the
connection between creativity and academic writing. For this first conference
in Israel, we wanted to appeal to as wide an audience as possible. The confer-
ence succeeded in connecting us with like-minded educators throughout the
world, and we hope that it widened the horizons of those of us engaged in the
teaching and research of academic writing in Israel.

   We hope that the conference will advance the goals of our organization. We
have not yet succeeded in locating all the existing programs in academic writ-
ing in Israel. Nor have we arranged to publish a journal or set up a permanent
internet site, both of which are included in our long term goals. We would also

290
      Achva Academic College of Education, Tel Aviv University, and Bar-Ilan University (Israel)

like to initiate a national writing project in Israel together with the Ministry of
Education and the Council for Higher Education. To the best of our knowl-
edge, there has never been such a project, either for Hebrew or English or Ara-
bic writing. Even at the universities, there has very rarely been central funding
directly from the Rector's office. The trend has been to have individual faculties
or departments (e.g., Humanities, Engineering) support writing courses in L1
or L2.

   What we would like to see in all our institutions is a combination of writing
courses, writing centers, and writing taught by all instructors according to the
needs of their disciplines. Writing centers, such as the one at Kibbutzim Col-
lege, are ideal, in that they meet the needs of the students as they perceive them,
but if they meet the needs of only 10 per cent of the student body, what about
the other 90 per cent? Similarly, setting standards in academic writing in the
various languages we teach is important, but we must guard against standard-
ization. Each group of students is different, and each institution should develop
its own program.

   Although the people of Israel are known as "the people of the Book," and
although many books and journal articles are published in Israel each year, we
know that supporting student writers at all levels of study is still a pedagogical
imperative. Beyond the academy, in today's world of research and globalization,
writing skills are a necessity for all who wish to advance professionally. In the
modern State of Israel, where academic writing is no longer the prerogative of
the privileged few, we make it our purpose, by drawing on Israel's ancient roots,
to empower all of its citizens to become fully accomplished people of the book.5

THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN

ACADEMIC WRITING CENTRE

IN THE NETHERLANDS

By Ingrid Stassen and Carel Jansen
Radboud University Nijmegen and Stellenbosch University)

Radboud University Nijmegen was the first university in the Nether-
lands to have a writing centre. Founded in February 2004, the Aca-
demic Writing Centre Nijmegen (ASN) was based on the outcomes
of a feasibility study that demonstrated that at Radboud University
Nijmegen writing problems were often not recognized as such, and
that faculty could not always give students proper individual coaching,
due to lack of time or expertise. The feasibility study also revealed that
both students and faculty felt positive about the concept of the writing
centre that was proposed, and in its basic philosophy that not the writ-
ing product but the writing process would deserve primary attention.
The ASN has proven to serve a clear need: the number of consultation
sessions has grown to an average of 45 sessions per week. Some three
years after its start, more than 50 percent of the students knew about
the writing centre's existence. Evaluation studies consistently show that
after visiting the writing centre students are highly satisfied with the
help that is provided. Supervisors of students who consulted the ASN
generally felt that both their students and they themselves as staff mem-
bers had profited from the services offered at the writing centre. In
spite of these positive evaluations the university board decided in June
2011, in view of the need to cut university expenses, that central fi-
nancing will have to end by 2013 and that from then on other means
of financing have to be found.

   In the past few decades academic writing has gained considerable atten-
tion at Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands.1 Courses in general
communicative skills (including composition), writing intensive courses, and
online facilities such as WorldWideWriting and WritingStudio have grown into
important tools to help students to improve their academic writing.2

   Since 2004, the university also houses a writing centre: the Academic Writ-
ing Centre Nijmegen (from here: ASN, the abbreviation for the name in Dutch:
Academisch Schrijfcentrum Nijmegen). In this chapter the development and
the (still short) history of the ASN will be sketched, and the results of the work
done in the ASN since it started offering its services will be discussed.

   In 2003, after having been introduced to the newly founded writing centre
at Stellenbosch University (South Africa), the second author of this chapter
asked the University Board to be allowed to investigate the possibilities for cre-
ating a similar writing centre at Radboud University Nijmegen, taking into
account, among other things, the favourable experiences of American universi-
ties such as Colorado State University, Purdue University, and the University of
Maryland with their writing centres.

   After some discussion between the University Board and the Assembly of
Faculty Deans, financial means were granted for a feasibility study as asked for,
to be carried out by the first author of this chapter together with her then col-
league, Vincent Boeschoten. As a result of this feasibility study, which included
interviews with students and staff members at the Nijmegen campus and con-
sultation of international colleagues in the field of the teaching of writing, a
proposal for founding a writing centre was put forward, including a business
plan for an experimental period of two years. The proposal was well received,
and the University Board decided to give permission and financial means to
start the first writing centre ever at a Dutch university.3 For a first experimental
period of two years, a total of 250,000 euros was granted to cover the costs of
hiring personnel (part time manager, part time office manager,and tutors) and
decorating the space that was made available (for free) in the university library.
This made it possible to offer services to students and staff members without
having to charge them, or their faculties.

   There were some clear criteria, however, that had to be met if the ASN was
to continue after the experimental period.

   First of all, the ASN needed to maintain an academic status. Only university
students could have access to its services, and these services could not be extended
to students from other types of higher education, even if they would be willing to
pay for it. Furthermore a full professor in communication (i.e., the second author
of this chapter) would have to be prepared to carry the academic responsibility for
the work in the ASN, and there would have to be frequent contact with experts in
this field from universities abroad, for example Professor Dr. Leon de Stadler from
Stellenbosch University (South Africa). The second criterion set by the University
Board was that after one year, a total of at least 250 visits from students would
have to be registered. That number would have to grow into at least 750 after two
years. The final criterion to play a role in the decision to continue or discontinue

294

the ASN pertained to the evaluation of the services offered by the ASN: both
students and staff members who had been in touch with the ASN would have to
think favourably of what the ASN had done for them.

                        KEY ROLE FOR TUTORS

   Following the basic philosophy of the writing centres in the US (and also in
Stellenbosch, South Africa) the coaching in the ASN was, and still is, done by
tutors who are in majority graduated students and PhD-candidates at Radboud
University Nijmegen.

   A welcome source of inspiration for the approach taken at the ASN was the
work in the writing lab at Purdue University, as discussed in Harris (1995).
As Harris points out, the primary responsibility of a writing centre is to work
one-to-one with writers, and not to duplicate or usurp writing classrooms. The
uniqueness of a writing center is its setting with "a middle person, the tutor,
who inhabits a world somewhere between student and teacher". It is in this
specific setting that students are encouraged to think independently, to gain
confidence in themselves as writers, and to put their theoretical knowledge into
practice as they write. If only because of the power structure in academia as it is
perceived by many students, the institutional authority automatically ascribed
to the teacher often prohibits the collaborative atmosphere that is typical for
tutor sessions in a writing centre (cf. Harris, 1995, pp. 27; 35-36; 40).

   Not all faculty members are equally convinced of the importance of giving
feedback that is directed at stimulating the student's development into a good
writer, rather than at providing quick fixes of an imperfect draft. And even if
they are willing to give development-directed feedback, where the writer is the
one who recognises and solves the problem, supported by non-directive ques-
tions from the coach, they often do not have enough time available to do so. In
a survey among teachers of the Faculty of Arts at Radboud University Nijmegen,
it emerged that several interviewees also indicated that they felt uncertain about
their expertise on this type of commentary (Stassen & Wilbers, 2006). Stassen
and Wilbers also point at the advantages of development-directed feedback. In a
qualitative study, seven students were observed in a total of 10 tutor sessions at the
ASN. Although the results were based on a relatively small number of observations
and therefore need to be interpreted with care, the study suggests that the tutor
sessions did influence the strategic writing process of the students. Non-directive,
development-directed tutor behavior led to a positive situational norm and inde-
pendent student behavior. Students who distilled their own strategies from the
development-oriented feedback of their tutors proved to use these strategies when
working independently on their writing tasks (Stassen & Wilbers, 2006).

                                                                                                295
Stassen and Jansen

   From the beginning, ASN tutors were thoroughly trained in providing devel-
opment-directed feedback and in supporting various forms of academic writing
by the manager of the ASN and by other experts in the field of writing educa-
tion, for example Gerd Bräuer, University of Education Freiburg, and Leigh
Ryan, University of Maryland. The manager of the ASN also offered support
for faculty by asking questions on, for instance, how to improve their students'
writing skills, how to assess their students' texts, and how to create programmes
for writing across the curriculum. Furthermore, the ASN organised workshops,
both for students and for teachers, about subjects such as writing effectively, col-
lecting relevant information when writing an academic text, avoiding plagiarism,
and developing writing assignments. Part of these workshops were, and still are,
conducted by experts such as Cheryl Glenn, Pennsylvania State University.

   To draw the attention of the target groups (i.e., students and staff from all
faculties) to the ASN and to its basic philosophy, a number of marketing activi-
ties have been undertaken. There were "guest performances" of tutors in regular
classes in all kinds of academic programmes, special lunches were organised to
introduce staff members to the services of the ASN and to show them its loca-
tion, a website including a short video clip was launched (http://www.ru.nl/
asn), a newsletter was issued, advertisements were placed in the university mag-
azine, favourably-priced memory sticks (including information on the ASN)
were offered to students who paid the ASN a visit, and posters and flyers were
distributed on campus, all stressing the basic ASN philosophy: better thinking
produces better writing, and vice versa.

                                   RESULTS

   Since its start in 2004, the ASN was evaluated on several occasions. Each
time the results were positive. Based on these outcomes the University Board
decided in early 2006 to extend the first, experimental ASN period for two more
years, until March 2008. By the end of 2007 it was decided to extend this period
for another two years (providing for additional means to cover all expenses until
March 2010), with the perspective that by 2010 a definitive decision would be
made about the possible inclusion of the ASN in the university structure. Below
the most important results from the evaluation studies are presented.

                   Students' Familiarity with the ASN

   In a questionnaire study carried out in 2006 among a sample of 1,012 stu-
dents at Radboud University Nijmegen, it was found that 54% were familiar
with the existence of the ASN. Especially students from the Faculties of Arts

296
                                                           Radboud University Nijmegen (Netherlands)

(80%), Management (76%), and Philosophy (75%) knew about the ASN; stu-
dents from the Faculties of Science (41%) and Medicine (25%) were less aware
of its existence. Those students who knew about the existence of the ASN were
also asked if they knew that the ASN offered individual help with a diversity
of writing tasks (90% said yes), if they knew that this service was for free (66%
said yes), and if in the 24 months before the date of this study, they had ever felt
the need for assistance in their writing processes (24% said yes).

                           Consultation Numbers
   From the start in March 2004, the total number of consultation sessions in
that year was 301. One year later the number had grown to 1,001. In 2010,
the total number of consultation sessions had reached 1,861, and based on the
numbers from the first five months in 2011 a total of 2,100 consultation ses-
sions are predicted (see Figure 1). On average, a student visiting the ASN has
three to four consultation sessions; by implication, by the end of 2011 some
600 students are expected to have visited the ASN in that year.
   Most students visiting the ASN prove to come from four faculties: Social
Sciences(40%), Arts (25%), Management (14%), and Law (10%). This re-
sult does not really come as a surprise, in view of the relatively high numbers
of students enrolled in programmes in these faculties, and in view also of the
importance that these faculties traditionally attach to adequate writing skills.

Stassen and Jansen

Most sessions (72.0%) are in Dutch; English (20.2%) is second. Most visitors
(55.5%) to the ASN are graduates; 44.5% are undergraduates.

                           Students' Satisfaction

   In the period 2008-2010, 150 students who received one or more consulta-
tion sessions were asked to fill out a questionnaire about the general quality of
the services provided by the ASN, the extent to which they felt the consulta-
tions helped them, the effect they thought the consultations had on their writ-
ing skills, and the role that the input of the tutor played in all this. All questions
had the format of statements followed by five answering options, ranging from
very negative to very positive. Table 1 shows the results of this evaluation.

                             Qualitative Output

   Due to the large number of consultation sessions, the different text genres,
and the variety of academic discourse themes that are discussed, the ASN has
gained more specific insights into the special demands of academic discourse.
This expertise is a breeding ground for the development of different strategies to

optimize the writing processes of academic texts. In April 2011, for instance, a
workshop was organized for staff members about efficiently supervising writing
to make optimal use of, often limited, coaching time. Another theme of this
well-attended workshop, directed by Jude Carroll (Oxford Brookes University),
was the coaching of writing in a second language. Recently the present ASN
manager, Dr. Joy de Jong, published a handbook on Academic Writing (J. de
Jong, 2011) that was based, among other things, on insights gained in the ASN.

                         Opinions from Supervisors

   Not only students, but also staff members who supervised students being
coached at the ASN, were asked for their opinions on the effects of tutor-coach-
ing. In an MA thesis, communication student Christa de Jong conducted 14
interviews with supervisors. It appeared that a large majority of the supervisors
felt that the work done in the ASN had an added value, that the text versions
that their students handed in after their consultation sessions clearly had im-
proved, and that the students in general had learned to be more critical toward
their own writing products. Most supervisors also felt that the ASN relieved
them from their tasks by helping the students to clearly structure and formu-
late their theses, so that in their own discussions with the students they could
concentrate more on the academic merits of the research presented in the text
(C. de Jong, 2005).

       OVERVIEW: INFLUENCE ON DEVELOPMENT OF
          WRITING CENTRES IN THE NETHERLANDS

         The first seven years of the ASN have shown that a writing centre
can play an important role in improving students' writing skills. The formula
of individual consultation sessions focusing on possible ways to improve the
writing process has proven to be successful--not only in terms of the fast-
growing numbers of students visiting the ASN but also in the quality of the
services rendered, as perceived by these students and their supervisors. Com-
bined with other forms of writing education, such as traditional composition
courses, writing-intensive courses, and modern online facilities, the services
offered by the ASN have a clear added value. In view of all this, it is not sur-
prising that the work in the ASN has drawn the attention of other universities.
In 2004 and 2008, after the example of the ASN, the second and the third
academic writing centres in the Netherlands were founded at the University
of Groningen and the University of Tilburg. In mid 2011, the University of

                                                                                                299
Stassen and Jansen

Twente and Maastricht University were in the process of developing academic
writing centres.

         In spite of all this, the Nijmegen University board decided in June
2011, in view of the need to cut university expenses, that central financing
of the Centre will have to end by 2013, and that from then on other means
of financing have to be found. May there indeed be other means to keep the
ASN up and running!

    TEACHING WRITING AT

    AUT UNIVERSITY: A MODEL

    OF A SEMINAR SERIES FOR

    POSTGRADUATE STUDENTS

    WRITING THEIR FIRST THESIS

    OR DISSERTATION

      By John Bitchener
      AUT University, Auckland (New Zealand)

       This essay describes and comments on a series of seminars that were
       designed by the author to meet the discourse needs of postgraduate
       students writing their first thesis or dissertation in English at AUT
       University, Auckland, New Zealand. In New Zealand, a dissertation
       is seen as a smaller report on research that has been carried out by a
       student in a bachelor honours programme, whereas a thesis may be at
       either master's or doctoral level. (Hereafter, the term `thesis' should be
       understood to also refer to "dissertation.")

   AUT University was originally the largest polytechnic in New Zealand, but
just over 10 years ago, in 2000, it was granted university status. Postgraduate
students at the institution had been writing theses well before it became a uni-
versity. The University comprises five faculties (Applied Humanities, Business,
Design and Creative Technologies, Health and Environmental Sciences, Te Ara
Poutama) and each of these houses a number of schools and departments. Ac-
cording to the Director of the Postgraduate Centre, the overall student popula-
tion at the university is in excess of 27,000, and 2,250 of these are postgraduate
students (Banda, 2011). Depending on the programme they are enrolled in,
not all postgraduate students are required to write a thesis, but more than half
do. Since 2005, over 400 students have graduated with a master's degree that
included a thesis and over 140 have graduated with a doctoral degree.

   The university has a multi-national and multi-cultural population: 42%
pakehas (white New Zealanders), 10% Maori (indigenous New Zealanders),
11% Pasifika (Pacific Islanders), 27% Asians (East and South Asian countries)
and 10% others (Banda, 2011). While many of the students who enrol in a the-
sis are New Zealand residents who have completed undergraduate programmes
at the university or at another New Zealand university, a growing number from
other countries and, therefore, from other educational backgrounds may also
enrol in a thesis at the university. Consequently, a number of these students are
non-native speakers/writers of English, but before they are accepted as thesis
students they are required to have an IELTS (International English Language
Testing System) score (or similar) with at least 6.5 in Reading, Speaking, and
Listening and 7.0 in Writing.

   This range of backgrounds means that the university must cater for the di-
verse needs of its equally diverse student population. Students who have com-
pleted short research projects and written up reports on this work before enroll-
ing in postgraduate programmes often have a head start in knowing generally
what is required in conducting and reporting on research. Even though these
students bring a certain amount of knowledge, skill, and experience to their
postgraduate study, their understanding of what is required at this level is some-
times quite different from what is expected at a New Zealand university. This
difference can become an issue for those who have completed an honours or
master's degree by thesis from a university in another country where different
requirements and expectations exist. When a university such as ours accepts a
student into a thesis-based programme, it needs to accept responsibility for en-
suring that students have every chance of succeeding. Aware of the need to take
responsibility for each of its students, AUT University established a Postgradu-
ate Centre in the mid 1990s to coordinate all aspects of postgraduate study at
the university, including that which is undertaken by faculties, schools, and
departments.

         WRITING SUPPORT FOR UNDERGRADUATES

   Before describing what the Postgraduate Centre offers its students, it is
worth noting that the university also provides writing support opportunities for
its undergraduate students. Students in these earlier years of study are able to
access various forms of writing support when required. For instance, the univer-
sity's Keys Workshops are available to those seeking a credit-bearing certificate
in generic writing skills. Te Tari Awhina, a writing support unit for one-on-one

302
                                                              AUT University, Auckland (New Zealand)

and small group conferences and workshops that is available to all students, is
another section of the university that provides one-on-one and small group sup-
port to both undergraduate and postgraduate students. Each of these provisions
were offered by the university when it was a polytechnic. At the faculty level,
students are also able to access on-line writing support given by academics in
the disciplines. Postgraduate students and staff who are upskilling their qualifi-
cations are able to obtain one-on-one feedback at writing retreats.

            ROLES OF THE POSTGRADUATE CENTRE

   One of the many roles of the Postgraduate Centre is to provide courses,
seminars and workshops on skills (e.g., computer and statistics packages) that
postgraduate students will need during their course of study. One of the needs
that was identified in the early years of becoming a university was an under-
standing of what is involved in the writing of a thesis. Although individual
schools, departments, and supervision staff understand that this is a role they
must take responsibility for, the Postgraduate Centre felt there was a need to
offer students an introductory seminar or workshop on the generic, non-disci-
pline specific requirements of thesis writing, so that those writing their first the-
sis could begin the task with some understanding of what would be expected.
The series of seminars that are now offered on writing the various part-genres
or chapters of an empirically-based thesis (to be described below) originated in
2004 with a one-off workshop on the writing of a literature review. Seminars
and workshops offered by the Centre are open to students across the faculties;
attendance is voluntary.

   Participation in these sessions cannot earn grades for degree programmes
or coursework papers. Inevitably, this means that students who might benefit
most from these sessions are the ones who choose not to attend, and those who
have sufficient knowledge and experience come to all sessions. The overwhelm-
ing success of the first workshop (in the number of students who attended, the
positive feedback given in the evaluation forms at the end of the workshop, and
the feedback from staff across the university who had heard about the workshop
from their students) meant that other workshops were scheduled. Many of the
evaluation forms revealed a desire for seminars and workshops on other aspects
of thesis-writing. This, of course, meant that the staff member facilitating the
seminars was required to give more of his time and that the Centre had to fund
his release time from the school in which he is employed as a fulltime staff
member.

                                                                                                303
Bitchener

         Since 2006, the series has included the writing of (1) an introduc-
tion chapter, (2) a literature review chapter(s), (3) a methodology chapter(s),
(4) a presentation of results chapter, (5) a discussion of results chapter and
(6) a conclusion chapter. Over the last three years, other seminars related to
thesis research and writing have been offered, including (1) preparing a thesis
proposal and (2) writing a journal article from a section of a thesis. These
initiatives have come about as a result of students and staff requesting support
in these high-stakes areas.

   The typical needs of first-time thesis writers have been identified by both
students and supervisors in the literature on students' needs and difficulties
(Bitchener, 2010; Bitchener & Basturkmen, 2006; Casanave & Hubbard,
1992; Cooley & Lewcowicz, 1997; Dong, 1998; Paltridge & Starfield, 2007).
While the needs of students at one university may be a little different from
those at another university (this, for example, may be the result of certain dis-
ciplines being offered by some universities and not others), there tends to be
a common need amongst students to understand (1) the type of content that
should be included in the separate chapters or sections of a thesis, (2) ways
to most effectively or rhetorically organise this material and (3) the register/
language expected by the general academic community and by the discipline in
which students are studying.

        USING A GENRE APPROACH IN THE SEMINARS

   Charged with the responsibility of deciding how the seminars/workshops
could meet the typical needs of thesis writers, the member of staff who was
asked to design and deliver the seminars decided that a genre approach would
be the most effective. As Swales (2004) and Devitt (2004) explain, a genre is
a text that has, amongst other characteristics, particular and distinctive com-
municative functions and recognisable patterns and norms of organisation and
structure. Discourse analyses, reported in the literature of discipline-specific
journal articles and thesis part-genres, reveal the inter-relationship amongst the
function(s) of a text, its content, and structure. Kwan (2006), for example,
explains that the crucial starting point for a "discourse move" analysis (that
is, understanding the units of content required) is to consider the purposes
or functions of the target genre (chapter or section) that regulate the choice
of content, its schematic pattern (or organisational structure) and character-
istic linguistic features. Discourse analyses also reveal that "discourse moves"
are staged or organised through the use of various "sub-moves" (sometimes re-
ferred to as "strategies" or "steps"). Empirical evidence reveals that these moves

304
                                                              AUT University, Auckland (New Zealand)

and sub-moves, employed within the various theme or topic sections of a part-
genre, should be seen as options rather than as prescriptive requirements and
that there may be a considerable recycling of moves and sub-moves within and
across theme/topic sections.

    The next section of this essay illustrates how this approach underpinned the
content provided in the seminar/workshop on writing a "discussion of results"
chapter. It should be noted that some theses combine the presentation and
discussion of results in one chapter, that others have more than one results or
discussion chapter, and that others include the conclusion of the thesis with the
discussion of results. The seminar presenter makes this variety clear to students
and explains how the content presented in the session can be applied just as ef-
fectively to whichever format is chosen.

    The discussion of results seminar/workshop, like those for the other part-
genres, takes approximately three hours (depending on the amount of interac-
tive discussion and the number of analyses of sample texts considered) and is
divided into the following sections: the approach taken (the genre approach),
the purpose(s) or function(s), the content and its structure, key linguistic char-
acteristics, frequently asked questions, and further activities and reading.

    1. The approach
    The genre approach and reasons for its use are explained to the students.
    2. The purpose(s) and function(s) of the discussion of results chapter
    This section includes the following stages: (1) participants discuss in pairs
what they understand to be the purpose(s) and function(s) of the discussion of
results chapter; (2) a plenary reporting back on the key ideas; (3) a presentation
of the chart shown in Figure 1. Attention is drawn to the importance of func-
tions 4 and 5.

    1. An overview of the aims of the research that refers to the research ques-
         tions or hypotheses

    2. A summary of the theoretical and research contexts of the study
    3. A summary of the methodological approach for investigating the research

         questions or hypotheses
    4. A discussion of the contribution you believe your results or findings have

         made to the research questions or hypotheses and therefore to existing
         theory, research and practice (i.e. their importance and significance)
    5. This discussion will often include an interpretation of your results, a com-
         parison with other research, an explanation of why the results occurred as
         they did, and an evaluation of their contribution to the field of knowledge

                                             previous research to support the claim being

                                             why further research is recommended

   3. The content & structure of the discussion of results chapter
   The presenter explains that the discourse analyses of discussion of results
chapters in the literature have identified a series of typical moves (content units)
and sub-moves used to create each main move (see Figure 2). It is emphasised
that these are options and that a recycling of moves and sub-moves is character-
istic of the part-genre.

1. The first research question investigated the relationship          Move 1(background)
between self-report WTC and WTC behavior in class. 2. This
question relates to the concept of WTC as a trait variable or a
state variable.

3. Correlation analysis8, indicated that self-report WTC strongly     Move 2a (SOR)
predicted WTC behavior in group work, while self-report WTC           Move 2b (Expansion)
negatively predicted WTC in the whole class and pair work.
4. The strong positive relationship between self-report WTC
and WTC group work demonstrated that participants' self-
report WTC was consistent with their WTC behavior in group
work. 5. However, participants' WTC behavior in the whole
class and in pair work contradicted their WTC reported in the
questionnaire.

6. Results from an examination of the relationship between            Move 2a (SOR)
self-report WTC and WTC behavior in three classroom contexts          Move 2b (Expansion)
on an individual basis, were found to be mixed (see Table 4.1).
7. For half of the class (Sherry, Jerry, Ray and Cathy), self-report
WTC was consistent with actual WTC behavior in class, whereas
for the other half (Erica, Sophie, Allan and John), self-report
WTC contradicted classroom WTC behavior.

Figure 3. Text of first research question discussion.

   The text shown in Figure 3 is used to illustrate the extent to which the moves
in Figure 2 were employed. It is explained that the sample material comes from
an applied linguistics thesis on the willingness to communicate of second lan-
guage learners in the language learning classroom. This particular thesis was
chosen because it is an excellent example of an empirically-based thesis. It won
a special award from the New Zealand applied linguistics community. It is also
explained that the content is quite accessible for those unfamiliar with the topic
or the discipline area. Participants are also reminded that the discourse analyti-
cal skills applied in the analysis of the move structure of the text can be trans-
ferred to texts in any other discipline area so that similarities and differences in
what typically characterises the writing of such texts can be identified. Other
sample texts that can be analysed are referred to in section 6 of this profile essay.

   4. Key Linguistic Characteristics of the Discussion of Results Chapter
   The following stages can be employed when discussing the linguistic character-
istics to which students' attention should be drawn: (1) for illustrative purposes,
the text in Figure 4 can be used to draw their attention to the use of hedging (re-
ducing the degree of assertiveness) when making claims and offering explanations
about certain findings; (2) the presenter defines hedging verbs (seems; appears)

                                                                                           307
Bitchener

and modal verbs (may) and illustrates their use in the first paragraph of the text. It
is also pointed out that adjectives such as "possible" might also be used for hedg-
ing purposes (e.g., It is possible that. . . .). Other samples can then be analysed by
the participants and these can be from any discipline.

   5 Frequently Asked Questions
   The frequently asked questions shown in Figure 5 are then discussed. Often,
they will be addressed during the course of the seminar/workshop but it is use-
ful to return to them towards the end of the session.
   6. Further Activities and Reading
   It is useful to have samples and/or recommendations of other textual mate-
rial for participants to use in a classroom context or in their own time. Some

   1. Whether L1 or L2 was used as the medium of communication also
   appeared to exert an influence on learners' WTC. 2. As MacIntyre et
   al. (1998, p. 546) have suggested, the differences between L1 and L2
   WTC may be due to "the uncertainty inherent in L2 use," and the level
   of linguistic competency can be one differentiating factor existing in L1
   and L2 WTC. 3. In this study, Jerry noted that a lack of linguistic com-
   petence in L2 inhibited communication, but when L1 was used, such
   a problem was not present. 4. Cathy also considered a lack of lexical
   resources in L2 as a factor affecting her perceived competence, which in
   turn influenced willingness to communicate at times. 5. This seems to
   support House's (2004) claim that lack of actual linguistic competence
   in L2 can prevent communication.

   6. Differences in L1 and L2 WTC were also detected in task engage-
   ment in pair work. 7. Dörnyei and Kormos (2000) found that learners'
   relationships with their interlocutor had a considerable impact on the
   extent of their engagement in the task in L1, but this relationship failed
   to emerge in an L2 task. 8. They suggested that when L2 was used as
   the medium of communication, the challenge of trying to express one's
   thoughts using a limited linguistic code in addition to decoding the
   interlocutor's utterances, created an emotional state different from the
   communication mode in L1, which may "alter one's perceptions of the
   constraints of the interaction" (Dörnyei & Kormos, 2000, p. 293). 9.
   Differences in WTC in pair work in both L1 and L2 were, however, be-
   yond the scope of this study and were not, as a consequence, examined.
   10. It appears to be another area for further research.

students may also be interested in the literature informing the content pre-
sented in the seminar/workshop. Examples of further activities and reading can
be found in Bitchener (2010).

                 EVALUATION OF THE APPROACH

   The approach described here is one approach. It has proven to be effective
for those who have been introduced to it, as several different types of evidence
reveal. First, the approach has been used with postgraduate students at a num-
ber of overseas universities (e.g., Brock University, Edith Cowan University,
Nanyang Technological University, University of Melbourne, Murcia Univer-
sity, Michigan State University, Purdue University, University of California).
Evaluative feedback (using a 7-point Likert scale to determine level of perceived
usefulness from the programme employing the approach) from a total of 840
participants over a seven-year period at AUT University reveal an extremely
high level of satisfaction: 92% rated it at level 7 (extremely useful), 6% at level
6 (very useful) and 2% at level 5 (useful). In the evaluations, qualitative assess-
ments were also sought. As an example of the type of statement made, four
from a recent seminar commented as follows:

         Course provided a solid foundation structure for both mas-
         ters and doctoral style thesis construction and useful for all
         disciplines

         Handouts and format of the session was brilliant--feel very
         confident to approach my thesis now--thanks John!

    1. Can I introduce any new literature in the discussion of results
        section?

    2. How much of the literature review do I need to refer to when com-
        paring one of my results with those of a study referred to in the
        literature review?

    3. To what extent do the ideas presented in the discussion chapter have
        to be based on the literature presented in the literature review?

         After attending John's workshops, I took on board his com-
         ments, information provided and would like to advise that I
         got an "A"

         The veil has now lifted!

   Empirical evidence (for example, Bitchener & Banda, 2007; Cheng, 2007;
Turner & Bitchener, 2009) also attests to its effectiveness.

   The approach described here is one that can be easily adapted if a less pre-
senter-centred style is preferred and if time permits a more deductive approach.
Group sessions can be in the form of seminars, workshops, and classroom-based
lessons. Illustrative textual material can be drawn from any discipline. Greatest
value for students tends to result if they are required to analyse textual material
as soon as sample analyses have been discussed. Finally, it needs to be remem-
bered that the genre approach presented in this essay draws upon the research
findings of numerous journal articles reporting empirical investigations of what
are typically the requirements and expectations for each of part-genres of theses
in specific discipline areas.

               CONCLUSION: ISSUES TO CONSIDER

   While the implementation of this approach and the seminar series gener-
ally has been largely trouble-free, there are a couple of issues that might be
usefully highlighted. First, some students have commented that they would
have liked to have had the seminar time extended so that more attention
could be given to analysis and discussion of sample texts, but not all students
shared this view. A credit-bearing course based on this approach would be one
way of meeting this request. Second, scheduling the seminars to suit a wide
range of students can be problematic, especially if they are offered during a
typical working week. Some students are distance-learners and not able to at-
tend sessions, and others may be working part-time or fulltime and are only
able to attend some sessions.

     The solution to these issues has been to offer the seminars on the week-
end. Six hours on Saturday and another six hours on Sunday proved popular
with some students, but others felt this schedule was too much over two days.
In recent years, we have spread the seminars over two consecutive weekends,
with six hours on the first Sunday for the Introduction, Literature Review, and
Methodology chapters and the second six hours the following Sunday for the
Results, Discussion, and Conclusion chapters.

   Finally, it is worth mentioning that the success of the seminar series is to a
large extent the result of not only the content that is provided and the way in
which it is delivered, as well as the willingness of the Centre and the presenter
to respond to suggestions given in the evaluations completed at the end of each
session, but also of the support given by supervisors across the University who
strongly recommend that their students attend the seminars.

DEVELOPING A "KIWI"

WRITING CENTRE AT MASSEY

UNIVERSITY, NEW ZEALAND

By Lisa Emerson
Massey University (New Zealand)

This essay outlines how the teaching of writing has been introduced
into the curriculum of a New Zealand university over the last 20 years.
Starting with a description of her accidental introduction to teaching
writing, the author outlines early initiatives such as the development
of a WAC programme in the sciences, and New Zealand's first OWLL.
Despite this early promise, recent years have seen the emergence of
uncoordinated initiatives in the teaching of writing that have led to
various groups competing for ground. Nevertheless, a promising new
development--New Zealand's first Writing Centre--aims not only to
support students, but also to teach writing theory to a first generation
of students. The author sees "becoming an ethnographer of your home
campus" as an essential aspect of developing a writing programme,
and describes the writing centre initiative as "something unique: not
a transplanted idea but a kiwi writing centre . . . which will be in-
formed by international theory and experience but emerge out of un-
chartered antipodean ground."

                           GETTING STARTED

   A little over 20 years ago, in 1989, I unwittingly took my first steps towards
developing a "Kiwi"1 Writing Centre at Massey University, in Aotearoa New
Zealand. A colleague had returned from sabbatical in the US fired up with a
mission to start a writing centre to improve students' writing skills in the Col-
lege of Business. She rang me to see if I would take on the job as sole tutor on
a .5 position. I pointed out that, as a recent MA in Victorian literature, I knew
nothing about teaching writing and even less about business writing--and had
no idea what a Writing Centre was. "No worries," said my colleague airily, "we

think you have the kind of personality needed for the job," as if that were the
only qualification needed to teach writing.

   As it happened, no one in New Zealand would have been more qualified
than I was to take on New Zealand's first writing centre work. At that time,
writing was not a part of the New Zealand tertiary curriculum: most universi-
ties had no writing courses of any kind, there were no PhDs in Rhetoric and
Composition, no WAC programmes, no freshman composition, no writing
centres. And so I stepped uncertainly into a new space as a pioneer--and soon
became passionately committed not just to making my little Centre work for
my students but also to making the teaching of writing an uncontested, inte-
grated part of the university's curriculum.

   I had no idea what a Writing Centre could or should be. This was before
the Internet revolutionised our ability to access information, and, because it
was not a research field in New Zealand, our University library carried scant
resources on writing pedagogy, let alone writing centre theory. I discovered the
Writing Center listserv in 1990-912--it was a lifeline at times, and I was over-
whelmed by the generosity of list members who took the time to send me re-
sources. More often than not, though, reading the e-mail discussions felt more
like eavesdropping on a conversation on an alien planet. The conversation may
have been in English, but the largely American cultural context in which it took
place was beyond my comprehension: the terminology was opaque, and the as-
sumption that a whole institutional infrastructure around writing was in place
was unimaginable at that time in a New Zealand context. So I had to invent my
role as writing tutor. My students, and some faculty, certainly had an expected
role for me which could only be described as a combination of proof reader and
magician.3 I was not entirely familiar with the concept of peer tutoring at this
time--but the role I carved out for myself was, in effect, that of a peer tutor,
puzzling over assignments with the students who found their way into my of-
fice, talking to faculty, listening, reading, asking questions.

   Early on I came across Elaine Maimon's comment (in McLeod & Soven,
1992, p. xi): "Those who would change curriculum must become ethnogra-
phers of their home campuses," and this resonated strongly with what I wanted
to achieve in a New Zealand writing programme: something that drew on inter-
national scholarship but emerged out of the context of a New Zealand univer-
sity, something unique and carefully crafted to meet the needs of New Zealand
students. To do this, I needed to pay attention to the political, educational, and
cultural context in which I worked.

   This profile essay outlines the development of a writing centre in a New Zea-
land university over a 20-year period, within the context of writing instruction
emerging within the Aotearoa New Zealand university curriculum.

                 BECOMING AN ETHNOGRAPHER:
                 UNDERSTANDING THE CONTEXT

   New Zealand (Aotearoa is the Maori name) is located in the South Pacific
with a population in 2011 of approximately 4.2 million people (Index Mundi,
2010). Although 70% of the population are of European origin (Statistics New
Zealand, n.d.), New Zealand considers itself to be a bicultural nation, with
both English and Maori (the language of the indigenous people) as official lan-
guages, although the language of tuition in most tertiary institutions is primar-
ily English. We also have a growing Asian population, as well as attracting inter-
national students primarily from Asia and the Pacific. New Zealand university
education was established in the 1870s and has a tradition similar to that of the
British university system (Degrees Ahead, n.d.): most students enrol in a three-
year degree (there are some exceptions in the applied sciences) and specialise
from first year. An unusual feature of the New Zealand university system, and
one that, until recently, it has prided itself on, is that it has an open entry policy
for students over 20 years of age.4

   My primary interest has been to develop a writing programme at Massey
University. Massey is situated on three campuses: the original and most estab-
lished campus in Palmerston North, in the lower North Island of New Zealand;
Albany (near Auckland); and Wellington (the nation's capital). It offers a full
spectrum of academic programmes from undergraduate to PhD and has an
unusual student profile by New Zealand standards, due partly to its role as New
Zealand's biggest distance education provider; in 2009, it had 34,000 students
enrolled, of whom 60% were mature students (over 25), 50% were part-time,
and 48% were distance students. It has more Maori students than any other
New Zealand university and only 31% of its student population are recent
school leavers.

                         FIRST STEPS: 1980-1999

   While the idea for a writing centre came from a colleague who had en-
countered a North American writing centre, that the initiative took root can
largely be attributed to the impact of a time of transition for New Zealand
universities, which led to a perceived need for writing instruction within the
curriculum. New Zealand was undergoing an economic and political upheaval
between 1985 and 1995, which led to a change in the student population.
Mature students, many affected by redundancy, were coming to the university
to retrain. At the same time, changing social investment and attitudes meant

                                                                                                315
Emerson

that there was concern to support equitable access to universities, particularly
increased representation from Maori and lower socio-economic groups. Open
admissions for mature students meant that for the first time large numbers of
students without academic preparation were entering the university system.

   The response to this transition took two forms at Massey University. First,
the small writing centre in the College of Business became the core of a uni-
versity-wide Student Learning Centre (SLC) in 1996, funded by government
"equity" funding. The SLC developed a range of programmes, from learning
skills to remedial maths and science, and writing support for both on-campus
and distance students. Writing support in these early years was offered by tutors
who were usually either experienced high school English teachers or who held
post-graduate qualifications in English or Education. The support offered com-
prised primarily one-on-one support for both on-campus and distance students,
and lectures to undergraduate classes. In the early years, the status of the SLC
was considered remedial, and its legitimacy as university business questioned.
Of particular significance was the fact that staff employed in the SLC was des-
ignated as non-academic staff, with a reporting line through Student Services.

   Second, the opportunities presented by the economic and social upheavals
of the 1980s and 1990s, combined with the identity crises of many English
departments in the 1980s and 1990s,5 led to the development of writing cours-
es as market opportunities. Massey University's School of English and Media
Studies showed a particularly early entrepreneurial spirit, with an undergradu-
ate academic writing degree course emerging in the early 1980s. Because we had
no "homegrown" PhDs in rhetoric and composition in New Zealand at that
time, suitably qualified faculty (with qualifications in applied linguistics and,
later, in rhetoric and composition) were re-located from overseas to direct the
academic writing course, with faculty from the literature programme retraining
to contribute to the course. Fulbright scholars from the US6 with an interest in
WAC also had an influence on the development of the course in the mid-1980s.
The development of this course was contentious, with some faculty of the view
that this was an inappropriate function of an English Department; however,
most English faculty engaged with the course and taught into it at some stage
in its early development.

          DEVELOPING DISTINCTIVENESS: 1990-2000

   Between 1990 and 2000, Massey University's writing programme developed
further to incorporate two distinctive features that clearly established writing
instruction as developmental rather than remedial.

   One of the most distinctive features of Massey University's writing initia-
tives has been the commitment of the College of Science (CoS) to integrating
the teaching of writing into its programmes. In the mid-1990s, a survey of em-
ployers of science graduates showed a particular concern with the generic skills
of science graduates and in particular graduates' writing skills, and the then
Dean began to champion the inclusion of writing in the new degree (Anderson,
1991). Prior to this, the College of Science had taken a range of approaches to
integrating writing into its curriculum, but with the advent of a new degree
programme in the applied sciences in 1995, which included a first year writing
course (Anderson, 1995), the college took the opportunity to introduce writing
as a core component of its curriculum through a first year science writing course
and a "Writing Across the Curriculum" (WAC) programme (see Emerson et al,
2002, 2006).

   Both aspects of this programme are unusual in that they emerged out of
a collaboration between myself (a writing teacher from the SLC) and faculty
from the College of Sciences as part of a PhD programme using an action
research methodology (Emerson et al, 2006). In the first years of the first-year
writing course, it was taught entirely by faculty from the CoS, who re-trained
with my support as a writing teacher. The WAC component of the programme
was intended to further extend science students' writing skills throughout the
disciplines, using both a "Writing in the Disciplines" (WiD) and a "Writing to
Learn" (WtL) approach. In particular, two Departments within the college de-
veloped whole-of-major approaches (modelled on Holyoak, 1998) to integrate
writing into their undergraduate programmes (Emerson et al., 2002; MacKay
et al., 1999)

   In 2000, the science writing course was made compulsory for all students
enrolled in any undergraduate science programme, and the course became do-
miciled in the School of English and Media Studies, under my direction.

   A second distinctive aspect of Massey University's developing writing pro-
gramme was the early development and extension of its OWLL (Online Writ-
ing and Learning Link7)--again, a first for New Zealand universities (Emerson
et al, 2000; MacKay et al, 2000). This was developed out of the SLC in 1996,
through a large grant from the Fund for Excellence and Innovation in Teaching,
and has a distinctive feature in its focus on the needs of distance students. It
has been through several iterations, with intensive investment and development
in the last decade, and is now an extensive resource, providing static learning
resources, interactive resources, and tutor-driven resources, including an asyn-
chronous tutor-review service (called the pre-reading service), which enables
distance students to engage with writing tutors and gain a similar level of sup-
port as that experienced by on-campus students (see http://owll.massey.ac.nz/).

                                                                                                317

   By 2000, then, Massey had developed a range of writing programmes, lo-
cated in two distinct areas: academic writing and science writing courses within
the School of English and Media Studies, and support for writing in the SLC
through face-to-face tutoring, a pre-reading service for distance students, and
the OWLL. While the two parts of the programme reported separately, through
quite distinct reporting lines, there was, at this time, some communication be-
tween the two groups, and a relatively straightforward distinction in function.

   There was also the first sign that an institutional approach to writing might
emerge, when, in 1998, Council approved the university's Learning and Teach-
ing Plan, which included, as one of the attributes of a Massey graduate, that
students be able to "communicate clearly and fluently with all individuals and
groups with whom they will interact professionally" (cited in Massey Univer-
sity, 2005, p.1).

                     FRAGMENTATION: 2000-2010

   Following these initial successes, however, in more recent years, a Universi-
ty-wide approach to writing instruction has not been achieved. Instead, the pro-
vision of writing instruction has diversified and boundaries have blurred--and
while the university has made progress with supporting students' writing, the
writing programme continues to face a number of challenges.

   On the positive side, in response to the university's Learning and Teach-
ing Plan (1998), the academic board in 2005 adopted a proposal for graduate
literacy and numeracy requirements. Despite this, no centralised plan was put
in place to operationalise the proposal--but literacy and writing development
initiatives continued to develop in an ad hoc way. In 2008, the College of Hu-
manities and Social Sciences made the academic writing course taught by the
School of English and Media Studies compulsory for all students studying for
a BA degree, which meant that by 2009 all students enrolled in the College of
Sciences and the College of Humanities and Social Sciences were required to
take a writing course as part of their first year programme. At the same time, the
SLC diversified its writing programmes, including the development of writing
support programmes for post graduates, and continued to extend its resources
on academic writing for both distance and on-campus undergraduates. Also,
in 2003, the SLC, in conjunction with the Halls office (the unit responsible
for student residences on campus), developed a PASS (Peer Assisted Study Ses-
sions) programme (Wilkinson, 2009a, 2009b), partly as a way of improving
the academic profile of the Halls; while this programme was primarily designed

318
                                                                        Massey University (New Zealand)

to support first-year science and business students, it signalled a commitment
to peer tutoring programmes, which would become significant in future years.

   However, there have been trends that suggest a need for vigilance. The uni-
versity has developed a preparatory academic writing course positioned as pre-
tertiary level within the Centre for University Preparation and English Language
studies (CUPELS), and there are indications that programmes are looking to
transfer writing instruction from their academic programme to the pre-tertiary
programme. This may be a matter for concern, since such a move would posi-
tion writing instruction within a remedial rather than developmental context.
This concern, that writing could be seen as a remedial rather than develop-
mental function of student learning, also emerged when the SLC, despite its
programmes becoming more developmental, was amalgamated with Disability
Services. Changed government funding policy, which looks to fund universi-
ties on the basis of completions while retaining open admissions, has led to a
proposal to develop a literacy testing or pre-entry literacy course requirement
for all students. Whether this will eventuate, and what its impact on develop-
mental academic writing programmes might be, is yet to be seen. The challenge
is to distinguish between pre-entry expectations and the academic writing skills
rightly taught within the disciplines.

   Those of us engaged in teaching writing now face a number of difficulties.
First is the fact that writing instruction is now so fragmented in so many parts
of the university (within different Colleges, in the SLC, and in CUPELS), with
almost no coordination or communication, that we are often competing for
ground. The second is that, while writing instruction has been established as
part of the curriculum, there is little understanding or articulation of the theory
of writing instruction or the relationship between writing, learning, and think-
ing within the disciplines.

                     A PEER TUTORING CENTRE

   Looking squarely into this situation, I have found my thoughts returning to
my earliest experience of teaching writing, to the notion of a Writing Centre--
and in particular a peer tutoring centre.

   In 2008, I was invited to spend a semester as visiting lecturer at the Sweet-
land Writing Centre at the University of Michigan in the United States. Like
my colleague 20 years ago, I came home with a passion to create a peer-tutoring
writing centre at Massey as part of our WAC strategy and to build bridges
within my home context.

                                                                                                319
Emerson

   Two practical factors have worked together to support the development of a
peer-tutoring centre. First, the School of English and Media Studies was keen to
develop its courses on academic writing beyond first year. Second, the SLC was
reviewing its commitment to the PASS programme, and looking for new ways
to extend the notion of peer-supported learning.

   For the first time, the School of English and Media Studies and the SLC
are actively working together. The peer review centre will be domiciled in and
funded by the SLC with an academic affiliation with the School of English
and Media Studies. I am writing two peer tutoring courses--Writing Centre:
Theory and Practice and a Writing Centre Practicum. Because the centre is
conceived as part of our WAC strategy, we anticipate inviting students from
across the university who have demonstrated outstanding writing skills to apply
to enrol in these courses. The courses will be offered for the first time in 2011
with the peer tutoring centre established at the start of the second semester in
July 2010. We hope to have the peer tutoring writing centre in full operation
by 2012, staffed by 10-20 fully trained part-time peer tutors.

   I am ambitious for this project. I aim to make connections between the SLC
and the School of English and Media Studies in a way that facilitates commu-
nication, coordination, and development. We cannot have a university-wide
writing programme without coordination: this is one step towards this process.
I also hope to engage a first generation of Kiwi students with an ability to see
writing as an integral part of thinking and learning within the disciplines. My
hope is that as these ideas become current within the New Zealand curriculum,
they may come to influence long-term strategy for integrating writing into the
curriculum.

   Finally, what I hope to achieve is something unique: not a transplanted idea
but a Kiwi writing centre. A straight transplant could never be a possibility.
As just one example, most Writing Center texts are geared for a North Ameri-
can readership, making assumptions about student experience and institutional
structures that are not applicable in Aotearoa. And while these texts may discuss
the needs and experiences of specific indigenous peoples in their transition into
academia, there can be no assumption that their experiences match those of
Maori. There are no texts that address the needs and experiences of Maori in a
writing centre context, or the needs of kiwi students more generally. We may
have to make our own.

   So the centre we are establishing, while it will be informed by international
theory and experience, will emerge out of unchartered antipodean ground. I
hope to do this through an unusual pedagogical approach: I plan to run the
courses using an action research model, and in this way I hope to take my stu-
dents with me, so that we can become, together, "ethnographers of our home

320
                                                                        Massey University (New Zealand)

campuses." Together, we will analyse our own context and develop a model for
peer tutoring that is informed by international scholarship, but grounded in
Aotearoa New Zealand.

   The last 20 years have seen exciting opportunities for writing to emerge
within the tertiary curriculum in Aotearoa New Zealand. We do not, at Massey
University, yet have a university-wide, coordinated writing programme. But we
have taken huge strides--and we are contributing to the wider conversation in
New Zealand universities concerning the integration of writing into the cur-
riculum. The challenge now is to retain the legitimacy of writing as part of the
academic programme and to develop coordinated approaches that are rooted in
writing pedagogy. The new peer tutoring centre is one step to achieving these
goals.

                                    NOTES

1. "Kiwi" is a term used by New Zealanders to describe themselves (i.e. as a noun) and
to describe a New Zealand context (i.e., as an adjective). It is a reference not to the fruit,
but to the flightless nocturnal bird that is indigenous to these Islands.

2. The Writing Center listserv is a mailing list run through what is now the Inter-
national Writing Center Association (IWCA); see http://writingcenters.org/resources/
starting-a-writing-cente/#Mail

3. "Fix the writing, fix the writer--preferably in one 30 minute consultation" would
be another way of describing the expectations on me.

4. Recent initiatives to cap university placements mean that this policy is currently
under review.

5. During this time, enrolments in English literature programmes in New Zealand
decreased, leading to a revision, in many places, of the curriculum.

7. The notion of an online writing lab did not make sense in a New Zealand context
because we had no history of writing labs. Hence, we did not make use of the common
term "OWL" or "online writing lab."

THE WRITING CENTRE AT ST.

MARY'S UNIVERSITY COLLEGE,

BELFAST, NORTHERN IRELAND

By Jonathan Worley
Saint Mary's University College, Belfast (Northern Ireland)

This essay describes how my experience of teaching in writing pro-
grammes in the US influenced my development of Northern Ireland's
first Writing Centre, established in the spring of 2002. I discuss partic-
ular influences and how they led to specific pedagogical practices. The
experience of moving from an American to a UK academic culture,
and the contrasts that the move revealed, were an especially important
part of the formation of my personal pedagogy, with insights, I believe,
for writing centres on both sides of the Atlantic. As this essay indicates,
I remain strongly committed to the student-centred tutorial practices
advocated by Donald Murray of the University of New Hampshire
and the close, critical scrutiny of student texts, as advocated by Kurt
Spellmeyer of Rutgers. Central to this narrative is the belief that criti-
cal writing is a significant element of social and political practice.

   Opening up a writing centre at St. Mary's University College on the Falls
Road in Belfast was in many ways the fulfillment of an unanticipated dream.
It was an "unanticipated" fulfillment because, like many of my American col-
leagues, I had dreamt initially of becoming a lecturer in English. I had planned
to share my love of literature with students who would then become enlight-
ened and improved, thereby fulfilling Matthew Arnold's high argument about
the place of literature in education.1 My gradual disaffection with Arnold's lofty
claims, combined with my subsequent exposure to pedagogies for teaching
writing, ultimately converted me to a lecturer in academic writing, one who
made a good fit with the liberal arts degree being offered at St. Mary's.

   What does that dream look like in reality? In reality, St. Mary's University
College is a close-knit community of approximately 1,000 students, lecturers,
management and staff. The community is self-effacing but quietly confident
about its place in Northern Irish society. Students were initially friendly and

welcoming when I began teaching there, and they became more so the better I
came to know them. Management was supportive of the importance of a writ-
ing programme to the liberal arts degree, and with their assistance, a colleague
from the English department and I were able to obtain substantial additional
funding to establish a writing centre.

   Lest that reality appear utopian, it came with a significant set of challenges.
First, the liberal arts degree at St. Mary's had a strong commitment to widening
access, which meant that many of our students were likely to be first-generation
university attenders, unfamiliar with the culture and academic practices of ter-
tiary education. Secondly, the heavy commitment to standardised testing in the
North--the 11-plus, GCSE and A-level exams--meant that students graduat-
ing from high school sorely needed to develop further competence in critical
approaches to research, reading, and writing. Finally, if my American impres-
sions of Irish students were correct, they were reluctant to express their critical
opinions publicly. The challenges, then, were to develop writing courses that
could effectively encourage these students to develop the critical sophistication
required for university work and to get them into a writing centre where they
could talk about their writing.

   A brief history of my development as a writing lecturer will help to explain
the practices that I have come to hold dear and which I believe are suited
to St. Mary's. In the United States, many graduate students in English Lit-
erature begin their teaching by being assigned first-year courses in academic
writing, often known as "Freshman English" or "Freshman Composition." As
an American graduate student, I began apprenticeship as a composition in-
structor at the University of New Hampshire (UNH) in 1985. Their writing
programme, which had achieved prominence primarily through the work of
Donald Murray, emphasised a writing process pedagogy that made use of one-
on-one teacher-tutor conferences (individual tutorials) and classroom work-
shops (full-class discussions of students' essays). The programme encouraged
students to write personal narratives and was memorably enthusiastic about
the act of writing.

   While my own reserved personality probably attenuated some of this en-
thusiasm, the programme provided an important reminder that writing ideally
should be enjoyable, and I began to develop a more restrained vocabulary: "en-
gagement," "struggle." "accomplishment," "absorption," "insight," and "com-
petence." These conceptions proved valuable in my one-on-one tutorials with
students, and as I began to learn to draw them out about their own writing
and looked for ways to encourage their interest, I gradually shifted from being
a "lecturer" to being a "responder." As Murray put it, "The instructor responds
to the student's response and to the student's suggestions for improvement."2

   Beyond Murray's emphasis on the importance of listening and responding
in the one-on-one tutorial, he also provided a good scaffold for the writing
process, which encouraged students to think of writing as a series of activities.
Students could learn that in any piece of written work, there are a multitude of
possible interventions. I still cling possessively to my first edition of Murray's
text on student writing, Write to Learn, and I continue (facetiously) to tell my
students to memorise Murray's model for the writing process--collect, focus,
order, draft, clarify--each stage associated with a number of possible develop-
ments of their texts.3

   However, good writing involves more than enthusiasm and an awareness of
writing as a process, as important as these elements are. Through my experience
at UNH, I realised that students could become effective writers about their per-
sonal experience, such as winning a football match or going to a formal dance.
If they were to venture further, into persuasive forms of writing, their arguments
often, frustratingly, were predictable and lacked engagement: they would write
familiar arguments about familiar issues in familiar ways. The issues did not
even appear interesting to them because they were on safe ground. Very little
of this writing did more than reflect their own positions within their dominant
culture; that is, they tended to write unproblematically about their experience
of the world around them. If they were to abstract values from their experience,
these were generally culturally accepted ones. For example, a football match was
about "good sportsmanship," a formal dance was the "best day of my life," abor-
tion was simply "murder"--all familiar cultural subject positions.

   My dissatisfaction with this kind of writing gained theoretical underpinnings
when I studied academic writing under Kurt Spellmeyer at Rutgers University.4
In his classes we read student texts through the lens of critical theory. While my
own interpretations undoubtedly err on the side of pragmatism and reduction-
ism, I found real power in the use of these theorists. Foucault's structuralism,
for example, became a commentary on how students were lulled through the
discourse that surrounded them into constructing safe and predictable argu-
ments.5 In contrast, Derrida's views on deconstruction helped me to see how
students' tightly held arguments might be the consequence of rigid binary op-
positions.6 Finally, Raymond Williams' (1977) Marxist theory demonstrated
that student texts could be productive of social change, but also might very well
participate in an ideological false consciousness that preserved the status quo.

   Critical theory enabled me to look at students' texts from a fresh perspective:
what kind of meaning could emerge from the student text? This perspective
turned me into a kind of Sherlock Holmes of student writing: in the presence
of larger cultural constructs, what meanings were students attempting to make?
This perspective kept student texts fresh and interesting and took me away from

                                                                                                327

an overemphasis on essay structure. Instead of endlessly looking for thesis state-
ments and well-structured arguments, I searched for emerging meaning.

   Arriving on Irish shores, my initial experience of teaching at Queen's Uni-
versity Belfast (1994-2002) was that there was not much interest in writing
pedagogy. Students were expected to have come to university as competent
writers. My experience, however, was that even at prestigious universities such
as Queen's, a significant number of students were under-developed as indepen-
dent learners and writers. For example, when I assigned my class to read Ham-
let, one promising student said, "You mean go off and read the whole thing?"
In secondary school, such students had been taken step-by-step through literary
texts in preparation for their pre-university exams and, additionally, some were
told exactly what to say about them. A history student told me that in preparing
a critical question upon whether World War I led to World War II, he was told
that there was only one correct answer.

   Fortunately, at Queen's, I was able to collaborate with another American
colleague who had a keen interest in developing a writing programme. He gar-
nered provisional funding for pilot programmes in the teaching of writing from
the Queen's School of English. A series of writing seminars ran for two years
before devolving to a smaller programme in individualised tutoring. My col-
league and I would sit together in our shared office and meet individually with
students interested in improving their writing. The high level of appreciation
from them for this work, and our developing skill with the one-on-one tutorial,
made us keen to expand the programme.

   That opportunity arrived when we moved to St. Mary's University College,
a teacher training college associated with Queen's that had just established a
new degree in the liberal arts. This degree incorporated the teaching of writing
as a central element of its programme, and I found myself with the unexpected
luxury of teaching students in the classroom on a regular basis. I made use of
Murray's writing process model, and, to foster engagement, supplied students
with the kinds of critically challenging texts that I hoped would encourage
them to problematize their experience. I further deployed strategies of small
group work, combined with a myriad of writing activities, in an attempt to
develop classroom discussions. These classrooms were not always as lively as
comparable American ones, but student reviews showed that they thought I was
an `energetic' teacher and that the texts were interesting.

   My American colleague provided a superb start for our mutual ambition to
establish a peer tutoring programme in writing by securing an initial grant from
the English Subject Centre.7 We began to establish the programme by drawing
upon essential lessons learned at Queen's. We had come to believe that the one-
on-one tutorial was central, that tutorial discussions should centre upon what

328

the student wanted to do, and that, because of this focus upon the writer, the
concept of having students tutor other students was essentially sound. It was
sound because our peer tutors were not going to put themselves forward as
experts, but rather as fellow writers who could listen and offer suggestions. As
another American colleague, Kathleen Shine Cain, continually asserts, "Writ-
ing is a social process." Students may retreat to a solitary location to write--the
so-called "ivory tower"--but they are probably deceiving themselves if they be-
lieve they do not need the criticism and support of fellow writers. Bolstered by
our experience, the training of peer tutors became grounded in student-centred
tutoring and the writing process.

   Additionally, based on my education at Rutgers, I encourage my tutors to see
themselves in the detective role I imagine for myself: Sherlock Holmes search-
ing for emerging meaning in student texts. When we practice reviewing pieces
of student writing, I encourage tutors to emphasise content. If, for example,
tutors comment that an essay needs a thesis statement, I encourage them to go
one step further and ask what the particular thesis statement should be. Thus,
in the tutoring session, queries such as, "Are you saying that Marxist political
theory does not address the issue of central government?" are much better than,
"Where is your thesis statement?"

   After three years of initial support from the English Subject Centre, my
colleagues and I were in the excellent position of having enough experience
to speak with some authority when applying for a grant to be designated as
a Centre for Excellence in Teaching and Learning in Northern Ireland. Our
application was successful and in 2006 our funding increased fifty-fold. A sig-
nificant benefit of this funding was that we were more fully able to develop a
relationship with Dr. Kathleen Cain, who directs the Merrimack College Writ-
ing Centre in Massachusetts, US Kathy came to St. Mary's for a year as a visiting
lecturer and was able to contribute her expertise to the further development of
our writing centre. The contrasts between the practices of American and UK
educational systems proved productive in our thinking about how to develop
writing centre pedagogy, and Kathy and I have developed a number of joint
conference presentations on the subject of this difference. The second signifi-
cant benefit was that we were able to move into a larger teaching space with a
connected suite of rooms: a peer tutor office, a teaching classroom, and an office
for me as director. The willingness of St. Mary's to provide us with this space
was one of the most significant aspects of our success: we became an obvious
physical presence at the college and students began not only to come to tutori-
als, but to begin to "hang out" at the centre and study and collaborate on their
writing. The rooms are not pre-possessing, but the space itself is excellent. I am
able to confer with peer tutors in an informal atmosphere, and the space is an

                                                                                                329

excellent design emphasising collaboration rather than formal teaching. As one
of the peer tutors commented: "There is no hierarchy in the writing centre."

   When I meet with peer tutors individually at the end of each academic year,
I am greatly encouraged and pleasantly surprised by their insights. My col-
leagues and I learn from them. My dream had been transformed from teaching
the appreciation of literature into the opportunity to see students empowered
by their ability to engage in the process of writing: not empowered merely be-
cause they had mastered writing skills, but because through writing they could
learn to be effective and engaged social participants in a larger world. The writ-
ing centre that we have set up at St. Mary's is good value because students, very
properly and naturally, tutor other students. Staffed by twenty-five student peer
tutors, we can handle up to 100 sessions per week, and last academic year we
had close to 700 tutorials. Each session is a unique opportunity for a significant
discussion about writing. In the writing centre students do what should be a
normal part of the learning process: they learn from each other.

THE UPS AND DOWNS OF
THE INTERDISCIPLINARY
WRITING CENTER OF
THE INTERAMERICAN
UNIVERSITY OF PUERTO RICO,
METROPOLITAN CAMPUS

By Matilde García-Arroyo and Hilda E. Quintana
InterAmerican University of Puerto Rico, Metro Campus

This profile describes the eventful history over twenty-five years of the
Interdisciplinary Writing Center of the InterAmerican University of
Puerto Rico. The Center, the first in Puerto Rico and committed to de-
veloping students' writing in both Spanish and English, flourished for
several years, closed, then re-opened in 2008 to a new mandate. The
authors analyze persistent attitudinal challenges the Center continues
to face, even as it has succeeded in its mission of reaching students
across disciplines.

   The Metropolitan Campus was founded in 1962 as part of the InterA-
merican University of Puerto Rico (IAUPR, founded in 1912), a private, co-
educational nonprofit teaching institution with a Christian heritage and an
ecumenical tradition. IAUPR was accredited in 1944 by the Middle States
Association of Colleges and Schools, thus becoming the first four-year lib-
eral arts college to be accredited outside the continental limits of the United
States. At present, our campus serves an average of 10,600 students, who are
enrolled in one of four faculties: Sciences and Technology, Education and
Behavioral Professions, Business and Economic Administration, and Human-
istic Studies. It offers all levels of study from certificates to doctoral degrees.

   During the 1983-84 academic year, our university initiated an innovative
general education program that included a composition course in Spanish,
our first language. IAUPR was the first university in Puerto Rico to require a
composition course in our native language. Specifically, this course allowed

our university to meet the following goal of this General Education Program:
"To develop a person capable of communicating with propriety in Spanish
or English and of using the other language at an acceptable level" (General
Catalog, 2007-2009, p. 106). Composition courses in L1 had never been part
of the college tradition in Puerto Rico, because it was assumed that students
who were admitted to them already knew how to write well in any disci-
pline. By doing this, our institution expressed concern about our students'
written communication skills. From that moment on, the Vice Presidency
of Academic Affairs of IAUPR also promoted writing across the curriculum.
Later on, and after Christopher Thaiss was invited in 1988 to offer several
workshops to faculty from across the disciplines, our institution approved a
policy that stated:

         Writing will be part of our curriculum and should be used
         intensively so that it becomes a means of expression and a
         learning tool in all of the disciplines. Its use will facilitate the
         development of thinking skills while being used as a teaching
         and learning tool. This is based on the idea that knowledge
         and language are inseparable. In other words, what is known
         should be communicated in written form [Authors' transla-
         tion] (Academic Excellence, 1988, p. 7).

   It was in the Metropolitan Campus that this policy was accepted very en-
thusiastically by both of us as Directors of the Spanish and English Depart-
ments. Therefore, in 1990 and 1992, we organized, together with a group of
professors from the Spanish and English Departments, the First and Second
Conferences on the Teaching of Writing, which served as vehicles for faculty
development. Both were key activities in acknowledging the importance of
composition courses in our first language and the need of incorporating writing
across the curriculum, not only in our university, but also in all institutions in
Puerto Rico. During this period some of our guests included Peter Elbow, Paul
Connolly, James Gray, Daniel Cassany, and Robert Tierney. We also received
scholarships to take post-doctoral courses in the teaching of reading and writ-
ing, including seminars in the Institute for Writing and Thinking at Bard Col-
lege in New York. All of these initiatives made us more aware that there was a
need to supplement what the university had done up to that moment and to
consider alternatives that would strengthen our General Education Program. It
was at that time that we began to consider the development of a Writing Center
for our campus.

                     THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
            INTERDISCIPLINARY WRITING CENTER

   In the summer of 1992, and with the sponsorship of the Vice Presidency
of Academic Affairs, we began a research project that allowed us to develop a
writing center model for our campus. Our research included visiting several cen-
ters in universities in the United States to observe their functioning, as well as
to interview the directors. We visited the Writing Centers at Lehman College
in CUNY, New York University, SUNY at Albany, the University of Southern
California in Los Angeles, the University of California at Berkeley, the University
of Texas at El Paso, and the University of Miami. In 1993 we also visited the
Writing Center at Georgetown University in Washington, DC. The reading of A
Guide to Writing Programs: Writing Centers, Peer Tutoring, and Writing across
the Curriculum (Haring-Smith,1985) helped us choose these centers. Other fac-
tors we took into consideration when selecting these centers were their prestige,
and that they were located in universities that had some similarities with ours;
for example, the student population. Since many of them had Hispanic students,
we were able to get information on how they taught writing in both L1 and L2.

   The visits allowed us to gather information about where to locate our center
and how to train the tutors and other personnel who would be working there.
Because we interviewed directors and tutors and studied the organization of the
centers, we also gathered much more information about the roles of Writing
Centers. In addition, all of the directors shared with us hand-outs and other of-
ficial documents that guided us in developing our own materials. All of the in-
formation collected and the work of Muriel Harris (1982) and Stephen North
(1984) served as guides when we finally developed our model.

   The mission of our Writing Center stated that we would help our students
improve the quality of their written work by means of one-to-one tutorials dur-
ing the writing process in both languages, English and Spanish. These tutorials
would be given by trained undergraduate students. Other group orientations
and workshops would be given to provide students with techniques to help
them discover their own writing processes. In addition, our model of the writ-
ing center included a faculty-training component.

                  THE BEGINNING AND THE END

   Our Writing Center was inaugurated in 1994 with the visit of Toby Ful-
wiler. The Center was assigned to the Dean of Studies office to make it clear

                                                                                                335
García-Arroyo and Quintana

that tutoring was available to students in all disciplines and not only to students
taking Spanish and English courses. It had a director who was a full time profes-
sor of the Spanish Department and who had completed post-doctoral studies
in the teaching of writing, plus two part-time coordinators, one for English and
one for Spanish, who were in charge of the tutors. During the first three years
all services were offered, and the number of students tutored increased year by
year. The few graduate students who sought services received tutorials given
by the coordinators, who had master's degrees in the teaching of Spanish and
English. It is important to point out that the Center was a stronghold of both
the writing process and writing across the curriculum. In other words, in the
Center we were aware that the teaching of writing had to be transformed, so
we organized professional development activities to help professors incorporate
writing in their courses.

   The Writing Center, the only one of its kind on the island, was open until
2000, when the administration indicated that for budgetary reasons it had to
close. However, we have to indicate that very few faculty members and admin-
istrators understood its mission. Usually it was confused with the Spanish and
English Language Laboratories that had been in operation since the 1970s on
our campus. These were set up for basic level students to do remedial work to
improve their writing skills. As a matter of fact, at the beginning of the 1990s,
the teaching of writing as a process was hardly known in Puerto Rico, especially
among the Spanish professors. Of course, this situation made it harder to incor-
porate writing across the curriculum.

   Gradually, the budget for tutors decreased, provoking the reduction of one-
to-one tutorials. At the same time, the direction of the Center fell into the
hands of part-time Spanish or English faculty who only worked six hours a
week and had no academic preparation in the field of writing. Basically, it was
the responsibility of a "specialist" in the development of writing skills who was
in charge of the Writing Center, because there were no tutors. This is further
evidence that the idea of a writing center was not understood.

   Sadly, all of these events led to the closing of the center, thus sending a
formidable message to the professors who had included writing in their courses
throughout the years. Harris (n.d.) helps us understand what happened:

         When there is a lack of understanding, outsiders tend to
         view the center as less important, capable of operating with
         limited funds and/or facilities, and able to cope with minimal
         assistance. In times of budget cuts, writing centers are more
         likely to be viewed as expendable because they are unlike

         traditional credit-bearing courses. Thus, the tenuous nature
         of some facilities and their reduced levels of support can
         demoralize the staff and weaken the writing center's ability to
         do its work. Where there is a clearer understanding of what
         the writing center contributes, however, support is strong,
         and writing centers are likely to be given increased responsi-
         bilities (15).

   The years that followed the closing of our center disrupted all we had done
to incorporate writing across the curriculum. It is during this period that the
composition course in Spanish was also eliminated as a graduation requirement
university-wide. A world literature course was substituted for it. In addition,
the university policy regarding writing across the curriculum was annulled at
this time.

                         THE NEW BEGINNING

   The efforts to transform the teaching of writing were left in the hands of a
small group of professors who were committed to this end. In other words, we
were left to work individually in our classrooms. We also continued publishing
our work and attending conferences in Latin America and in the United States.
Basically, we felt it was our responsibility to continue our own professional de-
velopment, hoping that one day we would be able to resume our discussion of
communication across the curriculum (CAC) throughout our campus.

   In 2003, the UNESCO Chair for the Improvement of Reading and Writing
in Latin America was established on our campus through our initiative. This
event started a new dialogue about the importance of both processes as learning
tools. To inaugurate the Chair a symposium was held in 2004, thus creating
more interest in the writing process and academic writing. This activity coin-
cided with a new administration that expressed great interest in reopening the
Interdisciplinary Writing Center.

   Finally, in March 2008, the Center was reopened based on the same model
we had developed. One-to-one tutorials are given in Spanish and English--and
this time in an extended schedule. Now the Center is open at night and on Sat-
urday morning in order to service our graduate students, who only study during
these periods on our campus.

   Our experience has been rewarding once again. The number of tutorials has
surpassed our expectations. Alliances have been made with the Teacher Prepara-

                                                                                                337

tion, Spanish, Music, and Psychology professors. At this moment our Internet
webpage is under construction to serve our online students. We are also making
plans to develop podcasts to strengthen our services.

   Reopening the Center constitutes a new effort to incorporate writing as a
learning tool in the curriculum, while we also take care of our students' needs
during the writing process. The Center is also part of the restructuring of the
services offered by the Faculty of Humanistic Studies and part of the new aca-
demic vision of our present administration. It is important to mention that the
Language Laboratories have been eliminated, so our Writing Center occupies
the place it should have in an educational institution that aspires to graduate its
students with writing competencies.

                          WHERE WE ARE NOW

   We are very satisfied with our achievements up to now. Nevertheless, we are
aware that budgetary decisions sometimes do not allow us to offer the number
of tutorials requested. There is still not a clear understanding that the tutoring
sessions have to be given individually in both Spanish and English during the
hours when the Center is opened. In addition, there is still no budget assigned
for books and other educational materials.

   We are also concerned that many faculty members still view the teaching of
writing as being equivalent to teaching grammar. Therefore, these faculty be-
lieve that only Spanish and English professors should teach writing. All required
Spanish courses have also been revised since 2000; they are all literature courses
now. The syllabi indicate that writing and reading processes are included in all
of them, but not all professors teach these. A strong grammar component has
gradually been included in these courses in recent years, too.

   Faculty development is still part of the Center, because the present adminis-
tration has appointed us as members of a campus-wide Interdisciplinary Writ-
ing Committee. Therefore, we sense that the administration is trying to locate
our CAC program in our Writing Center. The mission of this committee is to
train professors who are interested in incorporating writing in their courses.

   It is interesting to note that our participation in this committee has helped
us reaffirm the results of a study that we recently completed with two other
colleagues from other higher education institutions in Puerto Rico (Quintana,
García Arroyo, Arribas, & Hernández, in press). In Puerto Rico, the teaching
of reading and writing is still viewed from a very timid standpoint. All of the
administrators of the institutions that we surveyed agreed that there is a great
concern with CAC, and they also recognized that many of the students enrolled

338
                                                                InterAmerican University of Puerto Rico

in their institutions need to improve these competencies. However, the partici-
pants in our study still view the writing process as being the same as learning
grammar. In addition, the majority of the institutions that were surveyed still
have Language Laboratories, including the other campuses of our institution.
All emphasize remedial work, mostly grammar and punctuation exercises for
which "correct" answers are sought to make sure, it is imagined, that students
will obtain writing competence.

   Some of the members of our campus Interdisciplinary Writing Committee
also share this vision. They believe it is our responsibility, as Spanish and Eng-
lish professors, to make sure our students learn to write. In addition, they do
not understand their role in helping students gain writing proficiency in their
discipline. They all agree that students need to improve their writing skills, but
they do not do anything about it. As a matter of fact, they have indicated that
they do not include any writing activities in their courses because students do
not know how to write. Therefore, our main challenge in this committee is to
convince these members that writing is a learning tool in all disciplines. They
also need to understand that the Writing Center can play a very active role in
the development of the writing competencies of our student body.

   Over the years we have finally understood that professors who write and
publish their work are the ones who understand the importance of the role of
writing in their disciplines. It is these professors who also understand the mis-
sion of the Writing Center; this is why they sponsor it.

   Finally, it is important to point out that we have never doubted the val-
ue of the Writing Center. In the Center our students write and discover their
strengths. There writing is promoted as an art and as a tool to obtain success
in any field or profession. The Center gives them a wonderful opportunity to
develop their intelligences, talents, and writing processes, most likely not devel-
oped in many traditional learning settings.

ACADEMIC WRITING AT THE

UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE:

A PERSPECTIVE FROM

SCOTLAND

By Kathleen McMillan
University of Dundee (Scotland)

This profile essay explores the variety of Academic Writing provision in
place at the University of Dundee, Scotland. The Academic Achieve-
ment Teaching Unit (AATU), under the Directorship of the Academic
Secretary, supports the University of Dundee community by promoting
on-campus development of academic literacies for all students. This
provision includes credit-bearing academic literacy courses, support
programmes, bespoke inputs, and discrete postgraduate writing courses.
In addition, under the Royal Literary Fund's Fellowship Scheme for
supporting writing development in Higher Education, the institution
hosts part-time Royal Literary Fund (RLF) Writing Fellows. The pro-
file charts how writing development work at the University of Dundee
has come into being organically, in response to demand from academic
colleagues and to student-led demand.

   The student population in Scotland tends to reflect the demographic profile,
by drawing the majority of its undergraduate students from the wider Scottish/
UK community, and often from the local area in which the university is set.
Postgraduate students present a more cosmopolitan profile, as institutions seek
to exploit the international market to supplement income streams; this trend
is reflected in taught and research degree programmes. Therefore, the academic
needs of subsets within university communities are diverse and often without
complementarity.

   Students as a community are articulate in their demands for a high quality
teaching and learning experience. However, they are not alone in possessing
high expectations of their university education; teaching and research staff, too,
have expectations as to performance of students and their ability to learn and

to meet the standards of performance that judge them to be worthy of the tar-
get degree. In practice, this means a series of push-pull tensions, as university
hierarchies seek to fulfil the requirements of central and regional governments
in terms of recruitment and progression targets, while those involved in deliver-
ing courses strive to maintain levels of teaching and learning to standards that
reflect the traditions of university education.

   To add to these tensions, emergent factors have further influenced learning
environments, as staff and students develop uses (and expectations about these
uses) of technology in learning. Lecture notes are de rigeur posted on virtual
learning sites, while podcast lectures and Twitter are beginning to reflect the
outlook and expectation of the twenty-first century learner. Students make use
of these different media to record ideas, contribute to discussions, and broker
their learning by writing in ways that are not particularly well related to the
traditional writing models of higher education. Yet, assessment modes still rely
heavily on the written-word tradition as a means of demonstrating understand-
ing and intellectual development.

                  THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

   The University of Dundee, as one of the older Scottish universities, having
separated from the University of St. Andrews in 1967, is no different from oth-
ers in the sector in that it has to meet the demands of central (UK) and regional
(Scottish) governments while responding to the requirements of its academic
community. Recently, the university has restructured to four Colleges com-
prising 13 Schools, representing a range of disciplines including Life Sciences,
Medicine, Dentistry, Social Sciences, Humanities, Engineering, and the Arts.
The university has three campus sites.

   The Academic Achievement Teaching Unit (AATU), under the Director-
ship of the Academic Secretary, supports the university community by pro-
moting on-campus development of academic literacies for all students. The
team consists of 4.75 full-time equivalent [FTE] staff: one senior lecturer
with a remit for overseeing the provision of academic development (Head
of Unit), two full-time lecturers (English language support for non-native
speakers of English), and 1.75 Academic Skills Tutors, supplemented by
hourly-paid freelance staff. Administration is covered by .5 FTE clerical staff
with extended provision for large projects over the year. In addition, under
the Royal Literary Fund's programme for supporting writing development
in higher education, the institution hosts two part-time Royal Literary Fund
(RLF) Writing Fellows (each for two days per week) and is grateful to the

RLF for its generosity in continuing to provide the services of the Writing
Fellows.

             SUPPORTING LEARNING: ORIGINS AND
                    GRADUAL GROWTH OF AATU

   AATU has developed organically, in response both to student-led demand
and to demand from academic colleagues. The hard work of the AATU team
has been successful in profiling the need for writing support and broader aspects
of the acquisition of academic learning skills across the university. The AATU
(under another name) originated in the late 1980s from modest requirements
to meet the language needs of international students (English for Academic
Purposes--EAP). Weekly tutorial classes were delivered within the University
Language Unit, which specialised in the teaching of modern foreign languages
(MFL). The EAP remit then morphed into a more inclusive one providing sup-
port in the development of academic literacies for all students. Subsequently,
under one of several restructuring exercises, EAP tuition remained with MFL,
while staff teaching academic literacies attained an independent identity within
a centralised learning service. This model, in turn, was restructured, with the
EAP component reunited with academic literacies activities, to the present con-
figuration as AATU.

   The chequered development of AATU demonstrates that, in earlier times,
interest in the academic literacy needs of students tended to be confined to a
minority of staff and to the international student community--rather than be-
ing an explicit policy of learning development across the student population.
However, in 2007, the creation of a formal unit with the remit of providing
academic literacies tuition to all students (international and home; undergradu-
ate and postgraduate) based on the existing platform of writing development
support, has contributed to the higher profile and more extensive activities that
characterise AATU's current work.

   Thus, institutionally, the work of AATU is regarded as a "good thing" in
that it contributes to aiding student retention and to engaging with the En-
hancement-led Institutional Review (ELIR) processes of quality assurance.
However, this status has been achieved less as the outcome of a discrete policy
than through the development of small, pilot projects launched proactively by
AATU staff and championed by the Academic Secretary. As one success has
been attained and the expertise, academic professionalism, and contribution of
AATU staff recognised, further projects have become more readily supported
and, thus, possible to implement.

                                                                                                343
McMillan

   Hence, University recognition of the importance of "academic literacy" as a
pillar of the university learning experience has been constructed (Ivanic, 1998;
Johns, 1997; Lea, 2004; Lillis, 2001; Street, 2001). The diverse demographic
student profile provides a community whose learning histories may represent
erratic assimilation of some basic concepts of learning, writing, and academic
self-reliance. This is the challenge that AATU seeks to address through holistic
approaches to supporting learning (McMillan, 2008). These encourage students
to recognise that seeking assistance is a mature decision that will help them de-
velop and succeed, rather than a de-motivating admission of failure. Students
may "present" with one need, but reveal needs in other aspects of their learning;
often, one of these is writing. While students may recognise for themselves or
through staff feedback that there is a far bigger learning "picture," students may
have yet to realise that

         Every time a student sits down to write for us, s/he has to
         invent the university . . . has to learn to speak our language,
         to speak as we do, to try on the particular ways of knowing,
         selecting, evaluating, reporting, concluding and arguing that
         define the discourse of our community. (Bartholomae, 1985,
         in Johns 1997, p. 20)

   This is the challenge that AATU staff address through the pragmatic ap-
proach of identifying, and then meeting, learning needs in the broadest sense.
Hence, the resultant AATU portfolio covers a range of diverse aspects of learn-
ing. This diversity takes account of the fact that students do not conveniently
or predictably reach a simultaneous awareness of their learning needs, whatever
these may be. Therefore, the essence of the AATU approach is to provide as
many opportunities and routes into developing learning skills as possible. Writ-
ing plays a key role in this respect, since writing is the means by which stu-
dents are most frequently assessed and, consequently, is the skill development
to which they seem to give most credence.

       PRACTICAL LEARNING: THE AATU PORTFOLIO

   In its practical application, the AATU approach cleaves into four subsets as
shown in Figure 1.

   Each of the provisions identified in Figure 1 has contributed in some mea-
sure to the development of writing for those students who have, either individ-
ually or in their mainstream classes, participated in AATU teaching. The credit-

bearing Personal Academic Student Skills (P@SS) programme, introduced in
2003 (Figure 1: model 1), has been influential in raising the profile amongst
those staff who acknowledge the value of developing academic literacies (http://
www.dundee.ac.uk/aatu/pass.htm). The module is offered twice in an academic
year and attracts students from Levels 1--3 from a range of disciplines. The
20 credits awarded for successful completion of the module contribute to the
requirement to accumulate 120 credits at level 1 towards the final degree. The
syllabus is delivered in three complementary threads: information-processing;

                                                                                       345

understanding "studentness," and academic writing (the latter incorporating
significant inputs on language [grammar] and lexical development). Classroom
teaching is supplemented by activities provided through the institutional virtual
learning environment. The course attracts 80-100 students per year and has
been commended by external examiners, one of whom commented that "this
course is exemplary of the type of support we might wish were available to each
student embarking on university study."

   Pre-entry teaching takes place in English language courses for international
students and, for home students, in a hybrid on-line/on-campus module on ac-
ademic literacies entitled "Learning Plus." Both programmes (Figure 1: model
1) place considerable emphasis on learning to write well. Clearly, although these
represent introductions to academic writing, the intention is that students will
engage, where possible, with later `writing in the disciplines' provision that ex-
ists within bespoke or discrete writing programmes.

   Three support programmes (Figure 1: model 2), Just Write, Write Right, and
Writing by Appointment, explicitly address the development of academic writ-
ing and have generated considerable activity since their inception. In 2004, the
generosity of the Royal Literary Fund (RLF) provided the University with our
first Writing Fellow, whose role was to help students develop their writing (www.
rlf.org.uk). Since 2004, we have had five Writing Fellows, and the current ar-
rangement is that we have two Writing Fellows at any one time working over the
two-semester period of an academic year. Thus far, each Fellow remains in post
for a two-year period. They offer two programmes (one each) --Just Write and
Write Right--and appointments are made via an online booking system, so that
the Fellows can optimize their time for working with students rather than on
routine administrative tasks. They work with undergraduate and postgraduate
students, with the focus on the development of style rather than explicit gram-
matical explanation of errors. The terms of the RLF agreement preclude working
with specific groups who might be regarded as requiring specialist attention;
notably, dyslexic students and students whose writing problems emanate from
the fact that they are using English as an additional language. Such students are
referred to our other in-house writing programme, Writing by Appointment.

   In the RLF programmes and the in-house Writing by Appointment, stu-
dents are seen on a one-to-one basis. This approach is well-received by students
and deemed to be effective; its acknowledged success supports the view that in
the modern, anonymous world of universities, the opportunity to work with
a writing specialist on the student's own work is highly valued (www.dundee.
ac.uk/aatu/writing.htm).1

   Over the three writing programmes, an average of 300 students are seen
each academic year, which in 2009-10 represented in excess of 780 appoint-

346
                                                                         University of Dundee (Scotland)

ments. The number of meetings will vary, since some students require support
over a number of weeks. Students can book online or staff can refer students to
AATU. Information about these programmes is delivered by corporate branded
PLUS@Dundee2 materials displayed prominently in sites available to staff and
students (http://www.dundee.ac.uk/welcome2010/leaflet.htm).

            The Challenge of Changing Staff Perceptions

   However, for some academic staff, perceptions remain that these initiatives
represent deficit models of teaching. These perceptions are incorrect. While some
students do, indeed, register because they are weak in writing, others participate
because they aspire to the highest grades possible and see the writing programmes
as a route to fulfilling this aspiration. If deficit there is, then this lies in the short-
fall in skills development in the school sector; higher education inherits that lega-
cy (McMillan, 2006). Blame cannot be placed on students who have had limited
school tuition in the fundamentals of writing; often these students write only
what they can write, not necessarily what they know (McMillan, 2006).

   Nevertheless, initially, some academics suggested that these writing pro-
gramme interventions compromise the integrity of the work of students, claim-
ing that such students gain an advantage over others who do not receive this
help. These suggestions highlight the failure of some colleagues to recognize the
approach as a construct of learning rather than provision of proof-reading, as they
had assumed. Since the programmes are open to all students, then, it is counter-
argued, no student is disadvantaged by the system, only by their choice not to
seek an appointment. For some individual students who receive guidance on their
writing and learning, this may well compensate in some measure for the skills
shortfall that is increasingly evident among some sectors of the student popula-
tion; even perceived "high achievers" need to recognize the importance of reflec-
tive thinking processes of planning and composing on writing (Sharples, 1999).

   Yet raising staff awareness of academic support mechanisms that exist con-
tinues to be an uphill struggle for AATU practitioners. It is hoped that some
recent institutional restructuring will address the student experience and the
support mechanisms within that concept in a more comprehensive and coher-
ent way that will help to push understanding of this aspect of learning higher
on the continuous professional development agenda.

  Bespoke Workshops and the "Writing in Disciplines" Approach

   Further opportunities to disseminate writing support information are pos-
sible in bespoke workshops (Figure 1: model 3) where AATU staff collaborate

                                                                                                347

with subject specialists in delivering a range of academic skills within the frame-
work of the academic discipline and its timetable. There is a direct correlation
between these team-teaching episodes providing large-group inputs and subse-
quent follow-on appointments for students wishing to address writing issues.
Once students have had experience of AATU support, whether in 1:1 writing
tutorials, bespoke class, or special courses such as P@SS and PREP, several seek
further help at later points in their academic journey towards graduation.

   Writing remains an issue for international students and, while AATU pro-
vides in-sessional English support classes (Figure 1: model 2) on different as-
pects of language acquisition, including writing, the numbers of students who
seek places in this voluntary programme are not indicative of the numbers of
international students who may be challenged by academic writing standards.
This disparity has been attributed to the fact that, because both under- and
postgraduate programmes are intensive, students do not have time to partici-
pate in generic language classes; conversely, some students do not acknowl-
edge their difficulties with writing until much further on in the academic year,
when it is too late to address these because of the time pressure of submission
deadlines.

   For these reasons, a `Writing in the Disciplines' (WiD) approach to support
the writing needs of undergraduate international students is being adopted,
modeled on a long-standing initiative for taught postgraduate orthopaedic stu-
dents and a newer pilot with taught postgraduate civil engineering students.
These discrete writing modules involve international and home students (Figure
1: model 4). The inputs are integrated into the course timetable, and the aim is
to do likewise for undergraduate programmes. The focus, in both instances, is
to shift the overt emphasis from language acquisition in the traditional, generic
English for Academic Purposes approach, by exploiting the students' strategic
need to prepare and produce a dissertation that meets the required written stan-
dard. Therefore, as each stage of the dissertation is tackled, the explicit writing
skills are developed incrementally to that end and, since the module is integrat-
ed into courses, the time spent in the subject-driven writing class is validated.
The content can be tailored to meet the discipline requirements, with those
students who are weaker being identified and given additional support through
the one-to-one writing programmes.

                      Postgraduate Writing Courses

   Another dimension of the work of AATU is the provision of discrete post-
graduate writing courses--in the form of 13 two-hour workshops on differ-
ent aspects of thesis writing within the Generic Skills curriculum offered to all

doctoral students regardless of nationality or language community in the four
University Colleges as part of their professional development programme in
years 1-3 of their studies. The workshops take students from the early stages of
exploring their topic through the literature review (Organised Writing), the de-
velopment of drafts as the research work begins to achieve outcomes (Scholarly
Writing), and into the final phase with sessions on achieving coherence over the
whole thesis (Thesis Overview). Again, working on the principle that students
are more engaged if the material relates to them as individuals, the approach is
to provide students with feedback on a short piece of un-edited writing (500-
750 words). This provides diagnostic information that forms the basis of the
workshop sessions.

                    Examination Preparation Support

         The AATU model of academic literacies development reflects
         the views of Johns (1997), who acknowledged that students
         need ". . . .strategies for understanding, discussing, organiz-
         ing, and producing texts . . . the learning processes as well as
         products, form as well as content, readers' as well as writers'
         roles and purposes" (Johns, 1997:2-3).

   This interplay is recognized particularly by students who participate in the
Preparatory Resit Examination Programme (PREP) (Figure 1: model 2). This
AATU support programme deals with students when they are at their most
vulnerable. Although only two-weeks long, the PREP syllabus has to work
through different academic literacies to ensure that students not only under-
stand the critical thinking necessary for exam success, but also ensure that they
can evidence this in their writing. For those students who successfully return to
their studies after resits, this provides an introduction to AATU provision and,
as a consequence, such students frequently seek further support with writing
through AATU's one-to-one writing tutorials.

   AATU also supports "unseen" students, namely, those who access the AATU
"How to . . . " leaflets on essays, reports, and exams that are available on PLUS@
Dundee displays across the campuses (http://www.dundee.ac.uk/welcome2010/
leaflet.htm). Additionally, our intranet sites, Advance@Dundee and Advance@
Dundee Postgraduate Portal, provide a resource on writing as an ever-present
reference. Similarly, Write Attributes, a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)
module accessible to all students, provides guidance, with models, on citation
and referencing. Designed to help students learn how to use the work of others
in support of the discussion in their writing, it tackles plagiarism constructively.

                                                                                                349

                           MOVING FORWARD

   The integrated approach of the AATU model is framed on an understand-
ing that "there needs to be a facility within school and university curricula to
introduce, develop, and enhance academic literacies for all those who may
aspire to study in higher education at some point in the future" (McMillan,
2008). Writing is one such literacy. However, the problems that surround the
development of writing lie not only with the constraints arising from students'
lack of prior learning at school level, but also with the broadening genres with-
in which students are expected to write (Ganobcsik-Williams, 2006), along-
side the "hidden agenda" of limited resources that prevail in modern higher
education. It is not enough that students have to write in traditional essay
or report formats; their writing must be appropriate to the discipline--yet
deal with the multitude of genres expected of them. Dealing with the differ-
ent formats and expectations that lead from these genres presents, for many,
confusion and inconsistency. For example, in some disciplines, students are
asked to submit a standard essay, blog entries, and a piece of reflective writing
within their first-year assessments. Feedback on any one of these diverse genres
has little potential to be particularly useful to the others. Thus, students are
often not given the opportunity (especially within the now common modular
system of course delivery) to consolidate their writing skills in light of related
feedback. Instead, within one module they are required to write in an en-
tirely different way measured against criteria that can be vague, if not unclear.
In addition, "mixed messages" within the guidelines, learning outcomes, and
practices required by individual academics can confuse students further; for
example, in use of voice, personalization, structuring of text, and general reg-
ister. Hence, students are constantly challenged by criteria that, while perhaps
seeming open and clear, are often, in practice, hidden and, to the novice writer,
unfathomable.3

   AATU initiatives have developed, therefore, not only to assist students, but
also to encourage subject specialists to become more aware of their role in "un-
packing" some of the mysteries of the writing required in their field, by help-
ing students to understand the academic "voice," the related language, and the
writing conventions. Thus, the roles of academic staff and academic skills prac-
titioners are to act as interpreters of the academic mores that support the tradi-
tions of academic writing for undergraduate and postgraduate students and to
model ways in which these need to adapt to meet the diverse range of genres
and contexts of the modern university. At a time when so much is uncertain in
higher education and the wider economy, it is imperative for employability that
students develop these academic writing skills in all their diversity, and recog-

nize that these skills need to be honed and shaped to transfer appropriately to
professional contexts. How can this be done except by showing students that
academia values and rewards excellence in writing?

                                    NOTES

1. One unexpected outcome of the RLF scheme has been that the author of this essay
has worked collaboratively since then on several commercial writing projects with our
first Writing Fellow, Dr. Bill Kirton. Without the RLF initiative, this writing partner-
ship opportunity would not have arisen.

2. PLUS@Dundee--Personal Learning for University Success at Dundee is a project
that introduces students to the new learning environment of the University from the
day of their arrival and progresses throughout the journey of their first academic year
with support activities mostly delivered through AATU. A comprehensive set of in-
formation leaflets in addition to the "How to . . . ." leaflets positioned at information
points across the institution gives students key information about University provision
and signposts them to further information online or in support units.

3. The reality is that many students, especially at undergraduate level, are simply un-
aware of the not inconsiderable gaps in their writing skills, while staff make assump-
tions about the expected skill set that are at odds with the reality. This means that
marking criteria and feedback often confuse more than assist.

CHANGING ACADEMIC
LANDSCAPES: PRINCIPLES
AND PRACTICES OF TEACHING
WRITING AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF CAPE TOWN

By Arlene Archer
University of Cape Town (South Africa)

This paper looks at the principles and practices of teaching writing in
the Writing Centre at the University of Cape Town (UCT). It out-
lines some of the context of higher education in South Africa and how
writing centres need to contribute to both access and redress of past
inequities. In order to critically engage with writing, the UCT Writing
Centre takes an "academic literacies" approach, which focuses on con-
textualized social practices, rather than decontextualized skills. This
practice-based approach helps to explore the interdisciplinary nature of
the work, as well as the changing representational landscape in higher
education. The paper explores some of the impact the Writing Centre
has had on student writing, and argues that the Centre contributes to
higher education transformation through the mentoring of postgradu-
ate students as future academics.

                   BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT

   The Writing Centre at the University of Cape Town (UCT) is one of the
oldest Writing Centres in South Africa and has been operating since 1994.
Writing Centres are potentially a locus for change, political spaces with a trans-
formatory agenda, which attempt to transform teaching and learning processes,
whilst democratizing access to education. In most tertiary institutions in South
Africa, the links with Academic Development have often given Writing Centres
their unique character. From the 1980's, tertiary institutions developed units

for Academic Development, or Academic Support as they were known then,
in an effort to address the realities of educational transformation. The support
model of these earlier programmes impacted Writing Centre identity. The walk-
in centres functioned as an extension of the remedial, separate concept of Aca-
demic Development--they were seen as remediation centres to rectify language
deficiencies in individual students. The quick fix model and deferment of re-
sponsibility for writing, the "sticky history of remediation that haunts writing
centre work" (Grimm, 1999, p. 84), is something that the UCT Writing Centre
has had to work against. In an effort to do this, the ethos of the centre is one of
voluntary and confidential usage for all students, from all disciplines at all levels
of study. The intensive training of the consultants ensures a degree of profes-
sionalism, as well as rigorous intellectual engagement with students' ideas.

   Although the Writing Centre has been located in varying institutional places
at different times in its history, it is currently based within a larger structure
called the Language Development Group. This location has served to situate
the work (Thesen & Van Pletzen, 2006). Although both the Language Develop-
ment Group and the Writing Centre focus on developmental work (working in
partnership with departments to develop language in the curriculum), the Writ-
ing Centre tends to have more of a "service" element. In particular, the one-on-
one consultancy serves to accommodate individual students in unique ways.

   The cognitive as well as the affective value of the one-on-one consultation
is well-documented (Harris, 1995; Flynn, 1993). The complexities of different
languages and discourses amongst students are well addressed by this model.
The premise underlying the consultant-student relation is Lave and Wenger's
argument that learning is located in the increased access of learners to par-
ticipating roles in expert performances (1991, p.17). Thus, the most important
role of consultants is to help students find their own voices as part of adopting
a new academic identity. The philosophy of the student consultancy is that
all students can improve their writing, whether they are highly experienced or
complete novices. Sixty-four percent of our clientele are women, more than
half speak English as a second language (although it is difficult to get the exact
data on this), 30 percent are postgraduate students, and 45 percent hail from
the Humanities faculty.

   In 1999, the staffing model of the Writing Centre changed from three full-
time staff members and two coordinators to one coordinator and 10 part-time
postgraduate students. The reasons for this change were manifold. Firstly, it
was felt that more than three years of one-on-one consulting led to consultant
burn-out, whereas fresh consultants each year keep the energy of the project
alive. Secondly, by employing 10 consultants, a range of disciplines could be
accommodated in the Writing Centre. Thirdly, the Centre became a mentor-

354

ing space for postgraduate students, creating a vibrant cross-disciplinary intel-
lectual community, with many consultants using this as a training ground for
moving into academic jobs within their disciplines. Lastly, the current model is
extremely cost effective, and most of the funding for the part-time consultants
is external. The source of this funding is a philanthropic organization that has
consistently funded the Centre for more than a decade.

                         MISSION AND VALUES

   Broadly, the Writing Centre aims to promote and facilitate access to higher
education, within an ethos of social justice and national redress. Social, political
and economic power is closely associated with knowledge of certain discourse
forms and the Centre plays an important role in equity redress at UCT. Writ-
ing is one of the main means of assessment. Developing students' writing helps
them to improve their academic performance and may mean that they stay in
the tertiary system, and proceed to graduation. The Centre aims to assist by
increasing students' understanding of writing as a process; enabling a "thinking-
through-writing" approach; helping students to focus on the given task; height-
ening students' sense of audience in writing. We alert students to academic
voice and plagiarism and help them understand how to select information from
a variety of sources. Lastly, we improve students' sense of coherence, cohesion
and logic in writing, and improve their ability to proof-read for some common
grammatical errors. It is clear from the above that the Writing Centre is in-
volved with emancipatory aspects of knowledge production, such as construct-
ing arguments and thinking through ideas, as well as technical dimensions,
such as the mechanics of writing. It is thus in a unique position to empower
students within the Higher Education system.

   There are three key challenges in the conceptualization of our Writing Cen-
tre's work. Firstly, the degree to which we need to provide students with ac-
cess to dominant practices whilst at the same time enabling critique of these
practices. Secondly, to make the tension between disciplinary conventions and
the generic a productive one. Thirdly, to engage with the changing multimodal
nature of student assignments.

        CRITICAL ACCESS TO DOMINANT PRACTICES

   The key question in terms of equity is how to provide access to dominant
forms, while valuing and promoting the diversity of the representational re-

                                                                                                355

sources of our students. There are social, educational, and political advantages
of acculturation into university practices. If students are denied access, their
marginalization is perpetuated in a society that values these practices. However,
socialization into dominant practices contributes to maintaining their domi-
nance and can uncritically perpetuate the status quo. By dominant practices,
I mean dominant languages, varieties, discourses, modes of representation,
genres and types of knowledge.

   This places the work of the Writing Centre in a double-bind. On one hand,
it would be in our learners' interests if we could help them to conform to the
expectations of the institution. On the other hand, by doing so, we may be
reproducing the ideologies and inequities of the institution and society at large,
and uncritically perpetuating the status quo. Feeling the right to exert a pres-
ence in the text is related to personal autobiography, and therefore is often
associated with the gender, class, and ethnicity of the writer. Students need to
think of themselves as people who have the power and authority to be authors.
They also need to be made aware of hidden cultural assumptions in socially
powerful discourses and to be taught the "rules" of what is appropriate in a way
that highlights their social constructedness (Delpit 1988; Kress, 1982; Lea &
Street, 1998). One of the consultants reflected on how working at the Writing
Centre made her critical of certain aspects of academic discourse and institu-
tional practices.

         It forced me to know the "rules," it led to a critical look at
         why these rules are in place and whether they are still relevant
         or not. Understanding a system better automatically leads to
         questioning and exploring that system.

   The Writing Centre consultants can talk to students about academic ex-
pectations in ways that acknowledge whose values are at stake. They can, for
instance, critically highlight conventions around disciplines, genres, and aca-
demic discourse (such as the use of the third person, nominalizations, the pas-
sive). These conventions can be discussed in order to understand how and why
they operate, and what "rules" would be the most appropriate for the students
to apply in a particular context.

   The approach described above is broadly known as an academic literacies
approach (Lea & Street, 1998), which takes into account institutional relation-
ships of discourse and power and the contested nature of writing practices.
According to this view, a writer needs "to switch practices between one setting
and another, to deploy a repertoire of linguistic practices appropriate to each
setting, and to handle the social meanings and identities that each evokes" (Lea

356
                                                                 University of Cape Town (South Africa)

& Street, 1998, p.159). This view also engages with diverse notions of reading
and writing that are emerging from current social and technological changes.

                 WAYS OF INTEGRATING WRITING
                        INTO THE DISCIPLINES

   One of the central tensions of Writing Centres is the decontextualized na-
ture of the operation, especially in a purely drop-in situation. Given that writing
provides access to and a way of learning the structure of disciplinary thought
that is typical of a discipline, such as ways of thinking, reasoning, interpret-
ing and explaining, the separation from context could be problematic (Archer,
2008). We attempt to link writing and context through embedding workshops
in courses, teaching in mainstream courses, developing feedback loops, and
creating interdisciplinary spaces.

   Although we run generic workshops on topics such as task analysis, reading,
structuring an academic essay, academic argument, referencing and language
use, we prefer to embed workshops within departments and courses. Large-
scale lectures do not offer students many opportunities to practice academic
discourse, whereas these kinds of workshops can create a space for students to
make meaning of their disciplines. The consultants in the Centre also work
together with mainstream lecturers in credit-bearing courses in order to stay in
touch with the rhythms and challenges of tertiary teaching. This kind of col-
laboration is vital to prevent us from becoming disembodied from the rest of
the university, and especially from the curriculum.

   We work with one of the biggest first-year Humanities courses, Media and
Society, for example. It addresses image literacy, writing skills and media writing.
For the past seven years, the Writing Centre has organized a drafting exercise
with between 400 and 500 first year students on the course. The peer-editing
has been built into the tutorial structure of the course and feedback is also given
by the tutors. Between 40 and 60 students from this course take advantage of
the follow-up one-on-one consultations. This intervention has contributed to
a drafting process for the first essay and a peer-review process to be adopted by
the department, thus entrenching the approach within the course.

   In general, the Writing Centre looks for opportunities to use its sites of
practice as sites of institutional learning. The one-on-one consultancy is used to
provide feedback to departments around the ways in which their students are
grappling with particular tasks. To this end, we maintain a comprehensive data-
base on student consultations, which includes demographic information as well
as details on specific consultations. This database also enables us to track the

                                                                                                357
Archer

developmental paths of individual students, sometimes across a number of years
of their studies. Through these feedback loops, the one-on-one consultations
can be justified in terms of data-gathering to inform institutional development.

   In many ways, the interdisciplinary nature of the Writing Centre can be
constructed as a strength rather than a weakness. By appointing consultants
from a range of disciplines, we are able to access their disciplinary knowledge,
and establish strong links to their departments. In the training programme we
examine disciplinary discourses in depth, and the multidisciplinary nature of
the group enables unique insight into writing practices. These feed into the
numerous interdisciplinary workshops that we run at both undergraduate and
postgraduate level

       CHANGING REPRESENTATIONAL LANDSCAPES

   The third challenge for our Writing Centre includes the extent to which we
are equipped to deal adequately with new technologies and emerging multi-
modal genres in Higher Education. Reading and writing practices are only part
of what people have to learn in order to be literate, and thus we need to learn
strategies to help students gain competency in multimodal composition. Many
assignments use visuals as evidence, whilst other assignments are predominantly
visual in nature, such as posters, storyboards, or assignments that include CD-
roms or other media. Related to these changing assignments are new technolo-
gies that enable a range of possibilities for individuals creating documents, in-
cluding variety in layout, image, colour, typeface, sound. The challenge for our
Writing Centre is to train the consultants to deal with the changing nature of
assignments. This includes learning about the appropriate use of visuals, and
the integration of visuals in multimodal texts.

   These multimodal challenges are in line with current thinking about Com-
munication across the Curriculum (CAC) (McLeod, 2008; Reiss, Young &
Selfe, 1998). CAC points to a widened notion of communication (including the
visual design of written assignments) and the redefined nature of texts through
new technologies. Although this thinking is more commonplace in the United
States, it is new in South Africa, and our Writing Centre is one of the first to
begin theorizing about the changing nature of texts and the implications for our
work. We have received funding (in partnership with the Institute of Educa-
tion, University of London) to re-evaluate Writing Centres in South Africa in
the light of our changing representational landscapes, looking at how a range of
forms of communication and media influence texts in specific disciplines and
the implications of this for writing pedagogies and academic literacies. We are

358
                                                                 University of Cape Town (South Africa)

exploring the affordances of a range of modes in student assignments (particu-
larly writing, image, colour and layout), the multimodal realization of academic
voice, the complexity of visual-verbal linkages in texts and how these may differ
across disciplines. We do not necessarily have the technological resources to
show students how to use new tools, but aim to raise awareness of the ways in
which multimodal texts are assembled.

    IMPACT ON STUDENT WRITING: OUR ASSESSMENT

   In the changing academic landscape, it has become imperative to evaluate
the impact of Writing Centre work. However, there are numerous challenges
involved in ascertaining our influence on student writing. Firstly, the one-on-
one consultation is difficult to measure in any systematic way. Secondly, there
are many factors affecting student writing other than visits to the Writing Cen-
tre, and it would be artificial to attempt to construct a control group. Students
write in a range of courses, get feedback, do a range of reading, and it is dif-
ficult to ascertain the extent to which one or two visits to the Writing Centre
have impacted their writing within this larger context. Thirdly, Writing Centre
practice tends to be somewhat ad hoc, with some students coming for once-off
consultations and others maintaining a relationship with the Centre through-
out their degree.

   In conducting an evaluation of our Writing Centre's work, I focused on
a few in-depth case studies of student writing, which seemed more appropri-
ate than looking at breadth of impact (see Archer, 2008). The evaluation was
achieved through interviewing 40 first-year students on their perceptions of the
Centre and its impact on their writing; looking at consultants' comments on
the student writing; looking at grades obtained. Finally, it compared indepen-
dent assessments of the students' improvement from first to final draft using
three criteria: organisation, voice and register, and language use.

   Both consultants and students identified organization as the most com-
monly addressed aspect of writing. The comparison of first and final drafts
revealed that the majority of students show an improvement in the organ-
isation of their essays. Many students do not have a good understanding of
structure when they come into the university, but most of them grasp the
basic concepts relatively easily and manage to improve on essay organisa-
tion. It appears that the Writing Centre helped most in the area of acquiring
academic discourse within particular disciplines. Students seemed weakest in
this regard in their first drafts (the average grade was 30.1%) and improved
substantially through consultation with the Writing Centre (the average for

                                                                                                359
Archer

the final essay was 50.9%). Students coming out of school tend to be unfa-
miliar with both academic discourse and the discourse of their discipline.
They also battle with the use and correct citation of references. It is thus not
surprising that consultations resulted in improved grades in the "voice and
register" category.

   However, improvements in voice and register can also be indicators of a
process of "acculturation" at first year level. I have already made the point that
discursive practices are ideological in the ways they serve to maintain exist-
ing social relations of power. Learning how each discipline presents students
with appropriate knowledge, appropriate ways of organizing that knowledge,
and appropriate ways of representing social relations between the writer and
reader can either lead to acculturation into those knowledge practices or critical
awareness thereof. One student maintained that the Writing Centre "changed
the way I thought about putting information into essays." This summarises the
Centre at its most useful, where it assists students to become adept at negotiat-
ing the epistemology of a particular subject, and inculcates understanding of
how knowledge is linked to appropriate form. Many students indicated a shift
towards a greater sense of autonomy and agency.

   Grammar is often the main reason lecturers send students to the Writing
Centre, yet few consultants and students mentioned this as a key component
of their consultations. The external examiner found that in fact the smallest
improvement took place in the "language use" category. Students who ask for
help with grammar often have overriding problems with structure, voice, reg-
ister and general understanding of the task. In these instances, working with
grammar is of secondary priority until the student has a better grasp of larger
academic literacy practices. Even when language problems are addressed, this by
itself is unlikely to lead to a notable improvement of students' grammar, espe-
cially among second language speakers. While students who come to the Centre
learn to express themselves in a more appropriate tone, improving grammar is
a more long-term development as a result of increased practice in reading and
writing.

   It was evident from this study that the Writing Centre provides an invalu-
able service to undergraduate students, particularly in introducing them to aca-
demic literacy practices in a supportive environment. This was reflected in the
students' marks, often making the difference between passing and failing assign-
ments and even the whole course. Many students reported increased confidence
in their own abilities to understand and write an assignment. This confidence
is particularly important for students from disadvantaged educational back-
grounds who feel overwhelmed by their own perceived lack of cultural capital
(Bourdieu, 1991).

         TRANSFORMATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION
        THROUGH MENTORING YOUNG ACADEMICS

   In accordance with the developmental and equity focus of the UCT Writing
Centre, we aim to develop future academics who are attuned to the academic
literacy practices of their disciplines. There is a strong emphasis on equity, mul-
tilingualism and multidisciplinarity in the selection process of the consultants.
The group is diverse in terms of gender, age, languages spoken and nationality
(currently including people from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mauritius).
The centre employs 10 postgraduate students from a range of disciplines (cur-
rently including linguistics, human genetics, educational technology, sociology,
chemistry, democratic governance, adult education, environmental and geo-
graphical sciences, and social anthropology). They undergo intensive training
throughout the year; training focuses on the theoretical underpinnings of Writ-
ing Centre work, including issues around access and redress, and the practical
application of these. The topics include multilingualism, English as a second
language, disciplinary discourses, multimodality, creative writing, referencing
and academic voice.

   Through the training we aim to develop a common language to theorize our
practice and talk about teaching, learning and writing processes. Reflections
from the consultants attest to how working in the Centre has led to the trans-
formation of their academic identities as postgraduate students and educators,
the refinement of their academic research and writing practices, as well as the
development of their teaching (Lewanika & Archer, 2006):

         I have come to appreciate that knowing and knowledge
         exist amongst people . . . through the social interactions in
         the Writing Centre I have concluded and accepted that my
         understanding of literacy is ever-shifting and that the cliché
         "there are more questions than answers" will always ring true
         for me when attempting to understand the complex land-
         scape of literacy teaching and learning. . . .

   This consultant's reflections reveal a transformation in his identity and prac-
tice as an educator. His interactions within the Writing Centre community
changed his perception of teaching from an exercise in which he imparts knowl-
edge, to one that acknowledges that he is an active participant in a mutual
learning exercise.

   In the last 10 years, we have produced 16 academic appointments at seven
different tertiary institutions in a range of departments, including Academic

                                                                                                361

Development, Religious Studies, English, Film and Media, Law, Botany, Nurs-
ing, Civil Engineering, Environmental and Geographical Sciences, Sociology.
These are academics well-trained in teaching writing and academic argument.
Seven of these young academics were interviewed to ascertain the degree to
which the Writing Centre had prepared them for and facilitated their entry into
academia. All commented on the significance of the Centre to the development
of their pre-existing ideas of academic discourse, particularly the barrier that
this specialized discourse can pose to second-language English speakers. In ad-
dition to academic discourse, they felt they benefited from their Writing Centre
experience insofar as it improved their own research, writing and teaching. It
did this by allowing them to appreciate a wide number of different disciplines,
to be explicitly aware of the rules that they took for granted in their own writ-
ing, and to shift the focus of their teaching from "teacher-centred" to "learner-
centred." The specific experience of one-on-one teaching was beneficial in this
regard. The Centre was regarded by all interviewed as a critically important
space for mentoring new academics.

         The Writing Centre is a very important mentoring space.
         Academics generally aren't taught how to teach. The writing
         centre certainly made me more aware of how to deal with
         students and especially where they experience difficulties. It
         was also useful to see students from across the academic spec-
         trum and different faculties. You realise that there are certain
         academic norms regardless of the department.

   By training young academics, Writing Centres can facilitate equity appoint-
ments in higher education in South Africa, and also contribute to changing
these teaching and learning environments.

               CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE PLANS

   Writing Centres need to be grounded in critical discourses in order to
understand and articulate individual cases and institutional practices. I have
shown how we pursued this at UCT by developing a common theoretical basis
through the training of consultants. This sense of common purpose needs to
be inculcated nationally. Although Writing Centres in South African tertiary
institutions have been operating for a good few years, it is only recently that
Writing Centre practitioners have come together more as a community. There
are now regional groupings that meet regularly, an active listserv and national

seminars. UCT, together with Stellenbosch University, has taken the lead in
putting together a national book outlining the approaches to and practices
within Writing Centres in South Africa (Archer & Richards, 2011). The book
serves to outline differing theoretical approaches to writing that underpin the
various centres, as well as differing implementation of some of these theories in
particular contexts. It reflects on good practice and also grapples with some of
the tensions within Writing Centres, and between Writing Centres and insti-
tutions in terms of degrees of perceived legitimacy and authority. The hope is
that putting together a book of this nature will help Writing Centres in South
Africa to re-engage with our history of remediation and to redefine our practice
theoretically.

   In this profile, I have shown the ways in which our Writing Centre takes a
multi-pronged approach to writing in the institution--providing one-on-one
consultations, ad hoc and generic workshops at all levels, and more sustained
departmental liaisons and curriculum development. There is no quick fix where
writing is concerned; we need multiple sites in and out of the curriculum for
raising awareness of writing. In addition, finding ways of designing interven-
tions to accommodate and harness student diversity is critical. Effective teach-
ing of writing involves a dialogue between the discourses of academia and those
of students, offering those from disadvantaged backgrounds an empowering
and critical experience, not just bridges to established norms. The Writing Cen-
tre plays a central role in this endeavour through its unique positioning in the
institution, its interdisciplinary nature (which needs to be reconstructed as a
strength rather than a weakness), and its ability to create coherent communities
of researchers and writers. This chapter has argued that the UCT Writing Cen-
tre contributes to transformation in terms of research-led development, widen-
ing access, promoting excellence through equity, and ensuring the provision of
key competencies in our graduates.

ACADEMIC COMMUNICATION

STRATEGIES AT

POSTGRADUATE LEVEL

By Isabel Solé, Ana Teberosky, and Montserrat Castelló
University of Barcelona, University of Barcelona, and Ramon
Llull University (Catalonia-Spain)

This chapter describes an experience of teaching academic communi-
cation concepts and procedures as part of the compulsory syllabus of
an interuniversity postgraduate (master's and doctorate) programme
run by six universities in Catalonia (Spain). We shall first provide a
necessarily concise description of the most relevant characteristics of
the institutional and academic context in which our experience took
place. We shall then set out the aims, contents, methodology and forms
of assessment involved in teaching the subject Procedimientos y cánones
de comunicación científica y académica (Procedures and canons of sci-
entific and academic communication) for which we are responsible. In
conclusion, we shall present an analysis of the achievements and limi-
tations of the subject's current format within the more general context
of postgraduate studies, which will allow us to identify the alternatives
that in our judgement would increase its potential.

      THE ACADEMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT

   There is very little explicit teaching of reading, writing, or oral exposition
strategies at Spanish universities. The few instances that do exist are mostly the
result of initiatives taken by individual lecturers who do this sort of thing on a
personal basis. The institutions in which we work also fit this model. There are
many reasons underlying this and a detailed examination of them is beyond the
scope of this chapter. In our opinion, a set of mistaken, albeit fairly widespread,
beliefs among the educational community is responsible for the scant attention
given to the specific teaching of academic communication strategies:

Solé, Teberosky, and Castelló

   · The belief that the learning of oral and written language occurs only in
       the first few years of compulsory education, which leads oral and written
       language to be treated as an "object" of knowledge in these early stages.
       Thereafter these capacities acquire the status of learning "instruments"
       (and lose their former status).

   · The consideration that oral and written language, as communication and
       (to a lesser extent) representation tools, remain invariable throughout a
       person's life, while what varies are the situations in which these tools are
       "applied."

   The experience described in this chapter is based on radically different ideas,
which are succinctly set out below (see section 2). This experience is part of
an official postgraduate educational psychology programme formed by the
Interuniversity Master's Degree in Educational Psychology (MIPE according
to its Catalan and Spanish initials) and the Interuniversity Doctoral Degree
in Educational Psychology (DIPE). This postgraduate course, which has been
taught since the academic year 2004-2005, is a joint initiative by six universities
in Catalonia (Spain) --the Autonomous University of Barcelona, the Univer-
sity of Barcelona, the University of Girona, the University of Lleida, Ramon
Llull University, and Rovira i Virgili/Tarragona University--led by Barcelona
University. It is aimed at students and professionals interested in acquiring a
solid theoretical and practical grounding in the contributions of psychological
knowledge to educational theory and practice, and also sets out to stimulate
research and scientific production in the field of educational psychology.

   There are fifty places available in the course every year and there exist spe-
cific admission criteria for selecting applicants, as the number of applicants
always far exceeds the number of places. The students come from a mixture
of geographical origins and educational backgrounds: there are students from
Catalonia and other parts of Spain, but also from various European and Latin
American countries (Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden, Mexico, Brazil, Chile,
Columbia, etc.); students of psychology, education or other related subjects;
students who have just graduated and others who come back to university to
complete their education following a period of employment. This means that
the academic cultures co-existing in this postgraduate course are diverse, which
makes it extremely rich and, at the same time, requires spaces where students,
especially those doing a doctorate, can get to know and examine the academic
requirements specific to the institutions where they are being educated.

   Meeting this requirement and simultaneously responding to the students'
wide variety of interests has implications for the organisation of the curriculum.
This provides for two educational profiles, one of a professional nature, linked
to psychoeducational intervention in a broad sense and leading to a master's

366

degree upon satisfactory completion of 90 credits; the other of a more academic
nature catering to research and linked to doctorate studies.

   Students opting for a doctorate must take at least 60 postgraduate course
credits--although most of them actually take the full 90 credits allowing them
to obtain the master's degree--and carry out a research project in one of the
16 groups taking part in the DIPE (for more information, go to http://www.
psyed.edu.es).

   The postgraduate curriculum is organised as follows:
   · compulsory common core credits: 20
   · compulsory profile credits: 20, consisting of a practicum, of which there

       are two modalities: professional and research
   · optional credits: 50, to be chosen from 42 subjects, each of which is

       worth five credits. Some subjects are professionally oriented, while others
       are research oriented, although at the present time most of them cater to
       both profiles.
   All students, irrespective of the profile they choose--professional or re-
search--must take the compulsory common core credits, which are divided
into various subjects, some of a conceptual or methodological nature--Cul-
ture, Development and Learning in Educational Psychology; Methodology and
Epistemology in Psychoeducational Research; Current Approaches and Trends
in Educational Psychology-- and others of a more applied nature: Professional
Environments and Contexts in Educational Psychology; Procedures, Canons
and Practices of Scientific and Professional Communication in Educational
Psychology.
   The fact that this last-mentioned subject (Procedures, Canons and Practices
. . .) is compulsory shows that those responsible for the course think its contents
are equally necessary whether students are intending to go into research (doc-
torate) or their interests lead them towards professional specialisation (master's
degree). The experience acquired over several years' teaching on the master's
and doctorate programmes had made it plain that postgraduate students often
have difficulties in coping with the requirements of oral and written academic
and scientific communication. Moreover, contrary to what might be expected,
it is fairly common, even at the highest levels of formal education, for students
to be ignorant of--or fail to use--the basic rules of citation, the documentary
database search strategies specific to the discipline, or the necessary procedures
for adequately organising documentary sources that are consulted in order to be
able to extract information effectively whenever needed.
   Of course, helping students to master these and other academic skills would
require the teaching staff responsible for the various different subjects to co-
ordinate in regard to the academic communication contents that need to be

                                                                                                367
Solé, Teberosky, and Castelló

taught during the course and the order in which they should be introduced.
This coordination is also necessary for those acting as tutors and supervisors of
projects and doctoral theses. However, such coordination is difficult to achieve,
and frequently there is not explicit agreement on what should be demanded of
students in relation to these contents.

         PROCEDURES AND CANONS: THEORETICAL
                     BASIS AND TEACHING PLAN

   Our proposal is based on the premise that reading and writing are insepa-
rable from the social practices in which they occur and from the particular
purposes that define these practices (Carlino, 2005; Kozulin, 2000). Read-
ing and writing constitute a set of competencies that are socially constructed
through participation in different textual communities--such as the academic
community--sharing specific texts and practising particular ways of reading,
interpreting, and producing them. Moreover, scientific writing is not just a ve-
hicle for communicating elaborated knowledge, but an indispensable element
for generating such knowledge. Using reading and writing in an epistemic sense
compels those doing so not only to read and write certain texts; it leads to writ-
ing, reading, and thinking in a particular way. For all these reasons, students in
postgraduate education are faced with new demands as readers and writers for
which they require competencies that cannot be generalised from their previ-
ous experience and need to be learned; mastering such competences requires
students to actually reconstruct the tools of representation and communication,
not merely to apply them.

   By means of this subject we intend to help students to become competent
in the epistemic use of written comprehension and composition tools, and to
familiarise them with the canons of formal oral and written communication. In
particular, the aims set for the subject are:

   1. Knowledge and analysis of the characteristics, canons, and requirements
       of academic texts in the psychology domain.

   2. Knowledge of the basic tools for finding, selecting, and organising infor-
       mation that are useful in carrying out scientific research and in academic
       communication.

   3. Knowledge and analysis of the characteristics of the processes involved in
       writing academic texts in the psychology domain.

   4. Evaluation of the influence of conceptions about and attitudes towards
       writing for academic purposes, from both the process and product
       standpoints.

                                          University of Barcelona and Ramon Llull University (Spain)

   The contents are structured around four core concepts:
    a) The characteristics of academic and scientific texts

         · The requirements of academic texts in psychology
         · Description of the general norms and canons
         · Examples of the variety of academic texts
         · Analysis of and reflection on examples, rules, and conceptions of

             academic writing in psychology
    b) The processes of academic writing

         · The process of composing academic texts
         · Frequent paradoxes in the production of an academic text
         · Writers' identities and profiles
    c) Reading academic and scientific texts
         · Exploratory reading and elaborative reading
         · Strategies for consulting and organising documentary sources
         · Reading to produce academic texts
    d) Public presentation of academic and scientific work
         · The relations between the requirements of the text itself, regulation

             of the written composition process and the necessary strategies for
             communicating in academic contexts
         · Oral academic communication: analysis of norms and conventions
   Teaching of the contents described above is done in four face-to-face class-
room sessions--eight hours in all--plus the directed study and work time
stipulated in the subject --a further 20 hours. Students must attend all four
classroom sessions and carry out the assignments that are set. One assignment,
which is of a general nature and is performed in groups of two or three at the
end of the course, consists in analysing and inferring the structure of a scientific
article given to them in disordered fragments. This activity is designed to help
students identify important characteristics of academic texts. The other tasks set
are more specific and are performed individually. They are linked to the devel-
opment of the core concepts listed above and involve reflecting on contents and
the composition process itself. The aim of both the general task and the more
specific tasks is to help students to consolidate and use the most important
knowledge from the different core sections. These tasks also have an evaluative
dimension, as they are used to assess and grade the students' work.
   The specific tasks are done before each session. There follows a description of
the tasks set for the core contents in the 2009/10 programme:

  Block 1. The Characteristics of Academic and Scientific Texts

   Individual reading and production of texts to answer the following questions:

                                                                                                369
Solé, Teberosky, and Castelló

   1. How many parts does each one contain?
   2. How many linguistic operations? (definition, reformulation, explana-

       tion, summary, argumentation, comparison, contrast, description, enu-
       meration, narrative, presentation of aims, presentation of procedures,
       presentation of instruments, etc.).
   3. How many concepts? (conceptual vocabulary).
   4. How many quotations?
   5. Which connectors?
   Working individually or in pairs, students are assigned two published sci-
entific articles and asked to perform a textual analysis of them and describe
their structure. For example, in the introduction section, they have to mark
and label references to previous theoretical and/or empirical work, and also
indicate whether a definition is given, and whether there are any descriptions,
comparisons or contrasts. In the methodology and results section, they must
underline the procedures, tasks and analyses carried out, the materials used
and the instructions given, and whether any examples of tasks, productions, or
behaviours are provided. They must also indicate the arguments and discussions
in the Conclusions section. They are also required to categorise the citations in
terms of integrated or non-integrated quotations, locate the connectors, and
describe their semantic nature. Lastly, the students must indicate the key con-
cepts and words in relation to the topic of the article. In order to perform this
activity, they must read: El texto académico (The academic text, Chapter 1, by A.
Teberosky in M. Castelló (2007). Escribir y comunicarse en contextos académicos
y científicos. Barcelona: Graó, 17-46.

                  Block 2. Academic Writing Processes

   Individual reading and production of texts:
   Assigned texts: Castelló, M. (2007). El proceso de composición de textos
académicos [The process of composing academic texts]. In M. Castelló (Ed.),
Escribir y comunicarse en contextos académicos y científicos (pp. 47-82). Barcelona:
Graó.
   Castelló, M. (2007). Los efectos de los afectos [The effects of affects]. In M.
Castelló (Ed.), Escribir y comunicarse en contextos académicos y científicos (pp.
137-162). Barcelona: Graó.

   The task involves various activities of different, though complementary,
kinds, the aim of which is to promote reflection on the cognitive, affective, so-
cial and cultural nature of the process of written composition and relate this to
the texts eventually produced. These activities are organised as follows:

370
                                          University of Barcelona and Ramon Llull University (Spain)

   a) After reading the set text, students write a brief summary of the research
project they are carrying out--or will shortly be carrying out--in one of the
modules on the master's degree (the practicum). These projects are usually done
in the third semester and consist in a research project, in the case of the re-
search itinerary, or an intervention project, in the case of the professionalising
itinerary.

   b) In order to have material for reflecting on the process, they must also
keep a diary in which they make a note of the process they followed in writing
the summary mentioned in the previous point. They are asked to record what
happens to them (what they think, feel and do) from the time they start think-
ing about it until they consider the text finished. The instructions for this task
instruct the students to do the following:

         Whenever you do any work on the summary, before finishing
         the work session, devote a few moments to making a note of
         everything you do (time spent, product achieved, steps taken,
         thoughts, feelings, expectations and your degree of satisfac-
         tion or dissatisfaction).

     In addition, the students are asked to fill in a questionnaire about their
profile as writers containing items related to four factors: conception of the
composition process, emotions associated with writing, procrastination and
self-image as a writer.

   c) During the face-to-face teaching session, the students form pairs and
analyse the similarities and differences between their diaries--the process fol-
lowed and the associated feelings--and their final texts. After this they discuss
the different factors dealt with by the items in the questionnaire and examine
how they are linked to the different writer profiles, so that each student can
assess their answers in the light of this information. Lastly, taking into account
their reflections in pairs and the guided discussion with the whole group, they
review their fellow students' texts and offer any suggestions for improvement
they consider appropriate.

   d) Following the classroom session, the students revise their own texts, bear-
ing in mind the suggestions for amendments they have received, and write a
final reflection on what they learned about their profile as writers.

   All the documents--diaries, reflections, initial and final text--are handed
in. The assessment is based on the level of reflection attained on both the pro-
cess employed and the impact of that process on the texts, the amendments sug-
gested in pair work, the changes introduced into the final texts, and the degree
of justification for these changes.

                                                                                                371
Solé, Teberosky, and Castelló

           Block 3. Reading Academic and Scientific Texts

   Individual reading and production of texts:
   Miras, M., Solé, I. (2007) La elaboración del conocimiento científico y aca-
démico [The production of scientific and academic knowledge]. In M. Castelló
(Ed.), Escribir y comunicarse en contextos académicos y científicos (pp. 83-111).
Barcelona: Graó.
   Working in pairs or individually, students are asked to reflect on exploratory
reading and elaborative reading, comparing the information in the reference ar-
ticle with their own experience, so they can identify difficulties or problems they
have when doing this type of reading. On the basis of this reflection, they write
a short piece (no more than two pages, but it can be shorter) succinctly defining
each of the two types of reading and setting out their difficulties with them, if
they have any. In this piece, students must also answer the following question:

         What would you ask of your (research or intervention) proj-
         ect director in regard to these two types of reading?

   The text produced by the students is handed in to the lecturer at the end of
the classroom session.

  Block 4. Public Presentation of Academic and Scientific Work

   Individual reading and production of texts:
   Solé, I. (2007) La exposición pública del texto académico: del texto para
ser leído al texto oral [Public presentation of academic texts: from the text for
reading to the oral text]. In M. Castelló (Ed.), Escribir y comunicarse en contextos
académicos y científico (pp. 113-135). Barcelona: Graó.
   In the reading material, the students identify the components of the public
presentation of academic work that cause them greatest doubts or difficulties,
and these then become the subject of discussion in the classroom session.

                  CONCLUSION: BALANCE SHEET
                       AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

   The procedures and canons of scientific and academic communication was
originally conceived as a workshop in which students and lecturers could further
the competencies of the former by working together on the real problems posed
by the production and dissemination--both oral and written--of academic

372

and scientific knowledge in the context of a university postgraduate course.
The aim was to cater also to the specialised communication requirements in the
professional psychology sphere. In addition, the subject acted as a preparation
for certain tasks--such as presenting and defending a research project or an
intervention experiment before a tribunal of teaching staff--thereby adding a
clearly evaluative dimension.

   In our experience we have found that students show interest in
   · learning and acquiring knowledge about the characteristics of academic

       and scientific texts
   · learning the most important features to be taken into account in the

       processes leading to understanding them and producing them
   · identifying and putting into practice appropriate strategies for finding,

       organising, and citing documentary sources.
   However, meeting more ambitious goals would require changes in the pres-
ent structure. Because of the short time available (eight hours in class and 20
outside), we have had to downscale our original plans in regard to both the
scope of our objectives and the methodology employed.
   As far as the objectives are concerned, we have gradually been focusing more
and more on scientific and academic competencies, while professional com-
petencies have been squeezed out. This does not mean that students who opt
for the professional profile cannot derive any benefit from the subject; in their
active life they will all have to read scientific articles, organise documentary
sources, and speak in public. However, to be honest, we must acknowledge that
our efforts are aimed at helping the students understand academic and scientific
texts and be able to present and provide arguments in support of their research
projects in prototypical academic situations.
   As regards methodology, we have not been able to give the subject the work-
shop flavour to the extent we would have liked. The disparity between the scope
of the contents and the time available, on the one hand, together with the large
number of students to be catered to, on the other, caused us to impose a struc-
ture more akin to a seminar. In general, therefore, the core contents are dealt
with by the lecturer presenting the most important aspects in the various class-
room sessions, augmented by a discussion of the compulsory reading articles,
which the students have to prepare prior to each session. The more procedure-
oriented dimension -which enables students to practise oral presentations and
the reading and writing strategies--is confined to the specific tasks mentioned
in the previous section.
   As might be expected, the restrictions we have described prevent the subject
from achieving its full, intended purpose. For the subject to be more successful,
the following conditions would be required:

                                                                                                373
Solé, Teberosky, and Castelló

   1. more time allocated to the subject, making it possible to cover the more
       procedure-oriented dimension

   2. a general reformulation of the subject so that its specific contents are
       integrated into the reading, writing, and oral communication tasks stu-
       dents have to prepare in other subjects.

   3. an extension of the subject--as part of the reformulation described in
       point b--with a workshop to support the writing of doctoral theses and
       other academic texts (for example, abstracts and papers to be presented
       in public at conferences or scientific forums).

   Each of these solutions has its problems, but there is no doubt that the sec-
ond--especially if it also involves the third--is the most complex. An examina-
tion of this option and the decisions that are eventually taken must be part of
a wider revision of the postgraduate course curriculum. At all events, we hope
the experience we have built up will enable the subject to be expanded and im-
proved. In this way, it would be possible to achieve the purpose for which it was
originally devised and meet the demands of the students, almost all of whom
appreciate the knowledge they acquire from taking the subject. They, as do we,
regret that there is very little follow-up and support for them in the demanding
reading and writing processes involved in producing academic knowledge.

MULTI-DISCIPLINARY, MULTI-
LINGUAL ENGINEERING
EDUCATION WRITING
DEVELOPMENT: A WRITING
PROGRAMME PERSPECTIVE

By Magnus Gustafsson and Tobias Boström
Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden)

The Centre for Language and Communication at Chalmers Univer-
sity of Technology is enabled by the university's curriculum structure to
arrange productive collaborations that promote student development
in language and learning throughout three- and five-year programmes,
including successful completion of BSc theses. This profile describes two
such in-depth collaborations, in mechanical and civil engineering. It
goes on to describe the special challenges of providing the best interven-
tions for the diverse students at the MSc level. That the Centre provides
programmes in both Swedish and English is another important feature
of its work.

                             INTRODUCTION

   Chalmers University of Technology is a research university with a long his-
tory of engineering education. It is situated on the west coast of Sweden in Go-
thenburg, which is Sweden's second largest city with some 500,000 inhabitants.
The institution was founded in 1829 and became a governmental university in
1937, only to become a private university owned by a foundation in 1994. The
university's vision is "Chalmers--for a sustainable future" and its mission state-
ment emphasizes its research profile, its educational appeal, and its professional
context: "Chalmers shall be an outward-looking university of technology with
a global appeal that conducts internationally recognised education and research
linked to a professional innovation process" (Chalmers 2010a).

   The annual report tells its readers that the research profile of the university is
informed by its three initiatives--material and bio, systems and environment,
industry and communication--as well as by its close collaboration with the
research and development activities of the industries in the region (Chalmers,
2010b). Chalmers consequently runs four centers of excellence with industry,
also works closely with the Swedish Ship-owners' Association, and works with a
number of companies in the vehicle and safety centre as well as with the Volvo
group on electronics, safety, and environmental issues. The sustainability profile
of the university is also present in its work with the Alliance for Global Sustain-
ability, as well as with the Swedish Hybrid Vehicle Centre.

   It is not a large institution. The annual report (http://www.chalmers.se/
en/about-chalmers/annual-report/Pages/default.aspx) statistics reveal that
it numbers approximately 12,000 individual students with some 2,000 first
year students. Approximately 25% of the students are women, with a slightly
larger proportion of women at the PhD level (30%). The various engineering
disciplines are taught through three- or five-year long programmes (there are
two different categories of engineers in the Swedish work force). Across all the
programmes and educations at the university (BSc Eng; BSc; MSc Eng; MSc;
MSArch), there are almost 1,000 international students, most of whom are en-
rolled on one of the 44 international master's programmes. The university staffs
some 1,500 teachers and researchers.

   The university has a two-part structure, with the required courses within
the departments on one hand and an educational organisation outside of the
discipline on the other. The educational organisation outside the department
places orders for courses with the relevant departments. For the undergraduate
level this often means that a program buys courses from three or four depart-
ments, whereas for the master's level the programmes tend to be more special-
ised and involve fewer departments. So for instance, none of the engineering
programmes deliver their own math courses in the first three years and instead
buy or order these from the Department of Mathematical Sciences. Similarly,
many programmes buy project management courses from the Department for
the Management of Technology.

   In this educational structure, our privileged situation at Chalmers allows us
to set up writing in the disciplines, by which we deliver courses and modules for
many programmes, allowing more than one encounter with language and com-
munication as well as gradual and challenging progression through sequencing
interventions, assignments, and courses. Our work relies partly on the profes-
sional applications of the engineering profession and on the current Swedish
language law, which demands all agencies and institutions to promote Swedish
as the official language, but also on the current European effort toward greater

378

mobility and internationalization. This means that we must on one hand in-
troduce communication for specific purposes in Swedish but subsequently turn
to our international context and focus on English for specific purposes in an
engineering/technical setting. Given the integration and progression, our lan-
guage and communication activities are never isolated from the disciplines, and
communication becomes a dimension of disciplinary knowledge.

            WRITING AND LITERACY AT CHALMERS
                   UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY

   There is no equivalent to US general education in Swedish higher educa-
tion. Therefore, students are admitted to a programme or to individual courses,
and it is up to the individual programme manager to design learning outcomes
and activities for the students. One of the consequences is that there is no
predictable background in, for instance, writing instruction at a given point
for a student in Swedish higher education, other than phrases in the higher
education act. Similarly, literacy as a term has not had much impact, except
information literacy. However, what has had greater impact is the emphasis
in European higher education on generic and transferable skills. At Chalmers,
and at many institutions with professional-oriented programmes, there is, also,
a very strong sense of professional orientation that promotes meeting employ-
ability requirements.

   Predictably, this kind of situation gives rise to a very instrumental and trans-
actional view of writing and literacy. Most of the writing that gets done is fo-
cused on reporting learning for grading in connection to exams, project work,
and theses. Assignments typically involve various types of reports and presenta-
tions, and there is often a strong connection to end-user applications of work-
ing in industry. In some programmes, there are projects in the third year or later
with industrial representatives; many BSc and MSc theses are done at, with, or
for industries, and all programmes have industrial representatives on their com-
mittees to help expand industrial networks.

   The emphasis on transferability and employability in combination with a
compartmentalised view of learning often leads to a situation where there is
initially less writing and instead a greater focus on lectures and exams. As em-
ployment approaches, writing and discipline-specific communication are al-
lowed more room in learning outcomes and learning activities. This situation is
possibly understandable in view of the fact that it is primarily the programme
managers, apart from faculty at the Centre for Language and Communication,
who care for writing at the university. Beyond the higher education act and ad-

                                                                                                379
Gustafsson and Boström

aptation to European standards, there is no university commitment to writing
or communication across the curriculum.

           WRITING-TO-LEARN AND LEARNING-TO-
                WRITE IN SWEDISH AND ENGLISH

   Adaptation to European education also means that writing tends to start
with interventions in Swedish and, by the end of the three- year and five-year
programmes, writing is also done in English. Initially, the assignments are re-
stricted to smaller course projects; whereas, towards the third year and onwards,
projects might involve BSc theses or MSc theses or other similarly demanding
writing projects.

   Our interventions vary in character. At times they are little more than a
sequence of two or three courses in a three-year programme employing a rather
superficial approach to writing that focuses on reporting and proficiency. Such
designs give rise to a subsequent imbalance between learning-to-write activities
and writing-to-learn activities. Increasingly, however, we are also fortunate to
work with programmes where there are opportunities and conditions to inte-
grate language and content more closely.

   In such embedded contexts it is easier to promote a view of disciplinary
language practice as informing the negotiation of and engagement with knowl-
edge formation and hence learning. In these educational settings, our work
with generic and transferable outcomes therefore becomes situated in a learning
paradigm where the individual student needs to be able to access and contribute
to a specific engineering discipline. Therefore, many of our courses and inter-
ventions are informed by basic CARS-applications (Swales, 1990; Swales &
Feak 2004); by a peer learning framework (Boud, Cohen & Sampson, 2001);
and by an effort to move beyond instrumental notions of literacy (Barrie, 2007;
Lea & Street, 1998).

     TWO ENGINEERING PROGRAMMES AT CHALMERS
             AND THEIR WRITING INTERVENTIONS

   In this profile, we have chosen to focus the examples of our activities around
the two main types of integration and progression that we have been able to
promote. The five-year programmes with their integration into courses and
the three-year programmes that are set up more around collaboration between
separate courses. The three-year programmes are often very good; the student

380
                                                           Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden)

writing experience progresses well throughout the three years, even it is often
communicated by us in our courses rather than primarily by the programme-
specific faculty in their courses. However, since our efforts in three-year pro-
grammes have been profiled elsewhere (Ericsson & Gustafsson, 2008), we pro-
vide more description here of two of the five-year programmes.

   Two interesting programmes to look at are mechanical engineering and civil
engineering. These two programmes are relevant to our profile because they
exemplify how we integrate activities inside "content courses" and work with
faculty more, or in different ways, than we do in most three-year programmes.
Both the programmes have also run educational development projects that have
involved faculty from the Centre. The educational development project for me-
chanical engineering started in the 1990s with their commitment to the Con-
ceive, Develop, Implement, and Operate (CDIO) initiative and involved re-
viewing the entire programme with all teaching faculty (Malmqvist et al, 2010).
More than anything, the CDIO-effort has led to faculty being more involved
with and aware of the communication dimension and the integrated learning
we help design. In a similar manner, the educational development project for
the civil engineering teaching faculty involved colleagues from the Centre who
worked with programme faculty on course design of language and communica-
tion interventions

   In both programmes, the actual interventions for the engineering students
and the faculty are all connected to courses where students do projects. In their
first year of mechanical engineering, we are involved in the planning and run-
ning of the course "Introduction to Mechanical Engineering," where groups
of students work in Swedish to write up a design project. The course manager
is a mechanical engineering professor and works with a team of faculty on the
course including two colleagues from our Centre. After the initial planning
stage, our work is primarily oriented towards students rather than faculty and
involves setting up a peer review process and responding on second versions of
reports. The first-year intervention for civil engineering focuses on an introduc-
tory course called "Building in Society," involving a large number of representa-
tives from the department's various interests. The writing component is almost
entirely oriented towards the written (and oral) presentation of the project they
do in this survey type of course. The reports and presentations are presented to
faculty from the department and from the Centre. Planning, supervision, and
assessment are shared between us and civil engineering faculty throughout the
intervention.

   In the second year of the mechanical engineering programme, we are in-
volved in a more demanding design project, and the course manager similarly
works with a team of faculty and us. In this project, we do more work with

                                                                                                381
Gustafsson and Boström

faculty in providing joint feedback to students as well as sharing the assessment
of oral project presentations. A specific effort has been to develop assessment
criteria together with faculty; these criteria are used by faculty in summative
assessment, as well as by students in formative assessment, where we scaffold a
peer response workshop for the students.

   In collaboration and discussion with the faculty, we decide the guidelines
and requirements for the reports to be written by the students. For the civil
engineering programme, the project is part of an advanced course in "Building
Economy and Organization," and the project students do is a larger component
of the writing-oriented course. Our work is very similar to the first-year in-
tervention, including having jointly established criteria and assessment design.
The decisive difference is that the stakes are higher in the second-year course;
the requirements are more demanding, with an explicit emphasis on critical
reading and argumentation.

   Apart from the actual integration with content, the important faculty work
in both these programmes is the co-assessment of reports or the design of cri-
teria as well as reflection tasks for the various assignments. A possible disad-
vantage with these programmes is the similarity of tasks for the students across
the two years. They do not face many different genres and text types, but they
develop a firm sense of what counts as engineering communication in their
respective disciplines.

   Another problem with writing at Chalmers that these programmes exem-
plify is that while they are well designed for the first three years and there are in-
tegrated and often progressively more demanding interventions, there is hardly
any corresponding work at the MSc-level. Needless to say, there are some very
ambitious and professional course managers, but the Centre is rarely involved.
Instead, our activities at the MSc-level are currently focused on providing six
elective courses; these range from proficiency courses to advanced level techni-
cal communication courses.

                              THE BSC THESIS

   For both these programmes, one factor that drives development is the recent
new design of the BSc thesis in European higher education. As of 2007, all third
year students have to write a 10-week credit (15 ECTS credits) individually-
graded thesis. The key features involve projects advertised by supervisors and
open to students from more than one programme, so we have cross-disciplinary
project teams of up to six engineering students and shared writing and assess-
ment guidelines across all disciplines. The Centre for Language and Commu-

382

nication has been integral to the design and development of this BSc thesis
intervention and provides a seminar for supervisors across campus--writing
guidelines, assessment criteria, and tutorials as well as lectures for students. All
of this has been developed with the group of programme managers for the five-
year engineering programmes. Our third intervention, then, for many of the
engineering programmes is the scaffolding of the written documentation as well
as the written and oral presentation of their BSc-thesis projects.

      INCREASING FACULTY WORK AND OTHER SIGNS
       OF SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMME DEVELOPMENT

   The requirement for a campus-wide, cross-disciplinary bachelor's thesis thus
provides an opportunity to promote writing in all programmes and work to-
wards more careful design of the writing interventions leading up to the BSc
thesis. Thus, it is in the BSc thesis intervention that we see how the small but
integrated courses we do in years one and two generate a good foundation. We
also see how writing cultures differ between departments, and to some extent
we have been able to adapt our activities accordingly.

   So, for example, one of our successes is that three chemistry-related pro-
grammes contacted us to set up preparatory activities in the first year. Predict-
ably, the Centre provides scaffolding for the first project report the students
write in the first year by initiating a peer response process and a more deliberate
writing process. The decisive difference with this intervention is that with these
programmes we have designed a continuous annual fall seminar with PhD TAs
who supervise the first writing efforts of the engineering students. The seminar
focuses on how to integrate writing into the lab and how to promote learning
as well as a shared instructional orientation among lab assistants during year
one. While we do not yet see many of these PhDs as course managers or thesis
supervisors, we do still see how a writing culture around the first-year chemistry
students is beginning to form.

   Another success we have been seeing is our being invited into other pro-
grammes to enhance the programme rather than just provide writing support.
We see such examples in the Architecture and Technology programme (Swedish
only) and in the most recent of Chalmers' three-year programmes--Economy
and Production (Swedish only). In this programme, we do a short introduc-
tory intervention in the fall term of the first year and continue with a "course"
in the second year that on the one hand integrates with a previous course and
completes the documentation and presentation of an argumentative economic
analysis industry case. More significantly, this second-year course also inte-

                                                                                                383
Gustafsson and Boström

grates seminar assignments and activities with a mathematical statistical analy-
sis course. Here we get involved with assignments that focus less on learning-
to-write and much more on enhancing learning with writing. The fact that
programme and course managers are now also interested in such assignments
makes our work more meaningful.

                   THE SHIFT TO TEACHING MSC
                      PROGRAMMES IN ENGLISH

   Much as the dean's decision to focus the BSc thesis assessment heavily on the
written presentation affected the institution and us profoundly, a subsequent
decision has been even more influential. In 2005, management decided that by
fall 2007, all MSc-programmes would be delivered in English, to align more
effectively with the European higher education arena and global education.
Many education development projects have been initiated and some completed
(Chalmers, 2010c). Our activities have been two-pronged. We were fortunate
enough to be able to design and deliver "teaching in English" courses to faculty
(Gustafsson & Räisänen, 2007). These courses are still in the staff develop-
ment offer to faculty. For students, in view of our difficulties of establishing a
sufficient number of integrated interventions at the MSc level, we decided to
open Chalmers Open Communication Studio (CHOCS) (Chalmers, 2010d).
CHOCS is a peer tutored writing-in-the-disciplines writing centre. It is a two-
campus studio, staffing 8-10 student tutors from the engineering disciplines
and catering primarily to students at the MSc-level.

   In past years we have been focusing largely on students; however, we have also
been able to increase our work with faculty and consider that one of our success-
es. Our meetings with BSc-thesis supervisors show us how their focus is initially
often and justifiably on the documentation of the project and the accountability
of the members in the projects. With a discussion of ways of enhancing learning
through writing, they seem ready also to make more informed use of writing
during the process leading up to the final presentation. Similarly, with the faculty
we meet in our courses for "teaching in English," where we see an initial and
necessary focus on proficiency, we see that gradually it also becomes rewarding
to them to discuss issues like information structure, genre awareness, and actual
critical reading. Such seminars tend to result in more enthusiastic supervisors,
who see the strength of a communication-oriented approach and generate new
integrated interventions or, at the very least, articulate better assignments that
include using the writing centre--CHOCS--to scaffold the writing process and
help promote writing-enhanced learning. As of 2010 we are also integral to a

384
                                                           Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden)

university-wide effort to promote high quality learning through constructive
alignment (Chalmers Learning Centre, 2010), which offers additional venues
for working with faculty to enhance learning with writing.

             STUDENTS' VIEWS OF WRITING IN THE
                     DISCIPLINES AT CHALMERS

   For this section of the profile we summarize student comments to represent
the student perspective. We show how students perceive the writing interven-
tions they face and show to some extent how we have responded to the student
feedback. This summary also allows us some room to articulate what happens
at the MSc-level, where the writing interventions are less structured or not as
explicitly designed by us at the Center for Language and Communication.

   It comes as no surprise that many students in the civil and mechanical engi-
neering programmes (described above) comment on the first-year writing experi-
ence as a useful one. Basically, this first-year writing intervention is seen, appro-
priately, as an introduction to the discipline focused on the writing of a report.
Since writing reports is something engineers do very often, this first course, which
includes many lectures about how to structure and formulate and formalize the
written word, is greatly appreciated. While the two programmes described here
do offer interventions also in year two, with a design for progression and greater
complexity in the writing assignments, not all programmes do that yet or not
all students experience the second year writing as different in terms of character
or complexity. So, for some students, it is not until the writing of the BSc thesis
near the end of year three that report writing is advanced to a significantly higher
level. That is due to the mandatory meetings with the Center for Language and
Communication, where feedback is provided in a professional manner.

   Interestingly, when students have noted to us or to their programme manag-
ers the lack of year-two attention to writing, we can begin to address it in the
various year-two interventions. The current second year interventions in various
programmes exemplify different ways of bridging that gap. Such progression is
crucial to developing writing ability even more before arriving at the BSc thesis
intervention.

         WRITING INSTRUCTION AT THE MSC LEVEL

   Entering into the MSc level, where English is most often a second or some-
times a third language among student peers, most students find the first se-

                                                                                                385
Gustafsson and Boström

mester quite frustrating. For instance, in addition to having to cope with com-
pulsory writing assignments, which sometimes lack clear purposes or contain
misaligned intentions, students who have been through the first three years and
the writing interventions in them have to be "teachers" for those who have not
had the privilege to study English in the context of basic sentence structuring
and paragraphing. Such courses are available among the electives for the third-
year students in the many engineering programmes before entering the MSc.
Increasingly, we are beginning to hear students in their MSc-courses suggest
that these currently elective communication courses should be made mandatory
to all students at the MSc-level. Furthermore, the progression in the writing as-
signments at the MSc-level include genres other than reports; thus, mandatory
writing interventions preparing students for genres like essays and articles make
perfect sense as students are introduced to entirely new activity systems.

   After the first semester is completed, there are some indications that conver-
gence in both the oral and written proficiencies has occurred. However, it is all
too often the case that the student "teachers" still end up as project managers
and editors on written group assignments to maintain coherence and structure.
Sadly, some students express a new sense of frustration, as they see how their
personal development as writers is hampered due to the failure--at programme
level--to increase the written proficiency level and requirements while adjust-
ing to the heterogeneous student body. So, in an idealized MSc programme, we
need, on the one hand, higher entry-level standards for communication and,
on the other hand, a more structured scaffolding of the written progression for
the various categories of students. The third need to address at a more consistent
level, according to many students, is for the lecturers to be trained to design,
give feedback to, and assess the increasingly more demanding and complex
communication assignments at the MSc-level. If lecturers cannot keep up with
the level required of students, awkwardness would surely arise that would not
foster progression in the subject at hand nor in technical communication.

                       CONCLUDING REMARKS

   From this brief profile it seems possible to say that designing a multi-dis-
ciplinary, multi-interventions, and engineering-education-specific writing pro-
gramme for the first three years of undergraduate studies in Swedish higher edu-
cation can be done successfully. The target of arriving at the third-year spring
term prepared to take on the BSc thesis project in terms of its communication
dimension is a feasible one that generates effective interventions in the first

three years. These interventions prepare students well not only for the BSc the-
sis, but also for the writing at the MSc-level.

   At the MSc-level, however, we have not been equally successful in our ef-
forts to integrate the necessary writing interventions and find ourselves relying
largely on electives and on the writing centre. Our intention, therefore, is to
increase our work with faculty, for which we are in a good position. Our courses
for "teaching in English" provide a natural meeting ground to discuss ways of
enhancing learning at the MSc-level.

   The main challenge right now appears to be addressing the heterogeneous
student body at the MSc-level in terms of writing development and technical
communication. We want the students who have been through the first three
years at Chalmers to maintain their developmental momentum for writing
competence. Our second challenge is to reach a larger number of the faculty
at the MSc-level with our courses for "teaching in English" and, therefore, to
increase our participation in educational development across Chalmers.

SHAPING THE MULTIMEDIA

MINDSET: COLLABORATIVE

WRITING IN JOURNALISM

EDUCATION

By Daniel Perrin
Zurich University of Applied Sciences (Switzerland)

Blogs are being used for PR, online newsmagazines are booming, and
young people are watching TV more and more often via Internet por-
tals such as YouTube. Increasingly, publicity results from stories and
news on the Internet. This development is unstoppable, just like when
the market switched from black-and-white to color photography, from
silent movies to sound films, and more recently from letters to e-mail.
And, as always in journalism, anyone who understands how to exploit
current technology for contemporary storytelling is in demand. The
accelerating change calls for media--and journalists--fit enough to
adapt to new circumstances. Professional practice and research show
that multimedia mindsets foster applying three success factors: writing
on all channels (see Section 1 of the article), working in teams (Section
2), and finding emergent solutions (Section 3). This has consequenc-
es for the design of writing courses in journalism education (Section
4) --including meaningful, relevant assessments, as an example will
show (Section 5). The second part of this essay describes in detail a new
joint programme in multimedia journalism designed by the Zurich
University of Applied Sciences and the Zurich University of the Arts.

   What is the difference between a blog and an item on a journalistic web-
site? Not the information itself; everything right and wrong, important and
unimportant to say or ask about almost any topic can be found in blogs and
anywhere else on the Internet.

   Why, then, use journalistic Brand X medium on the Internet, as opposed to
non-journalistic Brand Y or Z? Because as a user, I assume that I will get more
from Brand X than I would a mouse-click away. Only research and preparation,

only such genuine journalistic performance, still separate a journalistic medium
from YouTube and the rest of the net. Distribution costs nothing, trust means
everything, and content is king like never before.

   Newspapers and radio programs are becoming user interfaces for content
management systems, for databases of journalistic stories, and for public story-
telling (Singer, 2008). This development is unstoppable, just like when the mar-
ket switched from black-and-white to color photography, from silent movies to
sound films, and more recently from letters to e-mail. And, as always in journal-
ism, anyone who understands how to exploit current technology for contem-
porary storytelling is in demand. Professional practice and research show (e.g.,
Brannon, 2008; Perrin, 2010, in press; Quinn, 2005; Singer, 2008; Tunstall,
2009;) that this is done with a multimedia mindset by applying three success
factors: writing on all channels (see Section 1 of this article), working in teams
(Section 2), and finding emergent solutions (Section 3). This has consequences
for the design of writing courses in journalism education (Section 4) - includ-
ing meaningful, relevant assessments, as an example will show (Section 5).

   SUCCESS FACTOR ONE: WRITING ON ALL CHANNELS

   Even convergent media need coherent texts, moving images, and suitable
sounds. Editors-in-chief of leading publications in media-convergent journal-
ism say that writing will be the key competence in the journalism of the future.
By "writing" they mean the ability to present complex relationships not only
with speech and written characters but also with sounds and images in an ap-
pealing, illustrative, and appropriately objective way.

   First of all, this "writing" succeeds by using the familiar strengths of print,
radio, and television journalism. As paradoxical as it may seem, these strengths
are more urgently needed in convergent media than ever before. If journalists
nowadays opt for a media item with sound but no images, they must know and
make clear to their audience why audio information alone conveys the topic in
the best way.

   In the multimedia environment, journalistic items are organized similar
to musical scores, but in all media: journalists present information, medi-
ating between verified facts and the appearance of protagonists--usually
the people concerned and the decision makers. In addition, there are other
elements involved, such as experts, specialized knowledge, and transitions
(Figure 1).

   The text score of a quote story shows that an item often begins with a quote
from someone representing the people concerned. Then the journalist might

variants.

transition to the appearance of a decision maker, who the people concerned
hold responsible for their misery. This is followed, for example, by specialized
knowledge, introductory comments, an expert's opinions, a transition, a second
expert, a transition, the people concerned again, additional specialized knowl-
edge to round off the "score," and finally a summary statement.

   A journalist might design the quote story not only for classically linear radio
or television or for a newspaper, but also for her audience sitting in front of a
multimedia computer. If so, she can prepare the main text as a written report,
incorporate a quote from the decision maker as an audio file and the appear-
ance of the experts as videos, and provide a link to a forum so that other people
concerned can make comments.

   In principle, a journalist operating in convergent media must continuously
decide in favor of or against options within three new degrees of freedom:

   · Paradigmatic variants offer "more of the same" on request, such as more
       background information or more comments from those involved (e.g.
       from blogs).

   · Syntagmatic variants disclose what happens before and after what is lin-
       early accessible; for example, the whole expert interview from which the
       journalist extracted only a single statement to incorporate into the media
       item.

   · Navigational variants make it easier for users to skip or steer directly to
       certain parts of media items and thus to determine their own paths to
       gather the information they want.

   · Every media item can be supplied with such a score. Journalists who
       master this universal tool of preparing media dramaturgy can design
       more clearly organized items, switch between media more easily, and ex-
       ploit the strengths of all media more flexibly. Since complex production
       processes in journalism are increasingly based on division of labor, scores
       with many voices should be played ensemble, not solo.

                                                                                                391

       SUCCESS FACTOR TWO: WORKING TOGETHER

         Media convergent journalism is not for lone fighters. Almost no one
can do everything perfectly, not in a single medium and most definitely not in
multimedia settings. In the practice of leading media, successful convergence
means a balanced and orchestrated interplay of professionals, each of whom
brilliantly solves parts of the multimedia production task:

    · shaping dramaturgical profiles that position one's own media product
         on the market, make it stand out, and distinguish it from the rest

    · finding and delimiting topics, doing the necessary research, providing
         raw materials, and incorporating contributions from the audience

    · preparing parts of the item to be read, listened to, or watched, as
         complementary voices of a multimedia score (see above)

    · allocating assignments and bundling the results, so that the most suit-
         able topics and dramaturgy run on all the right channels

    · systematically updating and linking new media offers, indexing items
         for internal databases and for searches by users.

   Multimedia assignment editors act as directors, conductors, and co-compos-
ers of such text scores. They allocate assignments to small teams and consolidate
the results. Multimedia reporters work off-site, collecting morsels of informa-
tion for all channels (e.g. still images, moving pictures, sounds, quotations).

   In between, though, editors operate in familiar and new roles, using their
knowledge of the topic, dramaturgical skill, their own material and that of oth-
ers, and their media channels to create appealing, relevant, topical, and self-
contained stories that will be retrievable on the net anywhere and anytime. They
remain responsible for research, preparation, and maintenance way past the day
the stories are published.

   In this game, those who work well with others survive, because they are
strong in their own fields and on the interfaces between their fields and those of
their colleagues. This much is already clear. However, it is also clear--based on
experience--that truly new things are still to come.

                SUCCESS FACTOR THREE: FINDING
                        EMERGENT SOLUTIONS

   It took decades until serialized chronicles became independent news reports,
until newspapers read aloud became listener-friendly radio, and until filmed
radio became visually-interesting television. It might take further decades until

392
           Zurich University of Applied Sciences and Zurich University of the Arts (Switzerland)

a repertoire of dramaturgical patterns for journalistic items in convergent media
can be developed and consolidated in daily editorial practice.

    Such new patterns come into being emergently: the new whole is then
more than the sum of its parts (O'Grady, in press). For journalistic writing
this means that a successful item in digital space is more than just the additive
mix of writing, sound, pictures, and interactiveness. It surpasses the accumu-
lated advantages of its components with a fundamentally new quality. Such
emergence, though, requires ideas, coincidences, courage to try things out, hu-
mility to learn, and, of course, time. Dramaturgy takes much longer to mature
than technology does.

    Anyone entering journalism today, wanting to stay in the field, or even
educating and assessing new journalists should seize the opportunity of the
present uncertainty and develop forms that exploit the added value of inte-
grated media. An example of how to assess all three factors crucial for writing
in convergent media will be presented using the case of a collaborative writing
course, Text analysis and text production, in an MA program for arts journal-
ists (who cover and critique music, literature, film, architecture, etc.).

       COLLABORATIVE WRITING ON ALL CHANNELS:
             TRAINING THE MULTIMEDIA MINDSET

   Text analysis and text production is one module of the Arts Journalism MA
program that two Zurich universities (Zurich University of Applied Sciences
and the Zurich University of the Arts) set up together for about 12 selected stu-
dents per year (http://mae.zhdk.ch/).1 The students come from Switzerland and
other countries, but all speak German, as the courses are held in that language.
The module described here prepares them to be journalists (online, print, radio,
television) or PR-managers focusing on cultural issues.

   It is in this module that attitudes, knowledge, and skills of journalistic writing
are systematically reflected upon and taught. The Text analysis and text produc-
tion module comprises fourteen full days spread over two semesters (Figure 2).

   The first eleven days of the module are one-day workshops. Each workshop
begins with a short theoretical block, followed by text analysis of case studies
and collaborative text production as group assignments. The workshops end
with a joint evaluation. During optional evening tutorials, students can receive
feedback about their individual text products.

   The workshops cover first the interplay of writing process, text product, and
optimization (days 1 to 3); then micro- and macro-processes such as title and

                                                                                                393

communication design (days 4 to 5); and exemplary aspects of text structure,
function, and environment (days 6 to 11). The last three days of the module
(12 to 14) are left for integration workshops with a single assessed assignment,
which, at the same time, is the showcase for the module.

   In the three integration workshops, each two weeks apart, the students pro-
duce a special section for the Swiss architecture magazine Hochparterre, with
about ten items on the topic Emotion in architecture. The section is published
on multiple platforms: the print version of Hochparterre and their multime-
dia website http://www.hochparterre.ch as well as the didactically-motivated,
experimental website http://www.redaktionzukunft.de ("redaktionzukunft"
means "newsroom of the future"). The first integration workshop focuses on con-
ceptualization, the second on realization, and the third on evaluation.

   · In the first integration workshop, the students decide in workgroups and
       in plenary how to approach the assignment as a group and individually.
       The workgroups start with input they have prepared during the preced-
       ing weeks: group 1 with media management, group 2 with text design,
       group 3 with the journalistic profile of the special section. Moreover, all
       the students present their individual approaches to the topic Emotion in

394
           Zurich University of Applied Sciences and Zurich University of the Arts (Switzerland)

       architecture and outline what they would like to say as individual authors.
       Later on that day, the students align the ideas of the workgroups with the
       individual journalistic visions. They decide on and assign responsibilities
       and steps in the production process, on the profile of the product, and
       on the tasks each author has to accomplish.
   · The second integration workshop focuses on the realization of the Ho-
       chparterre project. The students as individual authors or as members of
       the production team get advice on demand from the module leaders,
       who act as external advisors at this stage of the project--rather than as
       teachers, as in the previous workshops, or as assessors, which they will be
       in the last integration workshop. Before this final day of the module, the
       students submit the special section along with a writing diary in which
       they describe and reflect on their iterative learning process.
   · The third and last integration workshop--which is the last day of the en-
       tire Text analysis and text production module--focuses on the evaluation
       of the Hochparterre project. Together, the module leaders and students
       evaluate what the entire project group, the three workgroups, and the
       individual authors have produced. This evaluation is presented in more
       detail below.

          COLLABORATIVE EVALUATION: ASSESSING
                    THE MULTIMEDIA MINDSET

   How should the students' multimedia mindset, their ability to recognize the
success factors in their collaborative production of the Hochparterre special sec-
tion best be evaluated? In order to grapple with this complex issue of evaluation,
we consider outcomes from three levels of text production: on the conceptual-
ization level, the input from the three workgroups to the entire product group;
on the realization level, the reflections on the iterative process of writing and
learning that are recorded in the writing diaries; and on the product level, the
individual texts and the entire special section.

   An interdisciplinary group evaluates these outcomes: one is an expert in
convergent media, one in conceptualization of communication, and one in
writing processes. These three experts are the main leaders of the Text analysis
and text production module. The other experts are the students themselves:
they are experts in their own processes of learning. First, the module leaders
agree on a grade for each of the evaluated outcomes and the students do the
same. Then, the averages of the two groups' evaluations determine the final
grades for each outcome.

                                                                                                395

   The grades for the writing diaries and the individual texts apply to the in-
dividual students, whereas the grades for collaborative outcomes such as the
group input or the entire special section apply for the respective groups. Thus, a
grade of A for the text design input means an A for all the members of the text

design workgroup, a B for an individual text or writing diary results in a B for
that student, a C for the final special section results in a C for all of the students.
The average of these three grades is the final grade for the module.

   The reflections and discussions preceding the grading are based on a shared
set of criteria. The set operationalizes the multimedia mindset and the success
factors on a practical level of writing strategies and practices (see Figure 3, cf.
Perrin, 2003; Perrin & Ehrensberger-Dow, 2008; Perrin, 2009 in press). For
instance, the success factor of collaboration is operationalized as defining the
task, implementing the product, and handling the social environment.

    The following example illustrates the interplay of journalistic strategies
and practices on the product level (e.g., finding the sources) and the process
level (e.g., goal setting, formulating and handling the social environment). The
student in question practiced and reflected on this interplay during his text
production, and it was discussed in the evaluation in the last workshop as an
example of an emerging practice to stage interviews in convergent media.

    The student S.G. addressed an extraordinary topic and opted for an un-
usual format: an interview via e-mail. His topic is objectophilia, the intimate
love a human feels for inanimate objects, in this case for the Twin Towers in
New York. In his writing diary, the student reflected on the risks of his inter-
view format:

         Given that my focus was clearly on one case, specifically a
         single individual, I only considered two genres as possibili-
         ties: an interview or a profile. Since Sandro told me early
         on that he did not want to talk to me on the phone or meet
         with me, I decided on an e-mail interview--although I was
         aware of the inherent difficulties of this. (Translated from the
         original German diary entry.)

   S.G. dedicated particular attention to the dramaturgy: "The first question
has to set the tone, no unnecessary shifts, smooth transitions, space to rearrange
things and delete bits . . . it's all about overcoming the deficiencies of an imper-
sonal interview" (translated from the original German diary entry). In addition,
S.G. edited and streamlined the answers of the interviewee linguistically (e.g.,
by eliminating redundancies). This procedure is common for transforming spo-
ken interviews into writing, although wide segments of the audience and even
authors are probably not aware of it.

   In the discussion with the group, S.G. proposed a paradigmatic variant
(see Figure 1) to make such staging procedures visible for the audience: readers
would be able to access the literal transcription of the spoken interview behind
the edited written text. The raw material would shimmer through the elegant fi-
nal product--a variant of the interview genre inspired by the particularities and
novelty of media convergence. A new solution for an old journalistic problem
emerged from conflicting demands and the possibilities of convergent media.

   To sum up, this way of assessing such programs shows that:
   · students and experts differ only slightly in their grades
   · students profit from the discussions during self-assessment when they

       reflect as a group on what they have produced individually and collab-
       oratively and what they have reflected on in their writing diaries
   · multimedia mindsets can be assessed through this multilevel and multi-
       perspective procedure systematically, explicitly, and convincingly for all
       parties involved.
   Shaping the multimedia mindset with such assessments, workshops, and
programs is what is required in the present professional environment. Conver-
gent media challenge and enable us to come up with new solutions. Channels
of distribution are becoming almost free of charge on the net: everything is
everywhere. Branding in the media business results primarily from journalistic
performance and audience design and from strong teams capable of writing for
all channels with courage and openness for collaborative emergent solutions.
Journalists who are fit in these areas will ensure the success of journalistic media.

THE PLACE OF WRITING

IN TRANSLATION: FROM

LINGUISTIC CRAFTSMANSHIP

TO MULTILINGUAL TEXT

PRODUCTION

By Otto Kruse
Zurich University of Applied Sciences (Switzerland)

The School of Translation at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences
is one of two Swiss institutions educating translators. The contribution
describes the institute's literacy conception and the changes from lin-
guistic parallelism to a model of multilingual literacy in which many
forms of language interactions are reflected, not only translation. A first
year writing program has been created that provides a variety of writ-
ing tasks focused on genre use in different domains (literary, academic,
professional, and journalistic). The program places a strong emphasis
on the connection of writing with linguistic knowledge acquired in the
other parts of the study program. While the first part of the course may
be characterized as genre training, the second one is devoted to creativ-
ity work leading to a group product in the form of a conjoint dossier.
The program builds on a process approach, uses electronic portfolios,
and places a strong weight on self-directed group activity. It is taught
in three languages parallel.

          THE INSTITUTION AND ITS GEOGRAPHIC,
            CULTURAL, AND ECONOMIC FEATURES

   The Zurich University of Applied Sciences ZHAW was founded in 1998
as an amalgamation of the once separate schools of business, architecture, en-
gineering, facility management, and translation. As a result of this merger the
schools acquired university status, not only providing them with generous state

funding but also extending their mandate to include research and continuing
education alongside teaching. The legal framework for this development was
provided by a federal law introducing the new type of a university of applied
sciences in addition to the traditional universities. As a consequence, the for-
merly independent schools became departments of the new university, within
which various institutes and competence centers were founded. The former
School of Translation thus became the new Institute of Translation and In-
terpretation within the Department of Applied Linguistics. One of the newly
founded competence centers within the Department was the Center for Profes-
sional Writing.

   In the transition period from a vocational school to a university, faculty had
to react to several challenges. They had to cope with the new standards of aca-
demic teaching and had to re-engineer the curriculum in accordance with the
new laws of the Canton Zurich as well as within the framework of the Bologna
Process that Switzerland had joined. Connected with this change was a reduc-
tion of the length of the study program from four to three years, which actually
meant that the compulsory one-year period of study abroad had to be cancelled.
Another change that had to be coped with was the transition from a collective
leadership system to a hierarchical one, as required by Swiss law. Management
became more flexible, albeit at the expense of transparency and collegiality in
decision making.

   Adaptation to the standards of university teaching demanded that the
school-like teaching and learning procedures had to be changed to more in-
dependent, self-directed learning, which included seminar teaching, project-
oriented learning, and thesis writing. These changes, however, were introduced
in a tentative step-by-step process, as the guidelines for the reform process were
anything but well defined. Research-oriented teaching and learning was one
of the clear requirements imposed, but it was left up to the schools to find the
discipline-specific ways of implementing this.

   This new type of applied university proved to be very successful in Swit-
zerland. Student numbers were and are still rising, and study programs were
able to become highly selective. In 2007, new departments of Health, Applied
Psychology, and Social Work were introduced. Today, the ZHAW hosts nearly
6,000 students and about 40 study programs at the bachelor and master level.

   The cultural context of the School of Interpretation and Translation cannot
be properly understood without considering the language situation of Swit-
zerland. There are four national languages, French, German, Italian, and Ro-
mansh, each with a different weight. The dominant language, German, is spo-
ken by about two-thirds of the Swiss population, French by about 20%, Italian
by 6.6% and Romansh by only .5%.

   All four languages are anchored in defined language regions and every can-
ton has one or two official languages. Only a minority of cantons are factually
bi- or multilingual (Wallis, Graubünden) and only some cities along the Ger-
man/ French border are bilingual (Biel/Bienne, Freiburg/Fribourg). The public
impact of the dominant languages German and French, however, is higher than
that of the smaller languages, which seems to be the fate of all minority lan-
guages. This unbalanced situation has given language politics a high priority in
Switzerland, which, throughout its history, has managed to prevent "language
wars" by taking care to prevent the open dominance of one language over the
others. This defensive attitude, however, led to multilingualism being consid-
ered something of a burden that blocks national unity. Only recently has the
seeming disadvantage of multilingualism turned into an advantage for Switzer-
land as an economic and educational location (Dürrmüller, 1996).

   Today, English is considered a fifth, unofficial national language, being used
in the economy, tourism and higher education. In several cantons, English has
now replaced one of the national languages as the first foreign language at school.
Alongside English, many other languages are also present as a result of the high
numbers of foreigners (20%) in Switzerland. The long tradition of well-man-
aged multilingualism makes Switzerland an interesting model for the study of
cultural differences in education. Multilingualism, however, does not mean that
translation is obsolete. Quite the opposite is true. All public documents have
to be translated into several other languages and the web sites of public institu-
tions and business enterprises are usually maintained in three or four languages.
This situation provides an excellent labour market for translators.

                  LITERACY AND WRITING IN THE
                 TRANSLATION STUDY PROGRAM

   The significance of literacy in a translation study program has received little
attention, in spite of the obviously close connection between the two. Thinking
in translation studies has a long tradition of stressing the independence of lan-
guages and the respective national or regional cultures. Translators are seen as
mediators between these cultures; they need excellent knowledge and language
skills in each. Both language skills and cultural studies are traditionally the
main subjects of translation study programs. Even if translation is considered
one of the oldest professions pursued by mankind, translation has only recently
become a discipline in its own right (Snell-Hornby, 1988).

   Before the School of Translation was remodeled, the objectives of the study
program were mainly defined in terms of professional language and translation

                                                                                                403

skills. Students had to acquire proficiency in two or three foreign languages
(L2-L4) and received intensive training in translating from each of their foreign
languages into their mother tongue and from their mother tongue into their
first foreign language. "Literacy" in the study program was implicitly defined as
linguistic knowledge and language proficiency.

   Today, this has changed in several ways. First, all students are required to at-
tain proficiency level (C2) in English, no matter which L2 and L3 they choose.
Second, translation is now mainly seen in the framework of a communica-
tion model. Language skills are now seen as part of communication processes
within/ between cultural systems or professional environments. To meet these
communicative and professional demands, three specialisations have been re-
cently defined:

   · Multimodal communication: Management of the intercultural and in-
       terlingual transfer of information with different media

   · Multilingual communication: Management of multilingual settings in
       business, education or culture

   · Technical communication: Management and translation of technical
       content in multilingual fields.

   Literacy is now seen as a matter of language use in social and institutional
contexts instead of a matter of "pure" language skills. There is also a shift from
a model of distinct, language-specific literacies to a model of multilingual
literacy, in which the co-existence of different languages with their corre-
spondent language practices is seen as the norm for individuals as well as for
communities.

   Although students still receive intensive language training separately in their
own languages, courses with comparative approaches have also recently been
included, such as one in comparative text analysis. Translation is usually per-
formed from L2 and L3 to L1. Students do have to write, however, also in their
L2 and L3 classes, at least for the purpose of language learning, and may, for the
same reason, also translate from L1 to L2.

   WHAT DO "LITERACY" AND ESPECIALLY "WRITING"
              MEAN TO STUDENTS AND TEACHERS?

   That writing is part of translation or--even more--that translation is a writ-
ing profession, was always taken as a fact, but a fact not rooted in a writing or
literacy theory. The only course connected to writing on the translation pro-
gramme was "Text Redaktion," a course that taught text revision skills based
on linguistic knowledge about grammar, text linguistics and style. "Text Redak-

404

tion" seemed to be the natural domain of translators' literacy, as they do not
usually have to concern themselves with the first stages of the writing process:
planning, the creation of ideas, text structuring, etc. In translation, the ideas,
structure, audience, etc., are already in place and it therefore seemed unneces-
sary to teach them--in other words to make students actually work on their
own texts. Consequently, the main kind of writing students had to perform
was writing translations of published texts. The second was writing as a means
of learning foreign language. The third form of writing consisted of the final
thesis, an extended translation with annotations.

   The kind of literacy standards typical for translation students was their high
proficiency in two or three foreign languages and their highly developed re-
flective abilities in their mother tongue, principally in all normative aspects of
language use. On the other hand, students had hardly ever written a text of their
own beyond the school level. Finding ideas, structuring a text, expressing their
own point of view, connecting to the texts of others, etc., were not required and
never taught. In a writing workshop with translators, all of them alumni from
the school of translation, I learned that they found even the most basic kinds of
narrative or argumentative texts hard to write. They were skilled in producing
perfect translations and delivering them in an accurate, error-free state to their
clients. But they were not used to developing their own ideas or to writing as a
means of communication. Literacy in the translation study programme meant
educating language specialists (in several languages) without giving them their
own voice or making them the authors.

   Used to teaching academic writing in the sciences and social sciences of Ger-
man universities (in which writing is traditionally a core element of teaching),
I found that teaching writing to translation students posed a whole set of new
challenges. When I taught my first writing course in this programme, I did not
know how to legitimize writing and I did not know which genres to teach. The
students expected to learn about correct writing, which meant polishing the
surface until it shines. Language correctness was the dominant criteria for all
kinds of student performance on this study programme. The focus on the writ-
ing process and on writing creativity which I initially offered did not seem to
contribute substantially to this.

   Moreover, I noticed that for students specializing in language skills a writing
course that does not relate to their previously acquired knowledge of grammar,
style, rhetoric, text analysis, etc., must indeed feel empty. For them, it is im-
portant to use writing not only as a means of producing some kind of message,
but also as a way of integrating their different kinds of language skills. Creative
writing exercises were especially hard for them to understand, as creative exer-
cises often displace the writer from language norms in favor of enhanced expres-

                                                                                                405
Kruse

siveness. I had to find a way of teaching writing that connected their quest for
correctness with my ideals of process and creativity.

   A third obstacle to introducing writing to the translation programme was
the choice of the domain. Teaching writing at university level, as I had done
before, meant teaching academic writing. Was this what translation students
needed? Academic writing was important for theses and seminar papers, but as
long as these were not an integral part of the curriculum, academic writing was
not really needed. In addition, the writing competences of translators cannot
easily be tied to a single domain. Translators need to be highly qualified as text
specialists in different domains like business and law, technical writing, journal-
ism, etc. It seemed impossible to prepare them in their core domain as this is
done, for instance, on journalism study programmes, where students receive
training in the dominant genres of news reports, comments, columns, features,
or reportages. Focusing on the genres of a single domain would not apply to
translators. They have to become generalists, able to understand and reproduce
a great number of genres--that cannot be specified exhaustively. They need
the skill to explore genres and genre systems in several domains and in several
languages. This demands meta-linguistic abilities that do not follow the usual
learning process of mastering genres, but need a deeper understanding of what
genres are and how they may be examined.

     WHERE AND WHAT DO STUDENTS WRITE IN OUR
  INSTITUTION - DISCIPLINES, GENRES, ASSIGNMENTS?

   The transformation to a research-oriented institution with its respective
teaching methods resulted in new developments, of which the following are
worth mentioning:

   · Research-oriented teaching: University teaching and learning demands a
       closer interconnection of teaching and research. This not only represent-
       ed a change for the faculty, who were encouraged to carry out research
       projects themselves, but also for teaching, with translation no longer be-
       ing considered simply a craft but a discipline comprising its own body
       of knowledge based on translation research. As a consequence, seminars
       were introduced to teach research skills.

   · More self-directed learning: A second demand was the change from a
       school-like teaching arrangement to one with more student responsibil-
       ity and self-directed learning. Less teaching in class and more indepen-
       dent work were required. In many classes, writing became the dominant
       mode of learning, for instance in translation projects, and of assessment,

406
                                                   Zurich University of Applied Sciences (Switzerland)

       where papers replaced multiple choice or gap-filling tests. Translation
       projects replaced translation exercises as the dominant form of learning.
   · Bachelor thesis: The introduction of a bachelor thesis as a requirement
       for graduation started a long debate not only about the kind of writing
       expected but also about the kind of preparation necessary during the
       study programme. The thesis traditionally required was more a dem-
       onstration of craftsmanship than of the ability to understand ways in
       which the discipline creates knowledge. By contrast, the new bachelor
       thesis calls for a contribution to translation studies or to any of the other
       disciplines involved in the study programme. The introduction of the
       bachelor thesis made it necessary to offer seminars where students can
       learn what research means and how it is done.

 WHO IN OUR INSTITUTION "CARES" ABOUT STUDENT
  GROWTH IN AND THROUGH WRITING? HOW IS THIS

      CONCERN--OR ITS LACK--SHOWN IN FUNDING,
          REQUIREMENTS, ATTITUDES AND ACTION?

   The ZHAW Centre for Professional Writing was founded as a centre of
excellence for research and continuing education. Coordinating writing within
the study programme or providing tutoring for students has never been its mis-
sion. Plans for a student writing centre were discussed but were not realised,
mainly for financial reasons. There is no lack of concern about writing, as writ-
ing is now a well-established field of teaching and learning, but the responsibil-
ity for student writing rested with the study programme directors and was not
passed on to a writing centre.

   The members of the Centre for Professional Writing were asked to add sev-
eral new writing courses to the curriculum. Innovation came not only from the
Centre itself but also from the other divisions, especially the English section,
which soon used a variety of writing assignments in their courses. The different
kinds of writing, however, were never co-ordinated.

   Writing was introduced to the study program mainly by inviting the Centre
for Professional Writing to offer writing courses. The first course was a two-
semester offering on academic writing for the second-year-students, which
was initiated in 2006. In groups of twenty, students were first introduced to
the principles of academic writing and then, in the second semester, wrote a
research-based paper in groups of four. In addition to the author, Gerd Bräuer
and Michaela Baumann were involved in this course. After the second run it was
decided to change this course to a research-oriented seminar in which writing

                                                                                                407
Kruse

instruction was reduced in favor of content. The first half of the course now fol-
lows the traditional way of seminar teaching, introducing students to a research
field before making them, in the second half, choose their own topic and carry
out a small research project. The second part consists basically of one-to-one
tutoring of the students, directing their research and their writing processes.
The course was no longer carried out by writing teachers but by faculty who,
in turn, were able to develop their own skills in teaching research and writing.

   A second innovation was the introduction of a new kick-off procedure for
the bachelor thesis. Instead of leaving the students to choose a topic and a person
to guide their writing process on an individual basis, a study week is organised
in which faculty are invited to present their research fields and students asked
to choose one of these as the subject of their own thesis. During this week, stu-
dents have the opportunity to attend several workshops on methodology and to
participate in colloquia and consultations with their future supervisors. At the
end of the week, they submit a proposal for their thesis, which is then discussed
with the supervisor. The third innovation was the construction of a new first-
year introductory writing course to better support the transition from school to
disciplinary writing. This course will be described in detail below.

   WHEN AND HOW HAVE GROUPS OF TEACHERS MET
     TO DISCUSS AND PLAN WAYS TO HELP STUDENTS

          GROW AS WRITERS? WHAT HAS RESULTED?

   The groups which discussed the writing issue consisted of those persons
with the mandate to offer writing courses. To provide students with a learning-
to-write experience specific to translation studies, a new course was designed
for the first-year students. The course was to be offered for German-, French-
and Italian-speaking students in their respective L1s. A group of five teachers
developed the course in close coordination with the head of the study pro-
gramme. In addition to myself, those involved were Michaela Baumann, Gerd
Bräuer (both German), Vittorio Panicara (Italian), Christian Treffort (French)
and Gary Massey (study programme director). The writing course that resulted
from this collaboration is specially designed to meet the needs of a translation
study programme (see Figure 1).

   Three things were initially decided upon:
   · The course was designed to give students enough time to take part in

       self-directed learning and to prevent school-like teaching. We therefore
       agreed to give lessons only every third week (in groups of 20) and have
       students work in small groups (of five participants each) in the two re-

       maining weeks. After the first run, however, we changed this to a two-
       week rhythm, thus alternating classroom and small-group learning.
   · Process-oriented teaching was used as the focus of the first semester, al-
       though this was interlinked with the teaching of genre norms and genre
       forms. This, we hoped, would help bridge the gap between writing and
       the linguistic or translation courses elsewhere in the curriculum.
   · The course was to be genre-oriented in the first half and directed towards
       creative products in the second. The genre-oriented part was managed
       by means of an electronic portfolio. The creative product submitted after
       the second part was to be a "dossier," a collection of texts on a defined
       topic suited to the use of certain media (a brochure, newspaper, web site,
       etc.) and selected by the students themselves. Each student has to con-
       tribute at least two personally signed texts to this dossier.
   In the first half of the course, the learning platform provides individual elec-
tronic portfolios, which here is defined as a forum to which students can upload
their texts. They are encouraged to upload several versions of any text they write
during the course. After one semester, students have usually posted between 15
and 25 texts to their portfolios, most of them in different versions and most of
them commented on by their fellow students. Feedback is first provided in the
small-group sessions and later, in electronic form, on the learning platform.

   The first half of the course principally takes the form of genre training. A
four-hour block is assigned to this every two weeks. Each block is usually de-
voted to introducing a domain (academic writing, creative writing, journalism,
rhetoric) and certain genres (or genre families), together with some model texts,
and to setting a defined writing assignment. All questions arising from the as-
signment and all theoretical issues can be discussed in the autonomous student
groups. All written texts are instantly posted to the portfolios so that the lec-
turer can read them and respond to them before the next lesson. In this way,
students are immediately informed about their products and given feedback
on the level of comprehension they have achieved. Every training block begins
with collective or individual feedback on the texts submitted. As seven 4-hour
blocks are available, some of the trainings blocks are extended over six or even
eight hours.

                                    Block 1

   Introduction, process-oriented writing and feedback: This part gives stu-
dents the chance to reflect on what writing at school is and what they have
learned there, and to contrast this with their new tasks at university. It also
contains an exercise in which they write a text in several steps, proceeding from
the initial idea to structuring, drafting, receiving feedback and revising (a proce-
dure taken from Ruhmann, 1997). This allows a discussion of relevant process
aspects of writing to take place. In the last part of this four-hour block, students
are instructed in the use of the learning platform and in the tasks they must
perform in their small groups. The instructions for small-group work are very
detailed at first, with students successively being given increasing autonomy
(and responsibility) in organising their group sessions.

                                    Block 2

   Narrative approaches: In the second block, students have to write an in-
dividual "literacy biography," exploring their family literacies, a procedure we
have borrowed from Foster (2006, pp. 142 ff.). As an experience in creativity,
they write a five-minute narrative text on a picture (from Allen, 1997) and
then record a scene from their own experience of literacy or from a fictional
story. This is supposed to introduce them to a few basic issues of creative writ-
ing: introducing characters, writing with all the senses, creating a setting, etc.
The second teaching block is also used to introduce them to feedback and to
increase their motivation to revise texts.

                                    Block 3

   Knowledge reproduction: Writing summaries and reflecting on knowledge
constitutes the third block. Students are briefly introduced to the specifics of
academic writing and the necessity of reproducing other texts. They perform an
exercise in class called "text reproduction in slow motion," in which they reduce
a text to its core elements and write their summaries on the basis of these (the
procedure is described in Kruse & Ruhmann, 1999). This procedure allows
all questions about quoting, understanding texts, reproducing texts, plagiarism
and writing discursive texts to be discussed

                                    Block 4

   Argumentation: Writing arguments and critical essays is the focus here.
Students are introduced to the traditions of rhetoric and the importance of
argumentation. They are introduced to argumentation theory on the basis
of a model provided by Booth et al. The text they write is a Plädoyer (a genre
that has no exact correspondance in English; it might be translated best as
"plea," an open text form that allows one to speak in favor of or against a
statement).

                                    Block 5

   Journalism: Writing news reports and commentaries. The last block intro-
duces journalism as a field of writing with highly regulated text norms. Partici-
pants learn to understand several journalistic genres like the news report, com-
mentary, squib, and column, and have to produce a report and a commentary.

   The second part of the course is mainly directed towards looking at text sys-
tems and at texts in context. The topics for their classes are as follows:

                                    Block 1

   Introduction to the course programme and to the task to be performed.
The dossier they are to produce is explained and they are instructed that they
can write on anything that is connected to writing or language and to our
university. They may, for instance, write a dossier on writing in architecture,
on foreign students studying at our university, or on the travel experiences of
students going abroad. They receive some information on group creativity and
use a brainstorming procedure to develop initial ideas.

                                                                                                411
Kruse

                                    Block 2

   Each group prepares a presentation about the first ideas they have generated
for their dossier. They are encouraged to visualise their ideas in order to opti-
mise their understanding and subsequent discussion of them.

                                    Block 3

   Each group prepares a presentation about the most important genres in their
dossier. They are instructed to look for descriptions or linguistic studies of the
genre, to collect some good examples and to explain how the genre "works."
Typical genres used for presentations are interviews, instructions, commentar-
ies, overviews, introductions, summaries, reports, reportages, various narratives,
satire and parody.

                                    Block 4

         Each group presents its first texts and receives feedback on them. The
relationship between the texts and their context (dossier, media) is discussed.
Issues of stance, voice and audience are discussed.

                                    Block 5

   Again, an integrated concept is presented (either in consultations with the
supervisor or in plenary sessions with the other groups). Issues of structure,
cohesion, media-specificity and text quality are discussed.

       ON WHAT MODELS, THEORIES, AUTHORS AND
PRINCIPLES HAVE COURSES OR METHODS BEEN BASED?

   The principles the course is based on are manifold. The general directive was
to create a space open to imparting new experiences in the use of written lan-
guage. Unlike in other writing courses, we did not focus this course on a major
domain like academic, creative, journalistic, technical, legal or business writing,
but tried to use it to raise awareness of the differences among these domains.
Translators may work in any of these fields but usually specialise in one. The
most important principles the course is based on are the following:

   · Independent, self-directed learning: The course should contain a high
       degree of autonomous learning and place as much responsibility for

412
                                              Zurich University of Applied Sciences (Switzerland)

   learning success on the shoulders of the students as possible. This is a
   general prerequisite for academic learning but also the main ingredient
   of writing courses. In the German-speaking countries, the principles of
   this kind of learning in connection with writing are traditionally rooted
   in seminar teaching (Foster, 2006; Kruse 2006) and are outlined in many
   student handbooks for successful writing, such as Kruse (1994, 2007),
   Bünting, Bitterlich & Pospiech (1996), Frank, Haacke & Lahm (2007),
   Gruber, Huemer & Rheindorf (2009).
· Creativity development: As writing is always a process involving creativ-
   ity, we had to make sure that the teaching of linguistic knowledge and
   of writing creativity was kept in balance. An important aspect of writ-
   ing instruction is that students learn about keeping and breaking norms
   (see for instance Gardner, 1984, on creative writing). Writing creativity
   can develop only when text norms are not interpreted as laws. It also
   follows a developmental model of writing competence involving cogni-
   tive, aesthetic and social growth. Creativity is not an elementary or basic
   competence but an "emergent" feature that always involves a multitude
   of factors (Sternberg & Lubart, 1996, Kruse, 1997).
· Process-oriented text production: Understanding cognitive processes in
   writing and building up meta-cognitive awareness of writing are essential
   to produce effective writers. All kinds of training in writing have to be
   oriented towards integrating the sub-skills outlined in cognitive research
   and organising them in a sequential writing process that connects with
   learning, exploring and reflecting on a topic (Bräuer, 2003).
· Genre theory: We see genre as the interface between linguistics, context
   and writing. As genre is also a major field of instruction in linguistics,
   students are provided with knowledge on genres from several fields. In
   this area we rely on genre research and theory from Bazerman (1988),
   Swales (1990), Bazerman & Prior (2004) and Russell (1997).
· Collaboration and feedback: Several paedagogical theories of academic
   learning stress the importance of collaborative and learning communi-
   ties as prime factors for successful learning (Bruffee, 1999, Miller, 2003).
   Understanding feedback is the most important prerequisite for collabo-
   ration in writing. Therefore, each writing course should contain some
   training in feedback and should connect writers through feedback. In
   addition, various form of collaboration such as group work, cooperative
   writing, writing projects, etc., should be offered. The most important
   goal of the first part of the writing course is simply to make students
   publish their texts early and overcome their fears of being exposed. This
   opens their minds for feedback.

                                                                                            413

WHAT HAVE BEEN OUR INSTITUTION'S SUCCESSES AND
 FAILURES IN TEACHING WRITING/STUDENT LITERACY?

   Looking at the overall writing curriculum on the translation study pro-
gramme, it is fair to say that writing has become a central concern. It has to
be seen in the context of other innovations that needed to be introduced,
such as independent learning and research-based teaching. A special issue in
any translation programme is the presence of students with different mother
tongues as well as of bilingual students who speak several languages at a native
or near-native level. What has not yet been accomplished is a closer interrela-
tion of writing and multilingualism. At the moment, writing is still performed
separately in each language. Writing in L1 and L2 has still not been linked
with translating and multilingual publishing. The creation of such a learning
environment would be helpful not only to gain a better understanding of how
language-related literacies may be interconnected but also to develop new forms
of writing instruction.

A WRITING CENTER JOURNEY
AT SABANCI UNIVERSITY,
ISTANBUL

By Dilek Tokay
Sabanci University (Turkey)

This profile focuses on Sabanci University's [SU] Writing Center in
Istanbul, which serves the university within another unit called the
Center for Individual and Academic Development (CIAD). As the
Writing Center's institutional, societal, and international roles and
practices are reflective of its objectives in line with Sabanci University's
vision and mission, a synopsis on the university and CIAD will serve as
a prologue to closer focus on the Writing Center's work and an overall
evaluation of what has been experienced as well as what still remains
to be accomplished.

   Sabanci University's founding raison d'être and operational philosophy is
to be an innovative institution, responsive to the needs of its constituents and
society through a participatory, team-based culture where interdisciplinary in-
frastructure is the backbone to create and disseminate knowledge. Established
in 1996 by the Sabanci Foundation, the university began its first academic
year in 1999 on a state-of-the-art campus. In its twelfth year now, SU has a
total number of 3,470 students (2,836 undergraduate, 634 graduates) and 374
faculty members. The average number of students per faculty is 14, reflecting
focus on small size and close interaction, which is electronically supported by
11,812 Internet connection points. As a member of the European Foundation
for Quality Management, implementation of curriculum is in line with the
Bologna Criteria for evaluation and enrichment of learning outcomes, pursu-
ing education for all as well as lifelong learning (Sabanci University, 2011)

   SU aspires to develop competent and confident individuals, capable of inde-
pendent and critical reflection within the interdisciplinary framework of three
Faculties: Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences (FENS), Faculty of Arts
and Social Sciences (FASS), and the Faculty of Management (FMAN). For the
incoming students to meet the expectations of the university, where instruction

is in English, the School of Languages (SL) provides the Foundations Develop-
ment Year Program. As Faculty Programs are built around a blend of disciplines
that leverage scientific developments and equip students with a wide diversity of
mental tools and skills, the Center for Individual and Academic Development
(CIAD) is engaged in uplifting students' oral and written communication and
research skills. The multi-functional role of CIAD's four units, including the
Writing Center, is unique to SU among Turkish universities.

                   CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL AND
                ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT (CIAD)

   The mission of CIAD is to support and facilitate SU students' adjustment to
the uniquely participatory and interdisciplinary nature of SU. CIAD's subunits
are (1) The Writing Center and Academic Support Program; (2) Disability Ser-
vices Program; (3) Advisory System, comprising Academic Success Monitoring
and Counseling, Foundations Development Year Counseling, Peer Tutoring, &
Individual Counseling; and (4) the Course Evaluation System.

   Activities of each sub-unit provide feedback to the other subunits. For ex-
ample, through Peer Tutoring, students are directed to either the Writing Cen-
ter for their skills development needs at all levels, or to the Academic Support
Program, for remedial group activities concerning courses such as Physics or
Calculus. For better self expression, time management, or study habits, Indi-
vidual Counseling is the right address. Through the Course Evaluation System,
the SU community has access to statistical reports on course evaluations, the
types of instruction, and statistics on student satisfaction. Hence, CIAD, with a
working team of 21 persons, promotes student-faculty-administration interac-
tion for efficiency, productivity, and accessibility of methodological and peda-
gogical innovations.

      SABANCI UNIVERSITY WRITING CENTER (SUWC)

   The following synopsis of SUWC considers the Center's mission, programs,
and future plans for viability and recognition.

          Philosophy, History, and Strategies of the SUWC

   All SU Faculty Programs necessitate critical thinking and academic writ-
ing. Forms include essays, project/internship/case reports, response or research

418
                                                                               Sabanci University (Turkey)

papers, conference papers, and theses, as well as discussion-debate strategies,
impromptu talks, presentations, and interviewing techniques.

   To fulfill its goals of creating interest and establishing the concept of writing
as a discipline, SUWC encourages and assists students to become expressive,
persuasive, critical, and creative thinkers and writers both in English and Turk-
ish. It facilitates students' development throughout their education at SU with
programs focusing on Writing across the Curriculum or in the Discipline, plus
thesis preparation, helping them seek for high achievement in careers or jobs in
Turkey and abroad.

   SUWC builds students' abilities to think, write, and speak in English
through workshops, tutorials, study groups, and adjunct courses that pro-
mote student writing, by engaging them in contests, conference presenta-
tions, and publications. In these activities, sample student essays, proposals,
reports, abstracts, response papers, presentations, CV or personal statements,
and theses are used, accompanied by Essay Evaluation Checklists that serve
as benchmarks.

   In tutorials, SUWC does not proofread or edit student writers' work but
helps them learn about writing by providing lead-in questions and ample
samples in different genres, using different rhetorical styles, and initiating
care for organization, structure, layout, and format, with documentation
styles for integration of evidence as support, and citation techniques to avoid
plagiarism.

   The Writing Center has thrived within the frame of CIAD since its incep-
tion in 2000, serving the university community through five elements: (1)
Foundations Development Year, (2) Undergraduate, (3) Graduate, (4) Career
and Academic Advising, and (5) Creative Writing. By encouraging students to
pursue competence in academic discourse and contribute to local and interna-
tional networks through participating at conferences and organizing websites,
SUWC fulfills its institutional responsibilities. Top administration's support
from its groundwork until present, faculty's familiarity with the notion of Writ-
ing Centers, as well as the hard work of the Center's academic staff, have been
crucial factors in SUWC's success.

                                    Location

   Both CIAD and SUWC are conveniently located on the campus, and can
workshop up to 60 participants; it has a Study Group Studio for 10. SUWC
has access to all the SU studios for larger workshops. For the five academic staff
of SUWC and the Help Desk, six offices are well-furnished and equipped with
technology and internet.

                                                                                                419
Tokay

                                    Archives

   SUWC has its program-based materials as workshop PowerPoint hand-
outs, Study Group activity sheets, checklists, sample student outlines/essays,
portfolios, reports, conference abstracts, presentations, CV and SOP samples,
supplementary guidelines, reading lists, attendance lists, a database for statis-
tics, semester-end reports, proposals, CDs of interviews with TAs and mock
job interviews, and program leaflets. Materials are kept both electronically
and in hard copy, including feedback letters and Evaluation Checklists as
testimonials.

                                  Composition

   The five members of the SUWC academic staff have their degrees in English
Literature, Law, Archeology, Mass Media, and Public Relations. Some have ad-
ditional certificates and experience in English Language Teaching (ELT), teach-
ing of English Literature, Expository Writing or Composition, and/or have been
involved in curriculum design, materials production, and teacher training, with
8-40 years of experience per person. Throughout the years, SUWC has had a
Coordinator, a Help Desk, and two to seven assistants for office work and peer-
tutoring. The current assistants are SU Graduate Program students in Political
Science, International Relations, and Cultural Studies, with BA degrees from
universities such as Cornell, UC Berkeley, University of Chicago, University of
Florida, Boston College, and Cambridge. Two assistants are junior and senior
in SU, FENS, and FASS. Assistants' recruitment is a two-tier process: submis-
sion of CV and two essays, followed by two interviews to measure teaching and
communication skills.

                             Activities/ Programs

   The five program elements of SUWC are designed based on feedback col-
lected from students, course assistants, and faculty at meetings, study groups,
and tutorials. Each program holds six to 26 two-hour workshops with a range
of eight to 257 students (course-based) per semester. The number of appoint-
ment-based tutorials has a range of 125-882 per semester. Study group sessions
range between 16 and 77, with an attendance of 3-562 participants per semes-
ter. The number of students benefitting from any one of the SUWC services per
semester is approximately 1,700 out of SU's 3,470 student population, mostly
undergraduates.

           Foundations Development Year Program (FDYP)

   The goal of the FDYP is to support the English language development of
FDY students to ensure a smooth transition between the academic English ex-
pectations of the FDY and undergraduate programs. Although this program
promotes the growth of all interrelated English language skills, it focuses most
strongly on advancing students' academic writing abilities.

                      Undergraduate Program (UP)

   Similar to the relationships built by many established writing centers (see,
e.g., Pemberton, 1995;Thaiss & Porter, 2010; and the Gustafsson/Boström , ,
McConlogue/Mitchell/Peake, and McMillan essays in this volume), the SU-
WC's Undergraduate Program (UP) aims to strengthen students' writing skills
through Writing in the Disciplines (WID) and Writing across the Curriculum
(WAC), supporting their development as confident and effective communica-
tors, researchers, and presenters, but primarily analytical and critical readers,
thinkers, and writers with a voice. In workshops and tutorials, different strate-
gies are practiced to help participants shape and refine their writing to achieve
and maintain academic standards concerning content, organization, and format
of their written work. Activities are designed in consideration of the interdisci-
plinary nature of the curriculum.

   For example, English 101 and 102 are composed of workshops and tutorials
concerning

   · writing processes
   · rhetorical styles
   · documentation techniques
   · research papers
   · film analysis
   · book reviews
   · presentation skills
   · effective interviews
   · the Speakers' Corner
   -- all of these topics applicable in any discipline.

                            WAC Implementation

   Within the interdisciplinary context of curricula at SU, students are required
to write competently in all the courses. They are expected to write response/

                                                                                                421

research papers and essays, exam essays, case/project reports, and dissertations.
SUWC's WID workshops started at the time of its foundation in 2000, with 11
workshops that found ground for WAC with the support of faculty.

   WAC implementation is geared towards the needs of the following 15 courses,
with their inception semesters in chronological order: HUM 201 Major Works of
Western Literature (S 2002); SPS 101and102 Social and Political Sciences-Man
and Society (F 2004); SPS 303 Law and Ethics (S 2002); POLS 302 Political Sci-
ence (S 2002); HUM 203 Major Works of Ottoman Culture (S 2004), ANT 469
Writing Culture (S 2004); CULT 250 Oral History (S 2004); HUM 204 Major

PROJ 102 Report Writing for FASS, FENS, and FMAN (F 2006); HUM 214 Ma-
jor Works of the Opera (S 2009); HUM 224 Major Works of Twentieth Century
Music (S 2010), IR 201International Relations Theory (F 2010), HUM 205 Major
Works of the Cinema (S 2011). Each of these courses has one to four workshops.

   Workshop attendance is made compulsory by the faculty teaching the
course. If the times are inconvenient for the students, make-up workshops are
arranged. Among all the courses for which WAC workshops are tailored, PROJ
102 (Report Writing for FASS) has the highest attendance.

   Face-to-face tutorials are set by appointment. Each WAC tutorial is run by
the responsible person of the program or a peer-tutor. The tutorial includes two
hours of lead-in questions, attention pointers, and suggestions on the draft,
with a revised version by the end of the session. Here, the aim has always been
to make student writers "editors of their own work."

   To encourage more courses to participate in WAC, we give best attendance
awards and present facts and figures to the administration in our end-semester
reports.

   For the WAC project to turn into an institutionalized Program, concerned
faculty have made the following recommendations:

   · A University wide WAC Committee that would begin with an analysis
       of WAC programs in US universities

   · A credit course for WAC TAs
   · A credit course, Academic Writing, which could be made compulsory

       for undergraduates
   · Funding for graduate assistants that would allow us to invite PhD can-

       didates from US institutions with effective WAC training backgrounds

                          Graduate Program [GP]

   The GP facilitates the acquisition of effective research principles, sound ex-
pression in scholarly discourse, and mastery of the specific conventions related

422
                                                                               Sabanci University (Turkey)

to a graduate student's particular discipline. Such discourses include research/
course papers and assignments, theses and dissertations, journal articles for
publication, and academic correspondence, as well as conference and classroom
presentations. How the SUWC works with graduate students is in some ways
unique to Sabanci, but its commitment to graduate education is similar to that
in the Gustafsson/Boström, Solé/Teberosky/Castelló, and Thaiss/Goodman es-
says, among others, in this volume.

   All graduate students send course papers, conference publications, and pre-
sentations, as well as grant and research proposals, to the SUWC for assistance.
Writing tutorials for completion of the doctorate, proposals, and defense are also
offered. Additionally, since 2005, GP offers the FMAN 621 Modules, Writing
and Presentations for Doctoral Students. With GP support, doctoral students
have published their research in academic journals. Since 2004, all second-year
MBA students have received support in the form of individual tutorials and
workshops in writing and the presentation of the cornerstone projects of the
MBA: the Company Action Project (CAP) and the Value Added Presentations.
All CAP Projects are read by GP faculty.

           Career and Academic Advising Program [CAAP]

   The CAAP assists undergraduates and graduates in their career search as
they prepare for employment or post-graduate education in Turkey or abroad.
It provides support for graduate school and scholarship applications, intern-
ships, research, and grant proposals. Advising students in the decision-making
and application process, the program contains a pedagogical component with
workshops, study groups, and tutorials concerning preparation for standard-
ized tests--GRE, GMAT, TOEFL, IELTS--plus writing the CV and personal
statement, submitting sample papers, and practicing mock interviews. Based
on 2004-2010 data, approximately 90% of the SU graduates accepted by post-
graduate programs had used CAAP services.

                    Creative Writing Program (CWP)

   The CWP's goal is to instill a love of writing with imagination and creativ-
ity, as well as clarity; CWP encourages students to develop their own voices
and visions. The program aims to develop empathy and fosters an appreciation
for human diversity, as students engage in the process of writing short stories,
poems, personal essays, or novels. CWP has small interactive workshops and
tutorials with undergraduate and graduate students, SU administrative staff,
and the students of a foundations high school in the vicinity. The Program also

                                                                                                423

designs two contests every academic year-- one in short stories and the other
in essay writing. The action plan for the program includes inviting prominent
writers for panels, conferences, and Writing Contest Awards Ceremonies; such
contests encourage writing in different literary genres such as poetry, mini-saga,
novella, and poster design.

        Professional Development - TA/ Peer-tutor Training

   Professional Development activities occur in three categories. In Category
I, TA Classroom Management Techniques workshops for all new FASS, FENS,
and FMAN TAs, as well as SUWC assistants, are given at the SU Orientations
in mid semester and the end of each semester. In Category II, workshops for
TAs of the courses within the WAC program guide the TAs in composing writ-
ten prompts and designing rubrics for assessment of students' written work.
In Category III, we arrange group meetings for workshop and peer-tutoring
assistants for each program. These sessions range between 4 and 9 per semester
for specific strategies.

                         Evaluation and Assessment

   The SUWC contacts faculty and students prior to the start of semesters for
collection of feedback on past practices and expectations for the new programs.
Contact with the students is maintained through e-mail or when the students
drop in for feedback. The assessment of both the contents and the delivery of
workshops and tutorials is a two-tier process: first, collection of student feed-
back on Workshop and Tutorial Evaluation Checklists, and second, checking
the value added to student performance by consulting with the course instruc-
tors or TAs. Findings from this process show tremendous impact of workshops
and tutorials on student achievement. Letters of satisfaction following each ac-
tivity and letters asking for more sessions serve as testimonials shared in semes-
ter-end reports.

               Local Outreach to Secondary Education
                         and Other Organizations

   The SUWC fulfills its societal responsibilities through its linkages with sec-
ondary education and universities in Istanbul and beyond through organiz-
ing seminars and workshops. Because writing has to start at an early age and
Turkish secondary education curriculum disregards this fact, linkages with high
schools are very important to equip the teachers with methods of teaching writ-

424
                                                                               Sabanci University (Turkey)

ing. Upon institutions' requests, activities are designed to discuss needs and
curriculum design to find thematic overlaps with other courses, to tailor writ-
ing projects, and to assign meaningful class/group/home work. Strategies for
the formation of a Writing Center are recommended. Current workshops and
seminars have either continued weekly through the academic year, or have been
presented as compact three-day or one-week programs. Educators, including
administrators, have visited the SUWC to observe workshops or tutorials and
review workshop materials. An SUWC effort has been instrumental in opening
five high school and four university Writing Centers in Istanbul. More high
school Writing Centers need to be established, and care must be spent not to
let the newly-opened centers close by the change of institutions' administrators.

   To reinforce these gains, in September 2011 we held our first Summer In-
stitute for high school writing center enthusiasts. We allocated its three days
to writing pedagogy enriched with creativity and critical thinking in Turkish
courses. The institute will be followed by a series of subject-specific seminars to
encourage WAC in Turkish secondary and higher education. The institute built
on the gains of the recent SU Educational Reform Initiative Conference. 2011,
which has been exemplary in establishing linkages with the teachers involved in
Turkish secondary curricula.

   The SUWC has also had some success in stretching teaching/learning spaces
for other societal needs, as in CV and application letter writing, creative writing
for municipalities and Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs), and presen-
tation skills for the business sector.

                          International Outreach

         From the very outset of the Center, international outreach has been a
 goal--widening its scope and recognition. The SUWC has been participat-
 ing in international organizations and at conferences like INGED, EATAW,
 EWCA, IWCA, NCTE, and CCCC. Interaction of SUWC members with
 international colleagues has always been supported by SU's top administra-
 tors. SU encourages international outreach through funding because it values
 the international voice that its academic representatives gain for the univer-
 sity. As we mix with others, we add to the international common core of
 knowledge, and we then bring back what we have observed and admired as
 differences, to be shared by others at home and implemented as much as the
 circumstances allow.

   The Center has also benefited from my own active involvement as a member
of the European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EATAW)
and as Chair in 2005 of the European Writing Centers Association (EWCA).

                                                                                                425
Tokay

The International Writing Centers Association (IWCA) honored me with the
"one-time-only" Muriel Harris award in 2010 for my contributions to the
organization.

   Collegial ties established at conferences and strengthened through network-
ing have brought SUWC prominent visitors from Turkey and abroad during
the years 2004-2011. EWCA Chairs and Board members, the past CCCC and
IWCA Chairs, Writing Center Directors from Europe and the US, and many
international professors have enhanced professional sharing at the events de-
signed by the SUWC in Istanbul, conveying their ideas for new action plans to
others during their visits.

   Networking through websites has additionally provided a professional me-
dium for the discussion of effective teaching-learning strategies in writing cen-
ters. For example. since 2003, the SUWC website has had 290,334 unique
visits and the EWCA website 199,151 (as of June 14, 2011). (See http://www.
sabanciuniv.edu/writingcenter and http://www.ewca.sabanciuniv.edu.

                                 Expectations

   The SUWC's growth in the past eleven years reflects the support by the
university's administration. Keeping SUWC networked with an international
audience is important, and so professional development of the staff through
conference participation needs to be encouraged with funding. To establish fur-
ther linkages with secondary and higher education, we need to recruit a techni-
cal staff to keep SUWC's homepage current and make it interactive, with links
to other program websites and an online SUWC newsletter. In the tradition of
electronic outreach by writing centers (e.g., Inman & Sewell, 2000; Thomas
et al., 1998), we are also aiming to start an on-line service to set up tutorial
appointments.

   Such new initiatives as the online newsletter and the scheduled summer in-
stitute bring hope for the SUWC to carry on as even a better address in Turkey
for promoting dialogue in the international writing community.

WRITING PROGRAMS

WORLDWIDE: PROFILE OF THE

AMERICAN UNIVERSITY OF

SHARJAH (AUS)

By Lynne Ronesi
American University of Sharjah (United Arab Emirates)

The American University of Sharjah (AUS) is a primarily under-
graduate institution located in the emirate of Sharjah, in the United
Arab Emirates, and accredited by the Commission on Higher Educa-
tion of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. AUS is
an English-medium, co-educational, and culturally-diverse university
that employs a traditional (US model) writing curriculum with a
freshman writing sequence and a second-year English course dedicated
to the communication needs of a field. Due mostly to a lack of exposure
to writing in secondary school, many AUS students face steep learning
curves as they try to meet the expectations of their writing courses and
of the writing assignments in other discipline courses. Supplementing
writing instruction are a well-established undergraduate-staffed Writ-
ing Center and a growing Writing Fellows program. As AUS under-
takes initiatives to develop its role in the region, the need for greater
attention to developing student writing is being highlighted.

   Sheikh Dr. Sultan has articulated the principal values that should define the
identity of AUS:

   · Science and education must regain their rightful place in the advance-
       ment of our society and in shaping the lives of our children.

   · The purpose of higher education is to reshape the minds of our youth
       in order for them to address personal and social challenges using the
       scientific method.

   · AUS must be a center of research for solving the problems faced by society.
   · AUS will have the autonomy and freedom needed to flourish as an inde-

       pendent university.

   · AUS must be organically linked with the economic, cultural and industrial
       sectors of society in productive cooperation (Vision of the Founder, 2010)

   AUS is a primarily undergraduate institution, with only 6% of enrolled
students in graduate programs. In spring 2010, 4,742 undergraduates were
enrolled: 43% in the College of Engineering; 30% in the School of Business
and Management; 16% in the College of Arts and Sciences; and 11% in the
College of Architecture and Design. During the spring 2010 semester, AUS
faculty, staff, students, and alumni were asked to rank descriptive words in or-
der to aptly describe AUS. Among the top-five ranked descriptors was "cul-
turally diverse" (Chancellor's Snapshot, May 2010). Indeed, according to the
AUS Institutional Research office, the top ten student nationalities of the 80
student nationalities represented during spring 2010 were Emirati (citizens of
the UAE), Jordanian, Egyptian, Palestinian, Syrian, Pakistani, Indian, Iranian,
Saudi Arabian, and Lebanese. Faculty members represented 49 nationalities
(Fast Facts, Spring 2010).

   This cultural diversity does not simply define AUS but can be noted through-
out the United Arab Emirates. Sharjah, the emirate in which AUS is located, is
one of the seven emirates comprising the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a large-
ly coastal country situated on the Arabian Peninsula between Saudi Arabia and
Oman. Once known as the Trucial States, the UAE gained independence from
England and achieved nationhood in 1971. At that time, due to the small num-
ber of Emiratis, the government began to hire an international labor force to
help create an infrastructure that would sustain the rapidly modernizing coun-
try. The workforce remains largely international, and English works as a lingua
franca in the UAE. In fact, while students have the option of Arabic-medium
and English-medium primary and secondary schools, all postsecondary institu-
tions in the UAE are English-medium.

   Sharjah, once known primarily for its ports and seafaring economy, receives
revenues from oil and natural gas. More recently renowned for its emphasis on
culture and learning, Sharjah was designated the Cultural Capital of the Arab
World by UNESCO in 1998. The emirate contains a number of universities, mu-
seums, galleries, theatres, and restored heritage areas--a "context [that] facilitates
the [AUS]'s intention to be an academic center at the intersection of ancient cul-
tural traditions and contemporary intellectual currents" (About Sharjah, 2010).

                       LITERACY AND WRITING

   As a university that is based on the American model, the concern for literacy
focuses most specifically on English. However, as a university in the heart of

430

the Arab world where the student body is 70% Arab, there are opportunities to
study Arabic and learn about Arab heritage. An Arabic Heritage course, which
can be taken in Arabic or in English, is a general education requirement for all
AUS students. Also, the Department of Arabic and Translation Studies offers
minors in Arabic language and literature and in English/Arabic translation, as
well as a Master of Arts degree in English/Arabic translation. In general, despite
the multicultural nature of our faculty and the fact that many speak Arabic as
a first language, AUS faculty members publish in English. This certainly can be
attributed to the effect of global English on academia; there are very few inter-
nationally recognized journals in languages other than English. At AUS, like
most American universities, decisions about contract renewal and promotion
revolve around publication in such journals.

   While there are AUS students who engage in writing with a sense of plea-
sure and take advantage of the usual university venues for writing, such as the
AUS literary magazine, student newspaper, and the annual Writing Center-
sponsored writing contest, there are many students who are apprehensive of
writing. There appears to be a variety of reasons for this trepidation; the most
immediately recognizable is the lack of attention given to writing in their pre-
collegiate schooling. Certainly, students from Arabic-medium schools often
have weak writing skills due to their lack of exposure to English. Yet, many
AUS students, even those educated in English-medium schools, begin their
freshman year without basic skills in (1) structure (i.e., thesis statement, topic
sentences, and transitions), (2) argumentation, and (3) source-based citation.
Many do not completely understand the notion of plagiarism and have not
assimilated the norms of intellectual ownership expected at an American-style
university.

   There appear to be a number of factors influencing this latter condition.
It is understood that many regional secondary schools emphasize rote learn-
ing, which results in practices such as providing written essay models for
students to memorize and re-write for evaluation purposes (Ronesi, 2009).
Moreover, many students report receiving very few writing assignments in
their pre-collegiate schooling and claim they were not taught the conventions
associated with intellectual property. Another important factor is the collec-
tivist nature of our students' societies. Collectivistic cultures, such as those in
Arab countries, value collaboration and support through established networks
over the more individualistic approach professed by North American soci-
ety (McCabe, Feghali, & Abdallah, 2008). Subsequently, it is understandable
that AUS students enjoy helping family and friends succeed and find it quite
normal to ask for such help. As such, AUS students must learn to make a
distinction between "helping behaviors" that truly help their peers (i.e., help-

                                                                                                431

ing a friend brainstorm ideas for an essay or quizzing each other on the main
ideas of a reading) and those behaviors that simply enable bad habits and lack
of learning (i.e., writing an essay for a roommate who is under time pressure,
or providing a friend homework answers). As new students grapple with as-
similating all of the new concepts they encounter, they feel that writing at the
university level is a monumental task.

   Indeed, many AUS students face an extremely steep learning curve as they
try to meet the expectations of their freshman writing courses and of the writ-
ing assignments in first-year discipline courses. Not surprisingly, with all the
cognitive, social, and emotional demands on them, many students cannot
reach academic standards for writing even after a couple of semesters. So, to
many AUS students, writing engenders discomfort and a sense of inadequacy.

   AUS follows a traditional US-model writing curriculum, with a freshman
writing sequence (covering a continuum from basic writing to argumenta-
tion to research) and a required second-year English course dedicated to the
general communication needs of a field (e.g., English for Engineers, Writing
for Business). The freshman-year sequence includes four courses, and in all of
them the development of critical thinking skills is emphasized: WRI 001 is a
developmental course devoted to academic reading and writing, contextual-
ized grammar instruction, goal setting, time management, and study skills;
WRI 101 addresses reading and writing strategies through class discussion
and formal and informal writing assignments; WRI 102 focuses on active
reading, and intensifies critical thinking and analytical writing; and ENG
204 is devoted to the construction of an argumentative research paper (Un-
dergraduate Course Descriptions, 2010). These courses comprise most of a
12-credit (four course) General Education requirement for English Language
Competency and all emphasize the writing process with peer-review and mul-
tiple drafts.

   A number of approaches have influenced the development of our writing
courses. Professor Alaanoud Abusalim, Associate Director of Writing Studies
and Curriculum Coordinator, notes that our curriculum and pedagogy draw
mostly on the following: the cognitive school (Flower, 1994; Hairston, 1982,
1994) with a process approach and focus on meta-cognitive work; the expres-
sive school (Elbow, 1998; Murray,1985) with an emphasis on free-writing,
journals, and discussion boards in an attempt to help students locate their
voice; and the social construction school (Berlin, 1996; Bizzell, 1992) which
has shaped our understanding of the cognitive, socioeconomic, and cultural
challenges our students face in becoming members of the academic discourse
community (personal communication, June 25, 2010).

   Over the years, the goals of the English Language Competency courses
have been re-aligned periodically to suit the steadily increasing proficiency of
more recent enrollees and to insure smooth flow between the courses. Place-
ment exams prior to a student's first semester determine at which level the
student begins. Most students are placed in WRI 101; for example, a typical
student majoring in Economics might place into WRI 101 followed by WRI
102, ENG 204, and ENG 225 (Writing for Business). However, it is possi-
ble--though rare--for very strong students to be placed in WRI 102 in their
first semester of their freshman year and to complete ENG 204 in their sec-
ond semester. After that, what and how much a student writes is determined
by the discipline a student chooses as a major and the pedagogical beliefs of
the various professors the student encounters. Accordingly, students who ma-
jor (or even minor) in International Studies report writing not only often but
also critically and analytically. Yet, there are some majors in which students
report relatively few writing assignments. However, it is not unusual that,
within departments where students are not asked to write much, there may
be a professor or two who bucks the trend and requires writing. Some profes-
sors believe strongly--often because of their own experiences--that writing is
extremely important to the learning process, even as they admit that requiring
writing in their classes is time-consuming and laborious. On the other hand,
some professors express that other means of assessing student learning, such
as multiple choice questions, are fairer to our students due to the potential
for cheating or plagiarizing in writing assignments. There is also the argu-
ment that poor writing skills may hinder students from demonstrating their
knowledge. Of course, this last argument highlights the need for providing
AUS students more curricular opportunities to develop their writing if they
are to graduate on an even par with cohorts in the US

               WRITING ACROSS THE UNIVERSITY

   While AUS has not instituted an official Writing across the Curriculum
(WAC) program to support writing across the university, the College of Arts
and Sciences (CAS) has generously supported the WAC endeavors of the De-
partment of Writing Studies (DWS). In 2004, an undergraduate-staffed Writ-
ing Center was established; it has been growing steadily and now has a main
location in the library and a satellite in the Language Building. The Writing
Center is a dynamic hub which, in addition to providing session-based writ-
ing support on assignments, arranges workshops on various writing issues

                                                                                                433
Ronesi

(e.g., rhetorical appeals, identifying logical fallacies, APA referencing), class-
room visits by tutors to explain the Writing Center, and class presentations
geared to specific aspects of writing as requested by professors. It has grown
steadily and is well-utilized especially by students taking writing and English
courses, but also increasingly by students in other courses. To expand Writ-
ing Center practice throughout the university and especially into classes that
had not traditionally placed much emphasis on writing, DWS began running
a Writing Fellows program in fall 2007. In conjunction, a training course
for all undergraduate peer-tutors of writing was established with the goal of
creating a coterie of students who could work in either capacity--Writing
Fellow or Writing Center tutor--or as both simultaneously. This training
course has become part of AUS curriculum and fulfills three credits of the
12-credit General Education requirement for English Language Competency
mentioned earlier.

   The Writing Center and the Writing Fellows Program are run by two differ-
ent faculty members from the Department of Writing Studies. As the Writing
Fellows Program director also recruits for and teaches the peer-tutoring class,
the two professors work closely; in fact, the Writing Center and Writing Fel-
lows program share tutors. During the course of an academic year, both profes-
sors are approached by colleagues from a variety of disciplines with questions
about course-based writing (usually assignment development or assessment ap-
proaches) and for information on the types of support their particular tutors
could lend. As AUS is not very large, word of mouth is a fairly effective means
of promoting the programs, although both promote their services in fairly tra-
ditional ways: websites, e-mail reminders to faculty and students, posters, fac-
ulty newsletter articles, and occasionally AUS-based presentations. In February
2011, both professors were co-chairs for the second annual Middle East-North
African Writing Center Association (MENAWCA) 2011 Conference held at
AUS. This event not only provided more than 200 professors and students
across the region a venue for discussion and learning, but also enlightened AUS
about its own WAC endeavors.

   It is fair to say there is interest and concern at many levels--from adminis-
tration to faculty to students--about insuring that students have more curricu-
lar opportunities to develop their writing. From my vantage point, it is hard to
determine what official route that interest and concern might take. AUS's rela-
tively new and dynamic chancellor has begun to underscore the need for devel-
oping more of a research culture at the university, particularly locally-oriented
research, and research that enhances the undergraduate experience. In addition,
there has been a great deal of self-study at AUS with regard to promoting a cul-
ture of academic integrity. To the extent that I have been involved, discussions

434
                                               American University of Sharjah (United Arab Emirates)

on both these topics serve to highlight the issue of writing at the university, and
future developments in that area seem possible.

                    THE TEACHING OF WRITING:
                     IMPACTS AND CHALLENGES

   There is a strong feeling among those of us who teach writing at AUS that
the nature of our courses contributes a great deal to the success of the AUS
student. In learning to write, so much else is accomplished. In many cases,
we writing professors provide our students' first exposure to employing critical
thought to their learning and communication, as we ask them to evaluate their
understandings and assumptions in light of a scholarly approach or of mul-
tiple perspectives. We introduce students to academic integrity and intellectual
property issues and ask them to incorporate these notions into all their future
accomplishments. In our capacities as writing professors, we individualize their
learning, responding to their needs as writers, as students, as multicultural in-
dividuals learning to express their perspectives in a sensitive, principled, and
scholarly way. Not only do we affect the learning of AUS students with limited
or average proficiency in writing, but we also offer challenge and growth to
many of our stronger writers, who, as peer tutors, grow as writers and individu-
als through their service to the AUS community.

   Daily events corroborate the sense that the required AUS English Language
courses and additional WAC endeavors play a pivotal part in our student's
academic and personal growth. The following personal experiences come to
mind: a chat with a Department of Writing Studies (DWS) colleague in which
I learned that a strong writer and motivated student in my current Peer Tutor
training class started out in the developmental course, WRI 001, only three
semesters before; the student who, at the beginning of the semester, fearfully
doubted his capability to write an argumentative research paper in ENG 204,
and ultimately wrote one of the very best in the class; a student in the same
class who admitted that his initial strong beliefs about his research topic were
toppled in the light of the research evidence he uncovered; a Writing Fellow's
report that she escorted a shy student she was working with to the Writing
Center to help her make a first appointment there; and the proliferation of zany
and creative Writing Center posters created by the tutors, which clearly convey
the enthusiasm they have for their work. Events like these suggest that those
AUS professors and students involved in the craft of writing have made untold
impact on the lives of students, and that not only writing-based learning but
also a culture of writing is unfolding at AUS.

                                                                                                435

   Frustrations are fewer, but, of course, they exist: the senior who has man-
aged to postpone his writing sequence until his final year, and whose writing is
terribly undeveloped in view of his looming graduation date and the start of his
career; the colleague from another department who presents me with an upper-
level student's atrociously written paper and states that Writing and English
faculty are responsible; the students who give short shrift to writing courses
because they feel it is a useless imposition. These are all "downers" encountered
on occasion.

     THOUGHTS ON THE FUTURE OF WRITING AT AUS

   Early in the fall 2009 semester, the different departments of the university
took a retreat day for strategic planning. My department--the Department
of Writing Studies--unanimously felt that we needed to play a greater role in
promoting literacy at AUS beyond the introductory courses discussed above.
We decided in our retreat that we wanted to increase our repertoire of classes,
expand our peer-tutoring programs, and create a minor in Rhetoric and Com-
position, all goals to which we have made strides over the past months. That
departmental retreat was a truly empowering one that seems to have played a
pivotal role in galvanizing our motivation and spirit. My sense is that, while
writing education becomes more apparent through the above-mentioned de-
partmental goals, other internal and external forces will take shape that high-
light the need for attending more closely to developing student writing at AUS.

   My hope is that this attention will highlight that writing is "organically
linked with the economic, cultural and industrial sectors of society in produc-
tive cooperation" (Vision of the Founder, 2010), as part of His Highness Sheikh
Dr. Sultan Bin Mohammad Al Qassimi's vision of an education that culminates
in the culture of productivity in the United Arab Emirates.

    THE CITY UNIVERSITY OF NEW

    YORK: THE IMPLEMENTATION

    AND IMPACT OF WAC/WID IN

    A MULTI-CAMPUS U.S. URBAN

    UNIVERSITY

      By Linda Hirsch and Dennis Paoli
      Hostos Community College/CUNY and Hunter College/
      CUNY (US)

       This profile will examine the ongoing WAC initiative at the City Uni-
       versity of New York, the largest public urban higher education insti-
       tution in the US and among the most diverse in students' language
       and cultural backgrounds. The essay provides an overview of WAC at
       CUNY's 23 campuses, including description of its unique Writing Fel-
       lows program, which employs PhD candidates from across disciplines.
       The authors give special focus to the implementation and impact of
       WAC principles and practices at two campuses: Hostos Community
       College, an urban, bilingual community college located in the south
       Bronx, one of New York City's poorest neighborhoods; and Hunter Col-
       lege, a senior college in mid-Manhattan with graduate programs and
       four professional graduate schools drawing students from throughout
       the City. As WAC Coordinators who were present at the inception of
       the now ten-year CUNY Initiative, we examine the insights gleaned
       from our experiences as well as the challenges and successes of this vast
       undertaking.

   The City University of New York is the largest urban public university sys-
tem in the United States, with a mission to provide access to quality higher
education for the full range of the city's inhabitants, regardless of income, gen-
der, or ethnic background. It serves more than 480,000 students at 23 colleges
and institutions in New York City, including 11 senior colleges, six community

colleges, the Macauley Honors College, the Graduate Center, and Graduate
Schools of Journalism, Law, Professional Studies, and Public Health.

   The university serves a diverse student body representing 205 countries,
with African-American, white, and Hispanic undergraduates each comprising
more than a quarter of the student body. According to CUNY statistics, 47%
of undergraduates have a native language other than English, 41% work more
than 20 hours a week, 63% attend school full time and 15% support children.
Nearly 60% are female and 29% are 25 or older. Of first-time freshmen, 37%
were born outside the US mainland and nearly 70% attended New York City
public high schools.

   It is against this background of an urban, multi-campus, diverse student
body that CUNY sought to strengthen its students' writing proficiencies. Rec-
ognizing the vital role that writing plays both in a college education and in
future academic and professional success, the CUNY Board of Trustees passed
a resolution in 1999 establishing a CUNY-wide Writing Across the Curriculum
(WAC) Initiative, which mandated that writing instruction be a University-
wide responsibility and that writing proficiency become "a focus of the entire
undergraduate curriculum" (http://policy.cuny.edu/text/toc/btm/1999/01-25).
To bring its ambitious plan to fruition, the initiative was linked to a CUNY
Writing Fellows Program, thereby placing CUNY doctoral students on each of
the member campuses to assist in project execution.

   This chapter will examine the breadth and depth of the CUNY-wide WAC
Initiative by providing an overview of WAC at CUNY's campuses, followed
by a special focus on the implementation and impact of WAC principles and
practices at two campuses: Hostos Community College, an urban, bilingual
community college located in the south Bronx, one of New York City's poor-
est neighborhoods; and Hunter College, a senior college in mid-Manhattan
with graduate programs and four professional graduate schools drawing stu-
dents from throughout the City. As WAC Coordinators who were present at
the inception of the now ten-year CUNY Initiative, we examine the insights
gleaned from our experiences as well as the challenges and successes of this vast
undertaking.

                               WAC AT CUNY

   In order to contextualize the WAC and Writing in the Disciplines (WID)
programs at Hostos and Hunter, a brief description of CUNY's WAC Initiative,
drawn from campus WAC web sites, reveals what may be common to all as well
as particular interests and accomplishments of each.

                             Hostos Community College/CUNY and Hunter College/CUNY (US)

   While each CUNY campus has developed its own WAC initiative responsive
to its particular institutional needs, the CUNY Writing Fellow is common to all.
These advanced CUNY Ph.D. students represent a range of disciplines and are
assigned to each of the undergraduate campuses and the CUNY Law School.
Their duties are as varied as the campuses and may include collaborating with
faculty on curriculum and assignments; tutoring students to develop writing
abilities; supporting student preparation for entrance and exit writing-related
exams; conducting faculty development workshops; developing and maintaining
WAC websites; and undertaking research into aspects of WAC at CUNY. (For a
description of the Writing Fellowship program and links to Fellow job descrip-
tions, see http://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/ue/wac.html.

   This reliance on graduate PhD students rather than traditional undergradu-
ate writing fellows, mentors, or associates is a unique aspect of the CUNY WAC
Initiative that allows for greater flexibility in how Writing Fellows serve a pro-
gram--while at the same time presenting new challenges and profound peda-
gogical shifts for both faculty and Fellows. The Writing Fellow/faculty collabo-
rations have had a singular transformative effect on pedagogy and the future
of the profession, by providing a professional development model for others
engaged in similar academic intiatives (Hirsch & Fabrizio, 2010).

   CUNY WAC programs' pedagogical underpinnings derive from a broad
range of theorists and compositionists who view writing as a mode of commu-
nication and as a heuristic: a means of analyzing, understanding, and assimilat-
ing course material. They rely on a number of bibliographic sources, with many
using John Bean's Engaging Ideas as a primary faculty development text. The
Brooklyn College WAC Bibliography (http://bcwac.wordpress.com) is repre-
sentative of the principles undergirding WAC at CUNY.

   In essence, WAC programs at CUNY are a variation on a theme. Most cam-
pus WAC programs are coordinated with General Education or Coordinated
Undergraduate Education (CUE) Initiatives. Almost all rely on Writing Fellow/
faculty collaborations to assist faculty in integrating writing into their courses,
develop and certify Writing Intensive (WI) courses, and provide opportunities
for professional development. Programs are supervised by one or more WAC
Coordinators from a number of disciplines (most frequently from the English
department); the Coordinators attend monthly meetings with the University
Dean for Undergraduate Education. Exchange of ideas, creation of University-
wide Fellows' professional development activities, and collaboration on com-
munal efforts such as assessment are functions of these meetings.

   Program undertakings are also determined by local circumstances. For ex-
ample, Baruch College, the university's "business school," situates WAC within
its Bernard L. Schwartz Communication Institute and has focused on develop-

                                                                                                441

ing instructional media such as weblogs and wikis. Most senior colleges, includ-
ing Lehman, Brooklyn, and John Jay, support the development of Writing in
the Disciplines (WID) with the aim of customizing WAC practices to the needs
of specific disciplines. At the CUNY Law School, Writing Fellows helped create
and staff the Writing Center and work with post-baccalaureate professional stu-
dents in presenting legal writing. LaGuardia Community College works exten-
sively with electronic (e-) portfolios and quantitative writing assessment. Most
programs engage in WAC research. Of particular interest to compositionists is
the work done at Medgar Evers College. Drawing on James Britton's seminal
The Development of Writing Abilities, Medgar Evers undertook a full-year re-
search survey of writing at the college resulting in "WAC: A College Snapshot,"
in Urban Education, January, 2003. The CUNY site, http://www.cuny.edu/wac
has links to all campus WAC sites as well as a report, Writing Across the Cur-
riculum at CUNY: A Ten Year Review, which provides further programmatic
details on WAC activities, WI requirements, and governance structures at each
campus.

           WAC AT HOSTOS COMMUNITY COLLEGE:
              STRENGTHENING UNDERGRADUATE
                       WRITING PROFICIENCIES

   Hostos Community College is an urban, bilingual college of 5,000 students
established in 1968 to serve the needs of New York City's impoverished South
Bronx community. Its mission is to provide educational opportunities for first
and second-generation Hispanics, African Americans, and other New York City
residents who have encountered significant barriers to education. Its student
population is diverse and poor, with the largest numbers coming from the Do-
minican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Central and South America. Nearly 99%
receive some form of financial aid. In addition to offering a rich liberal arts
curriculum and career programs, Hostos, as the university's only bilingual col-
lege, permits English-language learners to enroll in Spanish-language college-
level courses as they gain proficiency in English. Fifty-five percent of freshmen
require developmental composition and 43% require developmental reading
courses, thus posing particular challenges for a college implementing a WAC
program.

   While the college attracts many students to its two-year terminal-degree
career programs, the majority plan on transferring to a four-year institution.
Campus writing efforts focus on developing student ability to read and write
proficiently in a variety of disciplines and genres including the changing forms

442
                             Hostos Community College/CUNY and Hunter College/CUNY (US)

of twenty-first century literacies such as blogs, wikis, and social networking
sites. The College seeks to validate and draw on the diverse languages and dia-
lects spoken by its students, including English-language learners (ELLs), stu-
dents speaking Black Vernacular English (BVE), and Generation 1.5 language-
learners. Recognizing that students must be adept in standard academic English
if they are to succeed, the WAC program works with faculty to seek ways to
reconcile students' language strengths and deficits. In accordance with its bilin-
gual mission, the WAC Initiative also reaches out to faculty teaching courses in
Spanish, so that these faculty are part of the campus-wide process of developing
effective teaching practices, and so that students in these classes can further
their Spanish-language writing skills and utilize principles of "writing-to-learn."

                              Writing at Hostos

   The Hostos WAC Initiative reflects the university-wide philosophy that
writing ability can only be developed through extensive writing practice across
a broad range of academic experiences and that writing itself is a way of enhanc-
ing student comprehension of course material. WAC is situated throughout
the college, encompassing developmental programs, ESL, liberal arts, the allied
health professions, and dual degree Programs. Writing is encouraged at all levels
of a student's academic experience: (1) generally throughout the curriculum,
and (2) in specially designed "writing intensive" (WI) courses.

   The development of WI courses that provide opportunities for both formal
and informal writing has been a key component of WAC at Hostos. Students
must complete two WI sections prior to graduation. (See http://www.hostos.
cuny.edu/wac for a description of WI criteria and policies.) Having no such
courses at the start of the University Initiative in 1999, the college currently
offers 80 WI sections representing a wide range of disciplines and levels. Un-
like senior colleges, which usually require that WI courses be upper-level, Hos-
tos and some other community colleges permit students at the developmental
English-level to enroll in selected WIs; these allow for early exposure to more
complex writing tasks. Preferring to rely largely on full-time faculty, each de-
partment and academic program offers WI sections taught by the faculty who
created them. WI sections are deemed highly valuable for their introduction
to WID and for providing greater assurance that faculty are prepared to deal
with WAC issues such as "covering the curriculum," "handling the paper load,"
and balancing the writing/multiple-choice testing requirements of accreditation
agencies.

   Yet from the outset the program's philosophy has been that students are
best served when writing is not compartmentalized into WI sections and that

                                                                                                443
Hirsch and Paoli

opportunities for writing should be prevalent in all course offerings. The WAC
Initiative encourages all faculty to collaborate with Writing Fellows to embed
writing and reading into course work.

   The amount and type of student writing varies by discipline. Along with
electives, the English Department offers courses in developmental writing and
freshman composition, and through collaboration with WAC is exploring ways
of refining these courses to provide foundations for writing in other disciplines.
Students are expected to write not only essays and research papers; through WI
sections in certain disciplines they are exposed to such genres as lab reports in
the sciences, lesson plans and observations in early childhood education, field
reports and interviews in psychology and sociology, theater reviews in drama,
and case studies in business and nursing. In addition, students may keep jour-
nals or logs and engage in other informal, non-graded writing activities.

   As on most CUNY campuses, much of the success of developing WI sec-
tions, as well as incorporating WAC principles and practices, is the result of
close collaborations between faculty and Writing Fellows. Hostos Writing Fel-
low responsibilities reflect the many seamless, and oftentimes unforeseen, ways
in which Writing Fellows support the growth of student literacies and faculty
receptiveness to changing pedagogies. Their influence extends beyond their
work with individual faculty and reaches into areas including program assess-
ment, workshops for students and faculty, and podcasts and library workshops
on topics such as the research paper and avoiding plagiarism

   A strength of any program is its ability to accommodate shifting priorities.
The recognition of the pedagogical connections between reading and writing
led to the Initiative's evolution from a Writing Across the Curriculum project
to one that encompasses reading as well. As a result, in 2005 the program took
on the in-house title of Writing and Reading Across the Curriculum (WRAC),
resulting in even-greater curricular revisions.

   Over the past ten years, the Hostos WAC project has sought to connect
writing and reading with teaching and learning, and to develop a cadre of fac-
ulty from a variety of disciplines who are familiar and comfortable with prin-
ciples of language-across-the-curriculum. Yet it came as no surprise that with
the university's emphasis on high-stakes testing for exit from remediation, Eng-
lish Department faculty initially felt the greatest responsibility for improving
student writing.

   Faculty attitudes began to shift dramatically with the creation of the CUNY
Proficiency Exam (CPE) in 2001. Its mandate as a community college gradu-
ation requirement (or movement from General Education to the major in the
senior colleges) resulted in campus-wide recognition that the exam's emphasis
on reading and writing across disciplines reflected sound pedagogical practice--

444
                             Hostos Community College/CUNY and Hunter College/CUNY (US)

and that all departments were accountable for student success. Though the CPE
was discontinued by the university's Board of Trustees in November 2010, the
notion of broad faculty responsibility for student writing frames much of our
work. The implications of the removal of this exam are yet to be determined.

   At Hostos, funding for WAC activities derives from the college's allocation
of the university's budget for Coordinated Undergraduate Education (CUE).
Though funding for WAC is mandated in principle by CUE, each college may
now determine the actual amounts given to WAC programs. In the face of
city and state budget crises, the college's CUE allocation continues to dimin-
ish--including funding for WAC. Class size for WI sections, originally capped
at 25, grows each semester with 27-28 students the current norm. The college
provides funding for stipends for faculty engaged in WAC work (which have
decreased from an average of $1,500-2,000 for a year's work to $500-1,000),
for professional development and reassigned time for the two WAC Coordina-
tors. The two-course WI requirement for graduation remains in effect, with
waivers requiring approval by the WAC Coordinators. Administrative support
is also reflected in support for campus-wide WAC activities such as Hostos in-
volvement in National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE) National Day
on Writing in 2009 and 2010, events which drew huge campus participation.
(See http://www.hostos.cuny.edu/wac or YouTube for a video on our "Walls of
Writing.")

                          AGENT FOR CHANGE

   After a decade, the WAC Initiative has become increasingly integrated into
the life of the college, fostering campus-wide dialogues on writing/reading and
learning and becoming an agent for change as it encourages teachers to reflect
upon their teaching practices and reshape pedagogies. The success and growth
of the Initiative may be traced to its ever expanding role in strengthening un-
dergraduate education by working closely with other college programs.

   The English Department and the Department of Language and Cognition
hold frequent course-level meetings to discuss student literacies and work close-
ly with the Writing Center (WC). Writing Fellows often attend these meetings
to provide an interdisciplinary perspective. Through WAC collaboration, plans
are underway to provide greater integration of the WC with courses through-
out the curriculum, and Fellows are providing workshops for WC tutors in
elements of WID. Overall, the WAC Initiative encourages frequent dialogue
among faculty to explore ways of fostering student growth as writers and read-
ers by: (1) offering regularly scheduled professional development workshops

                                                                                                445
Hirsch and Paoli

throughout the academic year (on topics similar to those described at Hunter
below) including ones for junior, adjunct, and evening faculty; (2) meeting
with the WAC Advisory Committee composed of Department Chairs to deter-
mine WAC policies; (3) over-seeing the ad-hoc WI faculty Task-Force, which
meets with colleagues who have designed WI syllabi to review and recommend
them for WI designation; and (4) joining faculty in presenting WI syllabi to the
college-wide Curriculum Committee for official WI designation. All of these
avenues have resulted in conversations about writing that move beyond the
English Department and beyond complaints about student writing to more
fruitful discussions about effectively addressing these concerns.

                         VISION AND REVISION

   In reviewing the past ten years of WAC at Hostos, there are moments of
pride and also dismay. We have learned a great deal about what makes a suc-
cessful WAC Initiative. Foremost is faculty support. Our model has been bot-
tom-up and relies on working with interested faculty, an ever-widening circle
over the decade. The WI requirement is viewed as an enrollment booster for
WI classes; this results in greater faculty participation. We have created struc-
tures to institutionalize our work, including the WAC Advisory Committee
and our insistence on going through college governance procedures on policies
such as the conceptual frameworks of WIs and the graduation requirement.
The congeniality of the WI Task-Force provides an environment conducive
to open discussion of pedagogy and has led to much thoughtful conversa-
tion and assignment revision. Our experience indicates that many faculty are
no more enthused than students about revising their work, and they benefit
greatly from this non-judgmental opportunity to present their work to inter-
ested colleagues.

   In addition to providing numerous avenues for faculty input and dialogue,
the Hostos WAC Initiative also owes much of its success to its high visibility on
campus through its integration with numerous campus agencies and initiatives
including General Education, freshman composition, the library, workshops
for mandated CUNY exams, professional development, the Writing Center,
Freshman Academies, and College Now, a program for high school students
taking college courses. In addition, publicizing our work through our website,
videos, podcasts, manuals, and a newsletter, "From the Writing Desk," have
contributed to the program's strength and viability.

   The project also undertakes yearly formative and summative assessments
by distributing and analyzing qualitative survey instruments to students and

446
                             Hostos Community College/CUNY and Hunter College/CUNY (US)

faculty and triangulating these with Writing Fellow assessments. These find-
ings, shared with faculty and administrators, consistently reveal high satisfac-
tion and perceived improvements in student writing as a result of enrollment
in WI sections. The higher CPE pass rates for those taking WI sections have
also provided quantitative support for the Initiative. All of these factors have
resulted in college-wide authority and support for our work and have enabled
us to avoid the "WAC-police" label too often assigned to WAC programs.

                                Growing Pains

   Our great success with WI sections over the past ten years reminds us of the
need to insure their vitality. Though faculty must attend professional develop-
ment sessions and collaborate with a Writing Fellow for a section to receive WI
designation, it is not easy to determine what happens over time as faculty teach
the same WI year after year. Many CUNY campuses are grappling with how to
maintain the integrity of these sections and insure that they still reflect WAC
principles and practices such as opportunity for revision and informal "writing-
to-learn" activities. Changes in pedagogy are hard-won, and student assessments
indicate that in some WI sections there is not that much writing after all--with
some faculty reverting to non-scaffolded, plagiarism prone, end-of-semester re-
search papers as the primary writing activity. The WAC Coordinators are cur-
rently consulting with Chairs and Coordinators, the WAC Advisory Commit-
tee, and WI faculty to institute procedures to monitor the implementation of
these sections over a period of time. Any recommendations will reflect broad
faculty input and will go through college governance procedures. In this way
we continue to insure that new requirements are faculty generated rather than
imposed top-down and that the WAC Initiative maintains the faculty support
crucial to its success.

   With high pass rates on the university's CPE and ever-improving scores
on the ACT reading and writing exams needed to exit remediation, the col-
lege would seem poised to have achieved many of its goals regarding student
writing. There is a campus culture that acknowledges the value of writing and
reading across the curriculum, as well as qualitative and quantitative measures
demonstrating faculty and student satisfaction with WI sections. There are also
increased opportunities for reading and writing in non-WI sections. Profession-
al development sessions are well-attended, and campus participation in WAC
events is broad and enthusiastic. Yet it would be impossible to conclude that
our work is completed and that we are satisfied with student writing/reading
proficiencies. Inexperienced readers and writers, our students still demonstrate
a lack of ease and expertise in accessing difficult texts and demonstrating their

                                                                                                447

comprehension and knowledge through writing. As our section on Hunter Col-
lege indicates, student proficiency issues are by no means fully resolved upon
admission to the four-year college. Upon transfer, many still struggle with se-
nior college coursework and its greater expectations of writing and reading pro-
ficiencies. We have made great strides and have laid the foundation for a vast
overhaul in how the teaching of writing is conceived and practiced at Hostos,
but our work has only just begun.

                     WAC AT HUNTER COLLEGE

   On every CUNY campus, in every WAC program, there are impressive ex-
amples of Fellows' success in managing this unique and challenging position
and making a difference in the delivery of higher education's most prized out-
comes: pedagogical and curriciular change, and student success. The exemplary
successes of the WAC program at Hunter (http://rwc.hunter.cuny.edu/wac/
index.html), one of CUNY's senior colleges, are due primarily to the Writing
Fellows.

   Hunter College, located in three campuses in Manhattan, is the largest col-
lege in the City University system, drawing over 21,000 students from all five of
the city's boroughs and beyond. The college is one of seven CUNY institutions
offering undergraduate and graduate degrees; it houses professional schools of
Education, Health Professions, Nursing, and Social Work, as well as research
centers specializing in genetics, gerontology, and Puerto Rican studies.

   Founded in 1870 and for much of its history a women's college, Hunter
shares the City University's mission: to provide academic opportunities for
all of the City's students. And it therefore shares the challenges of the coun-
try's major institutions of public higher education: maintaining standards
of learning across a large and varied curriculum for a large and diverse stu-
dent population, and maintaining standards of instruction among a large
(in Hunter's case nearly 1,700) and varied faculty, a substantial percentage
of whom are part-time staff. Since the majority of courses in Hunter's cur-
riculum require writing from a student body that comes from well over a
hundred different linguistic backgrounds and exhibits a wide range of flu-
ency in the English language and experience in writing academic prose; and
since the instructors of those courses are from dozens of disciplines, often
with limited experience assigning and assessing student writing, and less ex-
perience analyzing those assignments and assessments, the challenges to our
Writing Across the Curriculum program are, as at Hostos, unsurprisingly
large, diverse, and daunting.

                            "Significant Writing"

   Hunter College has had a WAC program since 2000, and required writ-
ing intensive courses--called "Significant Writing" courses--since 2003. While
most CUNY campuses certify writing intensive courses or faculty, Hunter does
not, and therefore cannot require faculty development. The Significant Writ-
ing, or "W" course, requirements legislated by the College Senate are minimal:
at least 50% of the grade must be based on written work; writing due dates
must allow for "faculty feedback" on student writing; Freshman Composition
must be at least a co-requisite; and the course must be offered on a regular
basis. Given these requirements and the historical role of departments at the
college in determining curriculum, individual departments-- often individual
instructors--determine the content of and pedagogy practiced in W-designated
courses. There is no interdisciplinary WAC Committee, and the program has
no basis from which to claim any college-wide authority. One consequence of
this policy is that there is no set cap for enrollment in "W" courses, and while
the optimal number of students in a writing-intensive course is debatable, such
courses at Hunter can have up to 90 students per instructor. And while most
of the over 900 sections of the roughly 200 Significant Writing courses offered
in a standard semester are taught by experienced staff, many are taught by new
and often inexperienced instructors. It is not uncommon that, given registra-
tion and hiring deadlines, instructors are placed in "W" courses without a clear
idea of what that designation means, or indeed that they are teaching a writ-
ing- intensive course. To say nothing of courses throughout the curriculum that
require student writing though they are not W-designated.

                             The Usual Suspects

   Under these circumstances, the WAC program at Hunter has, over its first
ten years, offered instructors of all courses, particularly targeting "W" courses, a
menu of services and professional development opportunities, including work-
shop series and brown-bag lunches on academic writing-related issues such as
assignment design, rubric development, and managing sentence-level problems
in student writing; a one-day college conference and a college-wide roundtable
on Writing in the Disciplines; consultation with departments and individual in-
structors on departmental and course-related writing issues; in-class workshops
on specific writing assignments in conjunction with the college's Reading/Writ-
ing Center, as well as supplemental in-Center workshops on disciplinary and
assignment-specific adaptations of the academic writing process; participation
in interdisciplinary focus groups and departmental consultation on program

                                                                                                449

and course assessment; and orientations for students on disciplinary writing
and for faculty on standardized writing tests, specifically the now discontinued
CPE, and on the foundations of academic writing as presented in Expository
Writing, the college's Freshman Composition course.

   The program offers faculty stipends for participating in professional devel-
opment events, but the hourly rates are limited, leading to the welcome par-
ticipation by part-time instructors and a core of Hunter faculty dedicated to
progressive pedagogy, who have by now become "the usual suspects." The incor-
poration of funding for WAC in the university's Coordinated Undergraduate
Education (CUE) Initiatives budget and therefore in the college's CUE budget
has led to other responsibilities and opportunities for Hunter's program. Since
the inception of CUE, the WAC program has supported and participated in
college initiatives, including a Learning Communities pilot in the Freshman
Block program, an e-portfolio pilot in Freshman Composition, a study and
proposal for reorganization of the General Education Requirement (GER), and
a diagnostic essay and Reading/Writing Center referral pilot in GER gateway
"W" courses in History and Political Science.

                            The Writing Fellows

   But by far the most transforming and enduring effects on course and cur-
riculum design, classroom pedagogy, and student learning are those attribut-
able to the work of the CUNY Writing Fellows. As discussed earlier, Fellows'
roles differ from campus to campus, but generally, at Hunter and elsewhere,
they provide consultation on WAC best practices to faculty and, in some,
cases, tutorial services to students. Three narratives from the Writing Fellows
Program at Hunter College give ample evidence of the capacity and potency
of this model.

   In 2001, a Writing Fellow PhD candidate in American Literature was as-
signed, upon request, to the Urban Public Health (UPH) Department in the
Hunter College School of Health Sciences. The Fellow, working with the De-
partment's Community Health Education (COMHE) program, well outside
his field of academic expertise, would make a profound change in that pro-
gram's curriculum. Besides offering tutorial services, he introduced COMHE
faculty to low-stakes writing assignments, e.g., responses to readings, weekly
letters, article summaries/analyses, and reading logs, leading to changes in their
syllabi, the incorporation of peer critiquing and library workshops on infor-
mational literacy skills in their classes, and the scaffolding of higher-stakes as-
signments. Impressed with the changes effected in their individual courses, the
UPH faculty asked the Fellow in his second year to help organize a study of

450
                             Hostos Community College/CUNY and Hunter College/CUNY (US)

their students' writing, leading to the development of shared writing goals, a
rubric, the norming, led by the Writing Fellow, of senior UPH faculty using the
assessment model, and the scoring of sample papers. After the experience, and
in consultation with the Fellow, UPH professors re-conceptualized the under-
graduate course of study in the COMHE Program, ultimately adding a course
with a focus on research to the required curriculum, which then offered a more
comprehensive, progressive approach to writing in the discipline. So the out-
come of working with a Writing Fellow for the Urban Public Health Depart-
ment was not just the introduction of WAC pedagogy and course adaptation,
but programmatic change.

   Humanities 110: Map of Knowledge is one of the college's "jumbo" courses,
with enrollments often over 200 students. As taught for the last decade by a
professor in the Philosophy Department, the course focuses on current issues
in social policy and academia, takes a debate structure, and includes a number
of critical writing assignments. Through the efforts of four different Writing
Fellows, the development of the course and its writing component over three-
quarters of that decade is an example of the ongoing refinement and improve-
ment possible in a pedagogical model, even for a "jumbo" course. The first Fel-
low, from CUNY's graduate English Department, helped the professor clarify
the grading criteria for the written debate reports and present them clearly in
the assignments, and introduced a syllabus-busting "mock debate" format, in
which class time was dedicated to student debate on a topic, to model break-out
debates among the rest of the class. The Fellow also led an in-class workshop
based on the reports submitted in the mock debate to demonstrate the fea-
tures and quality of writing required. After her two-year appointment, a second
Fellow, from Urban Education, was assigned to work with the course. In her
service as a Fellow, she helped refine the criteria for writing assessment through
norming sessions among the course's teaching assistants and the development of
a rubric based on the refinements; added a critique element as well as a revision
process to the debate report assignment, with workshop and tutoring support
adapted to the new assignment design; and aligned documentation require-
ments for the class's research paper with the style (MLA) required in Freshman
Composition (which is often taught in tandem with sections of Humanities
110 in the college's Freshman Block Program). A third Fellow, studying Envi-
ronmental Psychology, continued this work while loading all the information
and support materials onto the newly-developed course website. The current
Fellow, another Urban Education student, is piloting a model for integrating
the course's writing component with the features and goals of Freshman Com-
position, creating a team-led interdisciplinary series of workshops for students
taking both courses. In the eight years a Writing Fellow has been assigned to

                                                                                                451

Map of Knowledge, this large-enrollment course has become more student-cen-
tered and participatory, its assignments more process-oriented and supportive,
its assessment models clearer and more consistently applied, the course itself
more interdisciplinary and integrated into the curriculum.

   In 2007, Hunter's department of Instructional Computing and Informa-
tion Technology (ICIT) reorganized and in the process ceased being able to
provide workshops in MLA documentation to Freshman Composition classes,
a service they had offered for years. ICIT asked the college's Reading/Writing
Center and the WAC Program to collaborate on an on-line MLA tutorial that
could substitute for the discontinued workshops. A Writing Fellow from Psy-
chology was recruited to the project, and quickly became its manager, creating
most of the content, contributing to the design, consulting on the contrac-
tors hired for the software training and the staff hired to build the tutorial,
and organizing what would become a collaboration unique in the history of
the college, between ICIT, the Library, the WAC Program, and the Reading/
Writing Center, with beta-testing by instructors of Freshman Composition in
the English Department. The result is a tutorial that is hosted on the Library
web site (http://library.hunter.cuny.edu/tutorials/mla/mla_tutorial.html), is on
all Freshman Composition course management sites, has been accepted into
the prestigious ALA/ACRL Instruction Section's Peer-Reviewed Instructional
Materials Online (PRIMO) project, and has become a model for future college
on-line development projects. Not only was the Fellow successful in creating
a viable alternative to the ICIT MLA workshops, she was instrumental in the
development of a nationally recognized on-line learning platform, one that is
now linked to dozens of academic websites across the country, and in creating
an interdisciplinary, interdepartmental collaboration uncommon in our power-
fully departmental institution.

   Without the Writing Fellows Program, Hunter's WAC Program would ap-
pear desultory in its successes, which, while not inconsiderable, occur discon-
tinuously here and there throughout, as opposed to consistently across, the
curriculum.

                               CONCLUSION

   While Hunter and Hostos are representative of WAC at CUNY and portray
the tensions inherent in reframing conversations about writing, they are not
necessarily the definitive CUNY senior or community college WAC experi-
ence. Each CUNY campus has its own model--with varying degrees of faculty
participation, administrative support, and student success.

   A 2007 poll of CUNY WAC Coordinators identified a number of common
challenges. Primary were budget-related issues including faculty stipends, reas-
signed time for coordinators, the loosening of WI enrollment caps, the reliance
on part-time staff with little WAC experience, and the difficulty in offering
enough courses for students to meet WI requirements. Other concerns cen-
tered on institutionalizing WAC. Almost all campuses have a WI graduation
requirement, and most certify WAC faculty or courses. Yet WAC experience is
not a major factor in tenure or promotion decisions, in effect de-incentivizing
participation.

   There are also potential obstacles to the continuity of WAC programs
brought on by CUNY policy changes that might dilute the highly successful
Writing Fellows program. Beginning in 2011, a Writing Fellow's time on cam-
pus decreases from two years to one. Considering the time it takes to educate
Fellows about WAC/WID and prepare them for their complicated, sensitive
work with faculty, this reduction of time threatens the quality of all CUNY
WAC programs.

   The growth and continuity of WAC at CUNY over the last decade was made
possible by the considerable talent in the field, available at CUNY, by virtue
of the university's size and its history as a leader in the development of writing
instruction and, of course, CUNY funding. With many of CUNY's acknowl-
edged experts in Rhetoric and Composition and WAC retiring or leaving the
position of WAC Coordinator, will the next generation of WAC directors be
able to sustain growth and preserve what has been achieved?

   Though these challenges cloud the future, some offer opportunities: the ad-
vent of CUE has given WAC programs greater visibility and influence in the
development of General Education programs and professional development.
There is ample evidence that changes made in the curricular incorporation of
writing, reading, and WAC pedagogy will endure. The greatest promise lies
in the fact that coordinators of WAC programs at Baruch, Hostos, Brooklyn
College, and the City College of New York, among others, are former Writing
Fellows, and that another generation of CUNY WAC practitioners, mentored
by the experienced leaders in the field who helped build WAC at CUNY, will
proceed to mentor the next generation and take WAC best practice to its next
stage of evolution both in CUNY and beyond.

    WRITING AT UC DAVIS:

    WRITING IN DISCIPLINES

    AND PROFESSIONS FROM

    THE UNDERGRADUATE FIRST

    YEAR THROUGH GRADUATE

    SCHOOL

      By Chris Thaiss and Gary Goodman
      University of California, Davis (US)

       Writing at this public research university--the largest among the ten
       campuses of the University of California--is taught in ways that re-
       flect the university's "land-grant" mission. Our academic writing
       courses and writing-support activities serve tertiary and post-graduate
       students from more than 100 disciplines and from highly-diverse lan-
       guage and cultural backgrounds. While this profile describes ways that
       most academic departments contribute to our students' writing devel-
       opment, we pay particular attention to the several roles, some long-
       established and some new, of the University Writing Program (UWP),
       an independent department devoted to academic writing across disci-
       plines and professions. We illustrate how UC Davis has re-interpreted
       the US model of "general education" to spread attention to student
       writing not only across disciplines but also vertically throughout the
       tertiary years and into services for PhD students from the humanities,
       social sciences, natural sciences, engineering, and agriculture. A PhD
       research emphasis in writing studies is also described, as is the Writing
       Minor for baccalaureate students.

   The University of California goes back to the early years of the new state on
the US Pacific coast. California became a state in 1850, just two years after the
discovery of gold in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada had lured people from
the eastern states and around the world to this rugged land. The closest port to

the gold fields became in a few years a thriving city, San Francisco, with sudden
pretensions to East Coast and European culture.

   Just across San Francisco Bay, in the town of Berkeley, the University of
California was launched in 1868, seen by civic leaders as an essential part of this
cultural rise and by the US government as California's "land-grant" university.
An essential part of the land-grant university's mission in the nineteenth cen-
tury was to train new generations of agriculturists in the latest technologies and
to redefine higher education as both "practical" and "classical," hence open to
a broader swath of society than had had access to the older colleges on the East
Coast in the US. Since California's richest agricultural lands lay across the coast-
al mountains from Berkeley, the state government was eventually convinced to
establish a "University Farm" in the 500-mile-long Central Valley, the farming
and ranching heart of the state (Scheuring, 2001, p. 20).

   Thus came into being in 1906 the tiny branch of the University that would
become the University of California (UC) at Davis, now in 2012 the largest of the
ten campuses of the UC system. UC Davis, with more than 33,000 undergradu-
ate, graduate, and professional students, offers more than 100 baccalaureate de-
grees, more than 80 PhD degrees, and degrees in law, medicine, veterinary medi-
cine, and business management. The majority of students concentrate in the life
and physical sciences, agriculture, and engineering, but robust baccalaureate and
doctoral degree programs also flourish in the arts, humanities, and social sciences.

    WHAT WRITING AND LITERACY MEAN AT UC DAVIS

   Understanding the place of writing at UC Davis begins with acknowledging
three factors:

   1. the emphasis of the campus on a wide variety of tertiary degree and
       graduate programs, and how this variety has been interpreted in terms
       of "core literacies" to be achieved by all undergraduate students (as de-
       scribed later in this profile);

   2. the American model of undergraduate studies, with "general education"
       a prime component; and

   3. the cultural and linguistic diversity of the university, with more than
       50% of all students coming from homes where English is not the first
       language--though the great majority of these students were born in
       California (Ferris & Thaiss, 2011). This diversity reflects not only the
       Spanish-speaking heritage of California, but also the waves of immigra-
       tion over 150 years from the Pacific Rim nations, from the rest of the
       US, and from many other cultures across the continents.

  WHO CARES ABOUT STUDENT WRITING AT UC DAVIS?

   US News and World Report, a public affairs magazine with international
circulation, publishes annually "America's Best Colleges," a guide for prospec-
tive college students. Among its many categories for ranking US colleges and
universities is "Writing in the Disciplines": according to the journal, "These
colleges typically make the writing process a priority at all levels of instruc-
tion and across the curriculum. Students are encouraged to produce and refine
various forms of writing for different audiences in different disciplines."

   Since 2007, UC Davis has been listed as one of only 20 or so institutions
considered distinguished in this category, as voted by a broad cross-section of
higher education administrators. The institutions in this short list represent
small privately-funded colleges, large private universities, and large public uni-
versities such as UC Davis. How each of these institutions enacts this commit-
ment differs. (See McLeod et al., 2001; Thaiss & Porter, 2010; and the WAC
Clearinghouse for examples of this variety.) In the case of UC Davis, the idea of
"care" for student writing means a multi-stage curriculum and tutorial oppor-
tunities serving all students, from newly-admitted undergraduates to doctoral
students writing dissertations.

   Some of these courses and services are specifically for students whose first
language is not English and are intended to help students achieve academic
English proficiency. Other courses and services are specifically for graduate stu-
dents, and these services focus on genres--journal articles, qualifying papers,
dissertations--central to doctoral education. The largest portion of courses and
services are open to all undergraduate students across all disciplines. Indeed,
all undergraduate students are required to complete several courses devoted to
text types and genres of academic writing. These various courses and services
are outlined below.

   In short, "care" for student writing is a cross-disciplinary commitment, with
several offices and one academic department focused on this commitment, but
with research and teaching faculty from many disciplines consciously develop-
ing student fluency, practice in writing processes, and genre literacy.

  WHERE AND WHAT STUDENTS WRITE AT UC DAVIS--
     REQUIREMENTS, OPTIONS, DISCIPLINES, GENRES

   This profile will describe requirements, programs, and services that have
been tentatively begun, then grown and changed over thirty years. We look at
these in terms of local and national contexts, changes in character and scope,

                                                                                                457

and ongoing challenges. Brevity allows only minimal analysis; we include links
to sources that we hope will give a fuller picture. We will close by describing one
of our most recent new programs, the Writing Minor.

         Admissions Testing for Academic Writing in English

   Applications for undergraduate admission to all branches of the UC are ac-
cepted from the top 12 1/2% of graduates of California secondary schools and
from qualified students from outside the state and the US For over 100 years,
most admitted students, despite their high academic standing in the secondary
schools, have been required to take the Analytical Writing Placement Examina-
tion (AWPE), a timed essay examination used to determine placement in the
appropriate first-year course dedicated to building awareness of and strategies to
accomplish university-level writing. Each campus determines this configuration
of courses differently, but all make distinctions based on AWPE scores. Leonard
(2011) has written the most comprehensive history of the growth and changes
in how this state requirement has been applied at UC Davis.

   The range of placements is complex: the highest level of exam scorers (about
60%) may choose a course from several that introduce them to genre expec-
tations either across disciplines or more focused on specific academic writing
tasks, such as analysis of literary texts. The most popular of these courses is the
introduction to academic writing across disciplines (UWP 1) offered by the
University Writing Program, the autonomous department dedicated to teach-
ing and scholarship in composition and rhetoric. The second level of AWPE
scorers (about 30 %) is placed in a course that does not receive academic credit
and is therefore considered remedial. This course is not taught by UC Davis
faculty or graduate students, but is outsourced to another institution, Sacra-
mento City Community College. These students must satisfactorily complete
the non-credit course before being admitted to UWP 1 and similar courses. A
third group of AWPE scorers (about 10%) are non-native speakers of English
whose language skills are considered not yet adequate for the higher two levels.
Each of these students is placed into one of three sequenced courses (all bear-
ing academic credit) taught by ESL specialists in the Linguistics Department.
Thus, a student placed into this developmental sequence may take as many as
four ten-week courses before being eligible for the first-year academic writing
course, such as UWP 1.

   Because of budget restructuring in the current economic recession, this
multi-step curriculum for the lowest group of AWPE scorers--now in place
for more than 20 years--is being reconsidered. One possible proposal would
bring the entire curriculum under the management of the University Writing

Program, so that placement and teaching could be coordinated and curriculum
revision made easier.

       The Required First-Year Writing Course (e.g. UWP 1)

   Typical of tertiary education in the US for more than a century (see, e.g.,
Brereton, 1996) is some form of mandatory first-year course (or courses) in
academic writing, the primary goal of this course to prepare students for the
assignments they are likely to receive in their major disciplines and in elective
courses outside the major. Indeed, so common is such a course that the US
Council of Writing Program Administrators (CWPA) has published a widely-
used list of "student outcomes" for first-year writing, including objectives in
five categories: Rhetorical Knowledge; Critical Thinking, Reading, and Writ-
ing; Writing Processes; Knowledge of Conventions; and Composing in Elec-
tronic Environments (http://www.wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html).
Because the common US model of undergraduate education dictates that pro-
spective students apply to the university, not to a department or a faculty, such
"general education" courses usually are populated by students representing a
broad variety of degree programs, from the arts and humanities to the sciences
and engineering.

   Hence, assignments in these courses often give students freedom in choice
of subject, but evaluate student writers on academic criteria that cross disciplin-
ary boundaries. For example, one outcome from the CWPA list is to "under-
stand a writing assignment as a series of tasks, including finding, evaluating,
analyzing, and synthesizing appropriate primary and secondary sources." The
typical US first-year writing course, including UWP 1 at UC Davis, expects
students to learn these critical processes as they apply them to a range of topics
that will differ by discipline and student interest.

                Required Writing in the Upper Division

   However, where writing at UC Davis differs from typical US structure is in
the portion of the general education writing requirement for the "upper divi-
sion" (third-year students and above). The great majority of US universities
place required general education writing courses in the first year only. At Davis
and a growing number of other universities, this requirement is split between
the first year and either the second or a later year (see Shamoon et al, 2000;
Thaiss & Porter, 2010). When configured this way, the goals of the two lev-
els differ. As we have theorized the difference here at UC Davis, the first-year
course acclimates the student to university-level writing in general, while the

upper-level course, taught in various versions, (1) focuses on discipline-specific
genres and ways of thinking that students experience in their majors and (2)
prepares students for rhetorical and genre expectations they are likely to en-
counter beyond graduation--in post-graduate education and professions. The
high regard in which most students hold these courses, as expressed in course
evaluations, reflects the importance to students of this dual aim.

   In the upper division at UC Davis, students select from a broad and growing
list of courses "in the disciplines and professions" (http://writing.ucdavis.edu/
about-uwp/about/): to name a few, writing in science, writing in the health pro-
fessions, writing for engineers, business writing, professional and technical writ-
ing, writing in history, writing in human development, writing in film studies,
and writing in legal studies, as well as introductory and advanced courses in
journalism.

   All of these courses are taught in the University Writing Program, by faculty
hired, reviewed, and promoted by the program. That the Writing Program has
its own faculty, most of whom (30+) are tenured in the program or on tenure-
like continuing appointments, is another difference from all but a few other
US institutions. In most colleges and universities, general education writing
courses are housed in the English department. Although how the independence
(2005) of the Writing Program at Davis came about is to some extent unique
(see http://writing.ucdavis.edu/about-uwp), what the emergence of the autono-
mous program shares with that of other similar US departments is the univer-
sity's recognition that (1) "composition and rhetoric" is a research field distinct
from most research concerns of US English departments and (2) the teaching
of writing is relevant to all disciplines in the university (see O'Neill, Crow, &
Burton, 2002), hence worthy of autonomy from any other single department.

                 The "Writing Experience" Requirement
                       and WID Staff Development

   "General education" at UC Davis, as at more than 400 other US institu-
tions (Thaiss & Porter, 2010) also requires that undergraduate students com-
plete a small number of courses, usually in their major degree programs, that
demand a substantial amount of writing in appropriate academic genres--and
that provide written feedback to student writers and the opportunity to revise
for resubmission. Such courses, often labeled "writing intensive" or "writing
emphasis" in the US, primarily focus on learning disciplinary content and
methods, but writing is an important means of student thinking and expres-
sion in these courses (Townsend, 2001). At Davis, we use the term "writing
experience" for such courses, and some 1,500 courses across more than 80 de-

460
                                                                     University of California, Davis (US)

partments have been approved by cross-disciplinary committees to meet more
stringent criteria beginning in 2011 (see http://ge.ucdavis.edu). Large lecture
courses, advanced seminars, and senior "capstone" courses are all included as
"writing experience" courses, as long as they meet the specified criteria for (1)
number of graded words, (2) feedback on drafts and/or on scaffolded shorter
assignments, and (3) the opportunity to revise. This breadth means that, in
many departments, students are encountering process-based experience with
disciplinary genres in lower-level, more advanced, and final-year courses in
their fields.

   The "writing experience" (WE) requirement, along with the required first-
year and upper-division courses taught by the UWP, represents "literacy in
words and images," one of the several "core literacies" that comprise the general
education requirements for all UC Davis baccalaureate students (see http://
ge.ucdavis.edu). The other core literacies include oral communication; visual
literacy; scientific literacy; quantitative literacy; the "literacy" (critical under-
standing) of American history, culture, and governance; and the "literacy" of
world cultures. Many of the courses that fulfill the WE requirement also fulfill
one or more of the other core literacies (although each student may count a
given course toward fulfilling only one of these core requirements; this rule
means that students must take a number of courses across disciplines to meet
the entire core).

   Unlike teachers of the UWP first-year and upper-division courses, the fac-
ulty and graduate students who teach these "writing experience" (WE) courses
in all those departments have not been formally trained in composition peda-
gogy. (In comparison, the graduate students who teach UWP 1 must complete
two pedagogy seminars and be observed by program administrators in a later
term.) What the many "writing experience" teachers have available to them are
short-term workshops, consultation opportunities, and web-available materials,
again offered by the UWP (http://writing.ucdavis.edu/programs-and-services/
the-workshop-program) or by the university's Center for Excellence in Teach-
ing and Learning (CETL: http://cetl.ucdavis.edu). While it would be ideal for
all WE teachers to be certified for this pedagogy, the number of teachers far
exceeds the resources of the UWP and CETL to reach them systematically, try
as our UWP consulting faculty and the CETL staff do.

               Writing Tutorials and Workshops at the
                    Student Academic Success Center

   All undergraduate students can also call on the tutoring services of the Stu-
dent Academic Success Center (SASC) (http://lsc.ucdavis.edu/writing.html).

                                                                                                461
Thaiss and Goodman

The full-time professional tutors and many trained undergraduate peer tutors
review drafts of assigned writing from any UC Davis discipline for such fea-
tures as focus, organization, coherence of argument, and English syntax and
punctuation. Congruent with writing center tutorial philosophy in the US, the
function of the tutor is to converse with the student about the draft so that the
tutor can offer suggestions for improvement (Geller, Eodice, Condon, Carroll,
& Boquet, 2006). In 2010-11, the UC Davis writing center gave almost 10,000
tutorial sessions to students from more than 100 degree programs.

   The SASC also offers hour-long workshops for groups of students preparing
for certain high-stakes essay examinations (e.g., for the L2 courses in Linguis-
tics) and on other general topics of writing proficiency. Workshops for English
L2 students are frequent.

          Tutoring and Workshops for Graduate Students

        Since the SASC focuses its tutorials and workshops on the 25,000 UC
Davis undergraduates, similar services for graduate students across disciplines
have become a further interest of the University Writing Program, in coopera-
tion with the Office of Graduate Studies (OGS). Over the past eight years,
gradually more of the time spent by the UWP on training opportunities
for faculty to assign and "care for" the writing in their classes, as well as on
services to the students themselves, has been given to the graduate level. To
illustrate, the fall 2010 schedule of UWP/OGS workshops included (http://
iccweb.ucdavis.edu/graduates/pds):

   · Writing Scientific Papers
   · Writing a Curriculum Vitae
   · Revising and Organizing for Grad Students & Postdocs
   · Overcoming Writer's Block
   · Enhancing Your Use of Endnote
   · Grammar and Sentence Crafting
   · Writing a Research Statement in the Sciences & Engineering: Academic

       Job Search Series
   · Articulating Your Research in the Humanities & Social Sciences: Aca-

       demic Job Search Series
   · Dissertation Writing Workshop and Retreat
   · Grant Writing in the Sciences
   Since 2007, the UWP has also staffed a Grad Writing Fellows tutoring ser-
vice with PhD students trained in writing pedagogy. This service began with
volunteers who had worked in writing centers at other universities; in 2009, the
OGS began to provide funding for the tutors and in 2010 a permanent work-

space. That tutorial services for graduate students across disciplines are far more
recent at UC Davis than those for undergraduates reflects the (1) long-time
acceptance by US tertiary education of responsibility for literacy development
by undergraduates (e.g., Russell, 2002), (2) the scope and expense of under-
graduate operations, and (3) only gradual realization by US graduate schools
that lack of such assistance has kept retention and degree completion rates at
disappointing levels.

 TOWARD FULFILLING FURTHER AMBITIONS: THE PHD
  "DESIGNATED EMPHASIS" AND THE WRITING MINOR

   Over the past three decades, close to one hundred US universities have de-
veloped PhD specialties in composition/rhetoric. Most of these programs are
attached to English departments, given the historical placement of required
English composition courses in these departments, as noted earlier. Some of the
existing PhD specialties are free-standing programs that draw students from a
number of disciplines. An annual issue of the journal Rhetoric Review provides
descriptions of the various programs and their locations within institutions.

   At UC Davis, the PhD "designated emphasis in Writing, Rhetoric, and
Composition Studies" (WRaCS) was conceived in 2006, approved by the
Graduate Council in 2008, and first offered to students that same year, with
five to eight new students per year. Current students' research focuses in such
areas as WAC/WID program design, writing placement theory and practice in
higher education, adolescent literacy development, L2 writing methodology,
and cultural rhetorics. Administered by the UWP, the designated emphasis has
more than thirty affiliated faculty, from the faculties of Education, Linguis-
tics, English, Cultural Studies, Techno-cultural and Film Studies, Performance
Studies, and Spanish, as well as the UWP (http://wracs.ucdavis.edu).

   Establishing an independent UWP also allowed the development of an un-
dergraduate minor in writing, which began in 2009 (http://writing.ucdavis.
edu/programs-and-services/uwp_writing_minor). Within the first year, more
than 50 students graduated with the credential and 100 more declared their
intentions to complete the minor. By the end of 2011, more than 150 students
had completed the Minor. Like all minors at UC Davis, this minor allows stu-
dents to concentrate study (20 units or five courses) outside their major; writing
minors earn a credential that shows their concentrated work in writing. While
the most common majors represented among our minoring students are Com-
munication and English, many minors come from Political Science, Interna-
tional Relations, Psychology, Sociology, and various sciences.

                                                                                                463
Thaiss and Goodman

   The writing minor gives students advanced instruction and opportunities
for practical experience. Students learn diverse genres in disciplines and profes-
sions; they learn to modify styles for varied audiences and formats. All courses
for the minor are "upper division," although students also take the prerequi-
sites for those courses. The curriculum includes four areas: writing in academic
settings; writing in the professions; history, theory and design; and a writing-
intensive internship outside the academy.

   Many students choose internships in journalism: as reporters and editors of
the student newspaper, The California Aggie, or for UC Magazine, local news-
papers, radio and television stations, print magazines, and online publications.
Internships in marketing and public relations are common, including work for
University Communications and other campus organizations, for local visitors'
bureaus, for local businesses and wineries.

   Some enterprising students have gained writing experience in other profes-
sions through their internships: research and writing for law firms or district
attorneys' offices, technical writing and editing, writing for political offices or
campaigns, or grant-writing for the university, for specific scientific research
projects, or for non-profit organizations.

   While many students in the minor already have excellent writing skills, a
significant number have chosen the minor because English is their second lan-
guage or because they consider their writing poor.

         I never considered myself a writer. I did the minor because I
         knew writing was one of my weakest skills. Now I don't feel
         like that. I know how to write various forms, such as press
         releases. I never thought I had a strong grammar background,
         but this is an area in which I've also seen improvement. I
         believe this is because I was put in charge of editing the writ-
         ing of others. I feel able to write on the job when I leave UC
         Davis. Justin Chu, Nutrition major

   Because of the range of upper division courses in the disciplines and pro-
fessions, students use the writing minor to prepare for careers in journalism,
public relations, marketing, technical writing, editing, grant writing, and public
policy analysis. Certification of the minor on students' transcripts establishes
their credentials for writing-intensive jobs immediately after graduation, in
non-profit organizations, businesses, and other fields.

         The minor is perfect toward preparing me for my dream

         career as a book editor or publisher. To have the Writing Mi-
         nor started during my second year seemed like a miracle, as
         it involves internships and certification of writing expertise,
         which I will definitely need as an advantage. Elizabeth Orfin,
         English major

   The minor also enhances critical thinking skills and writing proficiency re-
quired for success in postgraduate programs and professional schools.

         Writing is an essential skill in science. I think how you
         convey your research, your findings, and your observations
         greatly determines how professional you are. Tacita Vu, Bio-
         logical Science

         My writing has improved significantly. Critical and analyti-
         cal writing not only helps you better convey your ideas to
         an outside population, but also trains your mind to be more
         analytical. Enkhee Tuvshintogs, Biochemistry and Molecular
         Biology major

                                CHALLENGES

   As this profile shows, UC Davis's commitment to student writing and to
research in this interdisciplinary field has grown over many years, with dramatic
steps, such as creation of the independent UWP, to enhance its range and help
ensure its future. Ambitions remain: e.g., for the Writing Minor to be built
into a major degree program, for the PhD "designated emphasis" to become
a free-standing degree, for funding to lower class sizes in required courses and
workloads in "writing experience" courses. The main threat to this future, as
in most places profiled in this book, is the ongoing financial crisis, which has
forced a dramatic decline in public support and huge rises in student fees. In
the midst of this crisis, the many cooperating faculty and staff across disciplines
at Davis have maintained their imaginative devotion to student learning. Sus-
taining this ambition despite fewer resources will be our continuing challenge.
However, as the student comments above illustrate, maintaining that commit-
ment to growth in student writing and critical thinking will produce the next
generation of thinkers and communicators to productively confront and, we
hope, resolve crisis.

                                                                                                465

      CHAPTER 40.

    SECTION ESSAY: ACADEMIC

    LITERACY DEVELOPMENT

      By Gerd Bräuer
      University of Education, Freiburg (Germany)

       This section essay provides an overview of the landscape of academic
       writing centers, writing programs, and writing initiatives in the Ger-
       man-speaking countries (Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein, Switzer-
       land). The author sheds light onto some of the major motivations--on
       both individual and institutional levels--for the emergence of writing
       support in higher education and uncovers several tendencies in writ-
       ing center work that seem to trigger institutional change with regard
       to writing. Peer learning, one of the major features of US-writing
       pedagogy, seems to have become a vital concept also in the German-
       speaking countries. Peer learning, especially as part of writing center
       work, is functioning as a strong catalyst for sustainable institutional
       and curricular development, leading not only to a change of indi-
       vidual writing practices but also to a redefining of the role of writing
       and maybe even to alternative writing cultures within institutions of
       higher learning.

   The territory of the German-speaking countries I will be talking about in
this section essay is about the same size as California.1 It is the area that I trav-
eled a lot over the past decade in order to participate in projects, conferences,
and workshops. You can take a comfortable night train from the writing center
at the University of Education in Zurich (Switzerland), in the south-western
area of this geographic territory, to the writing center at the Europe University
Viadrina in Frankfurt/Oder in Germany (not to be confused with the well-
known airport hub Frankfurt/Main), located near the border to Poland, in the
north-eastern corner of this international conglomerate of writing centers, writ-
ing programs, and other bold initiatives to support academic writing and writ-
ers in higher education.

   I say bold here to indicate that this work has involved struggle against many
obstacles at least since 1993, when the first European university writing center

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2012.0346.2.40  467
Bräuer

began its work in Bielefeld (Germany). Even in 2001, when I helped to set up
the first writing center in European teacher education in Freiburg (Germany), I
had to handle opinions among teaching faculty like the one that I received one
day by email: "Dear colleague, it is wonderful to see what you do for our weak-
est students, but--please, please! --don't make this college look like a gathering
place for fools. Many of our students CAN write and do it quite well and, there-
fore, don't need your support. All the others I'd rather see leave this university
the sooner the better!"

   Of course, all these students can write--some better than others--but
everybody needs feedback and the challenge to revise. Luckily, opinions like
the one just mentioned didn't hinder people in their efforts to progress to
the present, where we find ourselves working in 39 writing centers across
Austria (1), Germany (32), Liechtenstein (1) and Switzerland (5), collab-
orating closely in local networks, such as the one in Berlin-Brandenburg
(Germany); in national forums, such as "Forum Schreiben" (http://www.
forum-schreiben.eu) in Switzerland; and within international organizations,
first and foremost the European Association of the Teachers of Academic
Writing (EATAW, established in 1999) and the European Writing Centers
Association (EWCA, since 2003). Several of the most active members of
this German-speaking community have served on the boards of these large
professional organizations.

   These close collaborations resulted in international projects and initiatives
such as "Scriptorium" (http://www.scriptorium-project.org), a professional
development program for literacy student-teachers and in-service teachers;
the foundation of a bilingual (German/English) scientific journal, Zeitschrift
Schreiben (http://www.zeitschrift-schreiben.eu); a yearly conference for stu-
dent peer-tutors (including its own journal on tutoring writing, JoSCH ,
journal.der.schreibberatung@googlemail.com); and the development of an
extensive research data basis (http://www.ipts.rwth-aachen.de/) that connects
professionals internationally outside the German-speaking area (see also Nie-
derau and Jakobs in this book). The scientific publications that resulted from
this collaboration have grown substantially since the 1980s, and most of them
can be found in the database just mentioned. The most recent collaborative
text that circled for months among several writing centers, stirring up fruit-
ful internal and external discussion, focused on the declaration of quality
standards for the training of peer tutors. The topic of this collaboration--
peer tutoring--isn't a surprise when considering that the short history of this
academic literacy movement in the German-speaking area was largely spurred
by writing centers and peer learning concepts.

            PEER LEARNING FOSTERED BY WRITING
             CENTERS AS A KEY CONCEPT FOR THE

         ACADEMIC LITERACY SUPPORT MOVEMENT

   When I started a training program for peer writing tutors in 2002 at the
Freiburg Writing Center (Germany), my main goal was to convince the par-
ticipants about the process character of writing and, as a pedagogical conse-
quence, the need to teach process writing in order to give students a chance
to grow as writers--instead of drilling them in applying knowledge about
text genres to successful written discourse (Bräuer, 2002). To better achieve
my intention, I constructed the course around my own beliefs, materials, and
methods, asking the students simply to follow the program by answering my
questions and working on my tasks. I simply didn't know it any better at that
time.

   In the same year (2002), I participated in a workshop organized by the
Bielefeld University Writing Lab with Paula Gillespie (Gillespie & Lerner,
2000) and Harvey Kail (Kail & Trimbur, 2000), two well-known experts on
peer tutoring. Peer tutoring stands in the tradition of Kenneth Bruffee's ap-
proach to collaborative learning (1984), with peer learning--learning from
and with each other (Boud et al., 2001) --in the center of attention. The peer
learning concept and the research on peer-assisted mentoring and tutoring
approaches (Falchikov & Blythman, 2000; O'Donnell & King, 1999; Top-
ping & Ehly, 2001) heavily influenced US-based writing center development.

   The lesson I learned at the Bielefeld Writing Lab workshop with Kail and
Gillespie was fundamental with regard to the Socratic teaching method I orig-
inally applied to my training program for peer writing tutors that I just men-
tioned above: based on Bruffee's work and concepts developed out of it, such
as community of practice (Lave & Wenger, 1991) and community of learners
(Rogoff, 1994), I changed the focus of the training by applying peer learning
strategies and thus opportunities for the students to discuss their own beliefs,
experience, and knowledge in order to collaboratively develop methods and
materials for the tutoring of writers and writing. The result was a radical con-
ceptual change of the training program toward social constructivist learning,
with peer interaction in person and on the web (in blogs, forums, and wikis)
at the core--with me as facilitator and organizer on the sidelines. In other
words: I gave up the role of one pretending to have all the answers on this very
personal quest toward becoming a peer writing tutor. When I look at what
many of the graduates of my training program do today as professionals in the
field of academic literacy and beyond, I perceive a substantial and sustainable

                                                                                                469

impact of the concept of peer learning on the development of writing centers,
writing programs, and initiatives across the German-speaking area.

   Not surprisingly, I see many of these colleagues engaged in redefining the
role of writing in higher education in the German-speaking area being in-
volved in writing centers as a place with a specific potential for fostering peer
learning as a mode of academic literacy development across colleges and uni-
versities. At least in the German-speaking countries, writing centers, in my
view, efficiently suggest and implement alternative ways of learning and in-
struction because they are extra-curricular. Other than a teaching faculty, they
are in daily contact with students through one-on-one tutoring, workshops,
seminars and self-learning materials.

   If writing centers make their work transparent toward the teaching faculty,
they can have a silent but nevertheless powerful and long-lasting impact on
teaching practices (see also Bräuer & Girgensohn in this book). The writing lab
at Bielefeld University (Bielefeld), with its powerful connections to the Center
for Teaching and Learning, the Center for Student Advising and Counseling,
the Career Center, and an initiative named "Toward a new culture of studying
and teaching," is in my view the most impressive example in the German-speak-
ing area of writing centers' innovation toward institutional change.

   In the following sections of the essay, I will sketch current tendencies in the
development of academic literacy that show peer learning, as part of writing
center work, as a catalyst for sustainable institutional and curricular develop-
ment that can lead not only to a change of individual writing practices, but
also to a change in the role of writing--and maybe even to alternative writing
cultures within institutions. Let me first briefly define what I mean by "change."

                   DEFINING A FRAMEWORK FOR
                     UNDERSTANDING CHANGE

   Curricular development and institutional development often go hand in
hand (e.g., Altrichter et al., 2007), but they are certainly not automatic steps.
While curricular development focuses primarily on change in individual class-
room practice, institutional development concerns changing larger structures
far beyond the individual classroom. Sometimes, the quantity and quality of
change in individual teaching can spur change in the overall culture of learning
and instruction and, therefore, trigger institutional change. In this bottom-up
development, the changes made on an individual level will be "codified" by the
institution's administration. The individual change becomes part of the official

has happened cannot be eliminated just because the agenda of the people in
power in an institution may change in the future.

   The other main scenario in the interplay between curricular and institution-
al development is top-down: it starts with an incentive on the administrative
level, often triggered by outside experts who combine research and professional
practice. Supported by a concept for change and a steering group, the institu-
tion's administration asks members of the teaching faculty to apply (or further
develop) the suggested documents and measures of change.

   How are these scenarios relevant to the integration of academic literacy mea-
sures in institutions of higher education? For the European context, I envision a
unique potential for writing centers to pick up on grassroots initiatives or initiate
change on the individual level of instruction, to further analyze the needs of indi-
vidual faculty and learners, and to contextualize these with the appropriate research
findings. This process facilitates a proposal to be made to the administration to
consider long-term and sustainable change either on a larger curricular level (e.g.,
for a department or discipline) or for cross-institutional measures. Let me illustrate
the two strategies for change with an example from the integration of university-
wide portfolio systems at the University of Education in Freiburg (bottom-up) and
at the Technical University of Darmstadt (top-down), both located in Germany.

   Portfolio work in Freiburg as a grassroots initiative of the two institutes of
education and languages has a history of almost 10 years. From the beginning,
the Freiburg writing center supported this initiative with research on writing as
reflective practice, faculty training, workshops for students, and peer tutoring.
Based on the rich experience from this facilitation process, in 2008 the writing
center presented a concept to the university administration for the implementa-
tion of a campus-wide e-portfolio system that would engage students in reflec-
tive practice throughout college training and beyond, and provide a conceptual
backbone for instruction that switched, as part of the so-called Bologna process,
to a modularized and competence-based approach. A first step in acknowledg-
ing this "bottom-up" portfolio concept is being made by adapting exam guide-
lines of individual degree programs that were recently set up in German Studies
and German as a Foreign/Second Language.

   At the TU Darmstadt, the procedure followed a somewhat reversed track,
"top-down": Due to existing institutional structures, embodied by a so-called
"dual mode strategy" (blended learning) (Ballweg et al., 2011, p. 190), an exist-
ing portfolio on e-learning competencies at the university and long-term port-
folio practice in the teaching profession in the state of Hessen (Germany), the
university administration assigned a steering committee to develop and assess a
competency portfolio that would be kept throughout the entire college career,
include the above-mentioned portfolio on e-learning, and prepare students for

                                                                                                471

using the portfolio in the profession. In order to put this project into practice,
faculty will be supported to design appropriate task arrangements and to use
the e-portfolio web application "Mahara." The steering committee hopes not
only to implement portfolio work into individual classrooms but also to initiate
sustainable institutional change by defining and applying an alternative role of
writing in teacher training, here especially in the format of "writing to learn"
through reflective practice.

   In both Freiburg and Darmstadt, tendencies in institutional development
can be witnessed that Altrichter (2012) calls "intentional and systematic," "di-
rected on long-term and structured development," by which "mediation between
heterogeneous goals and expectations" is being practiced slowly but intensely, to
build change in the overall culture of learning and instruction, where the concept
of peer learning as part of writing center work can be a powerful change agent.

               LITERACY MANAGEMENT AS A TOOL
                   FOR INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE:

   How can institutional change be carried out in a planned, efficient way?
Curricular and institutional change are both pressing and central needs in to-
day's academy in order to deal in a productive way with the growing challenges
of "multiliteracies," which originate in a "multiplicity of communication chan-
nels and increasing cultural and linguistic diversity" (Cazden, Cope, Fairclough,
& Gee, 1996, p. 60). The existence of multiliteracies indicates the need of man-
aging the interplay of these different literacies among the three stakeholders of
higher education: the individual learner, the educational institution (including
teaching faculty and administration), and the profession(s). In order to be able
to manage literacy--which Cazden et al. (1996) understand as the ability to
read, write, and distribute information beyond language--we have to be aware
of the existing flow of information within defined structures of an institution
and beyond, especially among the stakeholders with regard to a certain phe-
nomenon of change (e.g., the implementation of portfolios). In more specific
terms: in order to be successful in the development of academic literacy in
higher education, we need to know how to optimize the way people deal with
information, form and formulate intentions, and comprehend, process, and
fulfill the intentions of others.

   The main task for literacy managers, who I see as change agents in the dis-
course among the stakeholders mentioned above, would therefore be two-fold:
to construct and strengthen synergy, understood as the collaboration of people
and their ideas, structures, methods, and materials; to deconstruct and therefore

472
                                                                         Academic Literacy Development

reduce dysergy, understood as the collision of people and their ideas, structures,
methods, and materials. This negotiating role can be played out much better by
extra-curricular entities such as the writing center than by structures that are part
of the institutional hierarchy and the ongoing power struggle within this hierarchy.

   Again, what is needed in today's academy more than ever is the negotia-
tion of a multiplicity of discourses in which individual learners, institutions of
education, and the professions are engaged with literacy managers. I personally
envision writing center people as most well-prepared for this role: to juggle the
potential, demands, and challenges of the different literacies such as computer
literacy, digital literacy, multimodal literacy, visual literacy, and critical literacy,
in order to solve problems with efficient handling of information through indi-
viduals within the larger framework of their institution.

   Literacy managers perform a complex range of tasks: (1) analyze the current
state of both handling information in general and text production, distribu-
tion, and reception, including visual, audio, spatial, and behavioral aspects of
forms of representation of meaning, within their home institution and beyond;
(2) assess the quality of the latter processes and try to determine a price tag for
any loss of information and/or understanding of texts in order to quantify the
urgency of change; (3) identify the current needs of the main stakeholders with
regard to in-house communication and the flow of information beyond; (4)
develop concepts and prototypes for optimizing the management of literacies
within the organization, (5) test and assess procedures, methods, materials, and
training programs in order to further develop and successfully implement them;
and (6) initiate necessary structural change within the institution and facilitate
steering groups in this matter.

   The following list of current tendencies in an academic literacy environ-
ment in the process of dramatic change will show concrete areas of work for
literacy managers either positioned in the writing center or collaborating with
the writing center as a true powerhouse for institutional change: redefining the
role of writing and writers in the academy, especially, as can also be seen below,
through different forms of peer learning.

   TENDENCIES IN INSTITUTIONALIZED SUPPORT FOR
 ACADEMIC WRITERS IN THE GERMAN-SPEAKING AREA

          Tendency 1: Face-to-face Facilitation of Writers

   Supporting academic writers through one-on-one interaction is probably the
most striking achievement of this very young writing pedagogy movement in

                                                                                                473

German-speaking higher education. It is no surprise that the two possibilities of
face-to-face writing support, peer tutoring and faculty mentoring (coaching), are
sometimes still seen as conflicting alternatives. In the late 1990s, the number of
institutions favoring faculty-based writing consultations was much higher than
the number focusing on peer-based feedback. I see two reasons for this: (1) Aside
from the Freiburg Writing Center (Bräuer, 2002), there was no other concept for
training peer writing tutors in practice in the German-speaking area. (2) Interest
in developing training programs was quite low because academic writing was still
seen mostly as a set of rules provided and guarded by the academy.

   Today, the number of institutions seeking ways to set up peer-based writing
support is growing rapidly, and a discussion of standards for writing tutor train-
ing has begun among the most active writing centers. Some universities (e.g.,
Bielefeld and Bochum) already offer systematic training for teaching faculty in
key aspects of process writing so that process-based and learner-based writing
tasks will incorporate regular feedback of different kinds. With regard to sup-
port for faculty in writing pedagogy, the work by John Bean (1996, 2011) has
become very influential in the German-speaking area.

                       Tendency 2: Online Tutoring

   Asynchronous forms of tutoring writing have developed rapidly in recent
years, with integration of e-learning platforms in higher education. While writing
centers offer e-mail support for academic writers, though often limited to specific
aspects of text production, the teaching faculty started to make use of peer-based
asynchronous tutoring in discipline-specific forums on e-learning platforms.

               Tendency 3: Extra-curricular Workshops

   Many university writing centers have developed over the past few years extra-
curricular workshops in which students participate voluntarily. The focus of these
workshops is either on the introduction to academic writing or on specific aspects
of the writing process in individual academic genres. Increasingly, university dis-
ciplines organize their own discipline-specific workshops and, sometimes, make
them mandatory for students. This is especially the case with new genres (e.g.,
e-portfolio) or skills and tools (e.g., use of digital devices for academic literacy) in
order to secure more comprehensive learning and instruction. As a consequence,
at some universities, individual disciplines start their own writing centers, to pro-
vide a joint roof for and more structure to the different support initiatives. The
most striking example of this initiative, in my view, is the writing center in the
Institute of Sociology at the University of Göttingen (Germany).

                 Tendency 4: Required Writing Courses

   At a growing number of universities, beginning students are required to take
part in either (1) an introductory writing course or (2) a cluster of lectures and
workshops, or (3) an autonomous writing group and/or collaborative writing
project. A successful example of the first format is the course designed, scientifi-
cally assessed, and finally implemented by Helmut Gruber (Gruber, Huemer,
& Rheindorf, et al., 2009) and his team at the University of Vienna (see also
Gruber's chapter in this book). A unique version of the second format is the
design of introductory clusters for academic writing at the Health Education
Department and the Department of Applied Linguistics, both at Zurich Uni-
versity of Applied Sciences Winterthur (see also Otto Kruse in this book). A
role model for the third format is Katrin Girgensohn's concept of autonomous
writing groups at the European University Viadrina (see also my interview with
Katrin Girgensohn in this book).

   Mandatory "writing-intensive" courses for advanced students are still rare
(see Hirsch and Paoli; Thaiss and Goodman in this book for US variations on
this theme). There are two possible explanations: (a) within universities many
faculty members and administrators view writing as a given skill which shall
not require extra instruction during university studies; (b) among the teach-
ing faculty there is a lack of knowledge about what writing pedagogy implies.
Therefore, generic online courses, such as the one developed by Guillaume
Schiltz (2006), called COLAC, have been implemented in advanced courses
at the Universities of Basel and Zurich and in other places in Swiss higher
education.

   With regard to lack of writing pedagogy expertise among the teaching fac-
ulty, more and more local writing centers offer training in how to teach process
writing and use writing task arrangements that offer alternative ways of text
production based on the individual needs of different writer types (Schindler,
2011). Although most colleges and universities are not yet willing whole-heart-
edly to invest in structures of "writing-across-the-curriculum" (WAC) and/or
"writing-in-the-disciplines" (WID), many colleagues are now eager to plan
their seminars and lectures around task arrangements that define and make use
of writing as a mode of learning and specific rhetoric tools for successful partici-
pation in discipline-specific discourse. (Bräuer & Schindler, 2011)

                       Tendency 5: Writing Groups

   Anne R. Gere (1987) defines writing groups as a communities of learners
temporarily established, more or less voluntarily, and based on similar learning

                                                                                                475
Bräuer

needs and goals of the participants. Interaction is organized through a set of
agreements that are either preset by a facilitator (often representing an educa-
tional institution) or negotiated and agreed upon by the members of the writ-
ing group. Writing groups in a more structured format, guided by a workshop
leader/facilitator, are an important element of the so-called Reform Pedagogy
developed since the 1920s especially in alternative educational settings in the
German-speaking area of Europe (e.g., Freinet pedagogy). Under the term
"Schreibwerkstatt," the concept of guided group work in process writing saw a
renaissance in the 1980s and is an integrated conceptual aspect of today's writ-
ing centers throughout the educational pyramid.

   Based on this precedent, Katrin Girgensohn (2007) developed and thor-
oughly assessed a concept for autonomous writing groups in higher education,
which forms one of the main pillars of the writing center at the Europe Uni-
versity Viadrina in Frankfurt/Oder (Germany, http://www.europa-uni.de/de/
campus/hilfen/schreibzentrum/index.html). Girgensohn merits recognition for
strengthening the self-dependent aspect of the original writing group approach
of the Reform Pedagogy by maintaining the potential of peer learning and col-
laboration (Bruffee, 1984) and the pedagogical power of learner communities
(Lave & Wenger, 1991). Meanwhile, Girgensohn's concept has been adopted
by several German-speaking universities (see also my interview with Katrin Gir-
gensohn in this book)

              Tendency 6: Support of Other Study Skills

   Universities not only started to realize the importance of facilitating writing
and writers but also the development of other key competences of academic
work, e.g., reading, e-learning, digital text production, language learning, learn-
ing to learn, plus competences to safeguard success in entering the profession
(e.g., writing of proposals and applications). Competences that directly influ-
ence the quality of academic writing have been central aims not only of writing
centers but also of academic skills centers or language centers. The latter institu-
tion sometimes emerges from an existing writing center, as it may be the case in
the near future at the University of Education in Berne (Switzerland), or out of
original plans to pursue a writing center, as seen at the University of Freiburg
(Germany). Which format the institution supporting writing and writers finally
adopts often depends on long-term strategic decisions and goals, as can be wit-
nessed at the Language Center of the Technical University of Darmstadt, where
research and development of concepts of multilingualism clearly dominate the
way academic writers are being supported within the "SchreibCenter" and the
Online Writing Lab (http://www.owl.tu-darmstadt.de).

       Tendency 7: Writing Projects with External Partners

   This tendency is currently most often seen within teacher colleges and uni-
versities of education, where the goal of so-called "double literacy" is at stake:
both mastering one's own academic writing process and knowing how to sup-
port writing development and text production of others. Projects that, on the
one hand, meet an immediate need of the external partner, but also provide
an opportunity for the university (students and faculty) to develop academic
knowledge and professional skills, have been proven very useful. In addition
to meeting a current need of the external partner (e.g., secondary school),
they also provide incentive to ponder possibilities of sustainable development
in at least two directions: to perpetuate a well-designed and assessed project
and to gain new theoretical insights. A very powerful example for this ten-
dency can be seen at http://www.ph-freiburg.de/schreibzentrum ("Laufende
Projekte") under the rubric of "Zeitung in der Schule," where, together with
a regional newspaper, projects in journalistic writing are being offered to lo-
cal high schools. Results of this project also feed into another project (see
"Internet-Zeitung"), a multilingual online newsletter for which students write
about their experiences in dealing with different cultures and languages. Both
projects provide excellent material for research on journalistic writing as a
tool for discursive mobility (Monroe, 2002) and (pre-)academic writing. They
also provide concrete incentive for bridging the gap between writing in high
schools and at the university and for the training of peer writing tutors at the
university writing center and at the writing centers of the participating high
schools (Bräuer, 2003, 2006).

   The largest initiative in the collaboration between colleges/universities and
secondary schools so far in the German-speaking area is "Scriptorium" (Bräuer,
2009, Scriptorium, 2010). This network of about 50 online training courses
for in-service teachers in literacy, partially provided in French, English, Italian,
Finnish, Danish, Dutch, Spanish, and German, is a powerful way to find out
the needs of international writing/reading support in and beyond the German-
speaking area. International collaborators of this network--teaching faculty in
primary, secondary, and/or higher education--share research findings and their
rich experience in learning and instruction.

                   Tendency 8: Self-learning Material

   Self-learning material presented to writers either in print or digital form
often provides deep insight into the accomplishments of an institutional struc-
ture geared toward facilitating writing and writers. In a number of writing cen-

                                                                                                477
Bräuer

ters (e.g., see websites of writing centers in Bielefeld, Bochum, Frankfurt/Oder,
Freiburg) self-learning material is being developed collaboratively by members
of each writing center team. This procedure helps to shape not only the under-
standing of the individual writing tutors but also the mission of the institution-
al entity. When self-learning material becomes used and assessed purposefully,
it provides valuable information for further developing tutoring strategies and
the overall format of the writing center.

   There is also an effort to move toward online writing labs (OWLs) in Ger-
man-speaking higher education, which perform as a website with a carefully
developed structure that leaves no single self-learning document without clearly
defined didactical purpose and reference to other material. OWLs can be an
efficient way of facilitating large numbers of students and/or students from dif-
ferent campuses, as seen at the University of Education of Northwestern Swit-
zerland (http://www.schreiben.zentrumlesen.ch). This OWL works as a point
of reference for both students and faculty; the didactical connection between
the two sets of self-learning materials is carefully constructed. Ideally, using the
student materials will be encouraged in class and as part of class-based tasks
designed by the teaching faculty.

           Tendency 9: Web 2.0 Tools for Text Production

   A very special tendency can be seen in the use of WebQuests, an HTML
structure which provides a compact framework for digital writing/learning ar-
rangements. The writing center at the University of Education Freiburg (Bräuer
& Schindler, 2011; SchreibQuest, 2010) and the University of Flensburg
(Trepkau, 2010) (both located in Germany) provide insight into the pedagogi-
cal possibilities of focusing and contextualizing self-learning material online.
Another web 2.0 tool, wikis, have developed growing impact in academic text
production and, therefore, receives more and more attention within the teach-
ing of academic writing, e.g., at the German universities in Greifswald (Endres
2010), and Dortmund (Beißwenger & Storrer 2010), as well as at the Swiss
universities in Luzern and Rapperswil (Frischherz & Verhein 2010).

                Tendency 10: Writing Centers Taking on
                      the Role of Literacy Managers

   Assessing one's own conceptual development and daily practice with regard
to literacy management has been a key issue of the writing center movement in
higher education in the German-speaking area since the late 1990s. This can
be seen in the following key publications on different issues of literacy manage-

ment: Bräuer (1998), Björk, Bräuer, Rienecker, and Stray Jörgensen (2003),
Abraham, Kupfer-Schreiner, and Maiwald, ( 2005), Kruse, Berger, and Ulmi
(2006), Berning, Keßler, and Koch (2006), Doleschal and Gruber (2007),
Frank, Haacke, and Lahm (2007), Jakobs, Lehnen, and Schindler (2010) and
Bräuer and Schindler (2011). Due to this intense practice-based research, writ-
ing centers in specific, but also writing programs and other literacy initiatives,
have a significant impact on certain aspects of institutional development. A few
examples of this impact can be found in this book (see chapters by Otto Kruse,
Helmut Gruber, Daniel Perrin, Ursula Doleschal) that either enhanced WAC
and/or WID structures or the development of tutoring writing and writers. At
the Technical University of Darmstadt, the work of writing center people, such
as Sandra Ballweg, sparked a project for developing an e-portfolio concept to
further enhance learning, instruction, and assessment procedures throughout
the university (Ballweg, Scholz, Richter, & Bruder, 2011).

                      Tendency 11: Writing Research

   Also based on reflective practice carried out by writing centers as literacy
managers, a broad range of research topics has emerged during the past decade.
Some of the most recent research fields that are directly related to facilitating
writing and writers include online/digital writing, the effectiveness of peer-tu-
toring of writing, procedural details of literacy management, aspects of L2-text
production, influence of culture and domain on writing and writers, writer
types and pedagogical consequences, and reflective practice (learning journal,
e-portfolio). Nevertheless, direct collaboration between the writing center and
writing researchers in combined research-development projects is still rare.

                               CONCLUSION

   My concluding thoughts adhere to the central concern of literacy manage-
ment under the circumstances and ways people both deal and interact with
information and with others in the processing of information. I base this con-
clusion on the assumption that the academy aims for a better understanding
of both theory and practice. The academy, embedded in research methodol-
ogy, observes and describes reality, raises and answers questions to achieve new
insights that are being used further in this continuing interplay of theory and
practice. For the development of academic literacy in institutions of higher
education in the German-speaking countries, I see the following two somewhat
contradicting tendencies.

                                                                                                479

                 Stuck in a Traditional Role of Writing

   The role of writing within the academy in the German-speaking area has been
affected by the long-lived spirit of the Early Enlightenment of the eighteenth
century, which views the writer as a medium through which inspiration speaks
in a strong voice leading to an immediate result: a text with a clear message to its
readers. This basic understanding of writing can still be witnessed in many differ-
ent facets of the German-speaking academy--in some respects starker than ever,
at least in places where the Bologna Reform has been misunderstood as "stream-
lining" what in the past was considered "individualized" learning through trial
and error over too many semesters of college. This influence is true especially
when the modularization of competency-based instruction now leads not only
to a reduction in the number of individual writing tasks, but even to the elimi-
nation of entire task arrangements that, in the past, helped to shape academic
literacy even if only through trial and error. Optional learning arrangements of
the past, including short seminar papers and study group discussions, including
summaries and commentaries eventually leading to an extensive end-of semester
paper, are now often being replaced by large lecture classes with written exams
as the only form of comprehensive writing--and even that expedience is elimi-
nated when the test is conceptualized as multiple-choice.

   In such a constellation, the institution will not see any incentive in the near
future to change the role of writing into a learning tool that needs to be acquired
through formal instruction and through different, individualized practices in
the daily classroom. To see institutions act alternatively probably requires their
sudden realization--a wakeup call--of the shrinking quality in learning and
instructional outcomes based on the written exams and the final thesis. Unfor-
tunately, since written exams often do not unveil contextualized understanding
of the learner, and the final thesis in many universities of the German-speaking
area does not count substantially in the final grade, I doubt that some institu-
tions will, for now, even bother looking at the quality of academic literacy.

              The Alternative: Less-structured Learning
                      that Fulfills Individual Needs

   The other tendency which can be witnessed since the Bologna reform start-
ed to unfold in German-speaking higher education is pointing in quite a dif-
ferent direction. With the support of mostly extra-curricular initiatives such as
centers for writing, language, or academic skills, a growing number of students
engage in a more informal, less-structured learning that feeds their real indi-
vidual needs. As authentic, self-responsive learners, they decide whether they

480
                                                                         Academic Literacy Development

participate in an extra-curricular activity or not. This role has been experienced
by many students recently as refreshing and stimulating, especially in contrast
with the role they are supposed to play in a rigidly planned course of study in
modularized BA and MA programs. This is a broad claim. However, one simple
result from the Freiburg Writing Center underlines this value: the number of
participants in writing workshops has doubled since the implementation of a
modularized curriculum. Many of them, when being asked why they partici-
pate, express motives like those of the student quoted here:

         In this workshop I can pick up competences unavailable in
         seminars and lectures but that are actually needed in order to
         make full use of the instruction. I also like the idea that these
         workshops are being offered several times during the semester
         so that I can participate whenever I need them (and even
         come back if necessary).

   Part of this second tendency is also the recognition from the teaching faculty
that they actually need students with basic academic literacy skills from early on
in their college careers in order to apply the modularized curriculum approach
successfully. As a result, faculty either develop their own methods of writing in-
struction--often in some form of peer learning--in order to support their own
teaching, or they make conscious use of the extra-curricular offerings provided
by the institution, such as writing workshops and peer tutoring.

   Another form of realization from the teaching faculty perspective is that the
student's performance shown in an exam is a limited example of this person's
learning effort and success. Here, portfolios have started to be used at least as a
complementary form of evaluation, often including peer assessment.

   There is a specific tendency coming from institutions of teacher training
and the effort that can be witnessed there with regard to strengthening "double
literacy" --the ability to write well and to facilitate others (peers and pupils
in primary and secondary schools) to write well. This focus on double literacy
has begun to show concrete results on the institutional level (e.g., portfolios
as an officially recognized form of assessment) and in intensified collaboration
with primary and secondary schools in the field of literacy development, often
through peer learning and peer tutoring.

   To conclude, it can be said that, even though a thorough realization and

development of academic writers. It appears that, by means of extra-curricular
activities, incentives are being placed that could lead, in the near future, not
only to curricular change but also to a different culture of writing at the center
of a different culture of learning and instruction. With a new generation of
writers, informed and trained through writing programs and writing centers
in secondary education, these tendencies will, hopefully, be strengthened and
shaped further. As already witnessed in part during the massive student protest
in 2010 throughout Austria, Germany and Switzerland, these students are go-
ing to demand places, structures, and resources in the academy to further de-
velop writing competence as a necessary basis for success at the university and
in their future professional careers. These students seem ready to take action,
not least in the form of peer learning through writing that could again become
a catalyst for institutional change in the future.

SECTION ESSAY: WHO TAKES
CARE OF WRITING IN LATIN
AMERICAN AND SPANISH
UNIVERSITIES?

By Paula Carlino
CONICET--University of Buenos Aires (Argentina)

This section essay briefly presents the Latin American and Spanish ini-
tiatives that are part of this volume. Before providing a general view of
what is being done in regards to writing at Latin American and Span-
ish universities, I offer an account of my participation in the collective
project that made this book possible. I first present my journey as a pro-
fessor who strove to integrate reading and writing in an Educational
Psychology course. I do this with the aim of offering an additional
perspective on how certain university teachers in the region decide to
help students read and write in their content courses, despite the lack of
institutional support. In addition, my own story includes some sugges-
tions on how to use this book, a topic I will return to in the conclusion.

       HOW I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS BOOK: A LATIN
           AMERICAN TEACHER'S JOURNEY TO WAC

   My participation in this book is rooted in my own enthusiasm and will-
ingness to contribute to documenting, gathering, and communicating what is
done with writing at the university level around the world. Through my per-
sonal history, I will explain how this enthusiasm was born.

   In 1997 I started including in my Educational Psychology classes several
reading and writing tasks to help students better understand the subject I was
teaching. In order to do this, I had to learn from others. At that time, I did
not know anyone who would do this in an explicit and systematic manner.
Many professors in the social sciences did ask for a lot of reading and writing in
their courses, but few of them oriented students to how to do it. When peda-

gogical assistance was provided, it tended to be sporadic and insufficient. I had
never heard of the Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) or Writing in the
Disciplines (WID) movements. The universe of ideas proposed by WAC/WID
authors was simply out of my reach, since during my undergraduate studies in
Argentina or my graduate studies in Spain I never came across these readings.

   However, my Psychology of Learning background had shown me that no-
body learns just by receiving information in a passive way. Nobody learns by be-
ing a mere receiver of a given body of knowledge. Knowledge, in research and in
learning, is not there to be taken. Instead, it needs to be created and recreated:
the researcher creates knowledge and the students create their knowledge. None
of them, researcher or student, receives knowledge that has been preformed.
This is the epistemological essence of constructivism (Castorina, 2001; Ferreiro,
1999; Piaget & García, 1982).

   According to this principle, it did not make sense to organize my classes
around lectures only. I had to plan class activities and assignments that would
get undergraduates to participate at both cognitive and social levels. I wanted
to do so not as an extension of my teaching but as a core activity. I would help
them work throughout the semester and not only during the week of the exam.

   My graduate work on literacy was of great assistance to me in this task. The
socio-cognitive activities that would lead students to learn the subject involved
reading, writing, and exchanging ideas about the course concepts. Under cer-
tain conditions, reading and writing can prompt an intense cognitive activity
(Bazerman et al., 2005; Langer & Applebee, 1987; Scardamalia & Bereiter,
1985; Wells, 1987) and I was attempting to recreate these conditions. But I
would not just require those tasks without offering further guidance. I knew
students needed to be oriented and receive feedback, since they were newcom-
ers to the field and therefore would be somewhat lost without this support. I
had often heard professors complain, "Students don't know how to write. They
don't understand what they read--they don't read." Instead, I was convinced
that many students did not do what teachers were expecting of them because
they did not know how.

   As a result, I decided to organize activities in a way that would allow stu-
dents to participate. Thus, I guided students and provided feedback while they
completed such activities as discussing readings, making connections among
texts, and reviewing what they had written (Dysthe, 1996): all this, with the
aim of helping them gradually understand the ideas of the course. By reading
and writing about the subject, they could recreate the knowledge for them-
selves, something that a teacher could not directly transmit to them.

   In brief, these literate activities were integrated into the course to help stu-
dents understand and study its contents. Along the way, however, I discovered

486
                           Who Takes Care of Writing in Latin American and Spanish Universities?

that these activities also contributed to another equally relevant purpose: help-
ing students acquire new ways of thinking, making an argument, debating,
explaining, and writing on topics related to the field. I realized that supporting
their participation in literate tasks had led me to inadvertently teach a new
content: how to interpret and produce the discourse of the discipline I was
teaching.

        QUESTIONS THAT A TEACHER ASKS HERSELF

   During this journey, I began to ask myself: How best could I approach these
goals? What writing and reading assignments should I ask from the students,
and what kinds of help should I provide? How much time should I allocate for
these activities and how much should I spend lecturing? How would these tasks
relate to the exams? And above all, who could I learn from? There were other
questions as well: How much time would I devote to design and implement
these activities? Would I be able to do this in a work context in which I was
totally alone and lacking institutional support? With whom could I share my
experiences and discuss them?

   I came up with two answers. On the one hand, I began an extensive In-
ternet search in order to find out how professors from universities around the
world were dealing with similar issues. I discovered the Australian Learning and
Teaching Centres, the WAC programs in the United States, full text versions of
conference papers, and countless websites where teaching practices were docu-
mented in detail. Entranced, I took on this task as a methodical exploration
that lasted for two years. Whenever I found something relevant, I read it, and
one website led to another. I selected, printed out, and organized materials, put-
ting together a library of resources and a list of new links to continue exploring.
As I went along, I decided what materials could help my teaching, and I modi-
fied them to try out in my classes. The response to my first set of questions was
the following: I was going to learn to include work with reading and writing in
my classes by testing variations of what other university professors had done,
documented, and published on the Internet.

   On the other hand, the response to the second set of questions was to turn
my teaching into a research activity as well (Hutchings & Shulman, 1999). I
first planned to make my Internet searches systematic and to categorize my dis-
coveries about what was being done in distant lands. This later became part of
the theoretical framework of a six-year action research project in which I docu-
mented and critically examined my own teaching practice. In addition, I wrote
about all of this, presented at conferences, and submitted papers for publishing.

                                                                                                487
Carlino

Written "conversations" with my readers and with authors who had inspired
me were very encouraging, since I did not have any close peers from whom I
could learn and by whom I could feel supported. I did find this support from
colleagues from different countries. Therefore, reading and publishing not only
fueled my research but also my teaching.

   I decided to publish in Spanish, because it was difficult for me to write in
English and because I hoped to spark dialogue in my own milieu. Looking
back, this is how I would summarize my work for a period of six years (Carlino,
2005). This was my personal incentive for investing time and effort, though I
expected to reap the benefits in terms of both my teaching and my potential
contributions to the debates in the Writing Across the Curriculum field.

           WHAT THIS STORY TELLS ABOUT OTHER
                    TEACHERS IN IBEROAMERICA

   I have shared my personal story because I believe it can help readers under-
stand the context of teachers in many Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries.
In these countries, professors face similar isolation in their academic contexts:
limited institutional resources, scant activities for professional development,
and a lack of knowledge of the epistemic power of writing and of WAC/WID
programs in the English-speaking world.

   I believe that the questions mentioned in the previous section are critical
to encourage content course professors to care for how their students read and
write. These are questions that all institutions should address in order to imple-
ment cross-curricular writing initiatives. The first set of questions--"How best
could I approach these goals? . . . who can I learn from?" --refers to how a
professor whose first and foremost subject is not reading or writing can learn
ways to develop and actually integrate these activities in the classroom. The
second set of questions--"How much time would I devote to design and imple-
ment these activities? . . . With whom could I share my experiences and discuss
them?" --is about how to sustain such activities over time if a professor is alone
and has no support or institutional recognition.

   The following section describes profiles included in this book that show
different initiatives that emerged from the personal conviction of their authors
rather than from institutional policies--though some of them later gained uni-
versity support. As a whole, the book explores both sets of questions and reveals
that more than one path can be taken within different institutional contexts.

   When I found out about Chris Thaiss' project, a project for researching,
compiling, and disseminating the experiences of teaching writing and teaching

488
                           Who Takes Care of Writing in Latin American and Spanish Universities?

with writing at universities across the world, I was thrilled. This book is part
of the project, and I am sure it will be useful to many professors who not only
want to integrate literacy work in their classes but also need to learn how to do
so from others. In addition, I am convinced that the ideas brought here by each
author will pave the way for institutions in our countries to understand that we
will not get very far unless professors are accompanied in this challenge.

      "DO NOTHING," "REMEDIAL," OR INTEGRATED
         MODELS IN IBEROAMERICAN UNIVERSITIES

   In order to introduce the chapters on Latin America and the one on Spain,
I will give an overview of what is happening in these places. According to the
responses to the International WAC/WID Mapping Survey (see Thaiss essay in
this volume) and the works presented at regional conferences, there is common
concern about how university students read and write. This concern is what
inspired the initiatives described in these chapters. Since the 1990s, different
actions have been taken, some on the periphery and some more integrated.
However, unlike what occurs in the US and Australia, Latin American and
Spanish universities have fewer experiences and less institutional involvement
for addressing questions concerning academic writing.

   If we considered the classification of initiatives proposed by Skillen, Merten,
Trivett, and Percy (1998)--the "do nothing" model, the "remedial" model, and
the integrated model--we would include what generally occurs in the region
in the second model. However, there are some isolated initiatives that repre-
sent the integrated model; in some countries the "do nothing" model is still
predominant.

   Regarding the "do nothing" model, Solé, Teberosky, and Castelló's essay
(this volume) explains why Spanish universities and teachers often neglect writ-
ing instruction. They generally hold the belief that "learning oral and written
language occurs only in the first few years of compulsory education; this belief
leads oral and written language to be treated as an `object' of knowledge in these
early stages. Thereafter, these capacities acquire the status of learning `instru-
ments' (and lose their former status)." It is also assumed that "oral and writ-
ten language, as communication and (to a lesser extent) representation tools,
remain invariable throughout a person's life, while what varies are the situations
in which these tools are `applied'" (Solé, Teberosky & Castelló, this volume).

   Similarly, in the "remedial" model, writing is seen as an autonomous code,
ruled by universal conventions and with the normative level (spelling and gram-
mar) appearing as its most visible attribute. Writing and reading, once dispos-

                                                                                                489

sessed of their social nature, are often conceived of as general abilities that can
be transferred to any context, as noted by Russell (1990). It is believed that
these skills can be taught and learned in ad hoc curricular spaces, dissociated
from the spheres in which reading and writing are required for specific pur-
poses. In such spaces, the contents related to reading and writing are generally
presented through exercises that break down and transfigure the real literate
practices in order to teach them divorced from their situated uses.

   For example, a recent survey done in Argentina (Carlino, Iglesia & Laxalt,
2010) found that 90% of 544 teachers across the higher education curriculum
recognized that their students found it difficult to "read comprehensively and
write clearly" in their courses. When asked what was done at the institutional
level, 29% of the respondents stated that their institutions dealt with these
problems and explained what was done. The most frequently mentioned initia-
tives were workshops and entry courses. Similarly, Fernandez Fastuca's (2010)
study showed that ad hoc initial courses greatly predominated over other insti-
tutional initiatives. Carlino et al.'s (2010) survey also explored whether profes-
sors did something about their students' literacy problems, with 28% of the fac-
ulty declaring that they addressed reading and/or writing in content courses and
describing what they did. Most commonly, professors' interventions took place
at the "margins" of the literate assignments, with professors requesting tasks,
giving guidelines, teaching writing techniques at the beginning, and assessing
students' final products at the end. A smaller group of professors declared that
they intervened during the writing process, devoting class time to literate tasks.
Within this group, a reduced number of respondents explained that they pro-
moted teacher-student interaction around disciplinary literacy.

   In other words, very few of the professors in the sample discussed readings
with their students, commented on their drafts, or mentioned teacher feedback
as well as peer interaction as part of their classes. These results confirm what was
found in a previous qualitative inquiry with university students and teachers
(Carlino, 2010). The author found that although literate assignments were very
common in Social Science courses in Argentine universities, professors rarely
offered support for how to do them: guidelines were rare and feedback minimal.

   In sum, those initiatives that address literacy in Argentine higher education
institutions tend to take place outside the content areas and are dissociated
from them. They are based on the idea that students can then transfer such
learning to reading and writing in their disciplines. In addition, most profes-
sors in the disciplines require and assess students' reading and writing, but very
few of them consider these practices as an object of their instruction. When
they intervene, they often do so at the periphery of the assignments. Although
these findings come from Argentina, they are consistent with what is usually

490

presented regarding other Spanish-speaking countries in regional conferences
and journals.

                  INITIATIVES IN IBEROAMERICA

   In the following paragraphs I review the Latin American and Spanish initia-
tives, some of which are included in this book.

                               Writing Courses

   Writing courses are the most frequent initiatives developed by tertiary in-
stitutions (Carlino, Iglesia & Laxalt, 2010; Fernandez Fastuca, 2010). These
courses vary in length and are usually confined to the first year of the programs
(Gonzalez, this volume) or required as entry courses at the undergraduate level
(e.g., Narvaja, Di Stefano & Pereira, 2002). In addition, some universities of-
fer writing courses at the graduate level (Carlino, 2008, and in press; Motta-
Roth this volume; Solé, Teberosky & Castelló, this volume). Two theoretical
viewpoints underpin writing courses: the remedial basic-skills approach and the
genre-based developmental approach.

   In the remedial basic-skills approach, writing is taught as an autonomous
object of study, "a single universally applicable skill, largely unrelated to `con-
tent,' [...] a separate and independent technique" (Russell, 1990, p. 55). As a
result, students are expected to transfer this general writing skill to different
disciplinary assignments.

   In the genre-based developmental approach, on the other hand, writing is
not taught as a generic skill but in context. Based on a situated learning per-
spective, writing courses are designed to help in the production of texts in a
particular discipline, for a specific audience. Therefore, students have several
opportunities to draft, receive feedback, and redraft their texts (e.g., Carlino,
in press; Motta-Roth, this volume). It is along these lines that Solé et al. (this
volume) highlight the importance of the length of postgraduate seminars to al-
low for nurturing the learning processes involved in academic communication.

         Nevertheless, despite the fact that longer courses seem to be more
encompassing, there is a potential problem associated with undergraduate or
graduate programs offering writing courses: supporting student writing might
fall only on the writing teacher's shoulders. Therefore, professors teaching
content courses might not be held responsible for helping students to develop
their writing--and those teaching writing courses most probably will experi-
ence a sense of insufficiency and isolation (González, this volume).

                                                                                                491
Carlino

                               Writing Centers

   The idea of a writing center with writing tutors is usually not known in
Latin American or Spanish universities. Even the notion of receiving feedback,
as a low-stakes reader's response to a student-author's text, is rare. Neverthe-
less, a handful of initiatives have appeared in recent years in countries such as
Mexico (e.g., Galán Vélez & Ormsby, 2010) and Colombia (Molina, 2008). In
addition, the history of the Puerto Rican writing center that García-Arroyo and
Quintana offer in this volume exemplifies some of the difficulties that this type
of initiative might face. Finally, most of the writing centers in Latin American
and Spanish universities are based on the North American model and were pre-
ceded by local staff visiting several writing centers in the US.

   Writing centers, as an expression of the WAC movement, should reach the
writing done in the disciplines. However, in our region they are still seen by
many professors as a remedial service to fix students' sentence-level problems.
This is related to how writing is conceived. If writing is considered as a mere
surface form dissociated from content, it is therefore confined to the writing
center's domain, with few content-course professors taking care of it (García-
Arroyo & Quintana, this volume).

                            Faculty Development

   Other initiatives in Latin America aim at raising awareness among content-
course professors and instructors regarding the feasibility of dealing with stu-
dents' literacy in their own courses. To challenge commonsense assumptions,
these initiatives discuss what literacy consists of, how reading and writing are
learned, and why they may have an epistemic power, as well as whether they
should be taught at the university level and across disciplines. At the same time,
faculty development workshops show participants the most fruitful ways of
assigning reading or writing and giving feedback to students. Thus, professors
from various disciplines are helped to integrate literate assignments in their
teaching with the aim of increasing students' learning in a specific field. These
experiences are worth noting since they try to make all the disciplines responsi-
ble for supporting student academic literacy instead of confining it in a separate
curricular space (writing course) or service (writing center tutoring).

   However, since faculty development seminars are usually offered for only
a few hours over a couple of months (e.g., Benvegnu, 2004; Marucco, 2004;
Narvaez, this volume) and sometimes have an even shorter duration, professors
are left on their own to put into practice what is theoretically discussed during
the sessions.

   For example, Narváez (this volume) questions whether the length and for-
mat of these seminars can affect teachers' instructional practices. The generally
tight format in which most of the faculty development workshops are presented
seems to be detrimental to this end. To overcome this limitation, Carlino &
Martinez (2009) offered guidance as part of the process of changing cross-cur-
ricular instructional practices. Working with professors from various disciplines
to help them integrate reading and writing in their classes, the authors ap-
proached the provision of faculty development as collective action-research for
two years.

   Excepting some very short workshops, these initiatives do not originate from
university-wide policies, but from the determination of individual academic de-
velopers. As a consequence, they are sporadic, discontinuous, and reach few fac-
ulty members. In contrast, the next paragraph describes a unique institutional
program in the region that promotes faculty development that accompanies
teachers for longer periods of time.

                                Team Teaching

   The essay by Moyano and Natale (this volume) depicts a writing program
that offers assistance to course-content faculty over an 18-month period to inte-
grate the teaching of writing into their courses. To achieve this integrative goal,
the program fosters interdisciplinary partnerships between writing instructors
and class professors. They collaboratively construct an inventory of genres and
skills necessary for the course and design how to teach them. The writing in-
structor participates in the class on selected occasions to analyze with students
the required genres. Three or four times a semester, for a minimum of three
semesters, the class professor and the writing instructor work together until the
professor is able to do the job alone.

   This writing-across-the-curriculum program is a rare case in Latin America
and Spain because it has gained clear institutional support to help students
learn writing in context in all the subjects throughout the four years of study. It
also contributes to faculty development through interdisciplinary collaboration.

   It is worth noting that this example of team teaching resembles the Austra-
lian IDEALL project (Purser, Skillen, Deane, Donohue & Peake, 2008; Skillen
et al., 1998;). Both initiatives take into account the principles of the "systemic
approach: the shift in focus from working outside the curriculum to one that
addresses the issues inside the curriculum [...] by collaborating with discipline
staff; the importance of working at the faculty and department level to make
these collaborations strategic; and the need to participate in and impact upon
policy decisions" (Percy & Skillen, 2000).

                                                                                                493

      Writing Instruction Interwoven in Disciplinary Courses

   Although faculty development actions are sporadic and limited, and team-
based teaching is exceptional, there are some Iberoamerican professors who help
develop student literacy in their content courses without any institutional sup-
port. Most of them have a Psychology, Education or Linguistics background.
They draw on this knowledge to develop creative ways to enhance learning by
offering guidance and feedback during the regular reading and writing tasks
implemented in their classrooms (e.g., Carlino, 2005; Fernandez et al, 2004;
Narváez, this volume; Padilla & Carlino, 2010; Vázquez & Jacob, 2007). They
"interweave" literate activities through their courses and organize their classes
to intervene during the processes of reading and writing. This concept contrasts
with that of professors who only "sew" literate tasks on to their courses and in-
tervene in a "peripheral" way, just requiring and assessing writing assignments.
While in the "interwoven model" (Carlino, Iglesia & Laxalt, 2010) the profes-
sor helps students take part in the study practices she/he considers necessary to
learn the subject, in the "sewed model" students are supposed to already have
the necessary knowledge to do so on their own. The way professors in the disci-
plines include writing and reading in their classes--as integrated or intertwined
activities or as added or sewed-on foreign elements--has clear consequences
for the quality and equity of education. In the first case, the method nurtures
the development of disciplinary literacy, while in the latter the method just
demands it.

   De Micheli and Iglesia (this volume) provide an unusual illustration of
the interwoven writing model in a Biology course. They not only assign mi-
crothemes, in which students have to make connections among disciplinary
concepts, but usually devote class time to collectively plan or review students'
texts. They also give them quick written feedback, only assigning a grade in ex-
ams. In this way, students are given beforehand several opportunities to practice
and receive feedback on the type of writing that later they will be required to do
in the exams (for example, explaining practical situations through relating key
concepts). Thus, they have the opportunity to study biology with the support of
their teachers, who have also responded to their successive brief essays.

   Experiences like this promote faculty-student and peer interaction around
disciplinary literacy, constituting an example of dialogic teaching strategies
(Dysthe, 1996). In the interwoven model, written assignments help students
learn disciplinary content and go beyond just being a means of assessment.
Students receive teacher support during the process of reading and writing,
which allows them to understand the subject and, at the same time, develop
their literacy. Furthermore, intertwining literate tasks in the courses leads to

494
                           Who Takes Care of Writing in Latin American and Spanish Universities?

avoiding teacher-centered classes and encourages students to take a more active
role in the course.

   Finally, it is worth mentioning that since interwoven writing strategies
are usually time-consuming, teachers who adopt this model often study their
practices as part of their research commitment. Otherwise, it is very difficult
for these faculty to sustain these teaching practices, especially with numerous
students.

                               CONCLUSION

         Latin American and Spanish universities have recently begun to ad-
dress students' academic literacy needs. The essays by De Micheli and Iglesia,
García-Arroyo and Quintana, González, Motta-Roth, Moyano and Natale,
Narváez, and Solé et al. in this volume illustrate some of the most relevant
initiatives collected in their countries. The essays show both the strong com-
mitment by their authors and the irregular support by their institutions. It is
in this regard that these profiles, as well as the whole book, can inspire teach-
ers and institutions to develop their own ways of addressing literacy across the
curriculum. The variety of examples and details offered by the authors in these
pages will aid readers in foreseeing some challenges and opportunities. These
vicarious experiences could encourage readers to experiment within their
circumstances without beginning from zero.

   Besides, the book can raise our awareness about what is being done or
neglected in our own universities regarding students' writing. The range of
perspectives presented over these chapters will hopefully allow us to see with
fresh eyes what is done or not in our own institutional settings and acknowl-
edge that what is occurring is just an option among others, and not some-
thing natural or necessary. This contrast will help us denaturalize familiar
practices and open them to critique. Furthermore, the collection of profiles in
this volume will be useful toward our questioning the ways of doing (or not
doing) established in our institutions and perhaps inspire our advocating for
institutional changes to better support the development of students' academic
reading and writing.

SECTION ESSAY: REFLECTING
ON WHAT CAN BE GAINED
FROM COMPARING MODELS
OF ACADEMIC WRITING
PROVISION

By Lisa Ganobcsik-Williams
Coventry University (England)

The purpose of this section essay is to consider a central question raised
by the Writing Programs Worldwide anthology and articulated in
Chris Thaiss' "Introduction" to this volume. This question is, to what
extent is it useful for those working in higher education to be aware
of writing practices and models of academic writing provision in place
at higher education institutions in other national contexts? To explore
this question, I will then use examples of academic development work
from profiles in this project from universities in the UK, Ireland, Aus-
tralia, New Zealand, Belgium, and France.

   My own earliest reflections on how academic writing is learned and taught
at the tertiary level in different countries occurred when I was an American
exchange student at a British university in the 1980s.1 Having been allocated
reading lists and assigned essays to write, I was told by the academics teaching
the courses I was taking, as well as by fellow students, that as far as writing
was concerned I just needed "to get on with it." I found this experience, dur-
ing which I grappled to understand what was expected of me as a writer and
throughout which I struggled to write, to be in marked contrast to the pedagogy
of the composition classes I had been required to take in my first year of study
at a US university. In these classes, assignment structures, expectations, and
argumentation were discussed and drafting processes scaffolded and monitored.

   The experience of being a student writer in a foreign higher education system
in which writing was not visibly taught proved to be a pivotal moment for me.
Because of this experience, I came to recognise the need for students to become

DOI: https://doi.org/10.37514/PER-B.2012.0346.2.42                          499
Ganobcsik-Williams

independent writers and to realise that students can be assisted in maturing as
academic writers through explicit instruction and guided practice in writing. I
carried this experience of learning to write academically, and of understanding
that students can be assisted in learning to write academically, back with me
to the US university at which I was studying; I became a peer writing tutor at
the university's writing center while completing my undergraduate degree. As
a student writing tutor, I began to understand more fully how fundamental
writing support for university students is, and how empowering for students
individualised attention to their writing can be (Borg & Deane, 2010). As an
American writing tutor, I also realised that writing teaching, or "writing devel-
opment work" as I later came to know it in the British context, can aid tutors
and teachers themselves in improving as writers, communicators, and critical
thinkers. (see, for example, Alpen, Breford & Tschirpke (2011); Devet, 2011;
and Girgensohn, 2011).

   Reflecting on my experience, however, led me to understand that the solu-
tion to supporting students as writers in various national higher education con-
texts was not simply to import models of writing instruction. As an American
student in a UK university, I had not been looking for a composition class, but
for guidance on expectations for writing in a higher education culture in which,
at that time, students learned to write (or didn't) through acculturation.

   When, in the 1990s, I began working in a UK university as a researcher
and teacher of Academic Writing, I learned that this topic was not just some-
thing with which I was preoccupied, but that international interest in com-
paring models of writing instruction was growing. Professional organisations
such as the European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing (EA-
TAW), the European Writing Centres Association (EWCA), and the Writing
Development in Higher Education Network (WDHE) were being formed,
and their biennial conferences, as well as the 2001 University of Warwick
Writing Programme conference on "Teaching Writing in Higher Education,"
were attracting international delegates who were interested in sharing models
and practices for teaching writing.2 This interest was also beginning to surface
at the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCCs),
the major US-based conference for college and university writing teachers
and scholars that has been held annually since 1949, as shown, for example,
in the panel "Transnational Goals and Practices of Composition: An Inter-
national Exchange" (Ede et al., 2002) and the half-day workshop "Chang-
ing Places: An International Exchange on the Teaching of College Writing"
(Ede et al., 2003). Intellectual curiosity was also leading to collaborations on
cross-cultural funded writing research and development projects such as the
"Developing Academic Literacy in Context" (DALiC) project, "a comparative

500

curriculum development exercise [. . .] involving a group of academic literacy
specialists in the UK, the US and Australia" (Purser et al., 2008), which fo-
cused on the application, in different higher education contexts, of an embed-
ded model of academic literacy teaching and learning that had emerged in
Australian higher education (Skillen & Mahoney, 1997; Skillen et al., 1998
and 1999).

   Articles published in English comparing both pedagogical and institution-
al approaches to developing students' writing in higher education in various
countries were also beginning to appear. Examples of these, whose compara-
tive nature is evident in their titles, include, "Learning from--Not Duplicat-
ing--US Composition Theory and Practice" (Mullin, 2006), "If not Rhetoric
and Composition, then What? Teaching Teachers to Teach Writing" (Murray,
2006), "Peering Across the Pond: the Role of Students in Developing Other
Students' Writing in the US and UK" (Devet et al., 2006), and "Writing Center
Tutor Training: What is Transferable across Academic Cultures?" (Santa, 2009).
Articles such as these explored and questioned specific instances of "importing"
and "exporting" writing instruction models from one national higher education
culture to another.3

   In her article "'Internationalization' and Composition Studies: Reorienting
the Discourse," Donahue (2009) further theorised the "import/export" con-
cept of cultural exchange of writing pedagogies and provision. Citing Harbord
(2008), Donahue acknowledged the attraction for "foreign experts" to share
their expertise with colleagues in other countries, as well as the attraction for
many colleagues of turning to foreign expertise to obtain advice on writing
pedagogy, theory, and programme administration (Donahue, 2009, p. 222).
She argued, however, that teachers and theorists of writing must move "`toward
equal trade models of exchange" (Donahue, 2009, p. 231), and that, follow-
ing Muchiri et al. (1995), we must "make claims in contextualized fashion, to
remind [our]selves of what [we] take for granted," "become more self-conscious
about the ways we use terminology, and resist an import-export model for an
equitable exchange" model that puts us "in a learning position with respect to
our colleagues around the globe" (Donahue, 2009, p. 232).4

   As one of the co-editors of Writing Programs Worldwide, I have kept this set of
principles in mind when offering feedback to authors on their profile essays and
in learning from the many ways of teaching writing and approaches to organis-
ing the teaching of writing outlined in the profiles. My purpose in the remainder
of this short essay is to investigate further the potential usefulness of exchanging
cross-cultural writing development theory and practice by exploring themes and
examples from the profile essays I commissioned. These profiles report on aca-
demic writing development work in universities in the UK, Ireland, Australia,

                                                                                                501

New Zealand, Belgium, and France. While some profiles focus on a particular
sphere of activity, others discuss an array of writing development activities.

          WRITING DEVELOPMENT IN RESPONSE TO
                 HIGHER EDUCATION EXPANSION

   One theme articulated in almost all of the profiles is that writing develop-
ment is often called for--by students, by academics and professional staff in
universities, by university managers, and by governments--in response to the
massification of higher education and the increase in heterogeneity of the stu-
dent body that such expansion brings.5 Many profiles begin with a statement of
how their institution's student body has grown and become much more diverse
in terms of increased participation of indigenous people; foreign students; peo-
ple from a variety of social classes, races, and ethnic groups; distance-learners;
and students with varied experiences of educational preparation. Writing about
AUT University, New Zealand, John Bitchener notes that AUT University
"`has a multi-national and multi-cultural population: 42% pakehas (white New
Zealanders), 10% Maori (indigenous New Zealanders), 11% Pasifika (Pacific
Islanders), 27% Asians (East and South Asian countries) and 10% others," and
that "[t]his range of backgrounds means that the university must cater for the
diverse needs of its equally diverse student population" and "accept responsi-
bility for ensuring that students have every chance of succeeding." Similarly,
Marie-Christine Pollet notes that students at the Université Libre de Bruxelles,
Belgium, are characterized by "a large diversity in their geographic, cultural and
social origins" as well as in their educational backgrounds.

   Karyn Gonano and Peter Nelson, writing from Queensland University of
Technology, Australia, explain that their government's Bradley Review, Trans-
forming Australia's Higher Education System, which was put into effect in 2009
"to widen participation in universities," has resulted "in an increasingly diverse
range of students with an equally significant range of experiences." Gonano
and Nelson discuss the impact of the internationalisation agenda in Australian
higher education in terms of the development of English as a Foreign Language
(EFL) writing support programmes at Queensland University of Technology.
They identify, as does Mary Deane's and my profile of writing provision at Cov-
entry University, England, the need for writing support not just for non-native
speakers of English, but for all students.

   That calls for writing development have been occasioned by growth in stu-
dent numbers in higher education and by erosion of homogeneity in student
populations is a claim that appears over and over again in Academic Writing and

502

Composition scholarship. Many scholars have written about this phenomenon
as a catalyst for the development of Composition teaching and writing centers
in US universities (see, for example, Boquet, 1999; Carino, 1995; Russell, 2002;
and Yaher & Murdick,1991), while Skillen (2006) has argued that as a result
of "the massification of the tertiary education system in the 1970s and 1980s"
in Australia, the assumption that writing instruction was not necessary because
"students at this level of education already had adequate writing skills acquired
during secondary school" was questioned, and learning centres were set up in
Australian universities (Skillen, 2006, p. 140). This claim has also been made in
relation to the development, from the 1990s, of Academic Writing as a teaching
and research field in UK higher education (Ganobcsik-Williams, 2006, p. xxi-5),
and appears in many articles by European writing teachers and scholars in the
Autumn 2011 inaugural issue of the Journal of Academic Writing, the journal of
the European Association for the Teaching of Academic Writing.

     WRITING CENTRES AND WRITING PROGRAMMES
                    WITH MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS

   A second theme apparent in the profiles is that of writing programmes
and writing centres outside of the US taking on multiple functions. As Santa
(2009) points out:"Most American writing centers stand in support of writing
programs which include composition or writing intensive course instruction
as mandatory features of an undergraduate curriculum. In most Continental
writing centers, the writing centre is the writing program" (Santa. 2009, p.3).

   That the writing centre is the hub for writing development work is also
true of the first writing centre in Irish higher education. The Regional Writ-
ing Centre at the University of Limerick, Ireland, discussed in the profile by
Íde O'Sullivan and Lawrence Cleary, names its priorities as supporting student
writers, supporting postgraduate students in developing their writing and in
training for tutoring writing, "faculty development on best practices for teach-
ing with writing" and, in conjunction with the University's Centre for Teaching
and Learning, academic staff development in scholarly writing. The Centre for
Academic Writing (CAW) at Coventry University, England, as depicted in the
profile by Deane and Ganobcsik-Williams, is also an example of a writing cen-
tre that functions as a department of writing studies. CAW's mission statement
comprises a "whole institution" writing development commitment to support-
ing student writing, to carrying out staff development in the teaching of writing,
and to facilitating staff and postgraduate writing for publication. The Academic
Achievement Teaching Unit (AATU), at the University of Dundee, Scotland,

                                                                                                503

detailed in Kathleen McMillan's profile, is classified as a teaching unit rather
than a writing centre, but offers, through a partnership with Fellows from the
UK's Royal Literary Fund Fellowship Scheme, one-to-one writing tuition for
students, bespoke workshops in which AATU staff collaborate with academics
to teach academic skills, and other types of writing and skills teaching.6

             THE IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL AND
                LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS
                   FOR WRITING DEVELOPMENT

   Another theme common to all of the profiles is the importance of national
and local institutional contexts for writing development. Many authors review
their choices of pedagogical approaches and emphasise the need to fit writing
pedagogies and writing development provision to particular contexts. Pollet, for
example, notes that the Center for University Learning at the Université Libre
de Bruxelles was established as a result of an internal institutional report and
that its work has been affirmed by a national government mandate in "working
to promote the success of students." Pollet explains how the Center's teaching
practices have evolved through "normative" and "technicist" approaches into a
"pragmatic" approach to providing linguistic and writing support for first-year,
French-speaking students.

   Another example of the emphasis on contextualising writing development is
shown by Lisa Emerson, in her profile of academic writing teaching at Massey
University, New Zealand. "Becoming an ethnographer: understanding the con-
text," writes Emerson, who became involved in writing development work when
a "colleague had returned from Sabbatical in the US fired up with a mission to
start a writing centre to improve students' writing skills." Having subscribed to
a US-based writing center listserv, Emerson notes that often:

         . . . . reading the email discussions felt more like eavesdrop-
         ping on a conversation on an alien planet. The conversation
         may have been in English but the largely American cultural
         context in which it took place was beyond my comprehen-
         sion: the terminology was opaque, and the assumption that a
         whole institutional infrastructure around writing was in place
         was unimaginable at that time in a New Zealand context.

   Emerson notes, therefore, that she had to "invent" her role as a writing tu-
tor and to become, in Elaine Maimon's words, an "ethnographer" of her home

campus (McLeod & Soven, 1992, p. xi) in order to build "a New Zealand
writing programme" informed by international scholarship but emerging "out
of the context of a New Zealand university" and "carefully crafted to meet the
needs of New Zealand students."

   Emerson's experiences and observations correspond with those of Santa
(2009), who found it inappropriate to use US Composition textbooks and writ-
ing tutor guides to teach and support Bulgarian, Romanian, Albanian, and Ser-
bian university students and writing tutors in Bulgaria. As Santa (2009) argues,
"[a]n increasingly international writing center practice demands elucidation of
theory and practice which might best facilitate the work of new tutors and bet-
ter conform to local academic practices and needs." (Santa, 2009, p. 1).

               CROSS-FERTILISATION OF WRITING
                     THEORIES AND PRACTICES

   The concept of contextualised writing development relates closely to the final
theme of the profiles that I would like to highlight, the importance of cross-
fertilisation of writing theories and practices between higher education cultures.
Within this group of profiles, the dominant and default provider of expertise
about writing development is the US; this is, arguably, inevitable given that the
US has well-developed programs, departments, and centers in which explicit ter-
tiary writing teaching and tutoring takes place, underpinned by a long tradition
of writing research and scholarship.7 Many authors explain how they have been
influenced by US theories and practices of teaching writing. In addition to my
own and Emerson's experiences as discussed above, Theresa McConlogue, Sally
Mitchell, and Kelly Peake note that the Thinking Writing programme team at
Queen Mary, University of London drew "inspiration from Writing in the Dis-
ciplines at Cornell University;" Jonathan Worley credits the influence of a US
writing center colleague in developing the writing centre and peer tutoring pro-
gramme at St. Mary's University College, Belfast; and Lawrence Cleary and Íde
O'Sullivan recount how, prior to setting up the writing centre at the University
of Limerick, a visiting professor from the US met with their working group for
"a week-long consultation" including "workshops on writing" and an exploration
of how "university-wide support could be translated into a systematic, compre-
hensive approach to writing while addressing individual, disciplinary concerns."

   For non-US-based writing teachers and researchers, one way in which to
move beyond or alongside the US influence is to seek to learn more from one's
own regionally- and nationally-based colleagues. In his section essay in this
volume, Gerd Bräuer indicates the value of the collegial regional and local net-

                                                                                                505

works that have enabled close collaboration in developing writing centers in
Austria, Germany, Liechtenstein, and Switzerland. As indicated by Pollet and
by Françoise Boch and Cathy Frier's profile of the Université Stendhal, Greno-
ble III, France, a community of exchange between writing teacher-researchers
also exists in Belgium and France.8 In the UK, the WDHE network and groups
such as the Interuniversity Academic Literacies Research Group (Aclits), as well
as visits and discussions between writing development colleagues at various uni-
versities, have helped to create and maintain a community of writing teachers,
scholars, and programme/centre managers.9

   Another way to learn about writing development more broadly is to seek and
compare expertise from a variety of cultural contexts. When setting up the Cen-
tre for Academic Writing at Coventry University, for example, I engaged a US
writing center/ Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC) colleague and an Austra-
lian learning centre colleague as joint consultants,10 and the writing centre ben-
efited from my opportunity to learn about US writing programs, writing centers,
and WAC administration as well as about Australian learning centres and models
for organising the teaching of writing. On a larger scale, Pollet's profile essay sug-
gests a cross-fertilisation of theory and theoretical traditions between Belgium
and France (Littéracies Universitaires) and the UK (Academic Literacies),11 while
O'Sullivan and Cleary cite Academic Literacies and American Composition and
Rhetoric perspectives as important influences on the teaching and research ap-
proaches taken at their Regional Writing Centre in Ireland.

   Scholarship giving insight into writing pedagogies and ways of organis-
ing writing development in various cultures is increasing and becoming more
widely available through publications such as the Writing Programs Worldwide
anthology. By reviewing the group of profiles under consideration here, for
instance, I have come to realise that there is an increasing focus on the writ-
ing of postgraduate students and academic staff. This focus includes doctoral
thesis-writing as discussed by John Bitchener in his profile of AUT University,
Auckland, New Zealand, as well as postgraduate and academics' development
in writing for publication as discussed in the profiles about the writing centres
at Coventry University and the University of Limerick.12 As a result of Boch
and Frier's profile of a writing research teaching intervention project, I have
also gained insight into the concept of "scientific" writing research prevalent in
European higher education.

   To what extent, therefore, is it useful for those working in higher education
to be aware of writing practices and models of academic writing provision in
place at higher education institutions in other national contexts? In this essay, I
have responded to this question through my reflection upon how the opportu-
nity, as a student, to begin to compare writing instruction and ways of organis-

506
                                                    Comparing Models of Academic Writing Provision

ing writing provision within universities in two different countries resulted in
furthering my own development as a student writer and led me to recognise the
benefits of supporting students with their writing in higher education. I have
also reflected on the question of the value of cross-cultural awareness of writing
pedagogies and institutional approaches to writing development by discussing
four main themes and an array of examples taken from a selection of profile es-
says in this anthology. As these themes and examples show, there are now com-
mon inter- and trans-national issues being faced in academia that would suggest
the benefit of comparing approaches, both within regions and nations and with
other higher education cultures. Transnationalism is accelerating, and writing
developers have much to learn from--and much to contribute to--other con-
texts for teaching writing.

                                    NOTES

1. Donahue (2009) points out that a "broadly ignored area of [C]omposition work is
that of US monolingual students' experiences when they go overseas to study or work
and find themselves in universities and workplaces with different rhetorical, discursive,
and sociolinguistic expectations, whether that work is being done in English or in an-
other language. An `English is English' mindset seems uniquely inappropriate for cur-
rent international contexts" (p. 218). The personal reflections offered in this essay are a
contribution to this area of Composition scholarship.

2. The WDHE was founded in 1994. The first, joint, EATAW/EWCA conference
took place in 2001. For more information on these organisations and on the Warwick
Writing Programme conference, see Ganobcsik-Williams (2006), pages xxiv-xxv.

3. Articles by Mullin (2006), as well as Heyda (2006) also cautioned that writing
pedagogies and models of organising writing instruction within colleges and universi-
ties may not be appropriate for the contexts within which they are operating, let alone
for implementation elsewhere. Heyda (2006), for example, argues that the "sentimen-
tal" tradition of required first-year composition classes in US universities is ineffective
and that US institutions' focus on this model hinders the resourcing and development
of other, he contends, more productive approaches to working with students on their
writing.

4. While Donahue addresses her remarks in this article in College Composition and
Communication to US Composition and Rhetoric teachers and scholars, I believe that
these points apply to all writing developers.

5. For many higher education systems, "universalisation" rather than "massification" is
the appropriate term. For a definition of the difference between "mass" and "universal"
educational systems, see Peter Scott (1995, p. 2).

                                                                                                507

6. While other UK writing centres typically are engaged in a variety of activities, the
Writing Centre at St. Mary's University College, Belfast, Northern Ireland, as discussed
in Jonathan Worley's profile, focuses its expertise on peer tutoring in writing.

7. As Donahue (2009), citing Muchiri et al. (1995) points out, however, "[t]he ab-
sence of an `industry' of first-year composition" in countries outside of the United
States "is not the absence of the study and teaching of higher education writing," and
some writing scholars have traced the histories of higher education writing instruction
in various countries back hundreds of years (p. 222).

8. Donahue (2009) makes reference to this field of the study of university writing as
`la didactique de l'écrit' (p. 222).

9. Established in 1993, Aclits is convened by Mary Scott at the Institute of Education,
University of London.

10. These colleagues were Professor Joan Mullin and Dr. Jan Skillen.

11. See the Call for Proposals for the "University Literacies" conference, held at the
Université Charles de Gaulle, Lille III, 2-4 September 2010: http://evenements.univ-
lille3.fr/litteracies-universitaires/en/?Call_for_proposals, which observes that "[r]es-
earch about university reading and writing practices, developed in French-speaking
countries and in Europe in the field of `didactics' in the past dozen years, are coming
more and more into dialogue with this kind of research in the U.K. field of Academic
Literacies . . . [and] the US field of Composition Studies."

12. For further discussion of thesis-writing pedagogies and approaches to supporting
the scholarly writing of postgraduate students and academics, see, for example, Murray
(2002, 2009) and Lillis and Curry (2006, 2010).

WRITING PROGR AMS WORLDWIDE

Emerging from the International WAC/WID Mapping Project, this collection of es-
says is meant to inform decision-making by teachers, program managers, and college/
university administrators considering how writing can most appropriately be defined,
managed, funded, and taught in the places where they work. Writing Programs
Worldwide offers an important global perspective to the growing research literature
in the shaping of writing programs. The authors of its program profiles show how
innovators at a diverse range of universities on six continents have dealt creatively
over many years with day-to-day and long-range issues affecting how students across
disciplines and languages grow as communicators and learners.

In these profiles, we see teachers and researchers relying on colleagues and on trans-
national scholarship to build initiatives that are both well suited to their specific
environments and can serve as regional and often global models. Their struggles and
achievements offer insights to colleagues in similar locales and across borders who
seek to establish, enhance, and assess their own work as designers of writing programs.

An introduction and three section essays by the editors illuminate themes that inform
this collection. Growing networks of initiators and scholars and survey results from
the International WAC/WID Mapping Project exemplify the argument of this collec-
tion for transnational exchange and collaboration.
