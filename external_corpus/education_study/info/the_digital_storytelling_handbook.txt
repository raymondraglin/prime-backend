Before the Beginning

How do you take an idea, an event, a moment -- and
make someone else care about it? The answer is story.
How do share that story widely, repeatedly, easily?
Digitally. Nancy Duarte is a well-known expert in
presentation design and storytelling. She is the the
author of several books, including "Slide:ology: The Art
and Science of Creating Great Presentations", "Resonate:
Present Visual Stories that Transform Audiences", and
"Illuminate: Ignite Change Through Speeches, Stories,
Ceremonies, and Symbols". Her work emphasizes the
power of visual storytelling, and she is recognized for her
contributions to the field of presentation design and
communication. Duarte talks about digital storytelling
being like a box of chocolates; the experience is both the
sweet, chocolatey inside contents but also the
presentation of the box itself. In sum, the whole is
greater than the parts whether that's a box of chocolate,
a chainlink, a class of students, or even the words in a
book. Stories also exemplify the strength of diversity,
because to experience them builds cultural capacity
through empathy and compassion. We learn from others
when we learn about ourselves.

Setting The Stage

Welcome to the world of digital storytelling--where
individuals create their own experiential narratives using
digital tools. While there are many definitions, for our
purposes we will work from the following definition that
"digital stories are short multimodal presentations that
combine a variety of communicative elements within a
narrative structure. Media may include any combination
of the following: text, images, video, audio, social media
elements (like tweets), or interactive elements (maps)."
Before you explore digital storytelling it is important to
understand that the essence of all stories is the story
itself; an ancient tried-and-true tested way of teaching
and learning.

At its core, storytelling, and the very study of the
humanities themselves is a narrative structure focused on
experience. And experience is about emotion. Since as
long as people have been literate they have been telling
stories that carry the wisdom of different cultures, the
reflections of the collective experience, and also the
echoes of individual lives. From the stories swapped
around ancient campfires to the intricate hunting stories

                                                              3
painted onto rocks to to the silver screens and Meta
headsets, humans have been bound together by the
power of story and the individual who can weave that tale
into something memorable, educative, and experiential.
Storytelling is more than the mere arrangement of words
into a clear beginning, middle, and end; instead, it is the
arrangement and juxtaposition of those words to each
other through complex syntactic structures that
transforms the experience of others into something
memorable for another. They are like artifacts of
experience, boundless and limitless and unique to
individuals but also similar and transcendent. Stories
connect all of us.

                                                              4
As we navigate the realms of pixels and data, storytelling
finds new avenues of expression, evolving into what we
now know as digital storytelling. Narrative is woven not
only with words but also with images that paint vivid
landscapes, sounds that evoke emotions, and interactive
elements that invite engagement.
In this book we will explore the tools and techniques of
digital storytelling, and the impact that this modern form
of narrative expression has on our interconnected world.
As we explore storytelling, may you discover the
boundless possibilities that await within the digital
narrative landscape.

                                                              5
Using What You Have

Digital storytelling is more than just learning a set of rote
tools -- operating a DSLR camera; learning Photoshop, or
iMovie or Adobe Premiere; or even utilizing the rule of
thirds in your digital compositions -- it's about engaging
individuals in conversations, creating dialogue, raising
awareness, and taking action. It's a process. A way of
thinking about humanity from different perspectives. It is
stories of life and death -- sometimes in the same frame.
But inevitably it's about what you have with you; what
tools you're already proficient in and leveraging those
strengths for the sake of creativity.
These tools are ways for storytellers to ask and answer
their own questions with what is accessible to them at the
time.

                                                              6
Process of Digital Storytelling

The process for digital storytelling is recursive in nature
and follows other methodologies rhetoric, composition,
and creativity, such as Kellogg's Cognitive Components of
the Writing Process (1999). Similarly this process includes
moving from an idea through and beyond peer review.

                                                              7
1. KYHOI ("Knock Your Head Off Idea") or
    Proposal: What is the essence of your idea? Where is
    the tension? Where is the humanity? What's the
    purpose or significance you as the storyteller are trying
    to convey? You have an idea that is unique to you and
    your experience.

2. Read, Research, Experience: The benefit to digital
    storytelling is that the majority of it is done outside of
    the confines of a classroom. To be a good storyteller
    also means to be a good critical thinker. Understand
    the people involved, the context, the story. Know that
    your story is singular to your experience as a
    individual. Engage with others, explore your
    community, learn about others experience.

3. Plan, Storyboard, Write, Script: Writing a good
    story is hard work; it's a recursive process that is not
    exact but instead is messy and chaotic. Having a good
    plan will help you when the going gets rough.
    Understand how the different parts might intersect
    within your story and how people, spaces, and places
    are represented. Know where you want your story to
    begin and end. It's ok to change the structure too; at
    least you have a starting place.

                                                              8
4. Collect Media, Curate Content: Have a plan to store
    your content in an easily accessible place whether
    that's a folder on your laptop, an app on your phone,
    or an external hard drive. Include all sorts of media
    like photos and videos, art, hyperlinks, scripts, etc.

5. Create and Edit: There are tons of great tools and
    programs. Find a software and a platform you're
    comfortable with. Use your smartphone at first
    because it's always with you and you won't need some
    of the advanced features from a desktop or laptop
    computer. It's important to find a convenient and
    accessible way to edit your content.

6. Share, Feedback, Reflect: Stories are meant for
    others to consume. Get feedback at various phases of
    your project -- not just at the end. An effective,
    influential, story will always be developed through the
    feedback of others.

                                                              9
Tools: What Is Already Out There?

If you're reading this, you have all you need to be
successful as a digital storyteller as one of the key
components is have tools that are accessible to you --
most likely, at its simplest form, is a smartphone or
smart, multi-touch device like tablet PC/iPad. Consider
beginning simply with just a one-photo story, then add a
caption, another photo, some title slides and some audio.
The idea with mobile technologies is that stories can be
created, edited and shared in just a few short minutes.

                                                             10
The idea is that it's relatively easy to move from a still
photograph to a series of photos to a short film to
something else entirely. But consider that there is no one
monolithic approach and no singular voice.

                                                             11
Pause and Consider: Think About
What Is Yet To Come?

Throughout time immemorial, new tools and technologies
facilitate different ways of experiences stories. Think
about the proliferation of books after Gutenberg; color
televisions, 360-degree cameras, virtual reality headsets,
and even the Sphere in Las Vegas, an immersive wrap-
around venue. The Gartner Hype Cycle (see below) is one
way to think about how new technologies are adopted,
and inevitably incorporated into our storytelling lexicon.

Why Use Digital Storytelling?

These stories inherently celebrate diversity of the
individuals telling the story; their perspective, culture,
and lens from which they view the world. Your worldview
and your view of others world view is what makes us all
unique.

                                                             13
Building Cultural Competence
With Storytelling

Baked into the very essence of digital storytelling is the
idea that others will experience your story and the
subsequently be able to see or identify with your
depiction of humanity. In some ways, the community of
storytellers can build empathy for each other through this
casual form of "peer review"; the opportunity for others
to see your work and in turn respond or react in some
way or manner. In fact, throughout the many facets of

the digital storytelling process help us to see and
celebrate the diversity of people and culture. Yet the
stories with the greatest resonance; those that might
have the greatest impact and reach (if that's the goal
with your story) is those stories that address or highlight
issues of equity, access, and inclusivity as they relate to
us as individual humans.

                                                             15
Diversity in Storytelling

Specifically, Addy et al (2021) state that "Diversity is to
recognize how learners differ with regard to their social
identities, demographics, perspectives, prior experiences,
attitudes, knowledge, skills, and other attributes." Digital
stories move us away from telling towards the showing;

what better way showcase these differences than a digital
story? Each perspective is unique; but collectively digital
story projects highlight the strengths and benefits of
diversity; they show us what matters to other people and
how they might view the world and ways we might be
able to learn from each other. Digital stories help us to
see different perspectives that might catalyze our
everyday creative thinking and subsequently decentralize
empathy to create more equitable spaces.

                                                             16

Equity, then is defined as customizing tools and resources
to meet the unique needs of that particular storyteller. It
differs from the idea of equality, which is that tools and
resources are evenly distributed to everyone regardless.
Students with documented learning disabilities who
request and are given extra time on quizzes and exams
exemplifies this notion of equity. "Equity acknowledges
the differences between learners, their diversity, and the
types of learning environments that help diverse students

                                                             17
                         succeed" while "equality in teaching and
                         learning suggests that all students
                         should have identical learning
                         experiences regardless of their
                         differences" (Addy et al, 2021). Equality
                         then is making all students do the same
assignment the same way without accounting for those
important and meaningful differences. What would you
rather? Assignments rooted in equity or equality?

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie has a great perspective on
this. She advocates for diverse narratives that challenge
single stories, which can perpetuate stereotypes and limit
understanding. Adichie believes that by sharing multiple,
nuanced stories from various perspectives, especially
those traditionally marginalized, we can foster empathy,
broaden worldviews, and promote social justice. Her
approach underscores the importance of inclusivity in
storytelling as a means to achieve equity and
representation in society.

Inclusion in Storytelling

Addy et al (2021) define inclusion as "creating a
welcoming environment and intentionally not excluding
any learners." But in reality, that might be easier said (or
written) than put into practice. Inevitably, inclusion and
inclusive practices create spaces where people not only
belong but feel like they should matter too. Digital
storytellers naturally highlight parts of life that are
important to their worldview. Sharing what matters helps
their audience to see the significance and intersection of
ideas and perspectives.

Video Interviews

By Sarah Mangano

Why Is Video Interviewing an
Important Part of Digital
Storytelling?

Introduction

                         Interviewing pulls a subject-matter
                         expert into your digital story in a
                         fascinating, intimate, and dynamic way.
                         Sometimes, instead of learning from a
                         book, it is more beneficial to learn and
                         analyze a subject or topic through a
                         question and answer format. Though
                         inevitably any really good interview will
                         also look like as friendly as two old
                         friends catching up on a park bench.

                         In this chapter, you will learn the ins and
                         outs of digital storytelling through
                         interviewing: how to set up your shots;
                         and what to look for when scouting for an
                         interview location.

                                                             22
How To Capture Your Audience
With Your Subject

The Importance of Setting

Angles, Lighting, and Listening Shots

Locating an appropriate SETTING to frame the
background of your subject-matter expert is the first step
to a great interview shoot. Find a location that
corresponds with the interview topic to keep it engaging.
For example, when interviewing a teacher in their
classroom, make the background of their library or
student desks or an area showcasing the students' work,
if applicable. Once you set up your background, mark
your shot by maintaining a good distance. This would
generally be about 3 to 4 feet in distance from the
camera to interviewee.

When planning the different ANGLES for your interview,
ensure you get a view from the interviewee side,
interviewer side and a wide shot of the interview itself.
This range allows for a better variety of angles when
editing and enables all sides of the interview to be caught
for storytelling purposes.

                                                             23
Next is to make sure you have good LIGHTING.
Inconsistencies with the lighting can dramatically affect
how an interview looks. If the picture is too dark or
bright, for instance, the viewer won't be able to see the
interviewee's face, potentially limiting the impact of
pathos (or emotion) on the story. When planning how to
light the interview, avoid putting your subject in front of a
large window which will drown out their face or darken
the background so as to increase impact.
Another factor to keep in mind is to avoid crowded and
overly noisy areas where volume and audio is hard to
capture clearly. In an effort record the highest quality
audio possible, bring correct equipment if needed, which
might include a small portable microphone, a pair of
headphones or other appropriate recording equipment.

                                                             24
Listening Shots

Listening shots are filming a few seconds of either the
interviewer or the subject listening, nodding and
interacting with the questions being asked or answered
like a B-roll. Make sure to get listening shots, so when
editing you can cut back to the interviewer if there's a run
on sentence and you need to edit. By incorporating these
types of shots into your story, you can avoid showing a
break in the conversation as these sorts of clips are also
good to use to show that the interviewer is listening
intently and engaged in the conversation. Listening shots
help with fluidity throughout the interview.

                                                             25
Interview Etiquette

What To Know

Before interviewing your subject, write out your questions
and give them to your subject ahead of time. Allowing
them to plan their responses also leaves more time for
potential conversations stemming from those initial
questions. Adding a lower third at the beginning on a
interview is something to consider. Have your interviewee
spell their first and last name, too, and include that
information in the lower third of the frame when first
introducing your subject into the video. You can also add
a title, position or other relevant information where
appropriate here too. It might look like this:

                                                             26
Additionally, have a sense of the the type or style of the
interview you want to conduct; if it is formal, make it look
and feel professional -- don't leave too much room for
side or off-hand conversation and keep it on track. If it is
more of a casual interview, choose a conversational style
(instead of rote question and answer) and allow for
informal questions to arise from your subject's answers;
let them talk without cutting them off and prepare some
extra prompts that might help guide your interviewees
answer. Don't be afraid to ask the hard questions either.

Keep in mind, too, that it is always helpful to shoot more
footage than what you might need in your final, finished
story. For example, if you need a 5-minute interview, get
at least 25-40 minutes of solid conversation so there is
ample footage to pull from to include in your final cut.

Lastly, when interviewing your subject, maintain good eye
contact with them. Try to not make the camera a part of
your interview instead, act like it's not there to avoid
looking directly at the camera. This can be considered
breaking the Fourth Wall, where the subject
acknowledges or speaks to the "audience."

                                                             27

Main Takeaways With Interviews

Wrapping up this chapter, there are three main points you
should consider when shooting your interview. First, pick
a setting that matches your interview topic. If the
interview pertains to a sporting event, make the setting
the arena or the field or a locker room. Secondly, ensure
the lighting is good by avoiding any large windows or
dark spaces. This will make the lighting consistent and
the subject clearly visible throughout the entire interview.
Lastly, learn your questions and have an idea of the
direction you want the interview to go. Do not be afraid to
go off script if you feel their is pertinent information and
understanding is there. Interviews can be a great way to
get a story and tell it in a way that is visual. Plan ahead
with good questions, be creative, have fun getting those
stories!

Storytelling Using Emotion

By Sarah Mangano

Introduction

Emotion, or pathos, is a very important part of digital
storytelling because it allows the audience to experience
the story without using words or text. In this chapter, you
will learn how to incorporate emotional queues into your
digital stories by learning various different methods and
approaches that leverage an audiences' emotions, in a
good way.

                                                             31
How To Use Emotion Without
Words

It is important to understand how utilizing objects,
emotion, pathos, and facial expressions can affect the
storyline and allow the audience to interpret how they are
supposed to feel. Pathos has an imaginative impact in
storytelling; it allows the audience to interpret, follow
along, imagine and even create their own ending if
needed, such as a call to action.

                                                             32
Why Emotion Is Important to the
Audience in Storytelling

Emotion is important to storytelling because it enables
the storyteller to sway the audience's reactions; to guide
them to feel one way or another -- sadness, for instance,
or humor. Emotion is important to storytelling because it
enables the writer, often through their main character, to
sway their audience's reactions. This can be for the
writer's benefit, or this can mean that the writer is
allowing the audience to choose the emotion and
interpretation they feel.

A storyteller can employ emotion by choosing a certain
environment or adding music, clothing and even color to
the story. For example, The Door Scene, an activity
introduced in the American Film Institute Educators
Handbook, is a great example of how to portray emotion
to sway the audience's emotions. If a storyteller wants to
portray the emotions of being scared and confused, they
can film a scene that is dark and focuses on the main
character's face to convey that the character is becoming
visibly more and more suspicious of something not being
right; the audience cannot see the threat, but with the
contextual clues of the main character's growing distress,

                                                             33
the audience can see that something is wrong. In other
words, the audience can feel the growing suspense.
Once the character gets safely behind the door, the
audience witnesses the relief that the character
expresses, and in return the audience also feels the relief
of a weight being lifted. This example illustrates clearly an
effective nonverbal way to convey emotion in storytelling;
there were no words used, just the depiction of the
character's environment, i.e., their door and their
accompanying emotions.

                                                             34
The Door Scene Example Video

This video shows how portraying emotion without using
words helps the writer tell the story. It depicts the pathos
of the main character's confusion and fear. It allows the
audience to feel the emotions of fear and confusion.

                                          The Door Scene

     Watch the "Door Scene" on YouTube Shorts (suspenseful music is
           played throughout the entire video; no words are spoken)

                                                             35
Taking a Deeper Look

Can you think of a time when you watched a movie, TV
show, or digital story that evoked a particularly strong
emotional response? Think of some of the greatest films
of your generation If so, what methods helped to prompt
those emotions?
While considering your own experience with emotions in
storytelling, think about how you can apply this
knowledge to your own digital storytelling creations.
Think about modeling your approach after someone else's
style you really admire and respect. This reflective
opportunity might open you up to more ideas and allow
you to think outside the box. Consider the emotions you
want your audience to feel and start a road map for what
objects, sounds, or methods will allow your audience to
reach that conclusion.

                                                             36
Smith and Lazarus - Cognitive
Theory of Emotion

The Smith and Lazarus Cognitive Theory of Emotion is an
influential psychological model that explains emotions as
a result of cognitive processes, particularly how
individuals appraise or evaluate events and situations.
According to this theory, emotions are not automatic
responses to stimuli but are shaped by how we interpret
and make sense of our experiences. The environment
also plays a major role with emotions. Subsequently,
these two factors -- increased cognition and
interpretation and manipulating the environment for the
story -- determine how an individual experiences your
narrative.

                                                             37
Emotion Is Your Biggest Tool

In conclusion, there are many different ways to showcase
emotion in storytelling to amplify the message. Emotion
can be used as your main source of pathos or it can play
a small but crucial part. Think about the setting for the
story and the purpose for your story; what is it you want
them to know or do after watching, listening, and
experiencing your story. Know that emotion is not just
something that is shown on a face but can easily be found
in the setting, the colors, the mood, the people's behavior
and the backgrounds you use.

                                                             38
Storytelling Through Visual
Aids (Photography and
Videography)

By Tu Le

What Is the Role of Visual Aids?

Introduction

With the advent of digital photography, taking pictures
with your smartphone or a fancy digital camera has never
been easier or more accessible, and the ability to share
and view them on various platforms has made
photography an essential communication tool in today's
world. The use of photography as a visual aid has become
ubiquitous in many industries, such as journalism,
advertising and education for showcasing the perspective
of an individual.

                                                             39
Photography

Photography plays a crucial role in conveying stories,
capturing moments, and presenting news to the public in
a way that evokes empathy, shock, and joy for the
subject matter. In advertising, photographs are used to
promote products and services and are an effective tool
for creating a lasting impression on the viewer. In
education, photographs can be used as visual aids to
enhance learning and comprehension in many different
modalities. The visual impact of a single photograph can
be significant, making it a valuable tool for
communication, expression and activism.

                                                             40
This chapter will explore the role of photography as a
visual aid and its various uses in different disciplines. We
will examine the key elements that make a photograph
visually compelling and effective in conveying a particular,
deliberate message. We will look at the various
techniques and styles used in photography to create
visually striking images that leave a lasting impression on
the viewer. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and
ethical considerations that come with the use of
photography as a visual aid in storytelling.

                                                             41
Angles

Angles are a crucial aspect of photography, as they can
completely change the way an image is perceived by the
viewer. The angle at which a photograph is taken can
influence the mood, emotion, and overall impact of the
image.

A low angle can make the subject appear larger and more
dominant, while a high angle can make the subject
appear smaller and more vulnerable. Angles can be used

                                                             42
to create a sense of depth, leading the viewer's eye
through the image and creating a more dynamic
composition. Choosing the right angle can also help to
eliminate distractions and focus the viewer's attention on
the intended subject. Therefore, a photographer must
consider the angle carefully to create a visually
compelling and impactful image.

                                                             43
Editing

Photography as a part of the visual medium continues to
change the way an image is perceived by the viewer. An
effort to enhance that perception is through a post-
production, editing process.

                                                             44
Editing transforms images into new works of art. The
photographer chooses either simple forms of edits, such
as adding filters, or an advanced route, which can
enhance, emphasize or create something entirely new in
a creative sense. Moreover, editing is important in
photography because it allows the photographer a second
chance to look at the image they initially created in a new
context. Post-production editing also seeks to remediate
the imperfections that may not have been caught when
the image was first captured. Editing software has
allowed photographers to adjust saturation, exposure,
contrast and many other settings to appeal to the human

                                                             45
eye. The many kinds of software offered for photography
and image enhancement has also allowed for an aesthetic
or atmosphere to be created so that the user can create a
storyline emotion in an image, or set the mood for their
work.
The reaction of the viewer, plays a crucial role in forming
the narrative that they want to display in their work,
especially when creating a series of images. In
photojournalism and documentary work, images will tell
the story. Prime examples are works in National
Geographic where landscapes or animals tell the story
based on the photographs. Your digital story can have a
similar impact if planned accordingly.

                                                             46
Videography

Angles

Similarly, angles are just as important in videography as
they are in photography. The angle at which a video is
shot can convey a variety of emotions and can influence
how the viewer perceives the subject. Different angles
can be used to create depth and establish a sense of
space and tension within the scene.

The right angle can evoke
emotion, create depth, and capture
the essence of a scene. The angle can be

  used to create movement, leading the
       viewer's eye through the scene and adding
            dynamic interest. The right angle can also
                 eliminate distractions and focus the
                      viewer's attention on the intended subject,
                           ensuring that the message of the video
                                is communicated effectively.

Therefore, a videographer must be intentional in their
choice of angles, as it can significantly impact the final
product and help to convey the intended message.

                                                             47
Editing

Just like photography, videography also holds high
importance in creating visually stunning content through
editing. Capturing content is one thing, but shaping it into
a visual tapestry that also includes a narrative structure is
another step in the process.

In the editing process for video, it is important to focus
on the narrative and the conciseness of the story to make
sure it has a linear and logical order (logos) and is
understandable for all audiences. Taking into
consideration adjustment to color, sound, pace and
overall tone of the video can not only enhance the
viewers' experience but can also turn raw, uncut footage
into something significant. In video editing, unnecessary
footage can be cut out to make the story flow better.
Sound effects and music can be overlapped to create
more of a visual and aural appeal for the viewers. And
adding transitions, like cross dissolves and wipes, can
allow for a more aesthetic appearance throughout the
video.

                                                             48
Body

Together, photography and videography are powerful
tools that a professional or even a novice can use in
storytelling. The ability to capture still and moving
moments allows the user to create their own narrative or,
when used effectively, a way to engage the viewers in
learning about people and purpose and culture and craft.

In photography, the first raw, unedited photos are nothing
less than any image that any device can capture. But
when put into editing software or applications, the
composition and framing of an image becomes important.
Cropping and cutting out unnecessary details improves

how the eyes focus on the main idea in the image. In
addition, filters allow for lighting, color and contrast to
play a role. Users can tweak these filters in their editing
process to create their own moods or emotion and, by
extension, produce depth in their storytelling for the
viewers to interpret.

The common strategy in editing lighting is to use black
and white to display a throwback and nostalgic feeling,
use warm colors to reminisce about the summer- and
springtime, or use a blue hue in the photos to feel a
sense of a winter wonderland. The list continues based on
the narrative that the user wants to portray.

Introduction

                  "The Disappearing Pencil" by Erica Belovich

      Watch "The Disappearing Pencil" on YouTube (Closed Captioned)

Erica Belovich's short film, utilizes various lighting
techniques, camera angles and audio inputs to shape the
narrative and overall impact of the story. For added
effect, the lighting set the tone of how the rest of the
visual narrative was to continue, as well as when and how
the shots were taking place.

                                                             51
The lighting used was intentional as it conveyed certain
moods or atmosphere occurring in the scene. The
importance of lighting helps to advance the storyline
through dramatic inputs by keeping the viewers in
suspense about what might occur next.

The angles that the camera used in the film contributed
to the storytelling as well. Movements and the emotions
of concern and confusion were captured from several
angles to display a sense of distress. The many angles
showed the disarray that was occurring throughout the
short film and guided the viewer's attention to details
about not only the object but also the individual in the
shot.

The sound used in the short film was crucial as it
displayed audible thoughts about the emotions that were
occurring throughout the short film. It amplified the
narrative that was being created and created not only a
visual but also an aural appeal. The combination of all
these factors created an enhanced narrative through the
short film that kept the viewers attention.

                                                             52
Why Short Films?

The use of short films encourages the digital storyteller to
convey a complex idea or notion in a limited amount of
time. Concise films can utilize a variety storytelling
techniques but should leverage all sorts of sensory inputs
like sounds and images.
Short films can also be part of a larger project and can be
published in smaller, serialized versions like a portfolio.
Students also like the idea of a shorter project. However,
with limited time each element of the story will need even
more purpose and focus.

Six Word, Six Shots Video
Story

By Autumn Hudson

Introduction

The purpose of the six shot story is to create a narrative
with a minimal amount of shots -- just six. The video
harnesses a visual component that allows the opportunity
to create something outside of a normal 30-second or
less video. The video focuses less on post-editing
techniques and instead focuses more on the process of
filming by highlighting various camera angles throughout
the segment. Video can be used in a variety of ways to
persuade, evoke emotion, introduce a topic or individual,
have a call to action, and so forth.

                                                             54
Unique Camera Angles

This project will allow you as the filmmaker to explore
and expand your knowledge of camera angles. It is
challenging to find the words that correlate with what
shots, identify when is it better to use a wide angle
versus an extreme close up and explore what type of
dramatized effect does what and adds to the piece. Every
shot taken for the video should be different and unique --
six shots of six using six different angles. Using a variety
of perspectives and depths will add the interesting flare to
the project that highlights six separate pieces tied
together through different pieces of media. Add textual
elements like words in your shot to tie them to the visual
and evoke emotion from the "phrase" you are using.

                                                             55

Other Production Requirements

The best part about this Six-Word Six-Shot project is that
it can be filmed on a cell phone or a fancy DSLR and the
quality of shots will be measured by the creativity in your
content. This project can be compiled in any variety of
software platforms (iMovie, Clips, Adobe) and devices.
Feel free to add words in the shot or they can be edited in
at the beginning or end of the project like a title card. The
project should have some audio component to it too like
royalty-free music, a voice over, or an original musical
piece. Regardless of the choice, the video should contain
audio and graphemic components too. This is a
contributing factor to the production and should be
considered when creating a storyboard.

                                                             58
Conclusion

Walking away from this project the storyteller will have
new ways to think about camera angles and the differing
perspectives associated with each unique shot. Thinking
about a storyboard should also strengthen your ability to
write and execute this piece. This pre-planning phase is
essential to the project and will provide you with a new
skill moving forward in your filmmaking journey.

Documentary

By Autumn Hudson

Introduction

The purpose of a documentary is to portray real people in
their actual settings to convey a variety of messages. This
could be to inform or teach your audience about a specific
event or topic, share an inspiring story, raise awareness
or simply share knowledge through the lens of a
particular person or event. In this section we will learn
how to properly plan, film and edit a documentary styled
assignment.

                                                             60
                                    Documentary Example

     Watch the Documentary Example on YouTube (Closed Captioned)

Planning

When planning a documentary, storytellers first should
identify the "who" and "what" of the film. Deciding who or
what focus will allow the documentary to properly
continue through the planning process. Once it has been
decided who will be interviewed, find a location that
highlights them in their real life setting. This place could
be their office, home or other location that is relevant to
their story and that they frequent often.

                                                             61
While planning, create open-ended questions to guide the
conversation. Typically, when interviewing an expert on
the topic, gather as much information as possible
beforehand to get a clear picture of the subject matter
and what perspective they will represent. Frame
questions more as conversational rather than a structured
interview format so as to avoid the feeling of
interrogation. While interviewing, always listen and
respond based on the content your interviewee provides.

                                                             62
Filming

When filming, ensure that the area is well lit or provide
supplemental lighting options. Additionally, place the
subject in the middle ground of the frame and about 10
feet away from the lens with the background in the
distance at a variable and appropriate distance.
Use the focal or face detection feature on the camera to
set the subject as the focal area as this should cause the
background to become slightly blurred and bringing more
attention to your subject.

                                                             63
To boost the engagement throughout the final product,
experiment with using multiple shots or multiple cameras.
This approach provides a variety of unique perspectives
throughout the film. Also, experiment with using different
locations and including B-roll.
Additionally, use external microphones or use the
microphone from the device. It is not required to use
multiple cameras, but it is beneficial to add depth and
perspective documentary.

                                                             64
Editing

The workflow of editing should revert back to pre-
planning sessions but may not follow exactly. Edits can be
made in any editing software. Go through the raw
interview and find any parts that have awkward pauses or
mistakes; comments that are not relevant to the overall
storyline; dry portions that the interviewer is asking
questions; or moments of stuttering or stumbling that
could be distracting. Be sure to add any titles or lower
thirds to enhance the audience's ability to identify the
title of your documentary as well as the interviewee(s)
speaking in the film. Add transitions to enhance a smooth
flow for your film.

Utilize B-roll and multi-camera angles to help with the
flow of the interview and support the statement being
made. For example, if a soccer coach is being interviewed
and he mentions the practice layout that has led to his
team's success, perhaps overlay the B-roll that includes
the team running drills. This approach adds details and
visuals to the content being discussed in the interview. If
there is extra B-roll that does not have relevant audio, be

                                                             65
sure to mute the clip. If the B-roll does include relevant
audio, for example the soccer coach leading the team in a
motivational speech, consider inserting it into the
interview rather than an overlay. Be careful adding too
many layers of audio or it will detract from the message
of the person being interviewed.

Conclusion

You will learn how to plan, film and edit a documentary
style film over time and through practice. You will be able
to create this piece with basic or advanced gear based on
their personal preference. The end goal here is to create
an engaging piece that follows a documentary structure.
If you follow all of the steps, you will have the look and
feel of a professional documentary.

Color's Impact on Digital
Storytelling

By Victoria McQuiston

Why Is Color an Important Part of
Digital Storytelling?

The impact of color on a digital story cannot be
overstated. While the details of what colors are used and
featured within a story can easily be overlooked, the
effects they can have on viewers are huge. Color can
elicit so many different emotions; it can set the mood or
tone of a story frame by frame; it can amplify a brand's
meaning. Color is a simple yet powerful tool in creating
digital stories.

                                                             67
Color and Emotion

In digital storytelling, color can have a significant impact
on the emotions that a digital story elicits from its
audience. For example,

      Warm colors like red, orange, and yellow can convey
        excitement, enthusiasm, and passion.

      Cool colors like blue, green, and purple can evoke
        feelings of calmness, relaxation, and tranquility.

      Neutral colors like black, white, and gray can be
        used to create a sense of mystery, elegance, and
        sophistication.

                     Colors  Colors and Emotions
RED (warm)                                                        Emotions
ORANGE (warm)
YELLOW (warm)                                  Love, passion, anger, excitement
GREEN (cool)                                   Enthusiasm, energy, happiness
                                               Happiness, cheerfulness, joy
BLUE (cool)                                    Hopefulness, calmness, nature,
                                               abundance
PURPLE (cool)                                  Relaxation, calmness, tranquility,
                                               sadness
                                               Creativity, nobility, romance

                             68
Color and Mood

In digital storytelling, color can also be used to set the
thematic mood of a story. For example,

      A story set in a dark and eerie forest can use dark
        greens and grays to create a sense of foreboding
        and danger.

      A story set on a sunny beach can use bright yellows
        and blues to create a feeling of warmth and
        relaxation

                                                             69
Color and Branding

Color can also be used to establish and reinforce branding
in digital storytelling. The use of consistent colors for
branding throughout a digital story can help to reinforce a
brand or person's identity and make it more memorable
to the audience.

                                "Linear RGB color wheel" by 8-

                               (CC0) via Wikimedia Commons

      Colors can be used to represent a brand's
        personality, values and identity

      In branding, red is used to represent passion,
        energy, and excitement. Subsequently, blue is
        typically associated with trust, reliability, and
        stability.

                                                             70
Conclusion

As we conclude this exploration of digital storytelling, we
return to the essence of what makes a story powerful.
From the ancient campfires to modern digital platforms,
storytelling has always been about sharing ideas,
moments, and experiences in ways that connect us all. As
Nancy Duarte reminds us, the power of a story lies not
just in the content but in how it is presented--a concept
that holds true whether we're talking about a box of
chocolates, a chainlink, or the stories we tell.

Throughout this journey, we've delved into the tools and
techniques that allow us to craft digital narratives. We've
seen how stories, now more than ever, are multimodal
experiences that combine text, images, sounds, and
interactive elements to engage and evoke emotions.
These digital stories are more than just modern tales;
they are artifacts of experience that transcend time and
culture, building empathy and understanding through
their diversity.

Inevitably digital stories teach us -- the audience, the
viewer, the community -- something about ourselves and
the collective human experience. Making stories is a

                                                             71
recursive practice wherein we learn and teach by doing --
it's the ultimate praxis. The best way to learn something
is to teach others and through the writing of this
eTextbook may different voices have been included in the
process. Feel free to add your own chapter or idea to the
eBook so that it continues to represent the voices of
students in the curation and creation of digital stories.
Everyone is a storyteller; and everyone has the tools.

"Not About Us Without Us:
Building Equity Through
Storytelling" Transcript

[Music]

So, I have figured out the answer to the quintessential
question: what is the purpose of my life? For me, I'm
here to smash the patriarchy, eliminate misogyny, and
dismantle racism.

[Applause & Cheering]

And then I realized I have three loads of laundry to do, I
haven't purchased groceries in a while, and I think there's
some homework that needs to get done. But honestly, I
do a lot of different talks around this topic, and one of the
topics I really enjoy talking about is about Muslim women
and the contributions we have to society.

Not too long ago, I was at my computer, and I needed to
get images of Muslim women to put into my PowerPoint
presentation. So, I went to my trusty little Google search
engine, and I typed in "Muslim women." And here's one
of the images that popped up. Now, I don't have a
problem with this image per se; my problem is really

                                                             75
around the context, around the stories around these
images. You see, I have a lot of family and friends who
dress this way, and they have made a profound decision
on how they want to express their faith. My problem is
that it's a very sort of monolithic image of who Muslim
women are. It doesn't represent people who look like me
and dress like me, or women that actually don't observe
the hijab or the headscarf.

So, I found this really problematic, and the further I
looked into it, I realized that the problem is that there is
such a negative stereotype around these images. A lot of
people feel that when they see this type of image, a lot of
negative stereotypes come forth. We're always seen in
this context of being stigmatized, marginalized, and
oppressed. It's always dehumanizing to see that we're the
subject of crimes, and instead of being curious about who
we are, people feel really threatened by who we are. And
so, we need to change this perception.

What I came to realize was, somebody else is always
telling our story. And in order for us to change this
negative stereotype, we need to start telling our stories
ourselves, because these stories cannot be about us
without us. So, some friends of mine and I, we got

                                                             76
together and we launched a storytelling project called
"Muslim Shiro's of Minnesota." The storytelling project
showcases women right here in Minnesota who are doing
amazing work--changemakers and trailblazers.

One of the best things about these stories is that finally,
Google has some images that I can use that reflect my
community. So, I'm gonna share with you three stories
that we've been telling. Meet my friend Amina. Now,
Amina saw these stories, and she was really inspired by
what she was learning, and she saw herself within these
stories. And so, Amina decided she wanted to get more
involved. And so, when the call came, she decided to
become an election judge. Now, can you imagine Amina
sitting at your polling place, looking the way she does
with her pretty floral hijab? And when there's so much
conversation right now about who is American, she's the
one who's registering you or checking you in and asking
those questions.

And then, Amina didn't just stop there. She started to
learn about boards and commissions in her city, and she
decided, "Hey, I'm gonna step up, and I'm gonna serve in
my community." So, she went out to be a commissioner
for the Public Safety Commission. Again, can you imagine

                                                             77
Amina at a table full of people who don't look like her
and, most likely, of a dominant culture? But she is there
again, in her beautiful scarf, representing and giving voice
to a marginalized community.

When you talk to Amina, and you ask her about how it's
going, she will tell you how she's lived in her city all her
life, but finally, she feels like it's really hers and that it
feels like home. She has moved from feeling welcomed to
being included and feeling like she belongs. Now, meet
these wonderful, wonderful students. These are the girls
from Hopkins Middle School and High School. They
attended a leadership conference that we hosted earlier
this year. Here, they're taking a picture with Ibtihaj
Muhammad. Ibtihaj is the very first Muslim hijab-wearing
woman to serve on the United States Olympic team, and
she's a bronze medalist, so really an amazing shero.

Now, usually, our conference targets and invites women
who are already out in the workforce and adults. But
these girls' teacher, Angela Wilcox, reached out to me and
asked, "Would it be appropriate to bring this group of
students?" I said, "Absolutely, the more the merrier!" The
girls had a wonderful time. They were able to see women
that looked like them--changemakers, people that they

                                                             78
could really aspire to be. And after the conference, Angela
emailed me back, saying the girls were so inspired that
they feel that they can be and live lives that they never
had dreamt of.

Now, what the girls are doing are really true young
leaders in our community. They went back and gave a
presentation to their school board members about our
conference and also started a storytelling project about
their histories. They are talking to their elders in their
community and telling the story of what Somalia used to
be before the civil war. And here's a way for these girls to
really lead in their community and tell their story
themselves, all while honoring the elders of their
community.

Now, I want you to meet my friend Sally. [Music] Bloom is
an organization that I started two years ago to try to get
Muslim sisters back out into nature because,
unfortunately, a lot of us don't get outside enough. And
what better place than a setting like this to connect with
God? You know, I was born and raised here in the States,
and so I was raised camping and canoeing and being
outside. Whereas, a lot of other people, they didn't really
have that connection with nature growing up. I was

                                                             79
constantly taking out my friends like, "Let's go canoeing.
Let's go do this. Let's go do that." A lot of girls were like,
"Oh, how do you go horseback riding with your dress on?"
So, we were trying to figure out a way to do it. And then
when we figured it out for just like three people, I was
like, "This is a way, so we should do it for like 32 people."
And Bloom was born.

We started taking out bigger groups of girls. Like, today
we're gonna go canoeing. I never really seek out the
leadership role, but sometimes it seeks me out. And so,
for me, I'm organizing, I'm really outgoing, I love the
outdoors, and I have this huge network of people. It's
kind of like it just makes sense that I do this. I truly, truly
believe that God has created each one of us with very,
very, very unique characteristics and strengths. And we
need to figure out what makes us "us" and then take
those things and figure out how we can best serve our
community as a whole, and, you know, in that, serve our
God.

[Music]

The first time I watched that video, I was convinced that
the closed captioning would not keep up with Sally. So,

                                                             80
Sally is the executive director of Bloom Adventures, which
is an organization that likes to take women out and be
one with nature. When her video first debuted, she
started to get inundated with phone calls and emails and
text messages about how she could come to other
communities and start chapters around Bloom. And
what's amazing about Sally is that she can't say no, but
she knows she can't be all over the nation starting these
chapters. So, she created a document, sort of guidelines
and a how-to on starting a Bloom Adventure chapter in
other communities.

So, Sally doesn't say no, but instead, she empowers other
women to go out and do it for themselves. And when you
watch her, I hope that you started to see the images of
the St. Croix, of canoeing, of being outdoors, and you
started to forget that you can't see Sally's face--that you
hear her voice and realize that it sounds just like yours. I
hope that, instead of having those really threatening
stereotypes pop up into your conscious, instead you feel
curiosity, and you feel a connection with her. You see,
we're all human, and we all love to know about one
another. We crave that human connection. We empathize.

                                                             81
We want to be able to lift each other up and continue
telling these stories.
Now, I've been telling these stories for a while, and I
invite you to share yours as well as tell these stories
going forward. Now, when I Google "Muslim women," if I
scroll down just a little bit, I can find myself.
Thank you.
