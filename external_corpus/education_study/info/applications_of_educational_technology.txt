Learning to Learn any Technology

You've heard the old adage . . .
If you give a man a fish, you feed him for a day; if you teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime.
The aim of part one of this chapter is to help you gain knowledge and skill that will transfer to learning any new
technology.

Steps in Learning to Learn

Let's talk about learning to learn any technology. There are six steps that we'll discuss:

 1. Consider your Purpose
2. Explore the Possibilities
3. Find Patterns
4. Learn from the Pros
5. Play
6. Take Pride

CONSIDER YOUR PURPOSE

Sometimes you are assigned a technology (could be a piece of software or a hardware tool) to learn, as you will be
doing in the next two weeks with SMART Notebook, OneNote, Office 365, and Diigo. When that happens, the first thing
you want to learn is the purpose of that tool. What problem was this technology designed to solve? Other times, you'll
go about this the opposite way -- first considering the problem you need to solve and then searching for technology
designed for the purpose of solving that problem.
You can think of any technology as a system - a combination of parts. The parts of a system may be physical (a
computer is made up of physical components connected to a central processor) or processes (whatever email system
you use connects the processes of sending, receiving, and organizing email messages). Systems and purpose go hand-
in-hand, and it's important to recognize these at the beginning of learning a technology. You are already familiar with
technologies designed to enhance your educational experience like information systems (ex: SIS), communication
systems (Cowboy Mail or Orange Mail), collaboration systems (Google Docs), and systems that combine all three of
these purposes (Online Classroom).

EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITIES

Once you have figured out your purpose for learning a particular technology, your next step is to explore the
possibilities. You want to know what you will be able to do with this tool. The developer's website for this tool is where
you will want to start. Most sites will have a gallery of users' work, which gives you a great idea of the possibilities.
Another common tactic is to do a general web search for "what can I do with ________?"

There are almost always multiple tools to fulfill your purpose. You'll want to select the best one that fits within the
systems you already use.

FIND PATTERNS

Have you ever noticed how you learn to use one technology and then easily transition to another tool based on that
previous knowledge and experience? Whether you realized it or not, many of you used knowledge gained from your
very cool MySpace page when you started using Facebook. Then, when you transitioned to Twitter and Instagram, you
subconsciously were seeing similarities and differences in them compared to Facebook. While learning technologies,
make a conscious effort to find similarities and make comparisons to what you already know. For example, you're
almost certain to find a top menu bar with the items "File," "Edit," "View," "Help" and others in practically any app you
open.

LEARN FROM THE PROS

Finding patterns can increase your comfort level when learning a new tool, but going to the pros who already know
what they are doing will take you even further. Developers typically offer tutorials on their website or under the "Help"
menu. The other pros are those you may know socially or professionally -- don't hesitate to send out a call to your
personal or professional network to see who else might be using that technology and what advice they have for you. If
you are conducting a general web search for tutorials, be as specific as possible to get the most meaningful results.
Another helpful resource can be found in sites that build tutorials as a commercial enterprise. They often have some
free resources while others are only available with a subscription.

PLAY

This step is actually harder than it sounds like! Probably from about the time you entered school, you started getting
the unfortunately misguided message that learning is work and play is not a valuable way to spend your time. Too many
adults avoid tinkering around with a technology out of fear of not doing something right, but we always learn more
from our efforts and mistakes than we do from doing something right the first time. Play is an extremely valuable part
of learning technologies, and you may be one of those people who has to actually schedule time to play on your daily
calendar!

TAKE PRIDE

The final step in the process of learning a new technology is taking pride in what you've accomplished. Even if you
didn't finish with some amazing product worthy of selling on the home shopping network, consider how very much
you gained through the process of learning and will be able to apply to your next learning endeavor. Besides, sharing
your learning journey with someone else may be just what they need!

Differentiated Learning with Educational
Technology

      Essential Questions

          Why should I differentiate my instruction for my students? Think beyond understanding that students
       learn differently.
       What does meaningful differentiation look like in a real classroom?
       Which teaching strategies can I employ to meet my students' individual needs?
       In what ways might I use technology to differentiate my instruction for my students?

Differentiated Learning with Educational Technology

Differentiated instruction is recognizing and being responsive to different learning needs of individuals and small groups
of students. The website Differentiation Central offers an excellent flow chart of the process. Access the full website
at http://differentiationcentral.com/model/.

                           This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 9
   The Teaching Channel website offers a series of videos for new teachers. Explore the site's K12 hub differentiation
topics and see if you can identify some specific strategies for differentiating in the classroom.

   Tomlinson's Differentiated Instruction Model (2010) is based on six elements:

   High-quality curriculum - identifying exactly what you want the students to know, understand, and be able to do
      at a rigorous and challenging level

   Continual assessment - using pre-assessments to determine what the students already know, understand and are
      able to do as well as where their interests lie; using formative assessments to determine when and how re-
      teaching needs to be done; and using summative assessments to allow students to demonstrate what they have
      learned

   Respectful tasks - All tasks should be challenging, interesting and worth doing. If some students are engaged in
      this type of work while others are completing drill and practice workshop, there is disrespect happening.

   Building community - The differentiated learning community must be a safe, accepting, risk-free environment
      where failure and learning from it is celebrated. Therefore, it is necessary for the teacher to insure that all learners
      understand and respect the process of differentiating instruction.

   Flexible grouping - At any given time, students may work individually, as a whole group, or in small groups or with
      a partner based on interests (similar or dissimilar) or readiness to learn (similar or dissimilar).

   Teaching up - Tomlinson (2010) notes that all students should be challenged to work up to the level just above his
      or her current competence. Differentiation is NOT about "dumbing down" the content for some students but not

10 | This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/
      for others.

The Differentiated Instruction Teachers' Guide (2007) offers four areas where differentiation can occur:

   Content - All students in your class will be expected to master the given curriculum standards (Oklahoma Content
      Standards, currently-used to be CCSS, PASS), but you can provide them different paths to gaining that knowledge.
      A pre-assessment is critical to determine what current knowledge and skill have already been mastered by
      individuals so the teacher can then determine which paths need to be made available.

   Process - Different methods can be employed based on the idea that how students learn best can be different.
      Many teachers use a "menu" of activities for students to choose the process they believe will work best for them.

   Products - Each student needs to demonstrate mastery of a standard or objective, but they may be able to
      demonstrate that mastery in a very different way than their classmates. A very clear summative assessment tool,
      like a rubric focused on what the student knows, understands and is able to do, is critical.

   Learning Environment - The learning environment in a differentiated classroom includes both physical and social/
      emotional aspects. The physical space may include adjustments to lighting, noise, types of furniture, and
      equipment. The social/emotional environment must be built upon respect for individual differences and
      supportive classroom management.

Judith Dodge (2009, p. 9, http://www.slideshare.net/robertojosephgalvan/25-quickformativeassessments) offers
specific strategies to help teachers address student needs at different levels of readiness. Which of these suggestions
could you consider?

Scaffolding Struggling Learners

   Offer teacher direction (reteaching with a different method)
   Allow the student to work with a reading partner, study buddy, or learning partner. (Buddy-up an English language

      learner (ELL) with another student.) This will provide peer support for collaborative learning.
   Allow students to use class notes, textbooks, and/or other classroom resources to complete the task.
   Provide a model or exemplar (of a similar problem solved or a sample of the type of writing expected).
   Furnish step-by-step directions; break down the task.
   Provide hints or tips.
   Color-code different elements; highlight for focusing; provide "masks and markers" for focused attention on

      specific text.
   Provide sentence strips, sticky labels with terms, or manipulatives (plastic coins, Judy clocks, Unifix cubes, fraction

      tiles, number lines, algebraic tiles, calculators, etc.).
   Provide a partially completed graphic organizer or outline.
   Provide out-of-sequence steps for students to reorganize.
   Allow additional time.
   Provide a cloze (fill-in-the-blank) paragraph (with or without a word box) for students whose language is

      extremely limited or for those who struggle with grapho-motor skills.
   Give a framed paragraph or essay (with sentence starters to help organize the writing).
   Provide guided questions.
   Supply a word bank and definitions.
   Support with visuals, diagrams, or pictures.

                           This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 11
   Provide words on labels for students to simply pull off and place appropriately.

Challenging Advanced Learners

   Design activities that are more complex, abstract, independent, and/or multistep.
   Pose a challenge question or task that requires them to think beyond the concrete and obvious response (from the

      newly learned material) to more abstract ideas and new use of the information.
   Require more complex expression of ideas: different types of sentences, synonyms, more than one adjective or

      action (verb) to describe what's happening.
   Require that metaphors and similes, idiomatic expressions, or specific literary elements be included in their

      writing.
   Ask students to make text-to-text and text-to-world connections (more abstract than text-to-self connections).
   Require students to note relationships and point out connections among ideas: compare and contrast; cause and

      effect; problem and solution; sequence, steps, or change over time; advantages and disadvantages; benefits; etc.
   Have students create their own pattern, graph, experiment, word problem, scenario, story, poem, etc.
   Ask students to tell the story from a different point of view.
   Ask students to place themselves into the story or time period and write from the first-person point of view.
   Ask students to consider "What if?" scenarios
   Provide multistep math problems.
   Include distracters.
   Do not provide a visual prompt.
   Ask students to suggest tips or hints that would help others who struggle to make sense of the information.
   Provide a problem or model that does not work; have students problem-solve.
   Have students use the information in a completely new way (Design an awareness campaign about . . .; Create a

      flyer to inform . . .; Write/give a speech to convince . . .; Write an article to educate . . .; Write an ad to warn others
      about . . .; Design a program to solve the problem of . . .)

Technology in the classroom is crucial to the success of a differentiated classroom. Read the Educational Leadership
article "From Gadget to Gift" and watch the video interview with Carol Ann Tomlinson to get some ideas.

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:

ISTE Standards

Which ISTE Standards do you think this chapter could help you address? The standards listed below are from an older
draft, but they are still a good way to think about and scope your work.

   2. Design and Develop Digital Age Learning Experiences and Assessments

   Teachers design, develop, and evaluate authentic learning experiences and assessment incorporating
      contemporary tools and resources to maximize content learning in context and to develop the knowledge, skills,
      and attitudes identified in the ISTE톁.
         a. Design or adapt relevant learning experiences that incorporate digital tools and resources to promote
            student learning and creativity
         b. Develop technology-enriched learning environments that enable all students to pursue their individual
            curiosities and become active participants in setting their own educational goals, managing their own
            learning, and assessing their own progress
         c. Customize and personalize learning activities to address students' diverse learning styles, working
            strategies, and abilities using digital tools and resources
         d. Provide students with multiple and varied formative and summative assessments aligned with content and
            technology standards and use resulting data to inform learning and teaching

4. Promote and Model Digital Citizenship and Responsibility

   Teachers understand local and global societal issues and responsibilities in an evolving digital culture and exhibit
      legal and ethical behavior in their professional practices.
         b. Address the diverse needs of all learners by using learner-centered strategies providing equitable access to
            appropriate digital tools and resources

Instructional Design

      Essential Questions

          What is instructional design?
       What are Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction?
       What are the most engaging ways content can be presented so students remain active while gaining content
       knowledge?

          What learning community resources are available to find and share digital resources for creating
       engaging lessons?

Models for Designing Instruction

Instructional design is the practice of creating "instructional experiences which make the acquisition of knowledge and
skill more efficient, effective, and appealing" (Merrill, et al., 1996).

   For you, as a future teacher, this means that there is a whole academic field dedicated to helping you create the
best possible lessons for your students. You will encounter a variety of methods for creating lesson plans during your
coursework and when you take your first teaching job; but, they all have some elements in common.

   Below are three different instructional design approaches -- see if you can spot the similarities and differences:

   Implementation (a procedure for training the facilitators and the

   Notice that each of the three instructional design models systematically consider the basics: who the learners
are, what is to be learned, how the learning will be assessed, and which strategies and resources will be used to make
sure students learn. One difference you may have noticed between the three is that Understanding by Design is
backwards -- it begins with the end in mind and then plans how to get there.

Instructional Strategies

In this course you will have the opportunity to develop and teach a lesson to your peers as part of a teaching team.
We will be using a particular instructional design model to make sure you've provided the best opportunity for your
"students" to learn: Gagne's Nine Events of Instruction.

   The graphic below gives you some details about the model:

By following these nine steps, you make sure you have taught a thorough lesson. Side note: the image above was created
using Piktochart. We may use this platform later in the course!

   "Step 4: Present Material" is often the most difficult to plan for. We all have been lectured at for so many years, and
even though it's typically not our favorite way to learn, we tend to fall back on it while we're teaching. Your challenge
in this course will be to come up with interactive and engaging ways to present material so your "students" are actively
learning. Kevin Yee has collected 186 interactive techniques to keep students engaged in your teaching. You can see the
full list at

selected a few to share with you below:

Strategy                 Description

Category: Lecture

Instructor Storytelling  Instructor illustrates a concept, idea, or principle with a reallife application, model, or
                         case-study.

Empty Outlines           Distribute a partially completed outline of today's lecture and ask students to fill it in. Useful at
                         start or at end of class.

Student Polling          Use a site like Poll Everywhere (http://polleverywhere.com); distribute standardized cards that
                         can be held aloft as visual responses to instructor questions (ex: green card for true, red for
                         false,yellow for not sure); or use small erasable marker boards for each student to display an
                         answer.

Pass the Chalk           Provide chalk, a soft toy, or small beach ball; whoever has it must answer your next question, and
                         they pass it on to the student of their choice.

The Half Class Lecture   Divide the class in half and provide reading material to one half. Lecture on that same material to
                         the other half of the class. Then, switch the groups and repeat, ending with a recap by pairing up
                         members of opposite groups.

Category: Individual Student Work

One-Minute Papers        Students write for one minute on a specific question (which might be generalized to "what was
                         the most important thing you learned today"). Best used at the end of the class session.

Muddiest Point           Like the Minute Paper, but asks for the "most confusing" point instead. Best used at the end of
                         the class session.

Drawing for              Students illustrate an abstract concept or idea. Comparing drawings around the room can clear
Understanding            up misconceptions.

Concept Mapping          Students write keywords onto sticky notes and then organize them into a flowchart. Could be
                         less structured: students simply draw the connections they make between concepts.

Bumper Stickers          Ask students to write a slogan-like bumper sticker to illustrate a particular concept from lecture.

Category: Students Working in Pairs

Think-Pair-Share         Students share and compare possible answers to a question with a partner before addressing the
                         larger class.

Pair-Share-Repeat        After a pair-share experience, ask students to find a new partner and debrief the wisdom of the
                         old partnership to this new partner.

Wisdom of Another        After any individual brainstorm or creative activity, partner students up to share their results.
                         Then, call for volunteers of students who found their partner's work to be interesting or
                         exemplary. Students are sometimes more willing to share in plenary the work of fellow students
                         than their own work.

Forced Debate            Students debate in pairs, but must defend the opposite side of their personal opinion. Variation:
                         half the class take one position, half the other. They line up and face each other. Each student
                         may only speak once, so that all students on both sides can engage the issue.

Category: Student Groups
Jigsaw              Give each group a different topic. Re-mix groups with one planted "expert" on each topic, who
(Group Experts)     now has to teach his new group.

Board Rotation      Assign groups of students to each of the boards you have set up in the room (four or more works
                    best), and assign one topic/question per board. After each group writes an answer, they rotate
                    to the next board and write their answer below the first, and so on around the room.

TV Commercial       In groups, students create a 30-second TV commercial for the subject currently being discussed
                    in class. Variation: ask them to act out their commercials.

Blender             Students silently write a definition or brainstorm an idea for several minutes on paper. Then they
                    form into groups, and two of them read their ideas and integrate elements from each. A third
                    student reads his, and again integration occurs with the previous two, until finally everyone in
                    the group has been integrated (or has attempted integration).

Simulation          Place the class into a long-term simulation (like as a business) to enable Problem-Based Learning
                    (PBL).

Imaginary Show and  Students pretend they have brought an object relevant to current discussion, and "display" it to
Tell                the class while talking about its properties

It seems that there is an endless supply of creative ideas of how and what to teach, but how in the world does
one find them and share with other teachers?! The word "curate" means to purposefully select certain things from
countless possibilities. You probably have heard the term in relation to a museum curator. Due to the vast amount of
resources available on the Internet, it is critical to develop skills in locating, evaluating, using, and sharing information
effectively. Web-based social bookmarking sites allow users to store, organize and share resources. Typically, resources
are "tagged" by users according to the individual user's choice of classification. Since it is socialbookmarking, you can
search by common tags other users have selected as well. Common tags you may use in this class are things like
"lesson plans," "edtech," or "teaching with technology." You can also join a group of users who have similar interests
to build a common collection of resources. We are going to be collecting resources within this course using Diigo
(http://diigo.com) through the EDTC 3123 group.

   The learning community we are building in this class will be available to you long after you complete the course and
graduate.

Technology Integration

      Essential Questions

          Why would a teacher want to teach with technology?
       What does effective technology integration look like?
       What are the national standards for teaching and learning with technology?

Teaching WITH Technology

In the book Meaningful Learning with Technology (2012), authors Howland, Jonassen, and Marra set forth a set of
assumptions:

   Technology is more than hardware. Technology consists also of the designs and the environments that engage
      learners. Technology can also consist of any reliable technique or method for engaging learning, such as cognitive-
      learning strategies and critical-thinking skills.

   Learning technologies can be any environment or definable set of activities that engage learners in active,
      constructive, intentional, authentic, and cooperative learning.

   Technologies are not conveyors or communicators of meaning. Nor should they prescribe and control all of the
      learner interactions.

   Technologies support meaningful learning when they fulfill a learning need -- when interactions with technologies
      are learner initiated and learner controlled, and when interactions with the technologies are conceptually and
      intellectually engaging.

   Technologies should function as intellectual tool kits that enable learners to build more meaningful personal
      interpretations and representations of the world. These tool kits must support the intellectual functions that are
      required by a course of study.

   Learners and technologies should be intellectual partners, where the cognitive responsibility for performance is
      distributed to the partner that performs it better. (Howland, Jonassen, & Marra, 2012, p. 7)

Many people think only of computers when they consider teaching with technology, but in this class, we're going to be
thinking much deeper and broader about it, as you can see from the assumptions above and in the latest definition of
the field of educational technology:
"Educational technology is the study and ethical practice of facilitating learning and improving performance by
creating, using, and managing appropriate technological processes and resources" (Association for Educational
Communication & Technology, Januszewdki & Molenda, 2008)

Why Technology Integration?

Chances are you have had a great teacher in your past who has inspired you. Study after study shows that the single
most important factor in the quality of education a child receives is the quality of his/her teacher. We often hear
students describe their best teachers as those who are tough but fair, love to learn, are enthusiastic about what they do,
make learning fun, and build relationship with their students. What does all this have to do with educational technology?
Watch this short video for an answer to why you would want to integrate technology in your teaching:

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/?p=31#oembed-1

It might be fun to take the the transcript from this video (direct link: http://www.edutopia.org/technology-integration-
introduction-video) and made a word cloud of it. What words do you think might jump out?

A word cloud is a great tool to analyze what is really being said. Note how often these words were used in talking about
technology integration in this video: learning, using, student, create, technology, kids, tools, make, think, work, share,
personal, ideas, better, seeing, etc. A word cloud lets you see at a glance what tech integration is all about - student
learning with the best possible tools available.

   Can you think of a time you might have your student create a word cloud? What would you have them do after they
created it?

What Does Technology Integration Look Like?

How would you know if you're seeing effective technology integration in a classroom? There are really two important
variables to consider: what the teacher is doing and what is happening in the learning environment. The Arizona
Technology Integration Matrix (TIM http://www.azk12.org/tim) is particularly helpful when making this determination.
Click through and take a look.

   The top row is concerned with what the teacher is doing. Notice a teacher at the "Entry" level of technology
integration is the one with his/her hands on the technology and is delivering to students. This is a very "teacher-
centered" scenario. Look toward the upward progression of the matrix and note that when the teacher is at the higher
levels of technology he/she is not the one actually controlling the tools, but rather, he/she is acting much more as a
facilitator and coach. At the low level, the focus is on the teacher's performance, and at the higher levels, the focus is on
student learning! Similarly, down the left column, we see the different types of learning environments that describe how
the students are engaged in learning.

The USF Technology Integration Matrix (http://fcit.usf.edu/matrix/matrix.php) is another useful tool to help you see
different levels of technology integration. Along the x-axis is a continuum of five levels of technology integration from
lowest to highest: entry, adoption, adaptation, infusion, and transformation. Along the y-axis are the five characteristics
of meaningful learning environments: active, collaborative, constructive, authentic, and goal-directed. Examples of
lessons at different grade levels and in different content areas are shown at the intersection of each level of tech
integration with each meaningful learning environment.

   You will want to spend a couple of hours studying these great examples to fully understand what is meant by

                          This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 25
technology integration. By the end of this course, we expect you will be able to envision yourself engaging students in
meaningful learning as you continue to move toward the higher levels of technology integration.

   Below is further description of the characteristics of meaningful learning environments:

                    An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/?p=31#h5p-1

With or From

As you saw in the TIM videos, each of these environments allowed for technology integration, but some seemed to
be more engaging for students than others. Let's take a look at the differences between learning from technology and
learning with technology:

   Learning from technology: This is most easily depicted as "drill and practice" or "electronic worksheets" in which
      the learner reacts to the technology, and the technology guides/directs the student. A high level of thinking is not
      needed here -- just memorization or repetition. Technology serves as a repository or distributor of information.

   Learning with technology: When students use technologies to communicate their ideas, work in collaborative
      groups, conduct in-depth research, interpret and represent their interpretations, and engage conceptually and
      intellectually at the point they need support, they are learning with technology. Technology is serving as a partner
      to the learner in this instance. (Howland, Jonassen, & Marra, 2012)

You will encounter a variety of models to assist with integrating technology into teaching and learning. We've chosen to
include TIM in this course, but know that there are other models as well. When you encounter different models, make
sure they are focusing on improving student learning first rather than focusing on tools first!

Assessing Learning

      Essential Questions

          How do you know what to assess?
       What technologies help make formative and summative assessments more effective and efficient?
       How is the performance of teachers assessed?
       How is the performance of schools assessed?

Learning Standards: Frameworks for Learning

There are a multitude of standards that give you a framework for knowing what your students are responsible for
learning and guide you in assessing their learning. First, let's look at two frameworks revealing what students should
know and be able to do in relation to technology: the ISTE Educational Technology Standards for Students (ISTE-S), the
21st Century Skills, and the Common Core.
ISTE Standards: http://www.iste.org/docs/Standards-Resources/iste-standards_students-2016_one-
sheet_final.pdf?sfvrsn=0.23432948779836327
Framework Definitions: http://www.p21.org/storage/documents/P21_Framework_Definitions.pdf
Common Core Standards: http://www.corestandards.org/read-the-standards/
A large majority of states have adopted the Common Core standards, and most are integrating them into existing state
standards. Oklahoma has re-written its Academic Standards, having previously integrated CCSS into the previously-
used Oklahoma Academic Standards. Legislative actions sometimes put the future of academic standards in Oklahoma
in limbo-it's a good lesson in keeping current with legislation that impacts education and educators! Keep an eye on
the Oklahoma standards for your discipline, as they may undergo revision frequently.

Above and Beyond is a short digital story created through collaboration by members of Partnership for 21st Century
Skills and FableVision. The story reflects the 21st Century Skills by showing what is possible when communication,
collaboration, critical thinking and creativity (often referred to as the 4Cs) take center stage in schools and transform
learning opportunities for all kids.

Formative and Summative Assessments Using Technology

Formative and summative assessments are both used to determine how well students are performing.
   Formative assessment is ongoing and provides information needed to adjust teaching and learning (remember

differentiation?). It gives important feedback to students letting them know they are on the right track and helps the
teacher determine whether students are ready to move on to the next task. Summative assessment is more of a singular
event at the end an instructional unit or module. To get the full picture of how well students are performing and whether
or how instruction needs to be adjusted, a teacher needs both formative and summative assessments.

Fair Assessment of Student Learning

It is critical to assess your students' learning in a fair manner. The Middle States Commission on Higher Education (2008,
p. 1) offers seven items that will help teachers make sure they are being fair:

 1. Have clearly stated learning outcomes and share them with your students, so they know what you expect from
      them. Help them understand what your most important goals are (detailed in a rubric you will use to assess their
      research project).

2. Match your assessment to what you teach and vice versa. If you expect your students to demonstrate good writing
      skills, explain how you define good writing, and help students develop their skills.

3. Use many different measures and many different kinds of measures. We know that students learn and demonstrate
      their learning in many different ways. Some learn best by reading and writing, others through collaboration with
      peers, others through listening, creating a schema or design, or hands-on practice, so give your students a variety
      of ways to demonstrate what they've learned.

4. Help students learn how to do the assessment task. No matter what kind of assessment you are planning, at least
      some of your students will need your help in learning the skills needed to succeed on that assessment.

5. Engage and encourage your students. Engaging students in building the assessment can be encouraging to them.
      For example, when you introduce them to the rubric, ask them if they think it's missing anything or if they would
      like to have something else to be measured.

6. Interpret assessment results appropriately. Suskie (2000) notes that it is "often most appropriate to base a
      judgement on a standard: Did the student present compelling evidence? summarize accurately? make justifiable
      inferences? At other times, it may be appropriate to consider growth as well. Does the student who once hated
      medieval art now love it, even though she can't always remember names and dates? Does another student, once
      incapable of writing a coherent argument, now do so passably, even if his performance is not yet up to your usual
      standards?" (p. 3).

 7. Evaluate the outcomes of your assessments. Suskie (2000) adds "if your students don't do well on a particular
      assessment, ask them why. Sometimes your question or prompt isn't clear; sometimes you may find that you
      simply didn't teach a concept well. Revise your assessment tools, your pedagogy, or both, and your assessments
      are bound to be fairer the next time that you use them" (p. 3).

Digital Portfolios and Deconstructing Standards

Digital portfolios can be an effective way for students and teachers to document their learning experiences. Experts
distinguish 3 different types of digital or electronic portfolios that are currently in use:

30 | This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/
   Online assessment systems where students place artifacts in an institutionally designed template
   A "print-loaded" portfolio that takes a paper text and displays electronically
   A portfolio that uses text boxes, hyperlinking, visuals, audio texts and design elements to convey a teacher's

      materials.

Types of Portfolio Assessments

There are two basic "families" of portfolios: growth and best work. A "growth" portfolio shows the learner's journey of
acquiring knowledge and skills. Your professional education portfolio is an example of this. A "best work" portfolio
exhibits only the learner's very best work. This type of portfolio is one you would want to display for a potential
employer. The chart below shows these two types, using "Learning & Collaboration" to describe the growth portfolio
and "Showcasing Achievement" for the best work portfolio.

When using portfolios, students choose which artifacts best represent their ability to meet the standards, thus the
portfolio process can be a democratic one. Choosing an artifact as evidence that you have met a specific standard is
probably the hardest part of putting together your portfolio. The section below will walk you through a very critical skill
that will be invaluable as you do your own work and when you are teaching your own students.

Deconstructing Standards

Here's a video explaining the activity we'll be doing in class:

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/?p=34#oembed-2

Standards can often be difficult to turn into practical plans for teaching and learning, but they are extremely important
because they let the learner know what the target is. In this class, our learning target is to master the ISTE-T standards.
These standards tell us what every teacher should know and be able to do in relation to educational technology, so they
are very important!

   Deconstructing, or unpacking, standards is a process educators undertake to clarify exactly what is meant by a
standard. There are actually four types of "targets" we can see in learning standards:

   Knowledge Targets-The facts and concepts we want students to know. Knowledge targets represent the factual
      underpinnings in each discipline. They are often stated using verbs such as knows, lists, names, identifies, and
      recalls. Ex. Know multiplication facts to 10

   Reasoning Targets-Students use knowledge and understanding to reason and solve problems. Reasoning targets
      represent mental processes such as predicts, infers, classifies, hypothesizes, compares, concludes, summarizes,
      analyzes, evaluates, and generalizes.

   Process/Skill Targets-Students use their knowledge and reasoning to act skillfully. Process/skill targets refer to
      those performances that must be demonstrated and observed, heard or seen, to be assessed. Knowledge targets
      always precede skill targets. Process/skill targets are also evidenced by the process being the most important
      aspect. Ex. Oral fluency in reading, driving with skill, playing a musical instrument.

                          This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 31
   Product Targets- Students use their knowledge, reasoning, and skills to create a concrete product such as
      "creates tables, graphs, scatter plots, and box plots to display data, notates music, or creates a personal wellness
      plan."

Here are the steps to deconstructing, or unpacking a learning standard:
   1. Select standard or objective to unpack.

   Highlight all of the verbs in the standard in red (circling or underlining works too)
   Highlight all of the nouns in the standard in green

2. Look at the verbs and determine what type of target the standard represents:

   Knowledge
   Patterns of reasoning
   Skills
   Products

3. Use the nouns with the verbs to write understandable learning targets.

   What targets are in this standard?
   What key vocabulary do students need to know?
   What key understandings do students need to have?

4. Stop and Reflect

   Are all of the knowledge, reasoning, skills and products that students need to be successful listed? What else do
      students need to know, understand or be able to do to master this standard?

5. Write each target in student friendly "I Can," "We Will," or "I Will" language.
   Let's try an example. The ISTE Standards-T standard 5.b. below is "Exhibit leadership by demonstrating a vision of

technology infusion, participating in shared decision making and community building, and developing the leadership
and technology skills of others." Imagine it with the verbs in one color and the nouns in another:

Exhibit leadership by demonstrating a vision of technology infusion, participating in shared decision
making and community building, and developing the leadership and technology skills of others.

This standard contains four targets:

 1. Exhibit leadership - This is a process/skill target because leadership must be observed or demonstrated to be
      assessed

2. Demonstrate a vision of technology infusion - Having a vision for technology infusion assumes that the learner
      has knowledge of technology infusion, but it is also asking for the learner to demonstrate that vision, which is
      a process/skill target.

3. Participate in shared decision making and community building - "Participate" and "community building" indicates
      a process/skill target, but note that a reasoning target is evident in "shared decision making."

4. Developing the leadership and technology skills of others - This is a process/skill target (developing leadership of
      others) that relies on a knowledge target (technology skills).

Our final step is to clarify these further, adding some specific information to help you see exactly how this standard
"fits" this chapter content and the activities we will be undertaking in this course:

   We will demonstrate a vision of technology integration/infusion when we create individual lesson plans for our
      content area and grade level.

   Strong technology-infused lesson plans help us exhibit leadership as a teacher who knows current practices, tools,
      and instructional strategies.

   We will participate in shared decision making and community building as we work in Peer Teaching Teams to plan
      and deliver lessons.

   We will participate in developing the leadership and technology skills of others as we actively engage each week in
      class and with online resources.

   We will participate in community building as we curate technology resources to be shared via social media long
      after we complete this class.

Compare these bullet points to the standard above. Don't the standards make more sense when you deconstruct, or
unpack, them? This is a very important skill you need to master as a teacher. Use the Making Sense of Standards
worksheet to get to know the ISTE Standards-E, ISTE Standards-S, and Oklahoma Academic Standards in this course.

      Essential Questions

          How does the personalization of social media and web search tools impact individuals?
          What is a digital footprint and how can I manage mine?
          What is the difference between the Surface Web and the Deep Web?
          How can I get the best information from a Web search?

Being NetSmart

The digital culture we live in demands knowledge and skills in managing personal and professional information in
public spaces -- the Web and social media apps in particular. It is no longer an option to be a passive user of the Web
and social media without being smart about your use of it and, frankly, its use of you. We use social media to share our
lives with friends and Web search engines to locate web-based information and services, but how might these tools be
using us? Rheingold (2012) explains

       Google, Bing, Yahoo! And other search engines offer search as a free service on the Web, because searches
       provide the marketing information that advertisers have sought like the conquistadores sought El Dorado --
       a way to show large numbers of individuals advertisements that each person might actually be interested in.
       Search is both a public good -- something useful to everybody, but that individuals lack sufficient incentive to
       create for themselves -- and a way to amass significant private wealth by selling a valuable commodity. In Web
       search, the valuable commodity is the searchers' attention. Search engines sell sponsored links that appear on
       the top or side of the page of links displayed in response to a search query. Whenever someone clicks on a
       sponsored link, a small amount of money goes to the search engine provider. Those clicks add up to billions of
       dollars each year. (p. 85)
You are probably well-aware also of how marketing uses social media -- to promote products, causes, candidates,
services, and also to gather the valuable commodity of the users' attention. Is this a bad thing? Actually, no. These tools
are just making use of a perfect marketing opportunity. The problem is when users are unaware of how the information
they willingly provide is being used.
Rheingold (2012) advises "Awareness of your digital footprints and impacts of your digital profiles ought to precede
your conscious participation online. Think before you post, because your digital actions are findable, reproducible, and
available to people you don't know, and will remain available to all indefinitely" (p. 249). What is your digital footprint?
Is it the one you intended to leave? The video below from Internet Society offers four reasons you should care about
your digital footprint:

                          This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 35

                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/?p=37#oembed-1

Your digital footprint is comprised of information such as particular links you click on when using a search engine,
groups you join, online shopping preferences, and reacting to someone else's social media post. How do you know what
footprints you've left? Try these steps:

 1. Search your name on a variety of different search engines. Search text, images, and video. If anything comes up
      that you would prefer not be attached to your name, take steps to remove it from the site it happens to be on.
      Don't hesitate to contact a webmaster if you need something taken off a particular site but have no way to do it.

2. Clean up accounts! You may have an old account somewhere that you haven't accessed since Jr. High that needs to
      be deleted. If you have accounts you plan to "deactivate," clean out all the photos and information before
      deactivating.

3. Check the privacy settings on your active accounts. Make a habit of going through your active accounts each year
      and clean them up. Anything you want to keep can be backed up on your hard drive without leaving it out and
      available within the app. Make sure you know what you are sharing and with whom you are sharing it. All social
      media apps' privacy settings require attention!

4. Unsubscribe from any mailing lists that you don't really need.
5. Use a secondary email account for sites you sign up on that may send marketing.
6. Check any e-commerce or retail sites and delete your account if you no longer use them.
 7. Use a more private web browser and search engine. DuckDuckGo doesn't log any personally identifiable

      information, doesn't use cookies to identify you, and it discards user agents and IP addresses from its server
      logs. StartPage runs a Google search for you but does not pass your information on to Google. Most major
      browsers have a private, or incognito mode, but note this still tracks your IP address (see
      https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch001378.htm for more information).
8. Always remember that digital information doesn't really go away, so think very carefully before you post! If you
      want to test how long web information remains available, search for a URL (like http://okstate.edu) on the
      Wayback Machine Internet Archive (http://archive.org).

There are serious privacy-related issues such as identity theft, surveillance, and behavioral data mining associated
with web and social media activities, but there are great affordances for those who bring knowledge and skill to their
engagement in digital culture. The wealth of outstanding information available, engagement in personal and professional
communities, and the opportunity to collaboratively create with diverse, global citizens cannot be ignored. Rheingold
explains, "Every PC as well as smart phone is a printing press, broadcasting station, political organizing tool, and site for
growing a community or marketplace. Knowledge, power, advantage, companionship, and influence lie with those who
know how to participate, rather than those who just passively consume culture" (p. 249).
It is ironic that we now enjoy such a high level of connectivity through the Web and social media, but the tracking of
our personal data and activity actually brings a self-segregated experience to users (boyd, 2017). Watch this video to
understand the effect of the filter bubble, or echo chamber, that is created for us based on our online activities:

(For a series of additional videos on How to Pop Your Filter Bubble, see https://www.youtube.com/
watch?v=B8of WFx525s&list=PLOGi5-fAu8bGbT40N1o65uMu9f HqAaojM).
By functioning online within our own filter bubble, or echo chamber, we miss out on the chance to appreciate diverse
perspectives and interact in a heterogeneous environment. Unfortunately, our society seems to be more polarized than
ever. Do you think there's a connection here? Danah Boyd noted:

       Thus, given the opportunity, people typically revert to situations where they can be in homogeneous
       environments. They look for "safe spaces" and "culture fit." And systems that are "personalized" are highly
       desirable. Most people aren't looking to self-segregate, but they do it anyway. And, increasingly, the technologies
       and tools around us allow us to self-segregate with ease. Is your uncle annoying you with his political rants?
       Mute him. Tired of getting ads for irrelevant products? Reveal your preferences. Want your search engine to
       remember the things that matter to you? Let it capture data.Want to watch a TV show that appeals to your
       senses? Here are some recommendations. (n.p.)
Take notice of the ads that show up when you conduct a search. Are they connected to anything else you've reacted to
on social media or searched for? Have a friend conduct the same search as you and notice the difference in the
sponsored links and ads that appear. You should see individual preference data reflected in ads. This personalization of
information comes at the price of your privacy and gives you a very narrow view of all available Web
resources. Another limiting aspect to what you see on the Web is tied to common search engines. Search tools like
Google or Bing index approximately 4% of all available web resources -- just the surface. The deep web is the part of
the Web that cannot be accessed by a general search engine. Consider how many great resources you're missing out on
that common search engines are not showing you!

Deep Web

Different types of search engines to access more than just the surface web:

Curating Open Educational Resources

      Essential Questions

          What is the difference between collecting and curating resources?
       What are open educational resources (OER)?
       How might educational websites provide interactive and engaging experiences for students?

Open Educational Resources (OER)

Open educational resources (OER) are free and openly licensed educational materials that can be used for teaching,
learning, research, and other purposes. -- Creative Commons

   Open Education "...is the simple and powerful idea that the world's knowledge is a public good and that technology
in general and the Web in particular provide an extraordinary opportunity for everyone to share, use, and reuse
knowledge."
--The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation

Video by Open Washington: Open Educational Resources Network (http://www.openwa.org/)
   The U.S. Department of Education's #GoOpen Campaign (see also #goopen) encourages schools and states to invest

in openly licensed educational materials to transform teaching and learning.
   Spend some time at OER Commons (https://www.oercommons.org/) to discover resources you might use. Realize

the power of OER is not just that they are free to use but licensing under Creative Commons allows for re-mixing, re-
using, and re-purposing of individuals' creations.

       The Creative Commons copyright licenses and tools forge a balance inside the traditional "all rights reserved"
       setting that copyright law creates. Our tools give everyone from individual creators to large companies and
       institutions a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work. The combination
       of our tools and our users is a vast and growing digital commons, a pool of content that can be copied,
       distributed, edited, remixed, and built upon, all within the boundaries of copyright law.

The process of selecting, organizing, and sharing OER, though, is critical for teachers to master.

Collecting vs. Curating

We have all collected web-based resources by bookmarking in a browser to be able to visit them later. This is collecting
-- saving something for our own use and enjoyment. Curating is a bit different. When we curate, we are thinking critically
about resources, considering how they can be used in a specific context, and purposefully sharing them with others.
Annette Clancy explains "Collection is additive. Curation is subtractive. Collecting is for yourself, curating is for others."
Nancy White shares a chart illustrating the differences between these two activities:

                                                                                                                                                          Differences between
                                                                                                                                                          collecting and curating
                                                                                                                                                          resources arranged by
                                                                                                                                                          criteria

"A curator is an expert learner. Instead of dispensing knowledge, he creates spaces in which knowledge can be created,
explored, and connected." (Siemens, 2007).

Types of Curation Tools

Social Bookmarking - You probably already keep bookmarks of your favorite websites to go back to whenever you
might need them. Social bookmarking takes it a couple of steps further, allowing you to access your bookmarks from
any internet-enabled device, organize resources in a searchable manner by tagging, and share your bookmarks with
individuals and groups who share your interests. In this course, you are getting to know the social bookmarking
tool Diigo well, as we are posting, tagging, and sharing resources with our EDTC 3123 group. In the Resources section
of this chapter, there are links to more social bookmarking tools you might like to try.
OER Commons - OER Commons offers a digital library and network of resources curated by educators.

Standards Connector - A Standards Connector is a collection of digital resources that is specifically organized based on
a set of standards.

Types of Websites

Using Technology Resources in Different Learning
Environments

      Essential Questions

          How do you integrate technology in a classroom that has very little technology?
       What about different configurations of computer technology in the classroom?
       How do you find iPad apps to use in the classroom?
       What are some of the newest learning technologies that could change teaching and learning?

Learning Environments

There are a variety of different learning environments you may find yourself teaching in -- from a one-computer
classroom, to a computer lab down the hall, to each student having a tablet computer of their own. The table below
offers information about a variety of learning environments:

Regardless of which of the above learning environments you find yourself teaching in, finding and evaluating software
will be critical. The next section will introduce you to resources to assist you in finding and evaluating software
applications.

Finding and Evaluating Software Applications

Regardless of what hardware you happen to have in your classroom, you will need to know where to find and evaluate
the best applications. For general electronic learning resource evaluations, we love Graphite from Common Sense Media
(https://www.commonsense.org/education) and the California Learning Resource Network (http://www.clrn.org). On
the Electronic Learning Resource site, you can browse resources by subject area and grade level and read summaries
and reviews by educators.

   For iPad apps, you'll want to check out Graphite by Common Sense (https://www.graphite.org/reviews). This
directory provides app reviews from Apple Distinguished Educators. Kathy Schrock provides Bloomin' Apps
(http://www.schrockguide.net/bloomin-apps.html), a website with recommended iPad apps organized according to
Bloom's Taxonomy . She also provides two excellent resources for evaluating apps designed to provide content and for
apps designed for creation of a product.

Communication and Collaboration with Parents and
Students

      Essential Questions

          What are communication and collaboration technologies?
       As a teacher, how can I use communication and collaboration technologies to improve student learning in
       my classroom?

Whether it is teacher-to-parent, teacher-to-student, student-to-student, or parent-to-parent communication, you will
want to have the best possible options available when you are a teacher. Undoubtedly, the school district you work for
will provide you with an email account, which should be kept professional and totally separate from your personal email
account.

   You might ask parents for their email addresses and create a mailing group or listserv. Many people prefer to
communicate via text, and you may want to check out a free service that allows you to send and receive texts
with parents and students but neither your actual number nor theirs will be shared. These services (see Remind 101,
Celly, GroupMe, or SendHub) typically allow you to send messages from your phone, email, or a website.

   A teacher might also maintain a website for parents to stay up-to-date with what is going on in their students'
classroom. Many schools have a content management system in place for teachers to maintain a website for which he/
she is the sole editor and changes are not made often. A blog could be used in a situation where the teacher plans to
update information often and allows for parents and students to comment. A wiki is used when the web-based writing
is done collaboratively. For example, a group of teachers at a particular grade level might want one site they all can
contribute to.

Collaboration Tools

Collaboration goes beyond just communication. Collaboration tools allow you to share, or work together on, different
types of media. Many of these tools function like the course management systems you have experienced (D2L,
Blackboard, Moodle, etc.).

   You might create an online space for your students to get homework help online, participate in discussion, share
documents, or engage in research with other classrooms around the world. The following tools allow you do these types
of activities:

   Collaborize Classroom http://www.collaborizeclassroom.com

Innovative Pedagogies

      Essential Questions

          What is innovative pedagogy?
       What is a flipped classroom?
       What is gamification?
       What is SOLE?
       What are some ways to make the way content is presented innovative?
       What makes innovative pedagogy an effective way of learning in the classroom?

Many of you are familiar with the dictionary definition of pedagogy: the method and practice of teaching, especially as
an academic subject or theoretical concept. Sounds great! But, what does this definition mean? How does this relate to
me and my teaching? Let's dig deeper!

   This chapter is designed to further develop your pedagogy as a teacher, and develop skills for innovative pedagogical
practices.

Innovative Pedagogy in Action

Think back to Chapter 3: Instructional Design. We learned that Instructional design is the practice of creating
"instructional experiences which make the acquisition of knowledge and skill more efficient, effective, and appealing"
(Merrill, et al., 1996). We have selected three methods of instruction that we feel are particularly innovative in
educational technology: Flipped Classroom, Gamification, and Self-Organized Learning Environment (SOLE).

Flipped Classroom

A flipped classroom is just as it sounds: doing what is done in class at home, and doing what is done at home in class. Let's
break it down. In a classroom setting, the instructor typically presents material and assigns homework based of off that
material. In a flipped classroom model, instructional material is given in reading material or videos and done at home,
which leaves in class time for the students to engage in active learning (Herreid & Schiller, 2013). In their article, Herreid
and Schiller (2013) stated "A guiding principle of the flipped classroom is that work typically done as homework (e.g.,
problem solving, essay writing) is better undertaken in class with the guidance of the instructor. Listening to lecture or
watching videos is better accomplished at home".

   There are many advantages of a flipped classroom (Herreid & Schiller, 2013):
   Allows students to move at their own pace

54 | This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/
   Doing "homework" in class can give teachers better insight into student difficulties and learning styles
   Teachers can more easily customize and update the curriculum and provide it to students 24/7, and use of

      technology is flexible and appropriate
   Classroom time can be used more effectively and creatively
   Can increase student achievement, interest, and engagement
Now, let's see this concept in action! The video below is an example how a teacher introduces a flipped classroom
model to their students and their parents:

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/?p=47#oembed-1

   Now let's view an example of a lesson:

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/?p=47#oembed-2

Jon Bergmann's blog also has some excellent examples and resources.

Gamification

Playing games in the classroom? Yes, yes, and yes! Gamifying your classroom can be extremely fun and a perfect
learning opportunity for students. Gamification is "the application of typical elements of game playing (e.g., point
scoring, competition with others, rules of play) to other areas of activity." You're all familiar with gamification in
business -- think about how many points you earn at Aspen Coffee or Fuzzy's Tacos? How many of you are
earning Pocket Points right now?
Watch how this science teacher made learning science a game:

                    One or more interactive elements has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view them online here:
                    https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/?p=47#oembed-3

Paul Anderson's videos and website are great examples of how to gamify your classroom (he is also known for his
flipped classroom videos!) Paul Anderson's TEDtalk is such a great resource for learning about innovative technologies
and instructional pedagogies. He talks about how schools should be FUN and that failure is OK - that it is part of the
learning process. Further, he discusses how students learn at different "levels" and that they should be enabled to "up"
their levels. Hence, his drive to reinvent his class as a videogame. He took the most compelling elements of gaming and

                          This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 55
then applied it to his classroom.
Alice Keeler's articles on Getting Started with Gamification and Gamification of the Classroom are great tools to
getting started!
A more thorough framework comes from Yo-kai Chou. His TEDtalk provides foundational strategies for gamification.
He describes his octalysis framework and how to gamify your classroom.
Michael Matera's, EXPlore like a Pirate, is an excellent example of how to gamify a classroom.

Self-Organized Learning Environment (SOLE)

Self-organized learning environment (SOLE) was developed as a method of learning by Sugata Mitra. Mitra was
inspired by several theories centered on constructivism, child development, and social cognitive growth (Mitra et al.,
2005; Inamdar, 2004; Mitra, 2003, 2004, 2014; Piaget, 1957; Vygotsky, 1978), and the belief that "students will learn
through exploration, collaboration, and curiosity" (Schwark, 2017).
SOLE is:
Student Driven

   Students are motivated by choice and interests
   Students drive process

Collaborative

   Students learn socially
   Students collaborate in the process

Curious

   Encourage innate sense of wonder
   Curiosity helps construct understanding

Open-Minded

   Students are open minded
   Instructor is open minded

Transformative

   Critical thinking is paramount

Encouraging

   Effective educators are encouraging

Patient

   Effective educators are patient

SOLE Sessions

Self-Organized Learning Environment is a learning environment that fosters collaboration, innovation, and creativity
through the internet. Learners organize themselves into groups, while also having the freedom to jointly use resources
and move around or migrate to another group, all with limited instructor intervention. Each session begins with a "big
question" posed by the instructor, one that is intended to spark students' sense of curiosity, wonder, or intrigue.
Toward the end of a session, the learners share what they learned and reflect on the process (Mitra, 2014; "School in
the Cloud", 2016). Mitra (2014) stated, "In a SOLE, children seem to create and maximize meaning out of the information
content of what they are researching" (p. 556). Below is a typical timeline for a SOLE session:
First 5 Minutes: Questions

   Pose a "big question"
   The question will be framed as a genuine process of discovery in order to promote curiosity

      Explain the SOLE Process

30-45 Minutes: Investigation

   Students work in student formed groups to find answers to the big question online. During this time, students
      explore the big question collaboratively, while the instructor provides encouragement and facilitation.

   The instructor should encourage students to resolve any group issues themselves.
   Students are encouraged to collaborate within their group or move around to other groups.
   Few rules are given to the students, and this lack of rules enables children to change groups, talk to each other and

      other groups, and walk around to observe their peers' work.

10-20 Minutes: Review

   Invite the students to share their stories of collective discovery. Talk about similarities/differences between their
      answers, help to see links to other areas.

   Encourage debate. Facilitate discussion about the question and investigative process
   Engage the students in their own review: What would they do differently next time? What do they think others did

      well?

The developing of a "big question" is extremely important! The "big question" is described as, "ones that don't have an
easy answer. They are often open and difficult; they may even be unanswerable. The aim of them is to encourage deep
and long conversations, rather than finding easy answers" ("School in the Cloud", 2016). Keep in mind, as the instructor
you are trying to elicit critical thinking, collaborative work, and discovering theories throughout the children's learning
process and provide connections across content areas. School in the Cloud provides an excellent outline and examples
for you to get started.

   You may want to start with simple questions. These may include:

   Where is........?
   Who is.......?
   What is the largest animal in the world?
   What makes trees green?
   What makes the sky blue?

Some harder questions may be introduced as children get more comfortable answering simple questions, or if they're

                          This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 57
already proficient with search and language, you can start asking some tougher questions that don't have such a direct
answer.

   These should encourage children to explore a wider topic, connect a number of subjects, and develop a deeper
understanding of their answer. It's the difference between "What is the largest animal in the world?" and "Why are there
no animals bigger than a blue whale?" ("School in the Cloud", 2016)

   There are really no limits to what a Big Question can be, as long as it is thought-provoking and captures children's
attention. Below is a list of Big Questions organized by Learning Objective or Topic that will help you get started:
Digging deeper into science concepts

   What would happen to the Earth if all insects disappeared?
   Is life on earth sustainable?

Introducing new math concepts

   What are fractals?

Investigating and understanding historical facts

   Who built the pyramids and why?

Abstract thinking concepts

   Can trees think?
   Does a frog know it's a frog?
   Can you kill a goat by staring at it?
   Will robots be conscious one day?

Developing an understanding of key concepts in a contextual setting

   What is technology?

Remember, "the questioning provides opportunities for students to explore a variety of sources, extrapolate different
answers, and challenge one another. A key aspect of the big questions is that the purpose is not to discover the `right'
answer, but rather to develop methods and skills that are transferable and applicable" (Schwark, 2017).

          What types of digital media production activities could students do at particular grade levels?
       How can digital media technologies best be used to improve student learning?
       What are the steps to creating a digital media project?
       What is digital storytelling?
       What are the four points of fair use that help me meet guidelines?

Why Teach Creativity

Csikszentmihalyi (2006) noted "creativity is no longer a luxury for the few, but . . . a necessity for all" (p. xviii). The world
of education appears to agree, as a variety of 21st Century Learning Skills have included concepts such as "thinking and
problem-solving skills," "inventive thinking," "high productivity," "using digital technology and communication tools," and
"learning academic content through real-world examples" in their standards.

   In Tough Choices or Tough Times from the National Center on Education and the Economy, McWilliam (2008)
explained "the 21st century is a world in which comfort with ideas and abstractions is the passport to a good job, in
which creativity and innovation are the keys to the good life, in which high levels of education - a very different kind of
education than most of us have had - are going to be the only security there is" (p. 67). As teachers, how can we bring
this "very different kind of education" to our classrooms? Multimedia production in the classroom offers significant
opportunities for students' creative expression.

Copyright and Fair Use Guidelines

Digital Media Production

This week, each of you will produce an educational video! As you work on this project, think about using multimedia as
a teacher (instruction) and as a student (sharing knowledge).
Consider the following questions:

   How can multimedia technologies best be used to improve student learning?
   How can teachers and students make their own classroom digital video productions?
   What is digital storytelling?

Using Digital Media Technologies to Improve Student Learning

Combining multiple media - text, voice, data, still image, video -- in a single application of technology can help students
learn better since they are receiving information in more than one form. Research shows that students learn best in
situations that involve multimedia, simulations, modeling, and student-to-student interaction. Meaningful interaction is
the key. Consider the following examples:

Classroom A                                      Classroom B

A chemistry teacher shows a video of an          A biology teacher connects his class with marine biologists on the Journey North online project where they can ask expert
experiment and then has students conduct the     biologists questions, track migration patterns using data provided from around the globe, and collect their own local
experiment individually.                         evidence of spring migration. Student groups produce video documentaries of migration patterns.

An English teacher shows a DVD of poets reading  An English teacher has students select their favorite video of a poet reading his/her own work
poetry aloud and gives the students a test over  on http://poetryfoundation.org. They create a new video of the same poem with the student reading and selected creative
their knowledge of different poetry styles.      commons images to illustrate their interpretation of the poem.

At the end of the school year, a 1st grade teacher is A 1st grade teacher has students record each other reading aloud at the beginning, middle and end of year. Parents are sent
pleased with how well her students are reading. the edited videos showing their children's progress.
In which of these scenarios do you believe you would learn better, Classroom A or B? As a teacher, you would probably
enjoy Classroom B a great deal more as well! The key to successful student multimedia projects is allowing them to
share their creativity-don't give them too many rules or procedures. Give them creative freedom and let them surprise
you!

Digital Media Production in the Classroom

There are three distinct phases to the media production process:
 1. Pre-production & storyboarding: idea generation; research; location ideas (interior/exterior); script writing; create
      a shot list; gather crew, talent (family, friends, & roommates will love being in your video!), equipment, props
 1. Production - shoot everything on your shot list, record all audio needed
 1. Post-production - editing, creating graphics, finalizing

There are some excellent online tools to walk your students through each of these processes!

Tips & Tricks for Filming in the Classroom

(adapted from http://langwitches.org/blog/2010/09/01/a-few-tips-tricks-for-student-filming-in-the-classroom/)
   Hold the camera with two hands to keep it steady. Suggest that you videographer lean against a wall, desk or chair
   Wait a few seconds after pressing the "record" button to start talking
   Make sure the microphone is on the camera
   Stay close to the source of the sound
   Be conscious of the noise going on in the background
   Take short clips
   Avoid running the camera for several minutes at a time
   Try to have "logical" breaks between clips: a new question, new topic
   Take both close ups as well as "panorama" shots
   Move in and out to achieve close ups and far away shots
   Try not to use the zoom - it can make the footage fuzzy
   Don't film against a sunny window
   Know what is in your background
   Make sure there are no other groups of students shooting in your background
   Don't film a distracting background
   Don't include students who do not have media release permission
   Don't identify students by filming something with their first and last name on it

Digital Storytelling

Digital Storytelling is just what it sounds like: telling stories using digital tools, or combining the art of telling a story

with multimedia tools and sharing them in a digital space. The plus of bringing digital storytelling into the classroom is

that kids are naturally good at storytelling, and it is a practice that fits each content area: science, social studies, math,

language arts, physical education, music, etc.

Check out some of the great examples from the Educational Uses of Digital Storytelling website

Teaching and Assessing Creativity

Can creativity be taught? Absolutely! Above you've seen the characteristics associated with creativity, and I'm sure
you'll agree these are traits that can be encouraged and developed. This section of the chapter will introduce you to
activities to use in the classroom to grow creativity.
The Torrance test for creativity includes measuring four components of creativity: fluency, flexibility, originality, and
elaboration in thinking.

                          This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 69
Component    Explanation                                       Activities to Encourage this Component of Creativity
of
Creativity

Fluency      the ability to generate quantities of ideas       Name everything you can think of within a specific category (the goal is to generate the longest list)

Flexibility  the ability to create different categories of     Name all the things you can think of that have a certain characteristic (wheels, for example), or come up with a
             ideas, and to perceive an idea from different     list of ideas for the perfect bathtub (the goal is create different categories of ideas and perceptions from different
             points of view                                    points of view)

Originality  the ability to generate new, different, and       Come up with the most outrageous solution for a particular dilemma (the goal is to come up with the most
             unique ideas that others are not likely to        unique idea)
             generate

Elaboration  the ability to expand on an idea by embellishing  Take an existing idea and elaborate further (the goal is to embellish the most)
             it with details or the ability to create an
             intricate plan
The Gifted Child Today article "Creative Thinking in Schools: Finding the `Just Right' Challenge for Students" provides
the following suggestions for teachers trying to incorporate more creativity into their lesson plans:

   Diversity and large volumes of ideas and work increase the chance for creative outcomes, so encourage students
      to generate lots of work, and give them the appropriate tools they need to develop this work. Free students from
      busy work, lots of worksheets, DVD watching, etc. in order to get them working on projects and generating
      solutions.

   Teach the value of hard work and discipline in finding solutions, solutions that make sense and aren't simply
      nonsensical or impractical. The ability to decipher good ideas from bad ones is an essential part of the creative
      process, and a skill that also should be taught.

   Encourage risk taking, and discourage perfectionism. Establish an environment that shows students that
      sometimes ideas fail, but the effort wasn't wasted. Ensure that integrity is maintained during successes and
      failures.

   Provide strategies for managing group dynamics, such as discussing with groups the possible difficulties that
      could arise, and how to troubleshoot those situations. Give the students a signal to inform the teacher when they
      need advice or mediation.

   Set up a rubric for the final evaluation of projects and assignments. Guidelines, expectations, and goals should be a
      part of every project.

   Layer independent study with group study, and give older students the option of working with students in younger
      grades.

   Teachers should model creative thinking in how they make decisions, solve problems, and how they approach their
      instruction and guidance.

   Encourage divergent thinking by providing students with nonconventional tools and supplies. For example, instead
      of using traditional art supplies, bring in objects that seem bizarre or out-of-the ordinary, and let kids create with
      these items.

   Lessen the amount of extrinsic awards, such as stickers, special privileges, or an emphasis on the final grade.
      Creativity researchers have shown that extrinsic awards actually reduce creativity. Instead, encourage intrinsic
      satisfaction by providing all the guidelines, materials, time, and space students need to complete projects and
      assignments.

   Allow time for student feedback sessions, and encourage responsible and productive critiques from all students.
   Show exceptional work in libraries, hallways, even in community buildings and businesses.
   Teachers that expect great things from students will receive great things.

Project Based Learning

Project-based learning (PBL) is a comprehensive perspective focused on teaching by engaging students in
investigation. Within this framework, students pursue solutions to nontrivial problems by asking and refining
questions, debating ideas, making predictions, designing plans and/or experiments, collecting and analyzing data,
drawing conclusions, communicating their ideas and findings to others, asking new questions, and creating artifacts.
(Blumenfeld, et al., 1991)
PBL has students creating a product for an authentic audience to solve an authentic problem. This type of learning
environment integrates knowing and doing. Students learn knowledge and elements of the core curriculum and apply
what they know to solve authentic problems and produce results that matter. PBL students take advantage of digital
tools to produce high quality, collaborative products. PBL refocuses education on the student, not the curriculum-a
shift mandated by the global world, which rewards intangible assets such as drive, passion, creativity, empathy, and
resiliency. These are activated through experience. (Markham 2011)

                           This resource is available at no cost at https://open.library.okstate.edu/applicationsofeducationaltechnology/ | 71
The keys to project-based learning are students solving authentic problems and producing a product as a solution.
Note in Blumenfeld's description how many of the skills match those discussed above in the section on creativity and
innovation.
Give YouTube a quick search for videos from Edutopia, Common Craft and Alan November. There are several that offer
a great overview, and you might find some others that interest you as well. Some good searches to try would include
`an introduction to project-based learning', `project-based learning explained', and you're likely to really enjoy the Alan
November TED Talk `Who Owns the Learning'.

Crucial Components of a Project-Based Learning Experience

   Need to Know - The idea here is to go WAY beyond "because it's on the test." The entry event can be almost
      anything: a video, a lively discussion, a guest speaker, a field trip, or a piece of mock correspondence that sets up a
      scenario. In contrast, announcing a project by distributing a packet of papers or assigning whatever is at the end of
      the chapter in the textbook is likely to turn students off.

   Driving Question - A good driving question captures the heart of the project in clear, compelling language, which
      gives students a sense of purpose and challenge. The question should be provocative, open-ended, complex, and
      linked to the core of what you want students to learn. It could be abstract (Is all really fair in love and war?),
      concrete (How safe is the water we drink?), or focused on solving a problem (How can we create an eco-friendly
      house?).

   Student Voice and Choice - The more student voice and choice, the more meaningful to the students! Choice and
      voice may range from selecting a particular topic from the general topic to choosing from a menu of products, to
      students making all decisions from topic to resources, to final product.

   21st Century Skills - Collaboration, communication, critical thinking, use of technology, an important purpose

   Inquiry and Innovation - Students generate additional questions and hypotheses related to the driving question.
      The classroom culture should value openness to new ideas and new perspectives.

   Feedback and Revision - The teacher acts as facilitator and coach to give direct feedback and guide students in
      reflection, self-assessment, and peer assessment.

   Publicly Presented Project - Presenting to an authentic audience gives students pride.

Digital Citizenship

Digital Citizenship is commonly defined as the norms of appropriate, responsible technology use. A digital
citizen is one who knows what is right and wrong, exhibits intelligent technology behavior, and makes good choices
when using technology. Does that sound like you? Click on the infographic below - do you practice all of these nine
skills on a regular basis?
Mark Ribble expanded these basic concepts into nine elements organized into three categories:

School Environment and Student Behavior

       1. Digital Rights and Responsibilities: the privileges and freedoms extended to all digital technology users, and
       the behavioral expectations that come with them
       2. Digital Communication: the electronic exchange of information
       3. Digital Access: full electronic participation in society
       4. Digital Etiquette: the standards of conduct expected by other digital technology users
       5. Digital Security: the precautions that all technology users must take to guarantee their personal safety and
       the security of their network

Student Learning and Academic Performance

       6. Digital Literacy: the capability to use digital technology and knowing when and how to use it
       7. Digital Law: the legal rights and restrictions governing technology use

Student Life Outside the School Environment

       8. Digital Health and Wellness: the elements of physical and psychological well-being related to digital
       technology use
       9. Digital Commerce: the buying and selling of goods online
Many argue that these elements should just be subsumed into the general definition of "citizenship" due to the
pervasiveness of technology in today's society. Regardless of definitions, these concepts are firmly embedded in
learning standards from Common Core to the ISTE Educational Technology Standards for both students (ISTE-S) and
teachers (ISTE-T). What age is too early to begin talking with students about digital citizenship? Some K-12 schools are
introducing personal digital responsibility as early as 1st grade.
