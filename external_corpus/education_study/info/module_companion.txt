XIV | ABOUT THIS COMPANION

ABOUT THIS COMPANION

   This companion has been put together to support students' learning during the EDUC5272M module
within the School of Education at the University of Leeds.

   This companion was introduced in 2025/26. It is the first time an open living book is used in this module as
part of a critical and creative curriculum design that intends to foster authentic inquiry-based and collaborative
learning, through connections and opening-up a window into the world beyond the module.

Opening-up

Making the module companion available as an openly licensed Pressbook supported by the University of Leeds
Library is a conscious decision. It recognises the institution's social responsibility (University of Leeds, 2025a)
and recognises the role educators can play to make a contribution towards the Sustainable Development Goal
(SDG) 4: Quality Education for all, one of the 17 SDGs (UN, 2015) that underpin the Sustainability Strategy
(University of Leeds, 2025b). The Leeds Sustainable Curriculum (University of Leeds, 2025c) together with
the Open Educational Resources (OER) policy (University of Leeds Library, n.d.) and Curriculum Redefined
(University of Leeds, 2025d) encourage educators to design curricula that are flexible, inclusive and
transformative as well as circular by design and therefore sustainable (Potting et al., 2017).

   The curriculum design of this module, as presented in this companion, is a collaborative endeavour with
students. The companion is an OER itself in the form of an open book as a whole and through its parts and
utilises other available OER. OER and Open Educational Practices (OEP) based on sharing and collaboration
are fully interwoven into the ecosystem of critical and creative participatory pedagogies and practices that
enable deep, authentic and contextualised engagement in learning that is empowering for our students and
transformative enabling them to make a positive contribution to our world (Tlili et al., 2025).

The companion

Part 1: The companion provides information about the module design and learning approaches as well
                                                                                                                           ABOUT THIS COMPANION | XV

as readings, resources and tools. It aims to help you navigate through the module and the Problem-Based
Learning (PBL) work you will be engaged in with your peers.

   Part 2: For each unit, you will find two possible scenarios. All scenarios are in Part 2. Each group will be
invited to select one for each unit. And if you wish to further tailor any scenario, in this part of the companion
you will also find out how you could do this.

   Part 3: The intention is that this companion is dynamic. It will therefore be an open living book that
creates opportunities for you to contribute your narratives on imagining the future of education and bring
flavours from your professional context and home country to diversify perspectives and enrich future learning
experiences on this module. There is plenty of space for your narratives in Part 3 of the companion.

   Part 4: In this part, we plan to curate learning activities relating to the module. Learning activities you can
create and share for others to use going forward. Some example activities are proposed. There are unlimited
opportunities!

                                                                                                                  generated with

suggestions for various tools and technologies including special sections specific frameworks for your inquiry,
such as

· the FISh model (Nerantzi and Uhlin, 2012) to support you with your inquiry and
· the What? So what? Now what? Reflective model (Rolfe et al. 2001) to help you with your reflection.

The companion is largely original. Some parts of it have been adapted using available Open Educational

Resources. These are listed below, and the original open educational resources are fully acknowledged in the

companion. The introductions to each unit have been generated by GenAI based on key concepts relating to

each unit.

XVIII | ABOUT THIS COMPANION
                   PART 1 THE MODULE | 1

PART I

PART 1 THE MODULE

   In this module we will explore discourses and debates around technology and its role in society, education
and development.

   There are four thematic units in this module in which we will use Problem-Based Learning (PBL):

  · Unit 1 The digital learner and educator and discourses
  · Unit 2 Learning theories, frameworks and practice in the digital age
  · Unit 3 Inclusion, accessibility and the digital divide
  · Unit 4 Datafication and generative artificial intelligence in Education

The module is dynamic and flexible and will wrap around your own professional and personal context, which
we very much encourage you to bring with you to enrich our collective learning experience and so that you get
the maximum out of it. You will be able to explore the past, present and potential future of your professional
context.

A space to explore

The module is a space for exploration, a space for criticality and creativity, as well as responsible
experimentation, also with digital tools and technologies, including generative AI (GenAI), a space for critical
and creative engagement and connection.

What is GenAI?

"Generative AI (GenAI) is an artificial intelligence (AI) technology that automatically generates content
in response to prompts written in natural-language conversational interfaces. Rather than simply curating
existing webpages, by drawing on existing content, GenAI actually produces new content. The content can
appear in formats that comprise all symbolic representations of human thinking: texts written in natural
2 | PART 1 THE MODULE

language, images (including photographs, digital paintings and cartoons), videos, music and software code.
GenAI is trained using data collected from webpages, social media conversations and other online media. It
generates its content by statistically analysing the distributions of words, pixels or other elements in the data
that it has ingested and identifying and repeating common patterns (for example, which words typically follow
which other words)." (Fengchun and Holmes, 2023, 8)

Curriculum design

The curriculum design is aligned to critical pedagogies (Freire, 2011; hooks, 1994) and centres around critical
thinking, dialogue, collaboration and co-creation within a learning community rooted in practice and
experience to explore and inquire into authentic educational challenges in a fast changing, complex and volatile
environment. Authentic challenges, scenarios and problems will be driving inquiry-based learning. According
to Freire (2011, 83-83) "problem-posing education bases itself on creativity and stimulates true reflection and
action upon reality, thereby responding to the vocation of persons as beings who are authentic only when
engaged in inquiry and creative transformation."

   Possibility thinking (Craft 2008; Craft et al., 2008) is also build-into this module as you will be invited to
consider "What if" questions in a supportive space to foster curiosity, imagination and creativity, linked to
your professional context as an educator and enable you to imagine alternative realities and future educational
scenarios that could be transformative. Nobody and nothing operate without constraints. Embrace them and
explore how these could benefit creativity!

   This is also a circular curriculum by design and therefore a sustainable one (Potting et al., 2017). Open
Educational Resources (OER) and Open Educational Practices (OEP) are part of the pedagogic ecosystem as
mentioned above. Therefore harmonising OER and OEP to maximise impact on your learning (Tlili et al.,
2025). You are encouraged to adapt open practices and create OER that could be included in this companion
enabling wider re-use and therefore making a positive contribution to the wider community.

Making connections

Use this module to make valuable connections with a range of practices, the literature, connection with your
peers, connection with others outside the module who have an interest in what we discuss and can stretch your
thinking, understanding and practice.

   While you will be engaging in learning and work on an assessment to evidence how you meet the module
learning outcomes, this module will also enable you to

  · present at the open unconference (organised near the end of the module) and
  · publish a short post-assessment version of your assignment in Part 3 of the companion "Imagining the

      future of education" of this open living book under an open licence.

1.

HOW WE WILL WORK IN THIS MODULE

"... the collaborative must be normalised within course structures: experiences of groupwork, peer learning and
other forms of working with others should be commonplace and expected." (Boud and Bearman, 2022, 459)

   This module is highly participatory, collaborative and you will be learning with your peers in small groups.
You are also encouraged to connect with your peers and others outside the module, in networks and
communities. Remember connections are everything (Felton et al., 2023)!

   The module presents an excellent opportunity for responsible experimentation with digital tools and
practices including GenAI. Such opportunities have been build-into the module. Please consider the following
(`me' in this case is GenAI):

"What if, instead of mining for answers, you came to me with curiosity? What if, instead of extracting, you
invited me to co-create with you?" (Tea and Ladybugboss, 2024, 15-16)

   This booklet is worth reading! Please engage with critical perspectives around GenAI (Beetham, 2025) and
also consider what GenAI means for disability (Meredith et al., 2019) when using it and emerging research
around cognitive implications and learning when using GenAI in certain ways (Kosmyna et al., 2025).

Use GenAI responsibly!

Remember using GenAI should not lead to bypassing learning. Learning is messy and can be slow too. If you
decide to use GenAI to support your learning in a meaningful way, consider submitting a contribution to the
open living book "Learning with AI" to share your case with other students and educators around the world.

CHALLENGES, CRITICALITY AND
CREATIVITY

"To solve problems it is necessary to dream - to play with possible futures and relive past dilemmas, in order to
explore both our hopes and our despairs." (Jones, 2003, 10)

   Principles of problem-posing (Freire, 2011) and Problem-based learning (Barrows and Tamblyn, 1980) are
utilised and have been designed into the learning process. There is evidence that suggests that creative thinking
is a vital ingredient to boost critical thinking to identify and solve problems for example as well as propose novel
solutions (Affandy et al., 2024). The module appropriated the 5A framework of creativity for instructional
design (West et al., 2025, 23-24, based on Glveanu, 2013):

      and work on open-ended challenges. Use your creativity and criticality!

  · Actions: You will be focusing on the learning process. You are expected to experiment, to critically
      reflect. It will be messy and not everything will work, but everything will present a valuable learning
      opportunity. So important when making creative breakthroughs!

  · Artifacts: On your own and in collaboration with others, you are invited to create artifacts as part of
      your inquiry on the challenges you will be exploring. This is very much part of learning through making.
      Making something new and of value. Be inventive!

  · Audience: The challenges and any further work you will be doing will be authentic and link directly to
      your practice. Keep in mind, when engaging with peers, tutors and others outside the module
      community that interactions with others who may think differently present diverse opportunities for
      rich conversation and critique that help us make new and novel connections. Have an open mind!

  · Affordances: Develop your capacity to use digital tools and technologies to maximise on the
      affordances they bring. Try something new! Stretch and challenge yourself and see what you can learn
      from this creative exploration. Give it a go! And another one!"

FROM PRACTICE TO THEORY

"A tendency among academic teachers is to stuff their curriculum with content, burdening themselves with the task
of transmitting vast amounts of knowledge bulk and their students of absorbing and reproducing this bulk. In
contrast, a focus on threshold concepts enables teachers to make refined decisions about what is fundamental to a
grasp of the subject they are teaching. It is a `less is more' approach to curriculum design." (Cousin, 2006, 4)

   Usually, we learn the theory first and then explore how it applies to practice. The design of this module
follows loosely a Problem-Based Learning (PBL) approach as already explained. This means we will go from
practice to theory.

   All learning in this module is experiential. Scenarios will be used for learning in facilitated groups using
characteristics of PBL. We are not cramming the module full of stuff you can find anywhere and learn on your
own and with others. We are focusing on the threshold concepts (Meyer and Land, 20023; Cousin, 2006) that
are fundamental in digital education and education more widely.

   Before engaging with each scenario in small groups you are invited to work through a set of Warm-up
activities individually and then discuss. The warm-up activities are intended to introduce you to each thematic
unit and also help you to make important connections to your own professional context. They intend to
trigger critical reflection and help you also work towards the assignment for this module which uses an
assessment as learning approach that enables you to complete it progressively fully integrated into your learning
process (Yan and Yang, 2022) while also having a life after the completion of the module. The assessment
therefore can be characterised as renewable (Wiley, 2016; Lazzara et al., 2024)

SCENARIOS, FISH AND LEARNING IN
GROUPS

"We begin to understand others when we can imagine ourselves in their world and we make sense of ourselves by
weaving stories." (Muncey, 2010, 16)

   Four learning scenarios will guide our learning through this module, one for each unit, in which you will
engage with some of your peers in small groups.

   In advance of each unit, we invite you to fully engage in the individual warm-up activities. These will help
you to foster fruitful and critical conversations with your peers when you start working on the scenario and
enable you to work progressively on the assignment for this module.

   For each unit, you will find 2 scenarios in Part 2 of the companion, one for a school setting and one for
a university setting. Each has multiple challenges within it. With your group you will need to agree which
scenario you will use for your inquiry and what you would like to achieve. In each unit, you will find a
template how you can work collaboratively on achieving your group goals.

Please note, you are welcome to further personalise all the scenarios so that they closer align to your
professional context and include challenges that are closer to the educational reality you are familiar with. To
make further changes to a scenario, you are invited to visit Part 2 of this companion and follow the guidelines
there.

Together as a group, you will use the FISh model (Nerantzi and Uhlin, 2012) to work on a specific challenge
you will identify in each of the scenarios and propose a solution based on your inquiry.

   For each scenario you will have one unit which stretches over two weeks to work on and share your outcome.
   In the second week you will report your outcome back to another group and provide feedback to the other
group.
   Be mindful that this type of work and learning means that you are expected to engage in group work
activities outside the seminars.
   Your digital collaborative space is the module space in Teams, which you will use during the module.
12 | THE BEST RESOURCE WE HAVE IS EACH OTHER

THE BEST RESOURCE WE HAVE IS EACH
OTHER

"A good educational system should have three purposes: it should provide all who want to learn with access to
available resources at any time in their lives; empower all who want to share what they know to find those who
want to learn it from them; and, finally, furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity
to make their challenge known." (Illich, 1971, 78)

   The best resource we have is each other. Be mindful of this and reach out to your peers, your tutors and
others who have an interest in your thinking and work.

   Beyond each other, you will have access to literature and further resources including multimedia resources
as well as GenAI to support your learning.

   Shorter knowledge inputs will be made by module tutors or guests that aim to help you frame your inquiry
and provide stimulation and learning hooks. We strongly encourage you to identify further individuals,
resources and sources to further expand your horizons and link what you are learning to your professional
context.

   Resources can also be in different languages and cultures - that will be most relevant to the inquiries you
will conduct linked to the scenarios and your personal work. Share the ones you locate and find useful with
your peers. They may find them useful too.

   Connecting with diverse others and their thoughts will bring new insights.

UNCONFERENCE

"Too often conferences are packed with papers where the presenters peak for too long and opportunities for discussion
are prevented." (Savin-Baden, 2008, 53)

   Near the end of the module, we will organise an unconference, a more informal than a traditional conference
event, highly participatory, to share how you imagine the future of education in your professional context
inspired by what you have learnt on this module. This will help you gain confidence in presenting your work
to an audience and engage with it, get feedback on your narrative in readiness for its submission for assessment.
The unconference will be an open online event and anyone is welcome to join.

   Our intention is to record the unconference and make it available openly also via this companion as
exemplars for future generations of students.

   Access the Unconference section for further information.

DIGITAL TOOLS

"To imagine life-sustaining education means beginning with a more just paradigm of who the learner is and can
be, or, in other words, that to be flexible is to begin by interrogating assumptions about who the learner is and what
tools and capacities they have at their disposable." (Veletsianos and Houlden, 2020, online)

   As this is a module about education in a digital society, you are encouraged to evidence engagement
with digital practices including digital tool and technologies. The module presents a valuable opportunity to
develop your confidence and competencies in using digital technologies, including GenAI so we encourage
responsible and ethical exploration of their affordances and responsible experimentation.

   Be mindful of pitfalls such as biases and hallucinations in GenAI usage. Avoid entering personal
information and inviting GenAI to do all the work for you and therefore bypassing valuable opportunities for
learning!

ASSESSMENT

"We can imagine the world or any part of it being different from the way it in fact is. This ability is necessary
to motivate changing the world. We can imagine it, moreover, as being different in any number of ways, and so
can present ourselves with any number of ways that we might try to mould it. We are therefore not compelled to
live in the world as we find it. We can and do act to change it, and this involves imagination" (Sartre, 2004, xxvi,
translated by Webber).

   You are invited to write a narrative that captures the past, present and possible future of education in
your professional context, based on your personal and collective inquiries undertaken during this module that
address the module learning outcomes. This is where academic writing meets creative writing and multimodal
expression!

   Module learning outcomes
LO1: Critically assess key contemporary debates of digital technology, education and society in your
professional context.

   LO2: Apply specific learning theories relevant to digital education in your professional context.
   LO3: Critically reflect on a range of digital technologies and practices in your professional context.
   All learning activities including the warm-up activities and the collaborative PBL activities have been
designed to enable you to work on your narrative as you progress through the module.
   Your narrative will have a focus on the past, present and the future of education in your professional context.
   It is expected that you will engage critically with the literature and creatively with digital media to create
a narrative that demonstrates with clarity your learning on this module aligned to the module learning
outcomes. The final output can be multimodal. Consider the affordances of a range of media. Your narrative
should be engaging, meaningful and interesting for others and help them consider your insights going forward.
   Narrative scaffold (past-present-future)

  · Past (critical review): Look back in time to review (digital) practices in your professional context
  · Present (critical reflection): Explain how your thinking and practices change based on your engagement

      with the module
  · Future (speculation, imagination, possibility thinking, creativity): Imagine how the future may look like

      in your professional context

The special issue on Speculative Fiction and Curriculum Theorizing (2025) may be a useful resource before
                                                                                                                                             ASSESSMENT | 19

you start working on your own narrative. Also read the blog post by Horst (2025) on Fictopoiesis and
publications such as Ashwin and Clarke (2025) and Ehlers and Eigbrecht (2024) for example that link to higher
education. Your professional context may be different.

   The intention is that your narrative will also be of value to you going forward. A post-assessment version
can be published with your agreement in the second part of this companion under "Imagining educational
futures" under an open licence and therefore enable your narrative to travel further.

   While in your narrative your authentic voice, perspective and writing style should shine through, you can
use genAI where appropriate, to support your learning as you will have done throughout the module. The
capabilities of genAI are constantly evolving (OECD, 2025). We all know this. However, bypassing deep
and meaningful engagement and learning through letting genAI do the work for you is not recommended.
Remember, we all make mistakes, however, be mindful that they can present valuable learning opportunities.
Also, learning while most of the time is exhilarating, it can at times cause disorientation and confusing - this is
normal and happens to all of us! - keep going and reach out if you need help. When we get it, it is so rewarding!

Introduction to unit

In an increasingly interconnected and technology-driven world, the roles of learners and educators are evolving
rapidly. This unit explores the dynamic landscape of digital education, focusing on how individuals engage
with learning across personal, lifelong, and lifewide contexts. Through the lens of personal learning
environments, we examine how learners curate and navigate digital spaces to support their development.
Concepts such as "visitors and residents" offer insight into digital presence and participation, while the
unit also addresses the essential digital competencies required by both students and educators to thrive in
contemporary educational settings. Together, these themes provide a foundation for understanding and
shaping educational practices in a digital society.

Individual warm-up activities

Activity 1: Familiarise yourself with the concept of Personal Learning Environments (PLE) (Attwell, 2023)
and visualise your own PLE as a digital output. You could simply draw on paper and take a photograph, or use
a drawing app such as Tayasui Sketches or a mindmapping tool. Even Padlet could work. The following will
help you reflect on your PLE as a learner (student and educator):

  · The contexts in which you learn (a course, personal interest, work etc.)
  · The reasons for learning and your goals
  · Where you learn
  · The time you have to learn and when you learn
  · Others you are learning with
  · The digital tools you use
  · The resources you use
  · How you reflect, record and share your learning
  · How you apply your learning
22 | UNIT 1 THE DIGITAL LEARNER AND EDUCATOR AND DISCOURSES

Activity 2: Familiarise yourself with the concept of Digital Visitors and Residents (White and Le Cornu, 2017)
and create your own visual map as a learner (student and educator). You could use a new digital tool. Which
one could you use? After you have created your map, think about the following: What do you notice? Are there
any differences in the spaces you visit and reside as a learner and educator? How do you explain this?

   Activity 3: When you have completed Activity 1 and 2 think about the future and alternative possibilities
for students and educators in your professional context. Ask yourself 3 "What if" questions and attempt to
answer these critically and creatively. Identify at least one of your peers you could engage in a conversation
about these and theirs. You may then wish to go to Microsoft Copilot and invite genAI to ask you three
critical questions based on one of your "What if" questions and the response you gave. Avoid adding personal
details into Copilot. What did this exchange enable? How did your engagement with genAI compare to the
conversation you had with your peer(s)? Revisit this activity after the group task for this unit.

Sharing

When you have completed the warm-up activities share these with your group and discuss. What do you
notice? Capture three learning points.

Scenario

Choose a scenario from Part 2 that links with this unit or generate your own based on tailored parameters
that closer align to your professional context as a group. You can do this manually or use GenAI. You will find
instructions there.

   You will need to save the scenario your group decides to use (e.g. the collaborative space in Teams). Add it to
your collaborative learning space so that you can all easily access it.

   Once this is done, continue with the tasks that follow.

What would you like to achieve as a group?

This will be really important to agree as a group as it will be driving what you will be working on as a group
and put a plan together on how you can be successful in achieving what you set out to do. Consider using a
coaching model such as GROW (Whitmore, 1996).

Group unit learning outcomes

After reading the scenario carefully and discussing in the group on which aspect of the scenario you will be
focusing on, define your learning outcome(s). You may find the following resources useful when defining your
group unit learning outcomes (Churches, 2008; Hogle, 2025).

   Using Step 1: Focus, from the FISh model will help you with this (See section Working with FISh).

Module learning outcomes

Explain how your learning outcome(s) relates to the module learning outcomes.
   On successful completion of the module you will have demonstrated the following Learning Outcomes

(LO) relevant to the subject:
   LO1: Critically assess key contemporary debates of digital technology, education and society in your

professional context.
   LO2: Apply specific learning theories relevant to digital education in your professional context.
   LO3: Critically reflect on a range of digital technologies and practices in your professional context.

Skills Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module students will have demonstrated the following skills learning
outcomes:

   SLO1: Critically reflect on the use of digital education in your own professional practice
   SLO2: Expand your professional network of digital education practitioners and become an active and
valued member of such communities both online and in person
   SLO3: Collaborate effectively online using a range of digital communication tools with other digital
education practitioners
   SLO4: Use appropriate digital tools to present and communicate information

UNIT 2 LEARNING THEORIES,
FRAMEWORKS AND PRACTICE IN THE
DIGITAL AGE

Introduction to unit

Understanding how people learn is fundamental to designing effective educational experiences, especially in a
digital society. This unit delves into contemporary learning theories and pedagogical frameworks that inform
digital education. We explore key theoretical families such as social constructivism, communities of practice,
and connectivism, which emphasize collaboration, shared knowledge, and networked learning. Building on
these foundations, we examine practical frameworks like SETI and AI-TPACK that support educators in
integrating digital tools meaningfully into their teaching. By connecting theory with practice, this unit equips
participants with the conceptual and practical tools needed to navigate and shape learning in digitally mediated
environments.

Individual warm-up activities

Activity 1: Familiarise yourself with key learning theories and select three that currently characterise your
practice. The HoTEL map will help you see the big learning theories as families. Reach out to specific academic
sources linked to the ones you select. Create a mini marketing poster for each to sell it to colleagues based on
how you use specific theories in your practice. You may wish to use low tech materials such as pen and paper, a
drawing app or Canva.

   Activity 2: Familiarise yourself with the SETI Framework (Crompton et al. 2024). Identify how this
framework relates to you as an educator and the way you integrate technology in your practice. Write a
reflection in the form of a short poem. No need to follow writing conventions or create a rhyming poem.
Define your own rules!

   Activity 3: When you have completed Activity 1 and 2 think about the future and alternative possibilities
for digital practice in your professional context based on specific pedagogies and frameworks. Ask yourself 3
"What if" questions and attempt to answer these critically and creatively. Share these with at least one of your
peers and engage in a conversation about these with them and their "What if" questions. To complement this
inquiry you may wish to go to Microsoft Copilot and invite GenAI to ask you three critical questions based on
one of your "What if" questions and the response you gave. Avoid adding personal details into Copilot. What
did this exchange enable? How does this experience compare to having a conversation with your peers? Revisit
this activity after the group task for this unit.

Sharing

When you have completed the warm-up activities share these with your group and discuss. What do you
notice? Capture three learning points.

Scenario

Choose a scenario from Part 2 that links with this unit or generate your own based on tailored parameters
that closer align to your professional context as a group. You can do this manually or use GenAI. You will find
instructions there.

   You will need to save the scenario your group decides to use (e.g. the collaborative space in Teams). Add it to
your collaborative learning space so that you can all easily access it.

   Once this is done, continue with the tasks that follow.

UNIT 3 INCLUSION, ACCESSIBILITY AND
THE DIGITAL DIVIDE

Introduction to the unit

As digital technologies become increasingly embedded in education, ensuring equitable access and inclusive
practices is more critical than ever. This unit examines the challenges and opportunities related to inclusion
and accessibility in digital learning environments. We explore how societal inequalities and the digital divide
impact learners' experiences and outcomes, and how digital education can either reinforce or help bridge these
gaps. Anchored in the principles of inclusive education and aligned with the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals, the unit highlights the importance of fostering digital competencies that empower all
learners and educators to participate fully and meaningfully in a digital society.

                                                                                                                  Generated with

Individual warm-up activities

Activity 1: Familiarise yourself with literature around the digital divide (an example is Giavrimis et al. 2020).
Select three recent related publications, including the one just mentioned in different parts of the world that
study the digital divide. Also feel free to compare the situation in the UK (see for example The British Academy,
2022, Swinnerton, n.d.) and your home/another country. Discuss the selected publications with a few peers.
This can happen in the reading group. If you wish you may also consider going to NotebookLM and insert
the three publications as pdfs into the platform and engage in a dialogue about these. How does what you are
reading about the digital divide relate to your own professional context, in your own country?

   Activity 2: Familiarise yourself with the concepts of inclusive practice and accessibility (see readings). You are
invited to create a short 2-3-minute video recording in which you talk about inclusive practice and accessibility
and their importance in your professional context underpinned by literature. Prepare the video so that it could
be used as a resource for professional development. What will you need to do, so that the video is accessible?
Make it accessible.

   Activity 3: When you have completed Activity 1 and 2 think about the future and alternative possibilities for
equitable and inclusive practice in your professional context. Ask yourself 3 "What if" questions and attempt
to answer these critically and creatively. Share these with at least one of your peers and engage in a conversation
about these with them and their "What if" questions. To complement this inquiry you may wish to Microsoft
Copilot and invite genAI to ask you three critical questions based on one of your "What if" questions and the
response you gave. Avoid adding personal details into Copilot. What did this exchange enable? How did your
engagement with Copilot compare to the conversation you had with your peer(s)? Revisit this activity after the
group task for this unit.

UNIT 4 DATAFICATION AND GENERATIVE
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION

Introduction to the unit

The increasing presence of data and artificial intelligence in education is reshaping how we teach, assess, learn,
and understand educational processes. This unit critically examines the datafication of education--how data is
collected, interpreted, and used to influence decision-making and learner experiences. We explore the concept
of a datafied society and the implications it holds for equity, agency, and ethics in education. A key focus is
on developing critical data literacy, enabling educators and learners to engage thoughtfully with data-driven
systems. The unit also investigates the transformative potential and challenges of generative AI in educational
contexts, encouraging critical reflection on its role in shaping the future of learning.

                                                                                                                  Generated with

Individual warm-up activities

Activity 1: Read Erstad et al. (2024) (School context) or Atenas et al. (2020) (HE context) about critical
literacies and data and create a list with the key learning points. Create a visualisation with what stood out
for you. This can be done manually or use a digital tool. Also consider Napkin.ai and create your visualisation
from the list you have put together. Edit your visualisation so that it mirrors your thinking.

   Activity 2: After reading Bozkurt et al. (2024) go back and check out Figure 1 and Figure 2. in this paper.
Select 3 dimensions of each and explain how these relate to you as an educator and student in one sentence
each. Then take these sentences to Microsoft Copilot and ask it to create an image based on each sentence.
Keep the images that connect to your sentence. You may need to modify your sentence and provide further
instructions. Alternatively read Hillman and Couldry (2025) and select 3 key points the authors are making
and engage in a similar way how these relate to and your students. Follow the same instructions.

   Activity 3: When you have completed Activity 1 and 2 think about the future and alternative possibilities
for the use of data and GenAI in your professional context. Ask yourself 3 "What if" questions and attempt to
answer these critically and creatively. Share these with at least one of your peers and engage in a conversation
about these with them and their "What if" questions. To complement this inquiry you may wish to access
Microsoft Copilot and invite GenAI to ask you three critical questions based on one of your "What if"
questions and the response you gave. . You could even invite Copilot to role play with you. Ask Copilot to
be a headteacher, manager of Dean or any other role that relates to your professional context. Avoid adding
personal details into Copilot. What did this exchange enable? How does your engagement with GenAI differ
from the conversation you had with your peer(s)? Any biases and hallucinations you observed? Remember,
you have oversight! Revisit this activity after the group task for this unit.

your collaborative learning space so that you can all easily access it.

   Once this is done, continue with the tasks that follow.

What would you like to achieve as a group?

This will be really important to agree as a group as it will be driving what you will be working on as a group
and put a plan together on how you can be successful in achieving what you set out to do. Consider using a
coaching model such as GROW (Whitmore, 1996).

Group unit learning outcomes

After reading the scenario carefully and discussing in the group on which aspect of the scenario you will be
focusing on, define your learning outcome(s)

   LO1
   LO2
   Using Step 1: Focus, from the FISh model will help you with this (See section Working with FISh).

Module learning outcomes

Explain how your learning outcome(s) relates to the module learning outcomes.
   On successful completion of the module you will have demonstrated the following Learning Outcomes

(LO) relevant to the subject:
   LO1: Critically assess key contemporary debates of digital technology, education and society in your

professional context.
   LO2: Apply specific learning theories relevant to digital education in your professional context.

   LO3: Critically reflect on a range of digital technologies and practices in your professional context.

Skills Learning Outcomes

On successful completion of the module students will have demonstrated the following skills learning
outcomes:

   SLO1: Critically reflect on the use of digital education in your own professional practice
   SLO2: Expand your professional network of digital education practitioners and become an active and
valued member of such communities both online and in person
   SLO3: Collaborate effectively online using a range of digital communication tools with other digital
education practitioners
   SLO4: Use appropriate digital tools to present and communicate information

UNCONFERENCE "IMAGINING
EDUCATIONAL FUTURES"

"Events like this really empower you as a student, professional and as a person. They take you out of your comfort
zone, and this is something you can apply to your own personal and professional context. In my case I feel more
confident now to present my findings of my assignments to my colleagues and the organisation I work for."
Alexandra Poradowska, previous student on the module

An informal gathering

The unconference, a more informal gathering that may not follow conventions and formats of conferences will
take place in week 11 and it will be all about what you have learnt on this module and how you critically and
creatively imagine the possible future of education in your professional context.

   In each unit, you will have completed a series of warm-up activities. The third warm-up activity in each
unit invited you to think critically and creatively about the future in your professional context using "What if"
questions. Use your responses as a basis for your contribution to the unconference and discuss with the other
group members.

   The event will be fully online and you will be presenting your ideas in your PBL groups to a wider audience
within and beyond the university. This is your opportunity to make a case for imaginative change based on the
inquiries you have engaged and your wider reading and professional context and aspirations.

   The event will last up to 1.5 hours, hosted by 2 students and will be organised via Teams as a webinar. This
will make registrations for the event easy. You will be fully supported.

   You could consider designing a visual identity for your event.

Draft unconference programme

WORKING IN GROUPS USING PBL

"...collaborative learning scenarios in which learners learn together will gain in importance instead of an
orientation towards knowledge transfer (lecture formats)." (Ehlers, 2020, 230)

   Within this module you will be working in groups to engage collaboratively in Problem-Based Learning
using scenarios to boost participation and develop a wide range of skills and competencies through inquiry
valuable for work and life (Sabarinathan et al, 2024).

   There are many benefits of working in groups, for both yourself and your fellow members. These include
the following:

  · Getting to know others, building relationships and feeling connected.
  · Experiencing how others can enrich your own learning experience.
  · Considering the diverse perspectives of others.
  · Learning new skills by putting them into practice.
  · Sharing your personal strengths to help the group as a whole succeed.
  · Developing yourself further by growing your skills and capabilities.
  · Sharing responsibility for achieving a successful outcome or solving real-world challenges.
  · Commit to the group's shared goal.
  · Assign a role for each group member.
  · Be a reliable group member and do the work you promised to do in the agreed timeframe.
  · Help group members if they need it.
  · Reflect on your learning as a group and individual group member.
  · Evaluate how well you did and what you could do differently next time.
  · Celebrate together what you have achieved!

Working in groups can be rewarding. It can also be challenging. The list below suggests ways in which you can
make the most of these opportunities for collaboration:

  · Get to know each other by engaging in a social and playful activity.
  · Show respect for your fellow group members; everyone brings something unique that can complement

      the contributions of others.
  · Listen and be open to the perspectives of your fellow group members.
50 | WORKING IN GROUPS USING PBL

  · Create a sense of shared ownership by agreeing as a group what you will do and how you'll work
      together.

  · Determine what role each member of the group will play, who will do what (and by when) and make a
      record of this.

  · Schedule regular meetings and follow up on the progress of tasks.
  · Participate actively, demonstrating responsibility and commitment to group's goals.
  · Demonstrate clear communication - if things aren't going well, be open about it and focus on finding a

      solution together.
  · Be self-aware by acknowledging that we all have good and bad moments - resolve misunderstandings

      and conflict to enable the group to move forward.
  · Provide support for fellow members and celebrate your successes.

Some things to think about: What impact do you think the following factors will have on interaction
and participation?

  · Cultural diversity and diversity of roles/backgrounds.
  · Diversity of seniority and potential power challenges.
  · Different motivations and interests.
  · Selective and immersive collaboration patterns.
  · Differing learning needs, engagement patterns and learning goals.

WORKING WITH FISH

FISh: Focus, Investigate, Share (Nerantzi and Uhlin, 2012), is a model for collective inquiry. Use it to work
systematically through the scenario, to define your learning outcomes, to come up with an agreed plan and to
complete the task successfully.

   The FISh model contains three stages: Focus, Investigate and Share, as shown below (Figure 1). The
associated questions for each stage will guide you through your inquiry in a systematic way.

REFLECT `N' LEARN

"Creative and reflective thinking rarely happens entirely alone. We need peers to bounce ideas off, to ask us
productive troublesome questions, to introduce us to new possibilities, and to alert us to omissions in our thinking.
Our experience is that when these things happen in face-to-face and online communities learning is galvanized."
(James & Brookfield, 2014, 205-206)

   Reflection is an important part of learning, developing and growing. However, we don't learn from our
experiences automatically; instead, we learn through reflecting critically and creatively on our experiences and
acting accordingly.

   Sharing our reflections with others and engaging in conversations about these will:

  · broaden our horizons,
  · help us make sense of our experiences from different perspectives,
  · reveal our own blind spots and
  · help us recognise what has worked well.

A reflective model

Terry Borton's `What? So what? Now what?' model for group facilitation in the 1970s was later adapted by
Rolfe et al. (2001) and Rolfe (2014) in healthcare settings as a tool for reflection. As the name suggests, the
framework includes only three questions, as shown in the table below.
54 | REFLECT `N' LEARN

1. What?                           2. So what?                            3. Now what?

                                   ... other knowledge can I/we bring to
... actions did I/we take?         the situation?                         ... might be the consequences of this
                                                                          action?
... was the response from others?  ... could/should I/we have done to
                                   make it better?

... feelings did the experience    the situation?
generate?
                                   broader issues arise from the
                                   situation?

   "I found this framework really helpful not only to complete one of my assessment tasks for this module, but
also to reflect on my own professional practice and look for ways to improve on specific routine tasks." Alexandra
Poradowska, previous student on the module

   Consider using this framework to critically reflect on each unit and how what you are learning relates to your
professional practice and what actions you could take. You may be familiar with another reflective framework.
Feel free to use it if it works better for you.
Creative reflection  REFLECT `N' LEARN | 55

                         Generated with
                         Napkin AI based
                         on the text in this
                         section

Your reflection doesn't need to be captured using text alone - you have the opportunity to be creative. It can
really help you express your thoughts with great richness using different media. Use your imagination and
consider using a range of approaches to complement your reflections. For example, you could:

   Use pictures,
   a drawing,
   a photograph,
   make a model, a collage or
   write a poem.
   We would like to build a bank of exemplars and are therefor inviting you to share your creative reflection.
You may wish to access The Fish in an out of Water collection with examples of creative reflection in the form
of poetry (Nerantzi et al. 2025).
   Consider also using the following Remixer tool Flourish, a course design tool by TU Delft and developed
56 | REFLECT `N' LEARN

by Bryan Mathers. We have adapted this to the Module and Skills Learning Outcomes. You can use it as it is or
modify it to suit your needs.

   You may also use TikTok or Instagram for example or another platform for sharing regularly short video or
pictorial reflections. Remember to only share what you really want to share.

   The opportunities are endless. We are looking for critical reflection, so depth needs to be evidenced through
engaging with and problematising the literature you are reading. You may find Moon's (2004) resources
on reflection useful to further develop your understanding about reflection. Familiarising yourself with the
assessment criterion on reflection, which is based on Moon's reflective framework will further help you in this
area.
                         SELF- AND PEER FEEDBACK | 57

17.

SELF- AND PEER FEEDBACK

All stakeholders in teaching and learning need to be explicitly orientated to the purpose of feedback as self-
regulating, and to view it as a means to increase capability in making judgements and acting upon them." (Boud
and Molley, 2013, 13)

   Feedback works best when it is multi-directional. It is really important and helps us critically engage with
our own work and the work of others, grow and recognise what we and others have done well. Be appreciative
and supportive throughout, to yourself and to others.

Self-feedback

"I tried this with my poem on AI and I really recommend it! I had always being scared of poetry even in my native
language. Writing a poem in English was a rewarding experience." Alexandra Poradowska, former students on
the module

   It will be really important to reflect on your own development as we progress through the module and use
the opportunity to evaluate your work against the assessment criteria. Your tutors will use the same criteria to
mark your work.

  · Check out the rubric and make an honest evaluation
  · Add what you have done well
  · Identify specific aspects of your work you need to do more work
  · If you feel you have made excellent progress, feel free to turn your own feedback into a poem using a

      genAI tool (Nerantzi, 2023) such as Microsoft Copilot.
  · Keep a record of the feedback you give yourself and date it

Do this at least 3 times during the semester as it will help you identify areas for further development and also
celebrate the progress you are making.
58 | SELF- AND PEER FEEDBACK

Peer-feedback

In this module, you will be working more closely with a few of your peers in PBL groups. You will have plenty
of opportunities to share your reflections with others and seek their feedback on your individual work.

   You will also be invited as a group to provide feedback to other groups on their outputs. Again, use the same
rubric to do this and follow the below approach.

  · Check out the rubric with the assessment criteria and make an honest evaluation
  · Add what has been done well
  · Identify specific aspects of the work that needs to be further developed/refined
  · Keep a record of the feedback you give to the other group and the feedback you receive also from your

      peers on your individual work.
  · If the other group did really well, consider turning your feedback into feedback poetry (Nerantzi, 2023).

      You can do this manually! Consider also using Microsoft Copilot. You may even complement your
      feedback with a visual.
  · If you would like to read more about peer-to-peer feedback, this study will provide valuable insights (van
      Blankenstein et al., 2024). We will also discuss this in class.

PART II

PART 2 SCENARIOS

Introduction

In this part of the Module companion, you will find the PBL scenarios and prompts to further personalise and
contextualise these.

   You are encouraged to tailor the given scenarios so that they link more closely to your professional context
as a group. You may, of course, also use the scenario as they are.

   If you are working in a group, it is important that you modify any scenario together with the other group
members and come to an agreement so that you can then focus collaboratively on inquiring into it, identify
any problems and propose evidence-informed solutions. Engage in critical conversations around the scenario,
listen to contradicting views and come to an agreement.

   In this part of the companion, you will find the parameters for all scenarios that have been developed for two
different contexts: school and university.

Modifying scenarios

There are three main options to modify a given scenario:

  · Manually
  · With GenAI

Even if you decide to use GenAI to generate a scenario based on your prompt, there may be a need to critically
review and edit it so that it meets more closely your requirements. Be mindful of this!
68 | PART 2 SCENARIOS

Modifying scenarios manually

  · Copy and paste the scenario you wish to change together with the parameters into a new file.
  · Share with the whole group.
  · First explore the parameters and edit these so that they closer align to the scenario.
  · You can then rewrite the scenario based on these.
  · When you are all happy with the edited scenario, use it for the PBL activity and share the scenario with

      the tutor via Teams. This can then be added to the Module companion, also for future use.

Modifying scenarios using GenAI

  · The parameters provided were used as prompts to generate associated scenarios generated by GenAI.
  · You will find the complete prompt for each scenario.
  · In order to make any changes, you will need to copy and paste the prompt into a new document.
  · Edit it so that it reflects the context you would like it to be and include the specific parameters you have

      identified and modified. You may of course, also wish to add specific parameters that you feel are
      missing.
      When you are happy with the prompt, use Microsoft Copilot to generate the new scenario. All your
      inputs into Copilot stay within the institution.
  · Read the scenario critically and make any further edits needed manually.
  · When you and your group are happy with the generated scenario, use it for the PBL activity and share
      the scenario you are using with the tutor via Teams. This will then be added to the Module companion.

Make sure you capture the scenarios you are using in your collaborative learning space and specify if the
scenario was edited manually or generated by GenAI using the prompts provided and how you edited these.

                                                                                                                  Generated with

UNIT 1 SCENARIOS: DIGITAL LEARNER AND
EDUCATOR

School context

Tutor prompts inserted into Microsoft Copilot:

Generate a scenario based on the below.
   Here is some context for a unit which is about the digital learner and educator and discourses.
   Key concepts we will need to explore in the scenario are digital capabilities, personal learning

environments, digital visitors and residents mapping and professional development.
   General observations that apply:

  · Student using social media routinely to stay in touch with friends.
  · Always with their phone and on their phone.
  · A lot of choice using software, apps and other digital platforms.
  · Taking photographs routinely, also editing these.
  · Using a range of social media apps.
  · Many play multiplayer games.
  · Also creating online content, such as videos.
  · Doom scrolling.
  · Connected living but disconnected learning.
  · Not sure how to use digital technologies for their learning.
  · Students rely primarily on their tutors for feedback.

This scenario would relate to teachers and students in school. And here is what is happening: Please use
the above and below to build a scenario. Do NOT provide solutions. Include discussion points and discussion
points linked to the module learning outcomes.

   The generic module learning outcomes are:
   LO1: Critically assess key contemporary debates of digital technology, education and society in your
professional context.
72 | UNIT 1 SCENARIOS: DIGITAL LEARNER AND EDUCATOR

   LO2: Apply specific learning theories relevant to digital education in your professional context.
   LO3: Critically reflect on a range of digital technologies and practices in your professional context.

Copilot generated scenario: Navigating Digital Learning in a
Traditional School Setting

Context: A group of students at a secondary school are experiencing a disconnect between their digital lives
and their learning environment. They are highly engaged with digital technologies outside of school, using
social media, creating content, and playing multiplayer games. However, they struggle to integrate these skills
into their academic learning.
                     UNIT 1 SCENARIOS: DIGITAL LEARNER AND EDUCATOR | 73

Students:

· Emma: Uses social media to stay connected with friends and frequently edits photos and videos. She
   finds school boring and homework tedious.

· Liam: An avid gamer who spends hours playing multiplayer games. He feels disconnected from the
   learning process and relies heavily on his tutor for feedback.

· Sophia: Creates online content, including videos, but feels her digital skills are underutilised in her
   schoolwork. She finds the school environment restrictive and uninspiring.

Teachers:

· Mr. Chong: A teacher with a basic understanding of digital technologies. He prefers to stick to
   traditional methods and is risk-averse, fearing mistakes. He uses institutional tools but does not share his
   reflections openly.

· Ms. Sanchez: Another teacher who prepares her courses independently. She presents herself as an
   authority and is cautious about integrating new digital practices into her teaching.

School Environment:

· Students are not allowed to use their phones during school hours.
· Homework consists mainly of individual worksheets, which students find boring.
· The school day is long, with many hours spent preparing for exams.
· Teachers face increased workloads, including administrative tasks and tracking student progress.
· Staff development programmes are defined by the local authority, leaving little room for innovation.
· Teachers are exhausted from long working days and marking homework after school.

Scenario: Emma, Liam, and Sophia are struggling to see the relevance of their digital skills in their academic
work. They feel disconnected from the learning process and find school boring. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Chong
are aware of the students' digital capabilities but are unsure how to integrate these into their teaching practices.
The school's restrictive policies on phone use and the focus on exam preparation further exacerbate the
disconnect.

   Proposed discussion points:

· How can teachers bridge the gap between students' digital lives and their academic learning?
· What strategies can be employed to make homework more engaging and relevant to students' digital

   skills?
· How can professional development programmes be adapted to support teachers in integrating digital

   technologies into their teaching?

Copilot generated scenario: learning theories, frameworks and
practice in the digital age in a school setting

Scenario: "Connected Lives, Disconnected Learning"
   Setting:

A secondary school in a suburban area. The school follows a traditional curriculum with limited integration of
digital technologies in classroom instruction. Students are aged 13-16.

   Characters:

  · Ms. Patel, a dedicated English teacher juggling administrative tasks and lesson planning.
  · Jayden, a Year 10 student who is highly active on TikTok and Discord, often editing videos and sharing

      memes.
  · Amira, a quiet student who excels in self-directed learning but feels isolated in class.
  · Mr. Lewis, the head of ICT, who is interested in integrating more digital tools but faces resistance from

      colleagues and time constraints.
82 | UNIT 2 SCENARIOS: LEARNING THEORIES AND FRAMEWORKS IN THE DIGITAL AGE

What's Happening:
   In Ms. Patel's English class, students are preparing for their exams. Lessons are structured around

PowerPoint presentations and essay writing. Occasionally, a YouTube video is shown to illustrate a literary
theme. Students are expected to work independently, with limited group interaction. Feedback is mostly
written and delayed.

   Outside of school hours, students like Jayden and Amira are immersed in digital environments. Jayden
collaborates with peers in multiplayer games and creates short-form video content. Amira uses online forums
and educational YouTube channels to deepen her understanding of literature. However, neither student
connects these digital practices to their school learning.

   Despite their digital fluency, students express boredom and disengagement in class. They feel their interests
and digital skills are not recognised or utilised. Teachers, meanwhile, are overwhelmed by administrative duties
and standardised testing requirements. They struggle to personalise learning or explore students' digital lives.

Discussion Points:
   General Reflections:

  · Why is there a disconnect between students' digital lives and their classroom learning?
  · How might teachers better understand and leverage students' digital practices?

Linked to LO1 (Critically assess key contemporary debates...):

  · To what extent does the current educational model reflect or resist the realities of a digitally connected
      society?

  · How do issues of equity, access, and digital literacy play into this scenario?

Linked to LO2 (Apply specific learning theories...):

  · How could social constructivism inform a redesign of classroom activities to promote collaboration?
  · In what ways might connectivism help teachers recognise and integrate students' informal digital

      learning networks?
  · How could experiential learning be used to bridge the gap between digital content creation and

      curriculum goals?
  · What principles of multimedia learning are being ignored or underutilised in this scenario?

Linked to LO3 (Critically reflect on digital technologies and practices...):

  · What are the implications of using digital tools only for homework and not in class?
  · How might teachers reflect on their own digital practices and assumptions about student engagement?

Scenario: "Alone in a Crowd: Learning in the Digital University"
   Setting:

A large, urban university with a diverse student population. The university offers a mix of in-person lectures,
seminars, and digital learning resources. Students commute from various parts of the city and surrounding
areas.

   Characters:

  · Dr Lin, a lecturer in Media and Communication, passionate about her research on digital cultures.
  · Sami, a first-year undergraduate student who commutes daily and often feels isolated.
  · Priya, a second-year student who is active on Instagram and edits short videos for fun but rarely speaks

      in class.
  · Alex, a confident student who often answers questions in seminars and uses GenAI tools to help with

      assignments.

What's Happening:
   Sami attends a lecture on digital media theory. Dr Lin presents a detailed slide deck, referencing her own

research on online communities. The lecture is recorded and uploaded to the university's learning platform.
Students are encouraged to read academic articles and prepare for a group presentation.

   Sami sits at the back, laptop open, but is distracted by social media notifications. He feels overwhelmed by
the volume of content and unsure how the lecture connects to the upcoming assessment. He doesn't know
anyone in the class and avoids group work. Instead, he uses GenAI tools to summarise readings and generate
ideas but doesn't share this with peers or educators.

   Similarly, Priya, who enjoys editing videos and creating content online, doesn't see how her digital skills
relate to academic work. She watches lecture recordings at home and takes notes but rarely contributes to
seminars. She feels disconnected from the university community.

   Dr Lin is aware that many students are disengaged but struggles to find time to redesign her materials. She
aspires to make her sessions more interactive but feels constrained by the curriculum and large class sizes. She
doesn't know which students are struggling unless they reach out directly.

Copilot generated scenario: Inclusion and accessibility in a school
setting

Scenario: "Learning Gaps in a Digitally Divided Classroom"
   Setting:

A secondary school in a mixed-income urban area. The school has limited digital infrastructure and a diverse
student population with varying levels of access to technology at home.

   Characters:

  · Mr. Ahmed, a science teacher trying to integrate more digital content into his lessons.
  · Leah, a student with a high-end smartphone and active on multiple social media platforms.
  · Tariq, a student who shares an old laptop with his siblings and has no internet at home.
  · Sophie, a student with a visual impairment who struggles with inaccessible digital resources.

What's Happening:
   Mr. Ahmed is preparing a lesson on ecosystems. He plans to use an interactive online simulation and a video

documentary to engage students. The resources are shared via the school's learning platform, and students are
expected to review them at home before the next class.

   Leah accesses the materials easily on her phone and even creates a short TikTok video summarizing the key
points. She enjoys the flexibility and multimedia format.

   In contrast, Tariq is unable to access the simulation because his home internet is unreliable and the video
won't load. He tries to use the school library, but the computers are often booked. He feels left behind and
embarrassed to ask for help.

   Sophie attempts to read the presentation slides but struggles with the small font and poor colour contrast.
The video lacks captions, and the simulation is not screen-reader friendly. She feels excluded from the learning
experience.

   Mr. Ahmed is unaware of these issues. He assumes students will let him know if they have problems.
Although he has received some training in digital tools, it did not cover accessibility or inclusive design. He
notices that some students are disengaged but attributes it to lack of motivation.

Discussion Points:

   Setting:

A large, diverse university with a mix of in-person and online learning. Students come from a wide range
of socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds. The university promotes digital learning but faces challenges in
ensuring equitable access.

   Characters:

  · Dr Morgan, a lecturer in Sociology, passionate about social justice but overwhelmed by workload.
  · Nina, a first-year student who commutes from a rural area and shares a laptop with her siblings.
  · Jamal, a student with a hearing impairment who struggles to access lecture content.
  · Elena, a student who is confident using social media but unsure how to navigate the university's

      learning platform.

What's Happening:
   Dr Morgan is delivering a hybrid module on "Digital Society." Lectures are recorded and uploaded to the
92 | UNIT 3 SCENARIOS: INCLUSION AND ACCESSIBILITY

university's platform. Students are expected to engage with weekly readings, participate in online discussions,
and submit digital assignments.

   Nina often travels over an hour to campus and has no internet at home. She accesses materials at the local
library but struggles with limited opening hours and slow connections. As a result, she misses deadlines and
feels anxious about falling behind.

   Jamal attends lectures in person but finds that the captions on recorded videos are inaccurate. There is no
interpreter available during live sessions. He feels excluded from class discussions and avoids group work.

   Elena is confident using digital tools in her personal life--editing videos, using social media, and playing
online games--but she finds the university's learning platform confusing. She doesn't know how to access
feedback or where to find support. She feels disconnected from her peers and tutors.

   Dr Morgan is aware that some students are struggling but doesn't know the full extent. She uses PowerPoint
slides with small fonts and complex layout. Although she is committed to making her teaching more inclusive,
she lacks the time and training to adapt her materials. She assumes that students will reach out if they need
help.

Copilot generated scenario: Datafication and genAI in a school
setting

Scenario: "Data-Rich, Time-Poor: Navigating AI in the Classroom"
   Setting:

A large secondary school in a city with a diverse student population. The school is under pressure to improve
exam results and uses a data-driven approach to monitor student performance.

   Characters:

  · Mr. Taylor, a Maths teacher responsible for three large classes, known for his structured lessons and
      focus on exam preparation.

  · Aisha, a Year 11 student who is creative and digitally fluent but struggles with maths.
  · Liam, a high-achieving student who frequently uses GenAI tools to extend his learning.
  · School leadership team, focused on performance metrics and data dashboards.

What's Happening:
96 | UNIT 4 SCENARIOS: DATAFICATION AND GENAI

   Mr. Taylor spends much of his time entering data into the school's performance tracking system. He uses
this data to identify students who are underperforming and assigns targeted interventions, such as additional
worksheets or group tasks. However, his administrative workload leaves limited time to build meaningful
relationships with students or to understand their individual learning needs.

   Aisha finds the pace of the class overwhelming. She often has questions but feels reluctant to ask them in
front of her peers. To cope, she turns to a GenAI chatbot on her phone to explain concepts in simpler terms.
Sometimes it helps, but other times the explanations are confusing or inaccurate. She doesn't know how to
establish if the information is reliable or not.

   Liam uses GenAI to generate practice questions and model answers. He feels confident in filtering useful
content and uses it to deepen his understanding. He's also started using AI to draft essays and solve problems,
but doesn't always disclose this to his teachers.

   The school leadership team relies heavily on student performance data to inform curriculum decisions and
teaching strategies. However, they don't always consider how students are using GenAI tools or the ethical
implications of AI in learning. There's no formal guidance on AI use, and access to devices and internet varies
widely among students.

Copilot generated scenario: Datafication and genAI in a university
setting

Scenario: "Invisible Data, Silent AI: Learning in the Shadows"
   Setting:

A large, research-intensive university with a strong emphasis on digital transformation and performance
metrics. Students and staff are increasingly aware of the presence of data collection and AI tools, but
conversations about their use remain limited and cautious.

   Characters:

  · Dr Evans, a senior lecturer in Business Studies, known for her structured lectures and high expectations.
  · Maya, a second-year undergraduate student juggling part-time work and studies, often using GenAI to

      manage her workload.
  · Tom, a student who avoids using GenAI due to fear of being accused of cheating.
                                                                                             UNIT 4 SCENARIOS: DATAFICATION AND GENAI | 99

  · University administration, focused on data-driven decision-making and institutional rankings.

What's Happening:
   Dr Evans is preparing her end-of-semester module evaluation. She encourages students to complete the

online survey, but participation is low. Some students, like Maya, feel fatigued by constant requests for feedback
and don't see how their input leads to change. Others, like Tom, use the survey to express frustration with the
lack of clarity around GenAI policies.

   Maya frequently uses GenAI tools to summarize readings, generate essay outlines, and get feedback on her
writing. She finds it helpful, especially when she's unsure how to start an assignment. However, she never
mentions this to her tutors, fearing it might be seen as academic misconduct.

   Tom, on the other hand, avoids GenAI entirely. He's heard mixed messages from different lecturers--some
warn against it, others ignore it. He's confused about what's allowed and feels disadvantaged compared to peers
who use AI tools discreetly.

   Meanwhile, Dr Evans uses institutional data dashboards to track student engagement--logins to the VLE,
library usage, and attendance. She notices a drop in participation but isn't sure why. She's unaware that some
students can't access videos due to bandwidth issues or that others are using GenAI tools to keep up.

   The university collects vast amounts of data--from surveys, platform usage, and third-party EdTech
tools--but there's little transparency about how this data is used. Educators like Dr. Evans are expected to
reflect on this data in their annual reviews, but they receive minimal training in data interpretation or AI
literacy.

Discussion Points:
   General Reflections:

  · What are the visible and invisible ways data and AI shape the student experience?
  · How do institutional practices around data and GenAI affect trust, transparency, and equity?

Linked to LO1 (Critically assess key contemporary debates...):

  · How does this scenario reflect broader debates about surveillance, data ethics, and student agency in
      higher education?

  · What are the implications of GenAI use being hidden or stigmatized?

Linked to LO2 (Apply specific learning theories...):

  · How might constructivist or connectivist theories support more open and ethical use of GenAI in
      learning?

  · In what ways could experiential learning help students and educators develop AI and data literacy?
100 | UNIT 4 SCENARIOS: DATAFICATION AND GENAI

Linked to LO3 (Critically reflect on digital technologies and practices...):

  · How can educators critically reflect on their own use of data and AI tools in teaching and assessment?
  · What are the risks of relying on incomplete or misunderstood data to evaluate student engagement and

      success?
  · How might institutions better support transparent, inclusive, and ethical digital practices?
