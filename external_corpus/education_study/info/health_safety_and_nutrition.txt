Licensing of Source Content

Wherever possible, source content with licenses that are compatible (either public domain or
CC-BY) with license of this overall text (CC-BY) were used. But there is limited content, mostly
images, that may have more restrictive licensing. To allow readers to effectively source content
and determine licensing, footnotes were used liberally throughout this book. If you choose to
use this content to remix or create a derivative, please check the licensing carefully.

Language Choices Throughout This Book

Language has power and word choice matters. Please see the following about some of the
language choices made for this book.

Terminology

As source content for this book was compiled from hundreds of sources, terminology doesn't
always match up, even after efforts were made to provide consistency across the text.
You may notice there are several ways programs that provide care and education for young
children are referred to in this book. In general, these all refer to programs in which children
are cared for in groups by non-family members and are used interchangeably.

     Early care and education programs
     Early childhood education programs
     Child care centers or child care programs
     Out-of-home care
     And at times, just programs or centers

The adults that care for children in these programs may be referred to as:
     Early childhood educators or professionals
     Teachers
     Caregivers
     Staff (although this term is often used when including other employees that may work in
         an early childhood education program outside of the classroom).

Gendered Language

At times you may notice that a child or adult is referred to with the pronoun they or them. This
is to be more gender inclusive. Unless specifically stated, when children or adults are gendered,
it is not to be exclusionary (and likely is due to the language used in the source content).

6|Health, Safety, and Nutrition in Early Childhood Education
Family Structures and Forms

Throughout this book, the word families has been used in place of parents in most places. This
is to be as inclusive as possible of the different family structures in which the adults responsible
for caring for children may not fit the label of parents. When the source content used the word
parents (referring specifically to the adults that are responsible for a child), efforts were made
to also use the words caregivers or guardians to be inclusive of all families.

Person First Language

Because people are not the situations they encounter (such as poverty) or may experience
(such as disabilities or medical conditions), person-first language is used. This is not intended to
discount characteristics that may be part of a person's identity but in an attempt to be
respectful.

Special Features Throughout the Book

     Explain why health and well-being in early childhood is so important.
     Describe qualities and benefits of high-quality early care and education programs.
     Outline what the book will be addressing in regards to safety, health, and nutrition.
     Discuss what licensing is and its role in keeping children safe and healthy.
     Compare and contrast Title 22 and Title 5 licensing requirements.

Introduction

Evidence shows that experiences in childhood are extremely important for a child's healthy
development and lifelong learning. How a child develops during this time affects future
cognitive, social, emotional, language, and physical development, which in turn influences
school readiness and later success in life. Research on a number of adult health and medical
conditions points to pre-disease pathways that have their beginnings in early and middle
childhood.

During early childhood, the human brain grows to 90 percent of its adult size by age 3. Early
childhood represents the period when young children reach developmental milestones that
include:

     Emotional regulation and attachment
     Language development
     Cognitive development
     Physical development (motor skills)

All of these milestones can be significantly delayed when young children experience inadequate
caregiving, environmental stressors, and other negative risk factors. These stressors and factors
can affect the brain and may seriously compromise a child's physical, social-emotional, and
cognitive growth and development.

More than any other developmental periods, childhood sets the stage for:
     School success
     Health literacy
     Self-discipline
     The ability to make good decisions about risky situations
     Eating habits
     Conflict negotiation and healthy relationships with family and friends3

Understanding Childhood Health Concerns

Although young children are typically healthy, it is during this time that they are at risk for
conditions such as:

     Developmental and behavioral disorders
     Child maltreatment
     Asthma and other chronic conditions
     Obesity
     Dental caries (cavities)
     Unintentional injuries

While typically nonfatal, these conditions affect children, their education, their relationships
with others, and the health and well-being of the adolescents and adults they will become.5

Emerging Issues in Childhood Health

The keys to understanding childhood health are recognizing the important roles these periods
play in adult health and well-being and focusing on conditions and illnesses that can seriously
limit children's abilities to learn, grow, play, and become healthy adults.

Prevention efforts in early and middle childhood can have lasting benefits. Emerging issues in
early and middle childhood include implementing and evaluating multidisciplinary public health
interventions that address social determinants of health by:

     Fostering knowledgeable and nurturing families, parents, and caregivers
     Creating supportive and safe environments in home, schools, and communities
     Increasing access to high-quality health care6

Early Childhood Development and Education

Early childhood, particularly the first 5 years of life, impacts long-term social, cognitive,
emotional, and physical development. Healthy development in early childhood helps prepare
children for the educational experiences of kindergarten and beyond. Early childhood
development and education opportunities are affected by various environmental and social
factors, including:

     Early life stress
     Socioeconomic status
     Relationships with parents and caregivers
     Access to early education programs

Early life stress and adverse events can have a lasting impact on the mental and physical health
of children. Specifically, early life stress can contribute to developmental delays and poor health
outcomes in the future. Stressors such as physical abuse, family instability, unsafe
neighborhoods, and poverty can cause children to have inadequate coping skills, difficulty
regulating emotions, and reduced social functioning compared to other children their age.

Additionally, exposure to environmental hazards, such as lead in the home, can negatively
affect a child's health and cause cognitive developmental delays. Research shows that lead
exposure disproportionately affects children from minority and low-income households and
can adversely affect their readiness for school.

The socioeconomic status of young children's families and communities also significantly affects
their educational outcomes. Specifically, poverty has been shown to negatively influence the

academic achievement of young children. Research shows that, in their later years, children
from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to need special education, repeat grades, and
drop out of high school. Children from communities with higher socioeconomic status and more
resources experience safer and more supportive environments and better early education
programs.

                   The Effects of Poverty on Education

                       "Despite being one of the most developed countries in the world, the
                       United States has one of the highest rates of childhood poverty
                       globally."7 "Poverty has a particularly adverse effect on the academic
                       outcomes of children, especially during early childhood."8 Research has
                       shown that children from families in poverty enter school with a
                       readiness gap. Contributions to this gap include:

                            Poor physical development and health (due to poor nutrition
                                and lack of access to medical care)

                            Challenges with concentration, memory, attentiveness,
                                curiosity, and motivation9 due to the chronic stress of living in
                                poverty

                            Greater risk for behavioral and emotional problems
                            Exposure to environmental hazards (such as lead paint) and

                                violence in their communities.

                       Two additional things that are important to note:
                            This gap disproportionately affects Black and Latinx children.
                            Families experiencing poverty have challenges finding
                                affordable, high-quality early care and education programs and
                                are often in districts with under-resourced schools. 10

Early childhood programs are a critical outlet for fostering the mental and physical
development of young children. According to the Center on the Development Child at Harvard
University's A Science-Based Framework for Early Childhood Policy,

    " The principal elements that have consistently produced positive impacts include:
     highly skilled teachers;
     small class sizes and high adult-to-child ratios;
     age-appropriate curricula and stimulating materials in a safe physical setting;

     a language-rich environment;
     warm, responsive interactions between staff and children; and
     high and consistent levels of child participation."11

The National Association for the Education for Young Children says that high quality programs:
     Create caring communities of learners in which children develop relationships with each
         and the teachers and each child and family are included.
     Teach to support children's development and learning by being intentional with the
         environmental design, materials, and activities and by providing positive guidance for
         children's behavior.
     Have developmentally appropriate curriculum that helps children learn and grow that
         sets challenging, yet achievable goals for children, balances adult instruction and group
         activities with play and child-chosen experiences, provides enough time for deep
         engagement, and is based on the children's interests, abilities, and knowledge.
     Regularly assesses children's development and learning to inform their environmental
         design, curriculum, and interactions with children and their families.
     Is founded on partnerships with families in which families are respected and valued,
         share their goals and concerns, are encouraged to participate, and with clear
         communication (in a family's home language whenever possible).12

And you can check out the checklist 15 Must-Haves for All Child Care Programs published by
The Administration for Children and Families Office of Child Care in Appendix A.

Early childhood development and education programs can also help reduce educational
gaps. For example, Head Start is a federally funded early childhood program that provides
comprehensive services for children from low-income families. Head Start aims to improve
health outcomes, increase learning and social skills, and close the gap in readiness to learn for
children from low-income families and at-risk children. Enrolling children in full-day
kindergarten after the completion of preschool has also been shown to improve academic
achievement.

Furthermore, extended early childhood programs for children up to 3rd grade, also referred to
as booster programs, can provide comprehensive educational, health, and social services to
complement standard early childhood and kindergarten programs. These programs help sustain
and bolster early developmental and academic gains. Characteristic of such programs include:

     Low student-teacher ratio
     Teacher training
     Creation of school-family partnerships
     School meals

          see how a compilation of services leads to children's well-being regardless of the age of the child.13

Quality education in elementary school is necessary to reinforce early childhood interventions
and prevent their positive effects from fading over time. Research also shows that school
quality has an impact on both the short- and long-term educational attainment of children, as
well as on their health. For example, children who enroll in low-quality schools with limited
health resources, safety concerns, and low teacher support are more likely to have poorer
physical and mental health.
The developmental and educational opportunities that children have access to in their early
years have a lasting impact on their health as adults. The Carolina Abecedarian Project found
that the children in the study who participated in a high-quality and comprehensive early
childhood education program, including health care and nutritional components, were in better

health than those who did not. The study found that, at age 21, the people who participated in
the comprehensive early education program exhibited fewer risky health behaviors--for
example, they were less likely to binge drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, and use illegal
drugs. This group also self-reported better health and had a lower number of deaths.

Furthermore, by their mid-30s the children who participated in the comprehensive early
childhood development and education program had a lower risk for heart disease and
associated risk factors, including obesity, high blood pressure, elevated blood sugar, and high
cholesterol. These studies show that quality early childhood development and education
programs can play a key role in reducing risky health behaviors and preventing or delaying the
onset of chronic disease in adulthood. We will look at what high quality programming looks like
at the end of the chapter.

Early childhood development and education are key determinants of future health and well-
being. Addressing the disparities in access to early childhood development and education
opportunities can greatly bolster young children's future health outcomes.

Additional research is needed to increase the evidence base for what can successfully impact
the effects of childhood development and education on health outcomes and disparities. This
additional evidence will facilitate public health efforts to address early childhood development
and education as social determinants of health.14

Importance of Considering Holistic Development

Early childhood education (ECE) is not a singular concept, but rather a holistic concept that
focuses on several aspects of a child's development, including their cognitive, social, emotional,
moral, spiritual, and physical well-being (American Academy of Pediatrics 2012; Chisholm 2004;
Tinajero & Loizillon 2012). According to Shonkoff, et al. (2011), debates about early childhood
education often focus on education and the enhancement of children's cognitive skills and later
academic progress. However, these authors stress the importance of viewing children in a
holistic manner as part of a bigger system. In this manner, early childhood education becomes a
vehicle for enhancing the physical, cognitive, mental, social and economic well-being of
individuals and the societies in which they live. Early care and education programs should
enhance multiple interrelated dimensions of a child's life; including health and safety, nutrition,
emotional well-being, and social competence.15

Focus on Wellness

Rather than waiting for health issues to arise, families and early childhood education programs
should focus on supporting children's wellness. "Wellness describes the entirety of one's
physical, emotional, and social health; this includes all aspects of functioning in the world

(physiological, intellectual, social, and spiritual), as well as subjective feelings of well-being. A
child who is doing well frequently experiences joy, delight, and wonder, is secure and safe in
his/her family and community, and is continually expanding and deepening his/her engagement
with the world around him/her."16

                       Figure 1.4 - Well children can engage in their environment and with others.17

Wellness is an active process. It requires awareness and directed, thoughtful attention to the
choices we make. Early care and education programs can play a critical role in helping children,
families and staff commit to and implement healthy lifestyle choices that promote both
physical and mental well-being. The two, in fact, are closely linked. Our feelings, thoughts, and
behaviors directly impact our physical health. Similarly, our physical health status has a direct
impact on our feelings, thoughts, and behaviors.18

We must also support children's mental well-being and help them navigate everyday stress and
adversity as well as trauma and significant sources of stress. The American Psychological
Association shares that "[b]uilding resilience -- the ability to adapt well to adversity, trauma,
tragedy, threats or even significant sources of stress -- can help our children manage stress and
feelings of anxiety and uncertainty."19

It is important that children are in an environment that keeps them physically and emotionally
safe and healthy and provides sound nutrition. As an early educator, providing these requires
attention, planning, and intention.

Introduction to Safety, Health, and Nutrition

This book is divided into three sections. These include:
     Safety
     Health
     Nutrition

Safety

Children are curious and eager to learn. They depend on their caregivers to keep them safe by
making sure that nothing within a child's reach can harm them. Injuries are a serious health risk
to young children. But most injuries are predictable and preventable.20

                         Figure 1.5 - This playground protects children from falls and from the sun.
                          But it fails to protect children by being enclosed with a fence and gate.21

ECE programs can prevent risks and unnecessary harm to children by committing to a culture of
safety. A culture of safety prioritizes safety at all levels. It encourages programs to learn from
past problems and prevent them in the future.22 Programs should not assume that nothing will
ever go wrong. In fact, they should plan that something is going to go wrong. And their goal is
to make it as hard as possible for things to go wrong.23

Chapters 2 through 5 will focus on ways programs can protect children's safety.
     Chapter 2 discusses active supervision and creating a culture of safety
     Chapter 3 covers creating safe indoor environments
     Chapter 4 examines creating safe outdoor environments

     Chapter 5 addresses caring for minor injuries and managing emergencies
     Chapter 6 discusses child maltreatment (abuse and neglect)

Health

"Health is more than merely the absence of disease--it is an evolving human resource that
helps children and adults adapt to the challenges of everyday life, resist infections, cope with
adversity, feel a sense of personal well-being, and interact with their surroundings in ways that
promote successful development."24

             Figure 1.6 - These children are learning about handwashing to prevent the spread of illness.25

As mentioned at the beginning of the chapter, research is showing that many adult health
issues, such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes, are linked to what happens
during early childhood (and even prenatally!). We also know that during early childhood there
are biological systems that are more sensitive to environmental factors (such as child
maltreatment, malnutrition, and recurring issues to infectious disease).26
It is vital for children and their families to have support for children's physical, oral, and mental
health. This happens through promoting health and protection from illness.
Chapters 7 through 11 focus on children's health.

     Chapter 7 examines promoting health
     Chapter 8 looks at preventing illness

Nutrition

Healthy eating and being active are essential to a child's well-being. Children who are under- or
over-nourished are at risk for chronic health problems.27 Early childhood is an important time
for developing healthy habits for life. Children's bodies grow and develop in ways that affect
the way they think, eat, and behave.28
A healthy diet not only affects growth, but also immunity, intellectual capabilities, and
emotional well-being. Families and educators must ensure that children receive an adequate
amount of needed nutrients to provide a strong foundation for the rest of their lives.29

Introduction to Licensing for Child Care Centers in
California

Licensing for child care programs in the state of California is overseen by the Community Care
Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services, whose primary mission is to
ensure the health and safety of all children enrolled in licensed child care facilities in California.

Licensing oversees the operation of licensed child care facilities in child care centers and family
child care homes. By definition, both types of child care facilities provide nonmedical, age-
appropriate care and supervision of infant to school-age children for less than 24 consecutive
hours at a time.

         Child care centers provide care in a large-group setting, usually operate in an
         institutional or commercial building, and must meet a number of requirements
         regarding their physical facilities, and the services they provide. For the most part, when
         this book refers to licensing requirements, it will be referencing licensing for child care
         centers.

         Family child care homes provide care in small-group settings in the licensee's private
         house or apartment. They include two types of facilities: small family child care homes
         that care for no more than 8 children at any one time, and large family child care homes
         that care for no more than 14 children at any one time.

The key to licensing's effort to protect the health and safety of children in child care is a
thorough and fair licensing and inspection program that ensures all facilities are in
compliance. Community Care Licensing is mandated by law to ensure that licensed facilities
meet established health and safety standards and that the licensee has access to all relevant
information about the department.

Once a facility meets all the requirements to merit a license, licensing's principal way of helping
facilities maintain compliance is through periodic unannounced site visits by licensing program
analysts (LPAs). In addition to conducting these inspections, our LPAs work with licensees to
address any needed changes, and conduct follow-up visits to confirm that problems have been
eliminated. It is also the role of the LPA to investigate any complaints about a facility and
consult with licensees to ensure they are aware of their rights and responsibilities.

Licensing also provides ready access to the child care advocate program. The advocates serve as
a link between licensing and the community of licensees, provide information about licensed
child care to families and the public, act as a liaison with businesses, child care organizations,
and resource and referral agencies, and coordinate complaints and concerns on behalf of

21 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
children in care. As a result, licensing is both an enforcement agency and a resource on health
and safety requirements.31

The complete licensing regulations, often referred to as Title 22, can be found on the
Community Care Licensing Division of the California Department of Social Services Child Care
Regulations Online California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Division 12 only webpage (see
Resources for Further Exploration). Highlights of the regulations can be found in Appendix B.

Licensing Requirements for Early Childhood Programs that are
State-Subsidized

There are more stringent requirements for programs whose families get tuition assistance from
the state of California, commonly referred to as Title 5. The most notable difference in Title 5
regulations is stricter adult-to-child ratios and staff qualifications. See Table 1.1 for a
comparison of ratios.32

Table 1.1 - Title 22 and Title 5 Adult to Child Ratio Comparison33,34,35

 Age Group            Title 22                 Title 5
   Infants    1 adult to 4 children   1 adult to 3 children
              1 adult to 12 children  1 adult to 8 children
Preschoolers  1 adult to 14 children  1 adult to 14 children
School-Aged

Accreditation from the National Association for the Education

of Young Children

While not legal regulations, there are even further requirements in place for programs that
choose to pursue voluntary accreditation by the National Association for the Education of
Young Children. One of the differences you will notice between licensing and accreditation is
some levels of staff qualifications. See Table 1.2 for a comparison of staff qualifications.

While licensing regulations ensure that children stay safe and healthy, high quality care goes
even further to provide the best start for young children. One reason that programs choose to
become NAEYC accredited is to document the quality of care and education they provide
children and families they serve. There are other processes and assessments that programs
may use to ensure high quality, as well.

                Pause to Reflect

                   As you progress through this book and course, what connections can you
                   make about how being knowledgeable about health, safety, and nutrition will
                   support early childhood educators in both following licensing and other
                   applicable regulations and ensuring they provide high quality care for young
                   children and their families?

Summary

Early childhood is a critical time in development. Many outcomes, both positive and negative,
have their beginnings in these years. It is vital that children's health and safety be protected.
High-quality early care and education programs can play a valuable role in improving outcomes
for children.

Introduction

Keeping children safe must be a top priority for all early care and education programs. Active
Supervision is the most effective strategy for creating a safe environment and preventing
injuries in young children. It transforms supervision from a passive approach to an active skill.
Staff use this strategy to make sure that children of all ages explore their environments safely.
Each program can keep children safe by teaching all staff how to look, listen, and engage.

What is Active Supervision?

Active supervision requires focused attention and intentional observation of children at all
times. Staff position themselves so that they can observe all of the children: watching, counting,

28 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
and listening at all times. During transitions, staff account for all children with name-to-face
recognition by visually identifying each child. They also use their knowledge of each child's
development and abilities to anticipate what they will do, then get involved and redirect them
when necessary. This constant vigilance helps children learn safely.

Strategies to Put Active Supervision in Place

The following strategies allow children to explore their environments safely. Infants, toddlers,
and preschoolers must be directly supervised at all times. This includes daily routines such as
sleeping, eating, and diapering or bathroom use. Programs that use active supervision take
advantage of all available learning opportunities and never leave children unattended.

Set Up the Environment

Staff set up the environment so that they can supervise children and be accessible at all times.
When activities are grouped together and furniture is at waist height or shorter, adults are
always able to see and hear the children. Small spaces are kept clutter-free and big spaces are
set up so that children have clear play spaces that staff can observe.

                                    Figure 2.1 - Open shelving can make supervision easier.1

Position Staff

Staff carefully plan where they will position themselves in the environment to prevent children
from harm. They place themselves so that they can see and hear all of the children in their
care. They make sure there are always clear paths to where children are playing, sleeping, and
eating so they can react quickly when necessary. Staff stay close to children who may need
additional support. Their location helps them provide support, if necessary.

Scan and Count

Staff are always able to account for the children in their care. They continuously scan the entire
environment to know where everyone is and what they are doing. They count the children
frequently. This is especially important during transitions when children are moving from one
location to another.

Listen

Specific sounds or the absence of them may signify reason for concern. Staff who are listening
closely to children immediately identify signs of potential danger. Programs that think
systematically implement additional strategies to safeguard children. For example, bells added
to doors help alert staff when a child leaves or enters the room.

Anticipate Children's Behavior

Staff use what they know about each child's individual interests and skills to predict what
he/she will do. They create challenges that children are ready for and support them in
succeeding. But, they also recognize when children might wander, get upset, or take a
dangerous risk. Information from the daily health check (e.g., illness, allergies, lack of sleep or
food, etc.) informs staff's observations and helps them anticipate children's behavior. Staff who
know what to expect are better able to protect children from harm.

Engage and Redirect

Staff use what they know about each child's individual needs and development to offer
support. Staff wait until children are unable to problem-solve on their own to get involved.
They may offer different levels of assistance or redirection depending on each individual child's
needs. 2

                   What Does Active Supervision Look Like?

                       To understand what active supervision might look like in your program,
                       consider the following example:

                       Maria and Yasmin have taken their three-year-old classroom out to the
                       playground for outdoor playtime. The 15-foot square playground has a
                       plastic climber, a water/sand table and a swing set. Maria and Yasmin

                       stand at opposite corners of the playground to be able to move quickly to a
                       child who might need assistance. The children scatter through the
                       playground to various areas. Some prefer the climber, while others like the
                       swings. Many of the children play with the sand table because it is
                       new. Maria and Yasmin have agreed on a supervision plan for which
                       children they will observe and are always counting the children in the areas
                       closest to them, occasionally raising their fingers to show each other how
                       many children are close to them. This helps them keep track of where the
                       children are, and to make sure no one is missing. If one child moves to a
                       different area of the playground, they signal each other so that they are
                       both aware of the child's change in location.

                       Maria has noticed that Felicity loves to play in the sand table. She hears
                       children scolding each other and notices that Felicity throws the toys
                       without looking. As Maria sees Felicity and Ahmed playing at the sand
                       table, Maria stands behind Felicity and suggests she put the toy back in the
                       basket when she is done with it. By remaining close, she is also able to
                       redirect Ahmed who has never seen a sand table before and throws sand at
                       his classmates. Kellan has been experimenting with some of the climbing
                       equipment and is trying to jump off of the third step onto the ground. While
                       he is able to do this, some of the other children whose motor skills are not
                       as advanced also try to do this. To help them build these skills, Yasmin
                       stands close to the steps on the climbing structure. She offers a hand or
                       suggests a lower step to those who are not developmentally ready.

                       Maria and Yasmin signal to each other five minutes before playtime is over,
                       then tell the children they have 5 minutes left to play. When the children
                       have one minute left, Maria begins to hand out colors that match the
                       colored squares they have painted on the ground. She asks Beto, a child who
                       has trouble coming inside from playtime, to help her. When the children are
                       handed a colored circle, they move to stand on the colored spot on the
                       playground. As the children move to the line, Maria guides them to the right
                       spot. When all children are in line, both Maria and Yasmin count the
                       children again. They scan the playground to make sure everyone is in place,
                       then move the children back into the classroom. They also listen to be sure
                       that they do not hear any of the children still on the playground. Yasmin
                       heads the line and Maria takes the back end, holding Beto's hand. When
                       they return to the classroom, there are spots on the floor with the same
                       colors that were on the playground. The children move to stand on their
                       matching color in the classroom. Maria and Yasmin take a final count, then
                       collect the circles and begin the next activity.

                       Both Yasmin and Maria are actively engaged with the children and each
                       other, supporting the children's learning and growth while ensuring their

                       safety. They use systems and strategies to make sure they know where
                       children are at all times, and that support developmentally appropriate
                       child risk-taking and learning.4

Active Supervision for Infants and Toddlers

Infant/toddler care is responsive, individualized care. And it's important to think about infants
and toddlers that are cared for in small groups with a primary-caregiver system of care and also
to think about the flow of the day as being responsive to the individualized needs of the
children. Staff work very closely with children throughout the day guiding them through
individual or small-group routines and experiences. Staff are providing responsive,
individualized care, and they will know each child well. That's an important piece of both
individualized care and active and responsive supervision. They have a good sense of how each
child gets through the day, what their abilities are, what their temperament is. Even as they
grow and change from day to day, they're able to follow each child in their care with an
understanding of how it is that they're growing.

                Figure 2.3 - Knowing children well is the basis of responsive care and active supervision. 5

In center-based programs or larger family child care homes, more than one caregiver is working
together in a team. And the other thing that's important to remember is the kind of
communication that develops between the two teachers in a classroom or a family-childcare
provider and an assistant -- a communication that supports a child's safe movement throughout
the day as well as their ability to explore and grow in a nurturing environment.

Adults provide support to each other, particularly at key times of the day, like transitions. All of
those important, individualized routines require both adults to work together, such as
individual sleeping times, going indoors and outdoors, changing times, feeding and eating times
for infants and toddlers, and other times during the day when there may be a particular child
that needs individualized care. It's so important that the staff working with them are working
together to support continuity of care.

The environment itself can be a partner in caring for infants and toddlers, particularly when it
comes to keeping children safe. We want to create environments that provide places for
children to play and be both together and apart but always in full view and within easy reach of
a caring and attentive adult.6

Creating an Environment of Yes!

An environment of "yes" means that everything infants and toddlers can get their hands on is
safe and acceptable for them to use. One way to ensure this is to for adults to do ongoing
safety checks in group care spaces and provide families with information about doing safety
checks of their own. The teacher, home visitor, and the child's family play a vital role in making
sure everything is safe, then stepping back to allow exploration.

Sometimes infants and toddlers will use materials in creative ways that surprise us! When
teachers feel uncomfortable about an activity, they should stop and ask themselves two
questions:

     Is it dangerous?
     What are the children learning from this experience?

If it is decided that the activity is safe with supervision, they should stay nearby. They should be
thoughtful and open to what the children might be learning. If the activity is not safe, they need
to consider what else might address the infants' and toddlers' curiosity in the same way. For
example, if young toddlers are delighted to discover that by shaking their sippy cups, liquid
comes out; a teacher may be worried that this water on the floor will lead to a slippery
accident. Instead, they might provide squeeze bottles outside or at the water table. The adult is
responsible for keeping children safe and encouraging learning through curiosity.

Saying "no" to infants and toddlers or asking them to "share" is a strategy that rarely works.
One way to prevent conflict is to reflect on, and then set up, the space where children play in
ways that promote "yes!"

     What areas generate the most "no's" or require the most adult guidance?
     What do the children need and enjoy the most when it comes to playtime?
     Do you have multiples of favorite toys?
     Do you have enough places where toddlers can play alone or with a few friends?

Active Supervision for Preschoolers

It's important not to become complacent with safety practices. Teachers need to keep it fresh,
thoughtful, and intentional. This begins with setting up the environment. Classrooms will have
unique factors to consider. But some general considerations include making sure that there is a
teacher responsible for every part of the space children are in, which may be referred to as
zoning, and for every part of the day (including transitions).

How teachers position their bodies is really important. They should see all of the children in
their care from any position in the room. And when in playing areas, their back should not be to
the center of the room, but towards the wall. It is also important to move closer to children as
needed (rather than staying in one place and potentially missing out on problems that may
arise).

Teachers also need to talk to each other, using back-and-forth communication, so that safety
information is easily spread through the room. It may seem strange at first, sometimes, for
teachers to talk to each other; but, it's incredibly helpful for active supervision - when there are
either changes in staff or children's routines, changes in roles, changes during transitions.
And one of the main purposes of zoning was created to help all children be engaged and to
minimize unnecessary wait times. When all staff know their roles in the classroom with zoning
and tasks are getting handled, children are engaged and the unsupervised wait time is really
minimized.

During transitions or routine changes, teachers need to have a heightened awareness.
Transitions are challenging times for both children and their teachers, so the risk to safety
increases. One thing that teachers can think about is how they can minimize the number of
changes so that there aren't as many transitions happening in the classroom. There should be
plans what adults will do, before, during, and after transition times.9

Creating a Culture of Safety

The topic of keeping children safe is only partly about policies and rules, and oversight. Those
things are important. But most important of all, this is about staff, the people who work directly
with children and families. Those people must be supported with opportunities for reflection,
professional development, chances to think about the work they do and why that work is so
important. What is challenging in that work, and what comes to them easily. It's the ability of
programs to recognize and analyze challenging conditions and be able to make improvements.
Programs must make sure that staff have that sense of commitment and responsibility, and
that they have the ability to ensure children are thriving is critical. They have to help make sure
staff remember why we do the work, to be curious about children's interests, needs, and ideas,
to have the opportunity to be creative, to enjoy children and each other's humor every day.
These things, in addition to the policies and procedures, will allow staff to be fully present with
children. Adults who can be fully present will keep children physically and emotionally safe and
thriving.

                             Figure 2.5 - Being fully present with children protects their safety.10

The first step to doing this is to create a culture of safety. In this context, culture means the set
of shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterize a program; the way things
work in that program and in that community. Experts and researchers have demonstrated that
the culture of an organization plays a key role in all successful safety initiatives.

This is done by involving every staff member and committing to safety at all levels. Programs
shouldn't assume that nothing will ever go wrong. In fact, they should plan that something is
going to go wrong. The goal is to create environments where there is zero harm, making it as
hard as possible for things to go wrong.
Directors, managers, staff, and families must all embrace the belief that children have a right to
be safe. All the adults in the program, the program leaders and staff, know that they are
responsible for every child, all day, every day. People understand their roles and responsibilities
in keeping children safe and embrace each of the 10 actions outlined in Table 2.1, that together
support a culture of safety. This approach is holistic. It's integrated, and community-centered. It
isn't an add-on. It's not a burden. It's a way of doing business so children don't get hurt.11

                                     10 Actions for a Culture of Safety12

 1. Use Data to Make Decisions: Program and incident data serve as an important resource
     to help managers and staff evaluate children's safety.

 2. Actively Supervise: Children are never alone or unsupervised. Staff position themselves
     so that they can observe, count, and listen at all times.

 3. Keep Environments Safe and Secure: Programs create, monitor, and maintain hazard-
     free spaces.

 4. Make Playgrounds Safe: Regularly inspected, well-maintained, age-appropriate and
     actively supervised outdoor play spaces allow children to engage in active play, explore
     the outdoors, and develop healthy habits.

 5. Transport Children Safely: Programs implement and enforce policies and procedures for
     drivers, monitors, children, and families using school buses, driving to and from the
     program, or walking.

 6. Transport Children Safely: Programs implement and enforce policies and procedures for
     drivers, monitors, children, and families using school buses, driving to and from the

     reactions to transitions and changes in daily routine, within and outside of the program.

 8. Model Safe Behaviors: Staff establish nurturing, positive relationships by demonstrating

     safe behaviors and encouraging other adults and children to try them.

 9. Teach Families about Safety: Staff engage families about safety issues and partner with
     them about how to reduce risks to prevent injuries that occur in the home.

 10. Know Your Children and Families: Staff plan activities with an understanding of each
     child's developmental level and abilities, and the preferences, culture, and traditions of
     their families. This includes everything from maintaining current emergency contact
     information to understanding families' perceptions about safety and injury prevention.

Specific Risks for Injury

Child injuries are preventable, yet 8,110 children (from 0-19 years) died from injuries in the US
in 2017.13 Car crashes, suffocation, drowning, poisoning, fires, and falls are some of the most
common ways children are hurt or killed. The number of children dying from injury dropped
nearly 30% over the last decade. However, injury is still the number 1 cause of death among
children.14

Children during early childhood are more at risk for certain injuries. Using data from 2000-2006,
the CDC determined that:

     For children less than 1 year of age, two-thirds of injury deaths were due to suffocation.
     Drowning was the leading cause of injury death between 1 and 4 years of age.
     Falls were the leading cause of nonfatal injury for all age groups of less than 15 years of

         age.
     For children ages 0 to 9, the next two leading causes were being struck by or against an

         object and animal bites or insect stings.
     Rates for fires or burns and drowning were highest for children 4 years and younger.15

Injury in Early Care and Education/Child Care

Families "are naturally concerned for their child's safety, particularly when cared for outside of
the home. However, children who spend more time in nonparental child care have a reduced
risk of (unintentional) injury. This may be because child care centers and family day homes
provide more supervision and/or safer play equipment. Nevertheless, injuries in child care
settings remain a serious, but preventable, health care issue."16

Creating a Safety Plan

Early care and education programs have an obligation to ensure that children in their care are
in healthy and safe environments and that policies and procedures that protect children are in
place. Using a screening tool, programs can identify where they need to make changes and
improvements to ensure children are healthy and safe while in their care. A checklist such as
the one modified from Head Start's Health and Safety Screener in Appendix C can be used for
this purpose.29

                               Figure 2.6 - Early childhood programs can make a safety plan.30

Programs must become familiar with the hazards to children that are specific to their
population and location. Considerations for this plan include the type of early education
program, ages of the children served, surrounding community, and family environments.

If any hazards are found upon screening, programs can make modifications to remove hazards
or use safety devices to protect children from hazards. Care should be taken to ensure that the
modifications include children with disabilities and special needs.

It will also be important to use positive guidance to help modify behaviors that put children's
safety at risk. Teachers can use role-modeling and communication to teach children how to
respond to situations, including emergencies, that put their safety at risk.

Early childhood programs must continue to monitor for safety. This includes regular screening
for safety and analysis of data surrounding injuries. Teachers must continuously monitor for
conditions that may lead to children being injured and examine both the behaviors of children
and adults in the environment.31

Documenting Injuries & Injury Prevention

When a child is injured, it is important to document the injury. This documentation is provided
to families, typically in the form of an injury or incident report. See Appendix D for an example
injury/incident report form. These should document:

     Who was involved in each injury? (child/children; staff, volunteers, family members)
     Where did the injury occur?
     What happened? (What was the cause?)
     What was the severity of each injury?
     When did each injury occur?
     Who - e.g., what staff were present and where were they at the time of each injury?
     What treatment was provided? How was the incident handled by staff?
     How could each injury have been prevented? What will be done in the future to prevent

         similar injuries?
     Who was notified in the child's family? When? How?

It is important to keep these reports to analyze them to:
     identify location(s) for high risk of injury.
     pinpoint systems and services that need to be strengthened.
     develop corrective action plans
     incorporate safety and injury prevention into ongoing-monitoring activities.32

Hazard Mapping

One such process to do this is hazard mapping, which is an approach to prevent injuries by
studying patterns of incidents.

Step One - Identify High-Risk Injury Locations
    1. Create a map of the classroom, center, or playground area. Label the various places
         and/or equipment in the location(s) that is being mapped. Make the map as accurate as
         possible.
    2. Place a "dot" or "marker" on the map to indicate where each specific incident and/or
         injury occurred over the past 3-6 months (or sooner, if concerns arise).
    3. Look at the severity of the injuries.
    4. Identify where most incidents occur.

Step Two - Identify Systems and Services that Need to be Strengthened
    1. Review the information on the injury/incident reports for areas with multiple dots.
    2. Consider what policy and practices are contributing to injuries/incidents.

Step Three - Develop a Corrective Action Plan
    1. Prioritize and select specific activities/strategies to resolve problem areas.
    2. Develop an action plan to correct the problem areas you identified. Include each of the
         activities/strategies selected in this corrective action plan. Identify the steps, the
         individuals responsible, and the dates for completion.
    3. Create a plan for sharing the corrective action plan with staff and families.

Step Four - Incorporate Hazard Mapping into Ongoing Monitoring
    1. Determine if any additional questions should be added to injury/incident report forms
         to obtain this missing information.
    2. When developing corrective action plans, consider prioritizing more serious injuries,
         even if they have occurred less often.
    3. Make sure there reduction in injuries and/or incidents and the severity of the injuries
         with a corrective plan.33

Teaching Children about Safety

While it is the adult's responsibility to keep children safe and children should not be expected
to actively protect themselves, teachers should help children develop safety awareness and the
realization that they can control some aspects of their safety through certain actions. The
earlier children learn about safety, the more naturally they will develop the attitudes and
respect that lead to lifelong patterns of safe behavior.

Safety education involves teaching safe actions while helping children understand the possible
consequences of unsafe behavior. Preschoolers learn through routines and daily practice and
by engaging in language scripts and following simple rules. These scripts and rules may be
communicated through voice, pictures, or signs. Children learn concepts and develop skills
through repetition, then build upon these as concepts and skills become more complex.

Preschoolers need help to recognize that safe play may prevent injury. Teachers can promote
independence and decision-making skills as children learn safe behaviors. Teachers can explain
that children can make choices to stay safe, just as they wash their hands to prevent disease,
brush their teeth to prevent cavities, and eat a variety of foods to help them grow strong and
healthy.

Preschoolers can learn to apply a few simple and consistent rules, such as riding in a car seat
and wearing seat belts, even though they are too young to understand the reasons for such

rules. For example, four-year-old Morgan says, "Buckle up!" as she gets into a vehicle. Although
Morgan lacks the skill needed to buckle the car seat buckle and does not understand the
consequences of not being safely buckled into her car seat, she is developing a positive habit.
Safety education in preschool focuses on behaviors the children can do to stay safe. It involves
simple, concrete practices that children can understand.

                            Figure 2.7 - Young children can develop habits that keep them safe.34

The purpose of safety rules and guidance is to promote awareness and encourage
developmentally appropriate behavior to prevent injury. Teachers may include separate rules
for the classroom, playground, hallways, buses, or emergency drills. Limit the number of rules
or guidelines, but foster consistency (e.g., three indoor rules, three playground rules) and base
them upon the greatest hazards, threats, and needs in your preschool program and community.
Safety guidance is most effective when teachers have appropriate expectations and safety rules
are stated in a positive manner. For example, an appropriate indoor safety rule might be stated,
"We walk indoors," rather than the negative, "Do not run indoors." On the playground, a rule
might state, "Go down the slide on your bottom, feet first." As children follow these rules,
acknowledge them for specific actions with descriptive praise (e.g., "Kevin, you sat on the slide
and went down really fast! That looked like fun!").

State rules clearly, in simple terms, and in children's home languages; include pictures or icons
with posted rules to assist all children's understanding. Children often are more willing to
accept a rule when they are given a brief explanation of why it is necessary. Gently remind
children during real situations; with positive reinforcement, they will begin to follow safety
rules more consistently. As children develop a greater understanding of safety rules, they begin
to develop self-control and feel more secure.

Adults are fully responsible for children's safety and compliance with safety rules and
emergency procedures. Safety education for children, which include rules and reinforcement of
verbal and picture scripts in children's home languages (including sign language), is essential for
handling emergency situations. Through practice and routines, children are better able to
follow the teacher's instruction and guidance. It is essential that teachers evaluate each child's

knowledge and skill in this area, and provide additional learning activities as needed to ensure
that all children can follow emergency routines.

Here are some strategies that teachers can use to help children learn about safety:
     Incorporate safety into the daily routine.
     Involve children in creating rules
     Provide coaching and gentle reminders to help children follow safety rules.
     Acknowledge children's self-initiated actions to keep themselves and others safe (such
         as pushing chairs in and wiping up spills)
     Provide time for children to practice safety skills (such as buckling seat belts)
     Introduce safety concepts and behaviors in simple steps.
     Role-play safety-helpers.
     Define emergency and practice what children should do in emergency situations.
     Introduce safety signs.
     Incorporate musical activities and safety songs.

Because of their level of cognitive development, many young children cannot consistently
identify dangerous situations. They may understand some safety consequences and can learn
some scripts. But adults must be responsible for their safety. Children often act impulsively,
without stopping to consider the danger. By learning and following simple safety rules (e.g.,
take turns, wear a helmet) and practicing verbal, visual, or sign-language scripts, children
establish a foundation of lifelong safety habits.35

                 Engaging Families

                     Share written and visual safety messages with families through
                         newsletters, brochures, bulletin boards, Web pages, and take-home
                         activities in the home languages of the families in the program. Emphasize
                         safety issues that relate to your preschool program and community.

                     Integrate parent information with children's learning about topics such as
                         poisoning prevention and traffic safety.

                     Provide safety information through workshops and during parent
                         meetings; include information on a variety of topics, especially those that
                         involve higher risk in specific communities, such as water safety, gun
                         safety, or lead poisoning.

                     Invite community safety personnel to participate in workshops and share
                         resources and information about how to access community services.

                     Address specific safety issues, such as vehicle safety and pedestrian
                         safety, through one-on-one guidance during pickup and drop-off times.

                     During family conferences, find out what messages family members would
                         like teachers to reinforce at school.

                     During home visits, offer to help families identify potential hazards in their
                         family environment and ways to reduce possible injury.

                     Post emergency plans on family bulletin boards and provide families with
                         a written copy of the preschool program's emergency plan. Include
                         responses to different scenarios (e.g., evacuation, shelters), location of
                         the designated evacuation shelter, and a number to call if family members
                         cannot reach the preschool.

                     Routinely update families' emergency contact information.
                     Encourage families to plan and practice emergency drills for fires,

                         earthquakes, floods, violent encounters, or other situations that could
                         occur in their home or community. Provide families with resources to
                         develop a home evacuation plan and drill.
                     Invite family members to attend the preschool or to serve as guest
                         speakers as children learn about people who can help in emergency
                         situations. Invited guests may include safety or medical personnel (e.g.,
                         firefighters, paramedics) or workers in related professions (e.g.,
                         construction workers, electricians, meteorologists, cleaning businesses).36

                    Risky Play and Children's Safety: Balancing Priorities for Optimal
                    Child Development

                        Injury prevention plays a key role in promoting children's safety, which is
                        considered to involve keeping children free from the occurrence or risk of
                        injury. However, emerging research suggests that imposing too many
                        restrictions on children's outdoor risky play may be hampering their
                        development. Like safety, play is deemed so critical to child development
                        and their physical and mental health that it is included in Article 31 of the
                        United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Thus, limitations on
                        children's play opportunities may be fundamentally hindering their health
                        and well-being.

                        Eager and Little describe a risk deprived child as more prone to problems
                        such as obesity, mental health concerns, lack of independence, and a
                        decrease in learning, perception and judgment skills, created when risk is
                        removed from play and restrictions are too high. Findings from disciplines
                        such as psychology, sociology, landscape architecture, and leisure studies,
                        challenge the notion that child safety is paramount and that efforts to
                        optimize child safety in all circumstances is the best approach for child
                        development. And families, popular culture, the media, and researchers in

                        other disciplines have expressed views that child safety efforts promote
                        the overprotection of children. These have the potential to trigger a
                        backlash against proven safety promotion strategies, such as child safety
                        seats or necessary supervision, possibly reversing the significant gains that
                        have been made in reducing child injuries.
                        Families, caregivers, and educators can work to create a balance by
                        fostering opportunities to engage in outdoor risky play that align with
                        safety efforts. An approach that focuses on eliminating hazards, that have
                        hidden potential to injure, such as a broken railing, but that does not
                        eliminate all risks, could be used. This allows the child to recognize and
                        evaluate the challenge and decide on a course of action that is not
                        dangerous but may still involve an element of risk. Adults can also provide
                        children with unstructured (open-ended) play materials that can be freely
                        manipulated in conventional playgrounds

                                               Figure 2.8 - This is an example of an adventure playground.37

                        This approach is a central component of the Adventure Playground
                        movement. Notably, European and Australian organizations and
                        researchers appear to be attempting to put this idea in practice, with
                        North American efforts lagging. For example, the National Institute for
                        Health and Clinical Excellence in the U.K. released injury prevention
                        guidelines that called for policies that counter "excessive risk aversion"
                        and promote children's need "to develop skills to assess and manage risks,
                        according to their age and ability." Both injury and play organizations, such

                        safe as possible. International collaboration would benefit from translating
                        this into practice in a manner that is sensitive to concerns for child safety
                        and children's developmental needs for risky play.38

                   What do you think? What are your thoughts about keeping children as safe as
                   necessary, not as safe as possible? What are appropriate ways for children to
                   learn how to manage risk?

Summary

Active supervision is critical to keep young children safe. When programs create a culture of
safety, they go beyond following regulations and policies, by making a commitment to
protecting safety so that children don't get hurt. There are some common risks to safety that
educators should be aware or (and that will be covered in more depth in the next two
chapters). When early care and education programs create a safety plan using data they have
gathered by documenting and analyzing the injuries children get, they can make changes to
help protect children's safety.
While adults have the ultimate responsibility for safety, children can be taught about and
families can be engaged in protecting children's safety. Teachers must also consider the value
of risk play when making decisions about what action to take to keep children safe.

Introduction

Designing an effective and engaging classroom environment takes careful thought and
planning, but it's important. A well-organized classroom that is interesting, orderly, and
attractive contributes to children's participation and engagement with the learning materials
and activities. This engagement, in turn, contributes to children's learning.
Let's look at it from a child's perspective. We want children to feel safe and comfortable in the
classroom. We want them to be interested in the learning activities and to take full advantage
of being at school and take full advantage of the activities you've planned and the materials
you've selected. It can be helpful to get down at a child's level and take a look at the classroom.
Does it feel welcoming and inviting? Is there enough room to move, make choices, and stay
involved with a toy or activity or project? And does the room help the child know what to do
and what's expected?

                Figure 3.1 - This reading area is set up so it's clear what children should do in this space.1

Designing an Effective and Safe Classroom Environment

There are all sorts of classrooms. They differ by size and shape, amount of light and wall space,
placement of sinks and counters, and amount of storage. Figuring out how to design the
physical space and to maximize children's interactions within the space will take some time.
Make a floor plan. Move things around. Take a look at other classrooms and see what works.

Here are a few things to think about when designing your space and making it as workable as
possible. Think about the number of interest areas or centers that you want or need for the
group of children. Arrange the space so that noisy areas are separated from quiet areas. Locate
centers next to needed storage or equipment. Use furniture or other items to provide
boundaries. But, make sure that the adults can see all of the areas of the room.2

Factors to Consider

Space and boundaries:
     Are the centers clearly defined with furniture, rugs, or shelves?
     Is there enough space for all children to easily move about the room?
     In each defined area, is there adequate space for the number of children using it?

Proximity and distance:
     Are the quiet and noisy areas in proximity or separated?
     Are centers located near things that children need to complete projects (art center near
         sink, puzzle or game shelves within reach of tables, etc.)?
     Are teachers able to view children in all centers?

Home and culture:
     What home-like features are included in the classroom?
     How is(are) the culture(s) of the local community reflected in the classroom?

Flexibility and permanence:
     How does the space accommodate gross motor activity?
     What aspects of the physical space cannot be changed (cost or structural issues) and are
         challenging to overcome (e.g., limited access to natural light, cumbersome cubbies,
         etc.)?

Engagement and challenging behaviors:
     Are there areas of the classroom where challenging behaviors are more likely to occur?
     Are there areas where typically children are positively engaged in classroom activities?

Traffic patterns:
     Can children move easily from space to space?
     Is running and wandering discouraged?

Material selection:
     Are materials chosen to support development and learning?
     Are they culturally relevant and meaningful to the children?
     Is there is a sufficient variety and quantity (without overwhelming children)? 3

                Pause to Reflect

                   So far, we haven't specifically called out safety much in our discussion of
                   environmental design. Look at some of the listed items and brainstorm how
                   they each might be related to safety? For example, why is looking at areas of
                   the classroom where challenging behaviors are more likely to occur a safety
                   consideration?

                    Tips for Environmental Design

                         Traffic patterns need to discourage running.
                         Use furniture, rugs, and similar items to define boundaries.
                         Ensure that teachers can see what is happening in all areas of the

                            classroom.
                         Cultural and home-like features are present in the room.
                         Use spaces with as much flexibility as possible.
                         Quiet and noisy centers are spaced appropriately.
                         Ensure interesting classroom content selection is balanced with

                            appropriate stimulation versus overstimulation.
                         Each center provides enough information about what to do there and

                            how to play.4

                             Figure 3.2 - This large space was transformed with this rug and arrangement of materials
                                                                           and furniture.5

Grouping of Children

Teachers want to be intentional about how they group children, whether it's a decision made in
the moment or as part of lesson planning. Match the size of the group with the purpose of the
activity. Think about the children who will be in the group. Young children need opportunities
to participate and learn with the whole group, small groups, and they will thrive with a bit of
one-on-one time with an adult.6

Large groups are good for:
     Introducing concepts
     Building community
     Conducting routine activities

Small groups are good for:
     Maximizing back and forth interactions
     Peer modeling of skills
     Guiding instruction

One-on-one interactions are good for:
     Tasks requiring complex skills
     Instance when a child needs specific direction and assistance7

                Pause to Reflect

                   How is considering group size related to safety? What might teachers need to
                   observe for to determine if the group sizes are working well for the children?

Every early childhood environment is full of pros and cons; it is how educators work with the
many characteristics of a classroom that can make a tremendous difference. Teachers can be
surprised by the results when they:

     Assess the spaces for both limitations and strengths.
     Strategize how to optimize what they have to work with in their classrooms.
     Try a different arrangement, see what happens, and then modify based on what is

         working and what is not.

                        Figure 3.3 - These shelves are in a classroom for 3-year-olds. What adjustments
                         might need to be made to meet the needs of the children and keep them safe?8

Sometimes a modification can be minor (raising or lowering a shelf, "stop" signs over
unavailable areas, masking tape to better define a space, etc.). This highlights the "work-in-
progress" nature of early childhood environments. As the needs of children change, the room
may need minor changes or have to be rearranged completely to meet those needs.9

                   A Few More Considerations for Environmental Design

                       When designing classroom environments, there are some other
                       considerations to keep in mind:

                       Rotations:
                            Avoid grouping the same children together all the time, especially
                                when pairing skilled with less skilled children.
                            Consider limiting the number of children per center and creating a
                                system for rotating children through favorite areas.
                            Regularly rotate some of the toys and materials to generate a sense
                                of newness.
                            Instruction can be tailored within small groups to meet educational
                                goals. For example, one group of children that is working on learning
                                numbers can read a counting book; another group working on fine
                                motor skills can do beading; still another group of children working
                                on social skills can practice joining play.
                            Emphasize cooperation by choosing toys and activities that require
                                it (e.g., large appliance boxes, games that need two or more players,
                                balls for throwing back and forth, etc.).
                            Whenever possible keep the design elements simple (both for the
                                teacher's sake and because simple tends to be longer-lasting). Also,
                                some aspects of designing can be done spontaneously and quickly
                                (spur of the moment) and still be effective. 10

Interpersonal Safety

Children can behave in ways that hurt themselves or others so teachers must prepared to
handle unsafe behaviors in their duty to protect children from injury. An important way to think
about behavior is as a form of communication. Young children let us know their wants and
needs through their behavior long before they have or can use words in the heat of the
moment. They give us cues to help us understand what they are trying to communicate.

Early childhood educators can help children by interpreting their cues and responding to meet
their needs. The following example illustrates the importance of responding to the possible
meaning behind behavior:

Javon bites Blair because he wants the block she is playing with and we remove Javon
from the situation. Not only are we not responding to his want or need, but we are
taking him out of the context where he can learn to communicate his feelings in a way
that doesn't hurt others.

Forms and Functions of Behavior

There are many reasons a child might use specific behaviors. This is why it is important for
adults to carefully observe children, pay attention to their cues, get to know them, and know
what part of the schedule gives them a hard time to better understand what they are trying to
tell us through their behavior.11

Each behavior has a:
         FORM = the behavior the child is using to communicate
         AND A FUNCTION = the reason or purpose the child is using that behavior12

Table 3.1 - Forms and Functions of Behavior13

            Forms of Communication             Function of Communication

Here are some examples of form and functions of infants, toddlers, and preschoolers:

Table 3.2 - Examples of Forms and Possible Functions of Behaviors14

Form of Communication  Possible Functions of Communication
Toddler biting              I want the dinosaur Joseph is playing with
                            I'm teething
Preschooler hitting         This is my space--I don't want you in my space
                            I am really frustrated
                            You just told me "no" and I don't like it
                            I want to play with you

                            I feel mad and don't know how to express it
                            I don't want to stop playing
                            I don't want to share my favorite toy
                            I want to play by myself

Form and function are also shaped by culture. Children are socialized to express their feelings in
culturally acceptable ways. It is important to talk with families so you can look for acceptable
ways that children express themselves in a culturally respectful way.

As you have probably already experienced--it is not always easy to figure out the meaning of a
child's behavior. To add to the complexity of understanding the meaning of behavior:

     A single form of behavior may serve more than one function. For example, a toddler
         might use biting (form) for different functions ("I want the toy you have." "I want to play
         with you but don't know how to let you know." "I'm tired." "I'm frustrated because you
         don't understand what I am trying to tell you." "I want some attention.")

     Several forms of behavior may serve one function. For example, a child's purpose
         (function) may be to build with their favorite blocks, but they use different forms of
         behavior (biting, yelling, grabbing, running away with the blocks, sharing) based on how
         they feel that day, who is playing in the block area, or based on their cultural
         expectations.

     The meaning of behavior is shaped by culture, family, and the unique makeup and
         experiences of the individual child. For example, some cultures may express sadness by
         crying or by having a nonchalant facial expression. Some cultures may express happiness
         by laughing and being exuberant, while others may expect more restrained behaviors.

Some of these functions of communication become a concern for children's safety (of the child
communicating, the other children, and other people in the environment). Early childhood
educators must take the time to understand a behavior's meaning so that they can help the
child replace unsafe forms of communication with forms that don't hurt others or harm the

environment. Pausing to try to figure out the meaning behind a child's behavior--instead of
just reacting to the behavior--can change the way we see a child, the way we respond to a
child, and the way we teach a child. Becoming a "behavior has meaning" detective who is
always on the lookout for the meaning of behavior will help you keep children safe.15 Take a
look at the following example of an unsafe behavior, what it might mean, and what an educator
might do to support the child.

                   Emilia and Sarae

                       Teacher Emilia says about a child Sarae, "I have to watch her like a hawk or
                       she'll run down the hall or go out the gate, down the street, and I don't
                       know where."

                       What This Might Mean
                       So, we could reframe this to: Sarae is an active child. She may naturally be a
                       kinesthetic learner, who needs to move and shake, has extra energy.

                       What the Teacher Might Do
                       A teacher can give Sarae positive ways to exercise the way she loves to be.
                       So, whether that's during choice time, that there is an opportunity for her
                       to dance, for example. Or, there' s an obstacle course set up for her to
                       maneuver through.

                                                    Figure 3.4 - Help keep children stay safe by figuring
                                                    out the function of their behavior/communication.16

                       When they are outdoors, the teacher can create opportunities for
                       structured play so that is running with an intention; such as part of a game
                       with her peers. If it's hard to get her back inside, give her a leadership role.
                       Maybe she's the one who has the bell that cues everybody that it's time to

                       line up. So now she's going to make sure she finds her friends and is the
                       one responsible for bringing the whole group together to go inside.

                       The Potential Result
                       Reframing the behavior and provide positive outlets will not only keep
                       Sarae safe, but it will also communicate to her that how she feels is okay
                       and that she's being supported, acknowledged, and encouraged.17

Taking a Closer Look at Behavior

You may also find it valuable to examine behavior much the way you would injuries and traffic
patterns. Gather data about unsafe behaviors:

      When are they happening? Are there specific times of day that children are finding it
         more challenging to behave/communicate in safe ways?

      Where are they happening? Are there hot spots for challenging behavior? What in the
         environment might be the focus of the unsafe behavior/communication?

      Why they are happening? What happened before the led up to the behavior? What
         happened after?

      Who are the behaviors happening between? All children will have times where they
         communicate with unsafe behavior, but some children may need more adult support in
         certain contexts (time of day, activity, groupings of children, etc.).

Look for patterns. Reflect on what can be changed in the physical environment,
schedule/routine, groupings, and supervision to help prevent children from hurting themselves
or others when trying to communicate their needs.

                   Biting

                       Biting is a common but upsetting behavior of toddlers. Here is some
                       information and tips for responding to biting:

                       When a child bites another child
                       Intervene immediately between the child who bit and the bitten child. Stay
                       calm don't overreact, yell or give a lengthy explanation.

                       Use your voice and expression to show that biting is not acceptable. Look
                       into the child's eyes and say calmly but firmly, "I do not like it when you
                       bite people." For a child with more limited language, just say "No biting
                       people." Point out how the biter's behavior affected the other person. "You
                       hurt him and he's crying." Encourage the child who was bitten to tell the
                       biter "You hurt me." Encourage the child who bit to help the other child by
                       getting the ice pack, etc.

                       Offer the bitten child comfort and first aid. Wash broken skin with warm
                       water and soap. Observe general precautions if there is bleeding. Apply an
                       ice pack or cool cloth to help prevent swelling. If the bitten child is a guest,
                       tell the families what happened. Suggest the bitten child be seen by a
                       health care provider if the skin is broken or there are any signs of infection
                       (redness or swelling).

                       Preventing biting
                       Reinforce desired behavior. Notice and acknowledge when you like what
                       your child is doing, especially for showing empathy or social behavior, such
                       as patting a crying child, offering to take turns with a toy or hugging gently.
                       Do not label, humiliate or isolate a child who bites.

                       Discourage play which involves "pretend" biting, or seems too rough and
                       out of control. Help the child make connections with others.

                       Why do children bite and what can we do?
                       Children bite for many different reasons, so in order to respond effectively,
                       it's best to try and find out why they are biting. If a child:

                            experiments by biting immediately say "no" in a firm voice, and give
                                him a variety of toys to touch, smell and taste and encourage
                                sensory-motor exploration.

                            has teething discomfort, provide cold teething toys or safe, chewy
                                foods.

                            is becoming independent, provide opportunities to make age-
                                appropriate choices and have some control (the bread or the
                                cracker, the yellow or the blue ball), and notice and give positive
                                attention as new self-help skills and independence develop.

                            is using muscles in new ways, provide a variety of play materials
                                (hard/soft, rough/smooth, heavy/light) and plan for plenty of active
                                play indoors and outdoors.

                            Is learning to play with other children, try to guide behavior if it
                                seems rough (take the child's hand and say, "Touch Jorge gently--
                                he likes that") and reinforce prosocial behavior (such as taking turns
                                with toys or patting a crying child).

                            is frustrated in expressing his/her needs and wants, state what she
                                is trying to communicate ("you feel mad when Ari takes your truck"
                                or "you want me to pay attention to you").

                            is threatened by new or changing situations such as a parent
                                returning to work, a new baby, or parents/caregivers separating,
                                provide special nurturing and be as warm and reassuring as

                 possible, and help him or her talk about feelings even when he or
                 she says things like "I hate my new baby."18

Safe Toys, Materials, and Equipment

Play is a natural activity for every young child. Play provides many opportunities for children to
learn and grow - physically, mentally, and socially. If play is the child's work, then the toys,
materials, and equipment in the environment are what will enable children to do their work
well and safely.19

Safe Toys

Protecting children from unsafe toys is the responsibility of everyone. Careful toy selection and
proper supervision of children at play are still--and always will be--the best ways to protect
children from toy-related injuries.20

It is important that educators consider both safety and durability when choosing toys for
children. Toys should be constructed to withstand the uses and abuses of children in the age
range for which the toy is appropriate.

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has safety regulations for certain toys.
Manufacturers must design and manufacture their products to meet these regulations so that
hazardous products are not sold (see Table 3.3).

                 Table 3.3 - Mandatory Toy Safety Regulations21

            Age                                    Regulations
For All Ages      No shock or thermal hazards in electrical toys
                  Amount of lead paint is severely limited
Under Age 3       No toxic materials in or on toys
                  All materials for children 12 and under are non-hazardous
                  Latex balloons and product with balloons are labeled as

                     choking and suffocation hazard
                  Unbreakable - will withstand use and abuse
                  No small parts or pieces which become lodged in throat
                  Rattles large enough not to become lodged in the throat and

                     will not separate into small pieces
                  No balls with diameters 1.75 inches or less

                        No electrically operated toys with heating elements
                        No sharp points or edges on toys

In addition to the mandatory standards, many toy manufacturers also adhere to the toy
industry's voluntary safety standards (see Table 3.4).22

                  Table 3.4 - Voluntary Standards for Toy Safety23

                                   Voluntary Standards for Toy Safety24

Puts age and safety labels on toys

Puts warning labels on crib gyms advertising that they should be removed from cribs when
infants can push up on hands and knees to prevent strangulation

Makes squeeze toys and teethers large enough not to become lodged in an infant's throat
Assures that the lid of a toy chest will stay open in any position to which it is raised and not
fall unexpectedly on a child

Limits string length on crib and playpen toys to reduce the risk of strangulation

Toys should be chosen with care. Teachers should look for quality design and construction.
Safety labels to look for include "Flame retardant/Flame resistant" on fabric products and
"Washable/hygienic materials" on stuffed toys and dolls. Watch for the hazards listed in Table
3.525.

Sharp Edges            New toys intended for children under eight years of age should be
                       free of sharp glass and metal edges. With use, however, older toys
                       may break, exposing cutting edges.

         Hazards                                          Description
Small Parts             The law bans small parts in toys intended for children under three.
Loud Noises             This includes removable small eyes and noses on stuffed toys and
Cords And Strings       dolls and small, removable squeakers on squeeze toys.
                        Some noise-making toys can produce sounds at noise levels that
Sharp Points            can damage hearing.
Propelled Objects       Toys with long strings or cords are dangerous for infants and very
                        young children. The cords can become wrapped around an infant's
                        neck, causing strangulation. Never hang toys with long strings,
                        cords, loops, or ribbons in cribs or playpens where children can
                        become entangled. Remove crib gyms from the crib when the child
                        can pull up on hands and knees; some children have strangled
                        when they fell across crib gyms stretched across the crib.
                        Toys that have been broken may have dangerous points or prongs.
                        Stuffed toys may have wires inside the toy which could cut or stab
                        if exposed. A CPSC regulation prohibits sharp points in new toys
                        and other articles intended for use by children under eight years of
                        age.
                        Projectiles--guided missiles and similar flying toys--can be turned
                        into weapons and can injure eyes in particular. Children should
                        never be permitted to play with hobby or sporting equipment that
                        has sharp points.

Check all toys periodically for breakage and potential hazards. A damaged or dangerous toy
should be thrown away or repaired immediately.

Age Appropriate Toys

Teachers must keep in mind the ages of children they are choosing toys for, including their
typical interests and skill levels. The manufacturer's age recommendation is a good starting
place to ensure that toys are age-appropriate. Warnings such as "Not recommended for
children under 3" should be followed.27 See Table 3.6 for some age-appropriate toys to
consider. Please note that toys appear on the list when they become appropriate and are not
repeated in later ages.

Nontoxic Art Materials

Federal law requires that all art materials offered for sale to consumers of all ages in the United
States undergo a toxicological review of the complete formulation of each product to
determine the product's potential for producing adverse chronic health effects. It also requires
that the art materials be properly labeled for acute and chronic hazards, as required by
the Labeling of Hazardous Art Materials Act(LHAMA) and the Federal Hazardous Substances
Act (FHSA), respectively.

In addition to the LHAMA requirements, art materials - such as paintbrushes and stencils - that
are designed or intended primarily for children 12 years of age or younger, are also required,
like all children's products, to comply with the requirements of the Consumer Product Safety
Improvement Act of 2008 (CPSIA).32 Under the FHSA, most children's products that contain a
hazardous substance are banned, whether the hazard is based on chronic toxicity, acute
toxicity, flammability, or other hazard identified in the statute.

Children's products that meet the FHSA's definition of an art material include, but are not
limited to, crayons, chalk, paint sets, colored pencils, and modeling clay. Non-toxic art and craft
supplies intended for children are readily available. Read the labels and only purchase art and
craft materials intended for children and that are labeled with the statement "Conforms to
ASTM D-4236."33

One such label will come from the Art and Creative Materials Institute's (ACMI) certification
program. "ACMI-certified product seals...indicate that these products have been evaluated by a
qualified toxicologist and are labeled in accordance with federal and state laws... The AP
(Approved Product) Seal identifies art materials that are safe and that are certified in a
toxicological evaluation by a medical expert to contain no materials in sufficient quantities to
be toxic or injurious to humans, including children, or to cause acute or chronic health
problems."34

Safety Risks from Art Materials

For certain chemicals and exposure situations, children may be especially susceptible to the risk
of injury. For example, since children are smaller than adults, children's exposures to the same
amount of a chemical may result in more severe effects. Further, children's developing bodies,
including their brains, nervous systems, and lungs may make them more susceptible than
adults. Differences in metabolism may also affect children's responses to some chemicals.
Children`s behaviors and cognitive abilities may also influence their risk. For example, children
under the age of 12 are less able to remember and follow complex steps for safety procedures,
and are more impulsive, making them more likely to ignore safety precautions. Children have a
much higher chance of toxic exposure than adults because they are unaware of the dangers,
not as concerned with cleanliness and safety precautions as adults, and are often more curious
and attracted to novel smells, sights, or sounds. Children need regular and consistent reminders
of safety rules, and there is no substitute for direct supervision.

Guidelines for Selecting Art and Craft Materials

Here are some helpful reminders about choosing art materials for children:
     Note that even products labeled `non-toxic' when used in an unintended manner can
         have harmful effects.
     Products with cautionary/warning labels should not be used with children under age 12.
     Avoid solvents and solvent-based supplies, which include turpentine, paint thinner,
         shellac, and some glues, inks, and a few solvent-containing permanent markers.
     Avoid products or processes that produce airborne dust that can be inhaled (including
         powdered tempera paint).
     Avoid old supplies, unlabeled supplies, and be wary of donated supplies with
         cautionary/warning labels and that do not contain the statement "Conforms to ASTM
         D4236."
     Look for products that are clearly labeled with information about intended uses.
     Give special attention to students with asthma or allergies, which may elevate the
         students' sensitivities to fumes, dust, or products that come into contact with the skin.41
     Gather your supplies beforehand so that you can continue to supervise their use
         without needing to step away.
     Instruct children on safety practices before you begin (such as, modeling how to cut
         safely with scissors).
     Do activities in well-ventilated areas.
     Use protective equipment (such as smocks).
     Assume that anything you use should be safe enough that it won't harm children if it
         gets on their skin or in their mouths and/or eyes.42

Using Technology and Media Safely

Developmentally appropriate use of technology can help young children grow and learn,
especially when families and early educators play an active role. Early learners can use
technology to explore new worlds, make-believe, and actively engage in fun and challenging
activities. They can learn about technology and technology tools and use them to play, solve
problems, and role play. But how technology is used is important to protect children's health
and safety.

Technology can be a Tool for Learning

What exactly is developmentally appropriate when it comes to technology for children? In
Technology and Interactive Media as Tools in Early Childhood Programs Serving Children from
Birth through Age 8, the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) and
the Fred Rogers Center state that "appropriate experiences with technology and media allow

children to control the medium and the outcome of the experience, to explore the functionality
of these tools, and pretend how they might be used in real life43."

Lisa Guernsey, author of Screen Time: How Electronic Media--From Baby Videos to Educational
Software--Affects Your Young Child, also provides guidance for families and early educators.
For example, instead of applying arbitrary, "one-size-fits-all" time limits, families and early
educators should determine when and how to use various technologies based on the Three C's:
the content, the context, and the needs of the individual child. They should ask themselves the
following questions:

     Content--How does this help children learn, engage, express, imagine, or explore?
     Context--What kinds of social interactions (such as conversations with families or peers)

         are happening before, during, and after the use of the technology? Does it complement,
         and not interrupt, children's learning experiences and natural play patterns?
     The individual child--What does this child need right now to enhance his or her growth
         and development? Is this technology an appropriate match with this child's needs,
         abilities, interests, and development stage?44

Early childhood educators should keep in mind the developmental levels of children when using
technology for early learning. That is, they first should consider what is best for healthy child
development and then consider how technology can help early learners achieve learning
outcomes. Technology should never be used for technology's sake. Instead, it should only be
used for learning and meeting developmental objectives, which can include being used as a tool
during play.

When technology is used in early learning settings, it should be integrated into the learning
program and used in rotation with other learning tools such as art materials, writing materials,
play materials, and books, and should give early learners an opportunity for self-expression
without replacing other classroom learning materials. There are additional considerations for
educators when technology is used, such as whether a particular device will displace
interactions with teachers or peers or whether a device has features that would distract from
learning. Further, early educators should consider the overall use of technology throughout a
child's day and week, and adhere to recommended guidelines from the Let's Move initiative, in
partnership with families. Additionally, if a child has special needs, specific technology may be
required to meet that child's educational and care needs. And dual language learners can use
digital resources in multiple languages or translation to support both their home language and
English development.

                  classroom are using an app to create a "story" with photos of their recent field trip.45

For Infants and Toddlers

Research shows that unstructured playtime is particularly important for infants and toddlers
because they learn more quickly through interactions with the real world than they do through
media use and, at such a young age, they have limited periods of awake time. At this age,
children require "hands-on exploration and social interaction with trusted caregivers to develop
their cognitive, language, motor, and social-emotional skills."

For children under the age of 2, technology use in early learning settings is generally
discouraged. But if determined appropriate by the IFSP team under Part C of the IDEA, children
with disabilities in this age range may also use technology, for example, an assistive technology
device to help them communicate with others, access and participate in different learning
opportunities, or help them get their needs met.

For Preschoolers

For children ages 2-5, families and early educators need to take into account that technology
may be used at home and in early learning settings. New recommendations in the AAP's 2016
Media and Young Minds Brief suggest that one hour of technology use is appropriate per day,
inclusive of time spent at home and in early learning settings and across devices.46 The
Department of Health and Human Services supports more limited technology use in early care
settings, and more information on their recommendations can be found in Caring for Our
Children: National Health and Safety Performance Standards.47 However, time is only one
metric that should be considered with technology use for children in this age range. Early
educators should also consider the quality of the content, the context of use, and opportunities
the technology provides to strengthen or develop relationships.

For School-Aged Children

For children ages 6-8 in school settings, technology should be used as a tool for children to
explore and become active creators of content. If children have more than one teacher, those
teachers should be aware of how much screen time is being used across subject areas and at
home. Students should learn to use technology as an integrated part of a diverse curriculum.

Active versus Passive Engagement

Early childhood educators should understand the differences between passive and active use of
technology. Passive use of technology generally occurs when children are consuming content,
such as watching a program on television, a computer, or a handheld device without
accompanying reflection, imagination, or participation.

Active use occurs when children use technologies such as computers, devices, and apps to
engage in meaningful learning or storytelling experiences. Examples include sharing their
experiences by documenting them with photos and stories, recording their own music, using
video chatting software to communicate with loved ones, or using an app to guide playing a
physical game. These types of uses are capable of deeply engaging the child, especially when an
adult supports them. While actions such as swiping or pressing on devices may seem to be
interactive, if the child does not intentionally learn from the experience, it is not considered to
be active use. To be considered active use, the content should enable deep, cognitive
processing, and allow intentional, purposeful learning at the child's developmental level.

                Pause to Reflect

                  Do these children look like they are using technology actively or passively?
                  What do you need to see or know to accurately make this determination?

                                                      Figure 3.15 - Two children on a computer48

Early childhood educators also need to think of ways they can reduce the sedentary nature of
most technology use. Technology can encourage and complement physical activity, such as
doing yoga with a video or learning about the plants outdoors with a nature app.

The Digital Divide

Research points to a widening digital use divide, which occurs when some children have the
opportunity to use technology actively while others are asked primarily to use it passively. The
research showed that children from families with lower incomes are more likely to complete
passive tasks in learning settings while their more affluent peers are more likely to use
technology to complete active tasks.

For low-income children who may not have access to devices or the internet at home, early
childhood settings provide opportunities to learn how to use these tools more actively. For
example, research shows that preschool-aged children from low-income families in an urban
Head Start center who received daily access to computers and were supported by an adult
mentor displayed more positive attitudes toward learning, improved self-esteem and self-
confidence, and increased kindergarten readiness skills than children who had computer access
but did not have support from a mentor.

Co-Viewing of Technology

Most research on children's media usage shows that children learn more from content when
parents/caregivers or early educators watch and interact with children, encouraging them to
make real-world connections to what they are viewing both while they are viewing and
afterward.

                                     Figure 3.16 - Interacting with children and technology
                                       is the best way to make technology use effective. 49

There are many ways that adult involvement can make learning more effective for young
children using technology. Adult guidance that can increase active use of more passive
technology includes, but are not limited to, the following:

     Prior to the child viewing content, an adult can talk to the child about the content and
         suggest certain elements to watch for or pay particular attention to;

     An adult can view the content with the child and interact with the child in the moment;

     After a child views the content, an adult can engage the child in an activity that extends
         learning such as singing a song they learned while viewing the content or connecting the
         content to the world.

                    Figure 3.17 - Here are some ways adults can effectively use technology with children.50

Safety Risks of Technology

In addition to the health risks of sedentary activity (in place of active play), there are concerns
about privacy and security with any technology. The rights of children under 13 and technology
in school are governed by federal laws, but looking at privacy policies is important.
Software and apps may also include advertising and in-app purchasing (generally inappropriate
for young children). So early childhood educators should choose software and apps that avoid
advertising and in-app purchases.

                   What is Digital Citizenship?

                       In the Ed Tech Developer's Guide, released by the Office of Educational
                       Technology in April 2015, digital citizenship is defined as "a set of norms
                       and practices regarding appropriate and responsible technology use... and
                       requires a whole-community approach to thinking critically, behaving
                       safely, and participating responsibly online."51

                       As early learners reach an appropriate age to use technology more
                       independently, they must be taught about cyber safety, including the need
                       to protect and not share personal information on the internet, the goals
                       and influence of advertisements, and the need for caution when clicking on
                       links. These skills are particularly important for older children who may be
                       using a parent's device unsupervised. Early childhood educators and
                       administrators should ensure that the proper filters and firewalls are in
                       place so children cannot access materials that are not approved for a school
                       setting.52

Not all technology is appropriate for young children and not every technology-based experience
is good for young children's development. To ensure that technology has a positive impact,
adults who use technology with children should continually update their knowledge and equip
themselves to make sophisticated decisions on how to best leverage these technology tools to
enhance learning and interpersonal relationships for young children.

Access to technology for children is necessary in the 21st century but not sufficient. To have
beneficial effects, it must be accompanied by strong adult support.53

Preventing Injuries Indoors

Some injuries that early childhood educators should be aware of and intentionally act to
prevent in the last chapter were presented in the previous chapter and earlier in this chapter
during the discussion about safe toys and art materials. Here is some further information about
injuries that are more likely to happen indoors.

Choking

Choking occurs when an object blocks the airway, preventing breathing.54 Infants have the
highest rates of choking (140 per 100,000). That risk decreases as they get older and their

airway increases in size, with 90% of fatal choking happening in children less than 4 years of
age.55

Reducing the Risks of Choking

The main way to prevent choking is to recognize that objects that are 1 inches or less in
diameter are higher risk. 56 Foods are the most common cause of choking. Having children sit
during snacks and meals at an unhurried pace, allowing time for children to properly chew their
food helps prevent choking on food. Food is safest when cut into small pieces or served in small
amounts. See Table 3.7 for foods that commonly cause choking.

Toys, and other items that children may play with, are another common source of choking
hazards. Ensuring children only have access to age-appropriate toys is an important step. See
Table 3.7 for items that should be kept out of reach of young children.

Teachers can use a small parts tester, a commercial product commonly known as choke tube, to
test whether or not an object is a choking hazard. Recognizing and responding to choking will
be addressed in Chapter 5.58

Poisoning

There are many hazards that put children at risk for accidental poisoning, both indoors and
outdoors. Poisoning can occur at any time a harmful substance is intentionally or
unintentionally ingested. Poisons come in many forms including plants, cleaning supplies,
spoiled food, and medications. Children, who are naturally curious and like to explore, are in
particular at risk for poisoning.

    Figure 3.19 -Lock up harmful substances in cabinets that are out-of-reach of children to prevent poisoning.60

Guidelines to Prevent Poisoning

     Keep all cleaning supplies and chemicals locked.
     All medications should be kept in a locked storage area, out of reach.
     Check medications periodically for expiration dates and properly dispose of expired

         medications. Some medications become toxic when they are past their expiration date.
     Do not tell children that medication is "candy" as this makes it look more attractive to

         them.

Burns

Every day, over 300 children ages 0 to 19 are treated in emergency rooms for burn-related
injuries and two children die as a result of being burned.

Younger children are more likely to sustain injuries from scald burns that are caused by hot
liquids or steam, while older children are more likely to sustain injuries from flame burns that
are caused by direct contact with fire. 63

Causes of Burns

Burns can be caused by dry or wet heat, chemicals, or electricity (both indoors and outdoors).
     Burns from dry heat can occur from fire, irons, hairdryers, curling irons, and stoves
         (American Institute for Preventive Medicine, 2012; Leahy, Fuzy & Grafe, 2013).
     Burns from wet or moist heat occur from hot liquids, such as hot water or steam
         (American Institute for Preventive Medicine; Leahy, Fuzy & Grafe). These types of burns
         are called scalds. Scalds can occur within seconds and cause serious injury.
     Chemical burns occur from chemical sources and can also cause serious burns when
         exposed to skin, or if swallowed, whether intentionally or unintentionally.
     Electrical burns can cause very serious injury as they can burn both the outside and
         inside of the person's body, causing injury that cannot be seen, and which can be life-
         threatening.
     Radiation burns can also occur from sources of radiation such as sunlight (American
         Institute for Preventive Medicine).64

Types of Burns

Burns are divided into first, second, and third degree burns.

First degree burns affect only the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). These types of burns are
the least serious as they are only on the surface of the skin. First degree burns usually appear
red, dry, and slightly swollen (MedlinePlus, 2014). Blisters do not occur with this type of burn.
They should heal within a couple of days (American Institute for Preventive Medicine, 2012). A
first degree burn is pictured in the bottom left of Figure 3.20.
Second degree burns affect the top layer of the skin and the second layer of skin underneath
(dermis). These are more serious than first degree burns. The skin may appear very swollen,
red, moist, (MedlinePlus, 2014) and may have blisters or look watery and weepy (American
Institute for Preventive Medicine, 2012). A second degree burn is pictured in the bottom middle
of Figure 3.20.
Third degree burns are the most serious burn. A third degree burn affects all layers of the skin
and may affect the organs below the surface of the skin. The skin may appear white or black
and charred (MedlinePlus, 2014). The person may deny pain because the nerve endings in their
skin have been burned away (American Institute for Preventive Medicine, 2012). Third degree
burns require immediate medical treatment. If teachers suspect a child has a third degree burn,
they should immediately call 911. A third degree burn is pictured in the bottom right of Figure
3.20.65

                           Figure 3.20 - This image shows first, second, and third degree burns.66

Chemical burns can occur anytime a liquid or powder chemical comes into contact with skin or
mucous membranes that line the eyes, nose, or throat. Chemical burns may also occur if a
chemical is swallowed. These burns can cause serious injury and emergency services should be
contacted. If a person receives a chemical burn, the chemical should be removed from the skin

by using a gloved hand to brush it off and then wash the area with plenty of cool water.
Electrical burns can occur if a person has been using an electrical appliance and is exposed to
water or if an electrical short occurs while using the electrical appliance. Using faulty or frayed
cords on electrical appliances can result in electrical burns. Electrical burns are a serious injury.
Emergency medical services (EMS) should be immediately activated.

Never use oils such as butter or vegetable oil on any type of burn as this can cause further
injury. For first or second degree burns flush the area with plenty of cool (not ice cold) water for
about 15 minutes or until the pain decreases and cover with a clean, dry bandage. Using ice or
ice-cold water can cause frostbite (American Institute for Preventive Medicine, 2012). For major
burns remove any clothing that is not stuck to the skin, cover the burned area with a dry, clean
cloth, and seek emergency assistance. 67

Guidelines to Prevent Burns

     Install and regularly test smoke alarms.
     Practice fire drills. 68
     Train staff to use fire extinguishers.
     Teach children to stop, drop, and roll.69
     Never allow children to use electrical appliances unsupervised.
     Never use electrical appliances near water sources.
     Never use electrical appliances in which the cord appears to be damaged or frayed.
     Never pull a plug from the cord. Always remove a cord from an outlet by holding the

         base of the plug.
     Cover electrical outlets with childproof plugs. Never allow children to put anything

         inside an electrical outlet.
     Ensure stoves and other appliances are turned off when finished with them.
     Turn pot handles inward so that a person cannot accidentally bump a handle and spill

         hot liquids.
     Do not use space heaters and other personal heaters.
     Check to be sure the hot water heater is not set too high. To avoid scalds from hot tap

         water, hot water heaters should be set to 120 degrees or less (MedlinePlus, 2014).
     Keep chemicals, cleaning solutions, and matches and lighters securely locked and out of

         reach of children.70

Safe Sleeping

Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is identified when the death of a healthy infant occurs
suddenly and unexpectedly, and medical and forensic investigation findings (including an
autopsy) are inconclusive. SIDS is the leading cause of death in infants 1 to 12 months old, and
approximately 1,500 infants died of SIDS in 2013 (CDC, 2015). Because SIDS is diagnosed when
no other cause of death can be determined, possible causes of SIDS are regularly researched.
One leading hypothesis suggests that infants who die from SIDS have abnormalities in the area
of the brainstem responsible for regulating breathing (Weekes-Shackelford & Shackelford,
2005).71

This is a very important topic for early childhood educators as one study found that while data
suggests that only 7% of incidents of SIDS should occur while children are in child care, 20.4%
actually did.72

                                               Figure 3.21- A baby sleeping safely.73

Risk Factors for SIDS

Babies are at higher risk for SIDS if they:
     Sleep on their stomachs
     Sleep on soft surfaces, such as an adult mattress, couch, or chair or under soft coverings
     Sleep on or under soft or loose bedding
     Get too hot during sleep
     Are exposed to cigarette smoke in the womb or in their environment, such as at home,
         in the car, in the bedroom, or other areas
     Sleep in an adult bed with parents/caregivers, other children, or pets; this situation is
         especially dangerous if:
             o The adult smokes, has recently had alcohol, or is tired.

             o The baby sleeps with more than one bed-sharer.
             o The baby is younger than 11 to 14 weeks of age.

Important Facts About SIDS

     SIDS happens in families of all social, economic and ethnic groups.
     Most SIDS deaths occur between one and four months of age.
     SIDS occurs in boys more than girls.
     The death is sudden and unexpected, often occurring during sleep. In most cases, the

         baby seems healthy.
     Although it is not known exactly what causes SIDS, researchers know that it is not

         caused by suffocation, choking, spitting up, vomiting, or immunizations.
     SIDS is not contagious.74

Reducing the Risks

Although the sudden and unexpected death of an infant cannot be predicted or prevented,
research shows that certain infant care practices can help reduce the risk of a baby dying
suddenly and unexpectedly. Early childhood educators can help lower the risk of SUID for
infants less than one year of age by following these risk reduction guidelines.

Sleeping Position

The chance of an infant dying suddenly and unexpectedly in childcare is higher when a baby
first starts the transition from home to care. Research shows if a baby has been placed on
his/her back by the families, and the childcare provider places the baby to sleep on his/her
stomach, there is a higher risk of death in the first weeks of child care. One of the most
important things you can do to reduce the risk of sudden unexpected death is to place babies to
sleep on their backs.

Healthy babies do not choke when placed to sleep on their backs. By reflex, babies swallow or
cough up fluids to keep the airway clear. Since the windpipe (trachea) is positioned on top of
the esophagus, fluids are not likely to enter the airway. (See Figure 3.21)

       Figure 3.22 - Airway positioning when infants sleep on their backs (left) and on their stomachs (right)75

Babies who are able to roll back and forth between their back and tummy should be placed on
their backs for sleep and allowed to assume their sleep position of choice. When infants fall
asleep while playing on their tummies, move the baby to a crib onto his/her back to continue
sleeping.

Cribs, Sleep Surface and Bedding

Infants should sleep in a crib, bassinet, portable crib or play yard that conforms to the safety
standards of the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). The mattress should be firm,
fit tightly, and be covered with a tight fitted sheet. Babies should not sleep on adult beds,
waterbeds, couches, beanbag chairs or other soft surfaces. Do not use fluffy blankets or
comforters under the baby, or put the baby to sleep on a sheepskin, pillow or other
soft materials. Keep stuffed toys, bumper pads, loose bedding and other toys and soft objects
out of the crib.

Temperature

Babies should be kept warm, not hot. Babies should be dressed with only one additional layer
than you are wearing for warmth. In areas where babies sleep, keep the temperature so that it
feels comfortable to you. If needed, infants can be dressed in blanket sleepers for warmth. This
ensures that the baby's head will be uncovered during sleep.

Smoke Free

No one should smoke around children. California Child Care Licensing Regulations prohibit
smoking in childcare centers. Smoke in the infants' environment is a major risk factor for SIDS.

Pacifiers

If the family provides a pacifier, it should be offered to the infant. If a pacifier is used, it should
never be attached to a string. Infants should not be forced to take a pacifier and if it falls out
during sleep it doesn't need to be given back to the infant.

Breastfeeding has many health benefits for mother and baby, including a reduced risk of SIDS.
Childcare programs should be breastfeeding friendly. 76

                   Other Things Caregivers and Teachers Can Do To Reduce the
                   Risks

                        Families should be asked about their infant's usual sleep position.
                           Teachers should discuss the recommended back sleeping position with
                           families and share the program's policy is to place infants on their back
                           to sleep.

                        Policies should be developed to address sleep position. If a family
                           insists their baby sleep on the side or stomach, they should be referred
                           to their health care provider for further information. Programs should
                           request that a medical care professional provide a signed statement for
                           infants who have a medical reason for not being placed to sleep on their
                           backs.

                        Teachers can attend education programs to learn more about sudden
                           unexpected infant deaths. Training and education for childcare
                           providers may be available through local public health Resource and
                           Referral agency or Public Health Department at no cost.

                        Programs should be aware of resources for additional support and
                           make them available to families as appropriate. It is vital to stay up-to-
                           date with the latest recommendations for safe infant sleep.

                        For education and informational materials, contact the California SIDS
                           Program: 800-369-SIDS (7437).77

Indoor Falls

While most falls occur outdoors, and this topic is addressed in Chapter 4, they can also happen
indoors. Teachers (and adults at home) can prevent falls indoors by

     Installing stops on windows that prevent them from being opened more than four
         inches or install window guards on lower parts of windows. Removing furniture from
         near windows. Screens should not be relied on to prevent a fall.

     Installing safety gates at the top and bottom of staircases. Installing lower rails on stairs
         that children can reach and use. Making sure the surface of the stairs stays clear.

     Using safety straps and harnesses on baby equipment and furniture. Children should not
         be left unattended in high chairs or on changing tables.

     Baby walkers should not be used (licensing prohibits these).

     Teaching children to walk where surfaces may be slick. Preventing these surfaces as
         much as possible, such as wiping up spills.78

Indoor Water Safety

Small children are top-heavy; they tend to fall forward and headfirst when they lose their
balance. They do not have enough muscle development in their upper body to pull themselves
up out of a bucket, toilet or bathtub, or for that matter, any body of water. Even a bucket
containing only a few inches of water can be dangerous for a small child.

It's important that early childhood educators follow the safety practices outlined in Chapter 4
for water safety both indoors and outdoors, keep children under active supervision, and be very
aware of containers of water.79

                Pause to Reflect

                   What are your top five tips for protecting children from safety hazards
                   indoors? These can relate to toy safety, safe art materials, preventing
                   poisoning, preventing choking, preventing burns, safe sleep, protecting from
                   indoor falls, water safety, or any other hazard/area of safety.

Summary

Teachers need to create safe indoor environments in which children engage, explore, and
interact. By recognizing that behavior is communication, they can help children use safe
behaviors to get their needs met. Teachers should choose age-appropriate toys and materials
that are well constructed, hazard-free, and nontoxic. With adult support, children can navigate
media and technology safely. Teachers must work to prevent injuries that may occur indoors,
such as choking, poisoning, burns, drowning, and falls. And teachers that care for infants must

Introduction

There are countless benefits to outdoor play for children. Research shows that children who
play outside regularly have healthier body weight, improved vision, and immune function,
reduced stress, better sleep, improved motor skills. There are substantial immediate and long-
term health consequences for children who aren't able to play outside or get enough physical
activity such as increased obesity and chronic diseases. The research also shows us that kids
who play outdoors have increased school readiness because outdoor play contributes to better
social skills such as cooperation, increased attention span, improved school attendance, and
improved brain development and cognition. Physical activity plays a critical role in supporting
health and learning.

Being aware of the benefits of outdoor learning as they relate to overall health and school
readiness is important so that teachers remember that the outdoor environment is an essential
extension of the indoor environment. All the learning that takes place indoors can also take
place outdoors. Anything programs do indoors can have an outdoor component.

Consider for just a moment how a program can increase the benefits of outdoor play while also
minimizing injury. Reducing risk does not mean limiting play equipment or enforcing rules that
restrict children's ability to move and explore their environment. An ideal playground is one

91 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
that encourages children to challenge themselves while also preventing little risk for injury. In
fact, studies show that playgrounds that are high challenge but low risk are the very best at
promoting the goals of outdoor learning. Children get more physical activity, develop better
physical, cognitive, social skills and are happier and more resilient when their outdoor play
environment is challenging and safe.1

                                  Figure 4.1 - Safe outdoor play is very beneficial to children.2

Playground Safety

When designing an outdoor space for children, it is critical to reduce the risk of injury while
increasing the challenge. The first step is knowing what aspects of the actual learning
environment are most likely to cause injuries.

Falls from, into, or on equipment are the most common cause of injury. Falls are most likely to
occur on equipment that is not appropriate for the age and development of the children. And
injuries are most likely to occur when the surface on which a child falls is not sufficiently shock-
absorbing. The equipment pieces that are associated with the most injuries include climbers,
such as monkey bars or overhead ladders, swings, and slides. About 85% of all playground
injuries occur on these three pieces of equipment. And the most common cause of death on
playgrounds is strangulation, that's an injury that chokes the child.

It's important to understand that injuries are not accidents. Most injuries are predictable and
preventable. Programs can take steps to prevent serious injuries by

     choosing developmentally-appropriate play equipment to ensure children do not fall
         from a high level and the challenges on the playground are matched with their ability.

     installing proper surfacing to minimize the severity of an injury if a child does fall.
     providing intentional and active supervision by maintaining close proximity to children,

         especially in places that are high risk for injury from a fall such as the slide or monkey
         bars).
     encouraging safe behaviors by introducing safety habits to children.

Reinforcing these safe behaviors in an early care and education program provides lifelong
lessons about safety and injury prevention. As consultants, you can work with your program
and teachers to predict and prevent many injuries and allow children to play.

Designing for Safety

Safe outdoor play space starts with selecting and correctly installing safe and age and
developmentally-appropriate structures. The play space design should not be a hazard and
should separate active play areas such as swings and slides from quieter activities such as the
sandbox, nature-based learning, and dramatic play areas. Only equipment that is manufactured
for public playgrounds or child care facilities should be used. So, home playground equipment
like Little Tykes brand or plastic sets that home use at local stores are not appropriate.

To assess whether equipment is safe, you should look for these labels. Equipment must meet
Consumer Product Safety Commission or CPSC recommendations and the American Society for
Testing and Materials, or ASTM, standards. These are two organizations that set standards for
design and manufacturing that ensure the equipment is safe. These logos can give you some
peace of mind and knowing the equipment has been developed with the highest safety
standards. And of course, it also needs to be installed according to the manufacturer's
instructions and properly maintained.

                  Figure 4.2 - Logos that denote playground equipment complies with safety standards.

Once playgrounds are installed, they should be inspected at least once each year by an
inspector or local regulatory agency and whenever changes are made to the equipment or the
intended users change. The inspection will identify hazards, check for proper equipment,
installation, and maintenance, and provide a report that identifies and prioritize corrective
actions to take to address any concerns. Together with a program, the consultant can review,
discuss, and make a plan to address the inspector's concerns that are immediate right now as
well as how to plan to prevent any issues in the future. 3

Importance of Impact Absorbing Surfaces

The playground surface is the material that lies under and around playground equipment. The
surface material under the equipment should be able to cushion a child's fall. Injuries from falls
occur not because children fall, but because the surface on which they fall isn't able to
adequately absorb the impact of their fall. Proper surfacing is prevention of predictable injuries.

There isn't a single best surface to use on playgrounds. The best surface is the one that:
 the program can afford
 the program is able to appropriately maintain
 meets the needs of the children based on their age
 is workable given the climate where the program is located
 consistently meets the standard for depth that is based on the height of the equipment on

    the playground.

Surfaces such as asphalt, cement, dirt, and grass, however, are not acceptable surfaces. Grass is
not an impact-absorbing surface. If a child falls onto grass, they are far more likely to get hurt
than they are if they fall onto an appropriate impact absorbing surface.
There are two types of appropriate, impact-absorbing playground surfaces, unitary and loose-
fill. Let's look at each.

Unitary material such as tiles, mats, or a rubber surface is engineered to be sufficiently shock-
absorbing.4 There are many options. If a program wants to use a unitary surface, it's important
that one is chosen for the appropriate height of equipment and that the manufacturer's
instructions are followed closely (and some require professional installation).5 Table 4.1 shows
some examples of unitary surfacing materials.

                   Table 4.1 - Examples of Unitary Surfacing Materials

Loose fill surfaces, such as sand, pea gravel, shredded rubber, or engineered wood fiber and
mulch, when installed correctly, will also safely cushion a child's fall.8 Table 4.2 shows examples
of each of these and Table 4.3 details the depth and protection provided by these materials.

Programs need to consider how data can help inform a decision about which surfacing is best
for a particular playground. It's important to think about who will be using the space and for
what.

     Some surfaces like pea gravel are not an appropriate choice for infants and toddlers
         who might put it in their mouths since it can be a choking hazard.

     Few of the loose fill materials are accessible for wheelchair users without significant
         accommodation, such as a special wheelchair. Engineered wood fibers provide a little
         bit better access, but solid or unitary materials are best if you have children on the
         playground with mobility impairments.

     Will the staff be able to maintain the playground surface? All loose fill surfacing required
         daily raking to maintain depth.

     Consider how tall the equipment is because sand and pea gravel can't be used at fall
         heights that are greater than four to five feet.

     The climate is also an important consideration. Factor in temperature, wind conditions,
         and precipitation, because they all impact the surface materials you choose.
             o Sand can harden when frozen.
             o Artificial surfaces can get really hot, in fact, hot enough to cause burns when
                  they're exposed to direct sunlight.
             o Loose fill material, with the exception of rubber mulch, compress about 25
                  percent over time due to use and weathering.

The protective surfacing has to extend for the full use zone, which is the area under and around
equipment where children might fall as a playground surface can't protect a child who falls onto
a hard object such as a tricycle instead of onto the protective surface.14

                Pause to Reflect

                   Think of a local playground or playgrounds you played on as a child? What
                   type of surface was underneath the equipment? Was it well maintained? Did it
                   protect children from injuries due to falls? Did the materials used caused any
                   other hazards (such as overflowing sand that caused slipping or a surface that
                   got too hot to safely touch skin)?

Use Zones

The use zone is the space that encompasses the activity/piece of equipment and the area
around that activity/equipment that will keep children from colliding and provides enough
separation between different pieces of equipment and types of play. It is also sometimes
referred to as a fall zone. The use zone should be free of movable hazards like trikes and toys,
rocks, and groups of children who might cluster and fixed hazards such benches.
Use zones vary depending on the size and the type of equipment. For most stationary
equipment on the playground, the use zone should extend six feet in all directions (see Figure
4.3).15 Equipment that is taller than 30 inches should be at least nine feet from other pieces of
equipment. And the use zone for swings should extend from the front and rear of the swings
twice the height of the swing (see Figure 4.4). 16

Age Appropriateness

Age-appropriate equipment provides children with opportunities to safely practice gross motor
skills without putting them at risk for unnecessary injury. This takes us back to the notion of
creating playgrounds that are high challenge but low risk.

Children are less likely to fall when equipment is only used with the age group for which it is
designed. Equipment that is made according to the ASPM or CPSC standards will clearly be
marked with the age group for which it is intended. And that's usually either 6 to 23 months of
age, 2 to 5 years of age, and 5 to 12 years of age. So, any equipment that is marked for 5 to 12
years of age is not acceptable on a preschool playground.19

Hazards on Playgrounds

Gaps in equipment such as the space between the platform and the top of the slide or hooks
can entangle clothing or entrap body parts, causing trips, falls, or strangulation. Head
entrapment into gaps that are large enough for a child's body to pass through (bigger than 3.5
inches) but too small for a child's head to pass through (smaller than 9 inches) can injure a
child's neck or choke a child.

Equipment that spins and moves such as steering wheels or springs on rockers can pinch, cut,
or crush fingers or other body parts. So, you want to make sure that any equipment that spins
or moves is not accessible for little fingers. Broken parts or improperly installed equipment can
cause injuries if the equipment tips over, breaks during use, or has sharp or loose parts that can
cut or entrap a child. And railings to prevent falls can break if bolts are loose. See Table 4.5 for
examples of dangers to watch for on playgrounds.

Pause to Reflect

Think of that playground again. Did it offer adequate use zones around the
different pieces of equipment? Was the equipment used by the appropriate
age groups (or did older children play on equipment designed for young
children or vice versa)? How well did it protect children from the hazards
mentioned (trips and falls, entrapment, impalement, entanglement, or
strangulation)?

Riding Toys

All children older than age 1 should wear properly fitted and approved helmets when they are
riding toys with wheels or using any wheeled equipment. Helmets should be removed as soon
as children stop riding the wheeled toys or using the equipment. Approved helmets should
meet the standards of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)23 and should pass
the three-point check for a proper fit as shown in Table 4.6.

           Table 4.6 - Three Point Check for Proper Helmet Fit

                   Three Point Check for Proper Helmet Fit

1. Helmet is level on the head, 1 to 2

finger-widths about eyebrows.

2. Straps are even and create a "Y"

under each ear with straps laying flat

against the head.

3. Chinstrap is buckled loose enough to

fit one finger between the buckle and

chin, but tight enough the opening

the mouth should pull the helmet

downward.                                Figure 4.5 - Helmet positioning is important.24

"Helmets provide the best protection against head and brain injury, whether [the] child is riding
a bike, scooter or skateboard, or using skates. However, a helmet will only protect when it fits
well."25

Keeping Children Safe by Monitoring

Early care and education programs need to develop a routine inspection process to identify and

misuse, from weather conditions. So, even if a program has correctly installed safe and age and
developmentally-appropriate equipment, it still requires regular inspections and maintenance.
The outdoor space, including the playground, should be inspected using checklists such as the
ones in Appendix E. It should be inspected upon initial installment.

                                  Figure 4.6 - Checklists are used to monitor outdoor safety.26

It should also be inspected on a daily basis to identify hazards that may have appeared
suddenly. It will also alert staff to any pieces of equipment that may have broken or become
worn since last being used. Some general items to include in a daily inspection may include
ensuring that

     any broken equipment is removed from children's access or repaired
     the playground is free from

A monthly inspection would include:
     checking for loose or missing hardware, checking
     inspecting equipment for broken parts, splinters, rust, or sharp edges,
     replenishing loose fill surfacing if needed, and
     examining vegetation for hazardous or poisonous plants.

There has to be a system in place to conduct inspections and then respond in a timely manner
when something is identified. It's too common for someone to notice a hazard but to forget to
report it or for somebody to report a hazard but then people forget to follow through to correct
it. Many checklists include space for writing down a corrective action plan. Once the hazard is
identified the person completing the form will write down what steps should be taken to
correct the problem, including identifying who will fix it, what needs to be done, and when it
will be done. The process should also include a system to check that the problem was fixed in a
timely manner.

A record of any injury reported to have occurred on the playground should also trigger an
additional inspection of that piece of equipment (this was previously discussed in Chapter 2).
This will help identify potential hazards or dangerous design features that should be corrected.

Active Supervision

The most important tool for reducing playground injuries is active supervision (which is also
addressed in Chapter 2). Early childhood educator should be actively supervising children at all
times. Active supervision is a specific child supervision technique that requires focused
attention and intentional observation of children at all times. Active supervision includes six
basic strategies.

    1. Plan and set up the environment to ensure clear sightlines and easy access to the
         children and the equipment at all times while they're out on the playground.

    2. Teachers are positioned among the children in their care, changing positions as needed
         so that they can keep an eye on the children.

    3. They are communicating about which children they're observing and any issues that
         divert their attention so that they know other teachers are taking up the slack and
         watching the other children.

    4. Teachers are watching, counting, and listening to children at all times
    5. They also use their knowledge of each child's development and abilities to anticipate

         what a child might do or to anticipate areas on the playground where a child might need
         some additional support.
    6. And if needed, they get involved and they redirect children when necessary or they
         provide that additional support if needed.27

  Figure 4.7: If this teacher is engaging with these two children, she would communicate this so the other teachers
                         could make sure they are effectively supervising the other children outside.

Other Safety Considerations for the Outdoors

In addition to designing and maintaining a safe playground for children, you also need to
monitor environmental factors such as weather, the sun, insects, animals, poisonous plants or
materials, and water. 28

Sun Safety

Children need protection from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays whenever they're
outdoors. Shade and sunscreen protect children from sun exposure and can help to reduce the
risk of some skin cancers.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), even a few major sunburns
can increase the risk of skin cancer later in life. The American Academy of Pediatrics
recommends the following guidelines regarding sun safety and the selection and application of
sunscreen:

     If possible, use play areas that provide some shade to help children stay cool.
     Protect infants under 6 months from direct sunlight by keeping them in a shady spot

         under a tree, umbrella, or stroller canopy.
     Limit children's sun exposure between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. when UV rays are the

         strongest.
     Encourage families to dress children in cool clothing such as lightweight cotton pants

         and long-sleeved shirts. A hat will protect their face, ears, and the back of their neck.
     Obtain written permission from children's parents/ guardians to use a sunscreen with a

         SPF (sun protection factor) of at least 15. That is "broad-spectrum" sunscreen to screen
         out both UVB and UVA rays.
     Apply sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going outdoors so it is absorbed into the
         skin. It will need to be reapplied every two hours if children are outside for more than
         an hour, and more frequently if they are playing in water.

     Each child should have their own labeled bottle of sunscreen.
     For children older than 6 months, apply sunscreen to all exposed areas, including

         children's ears if they are wearing a cap instead of a hat.
     For children younger than 6 months, use sunscreen on small areas of the body, such as

         the face and the backs of the hands if protective clothing and shade are not available.

                              Figure 4.9 - Shade over climbing structures helps protect children

                              from the sun and the heat when the temperature is high.

Hydration

Toddlers and preschool children cannot regulate their body temperatures well and need
additional water when the weather is hot. Provide regularly scheduled water breaks to
encourage all children to drink during active play, even if they don't feel thirsty. Fluoridated
water (bottled or from the faucet) can reduce the risk of early childhood caries, and is the best
drink choice for young children in between meals. Each child should be provided their own cup
or bottle. Staff may offer additional breast milk or formula to infants as water is not
recommended, especially for infants younger than six months of age.29

Weather

Teachers should be aware of local weather conditions and monitor the temperature, humidity,
and air quality. To stay up to date on current conditions:

     Check the Air Quality Index and limit play outdoors when there is poor air quality.
     Check the forecast for the UV Index to limit exposure to the sun on days when the Index

         is high.
     Check current and forecasted weather to be aware of the temperature and other

         weather conditions that may make the outdoors hazardous to children's health.

Protecting Children from Heat-Related Illness

Children's bodies heat up three to five times faster than adults.31 It's important to help children
during hot weather. Here are some tips from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

     Air conditioning should be provided when temperatures are high.
     Children need to stay hydrated.
     Children sweat less than adults, so they should wear light clothes in no more than one

         layer.
     Extra downtime to rest and recover from the heat should be provided
     Activities that will help children cool off (such as water play) can be planned.32

Protecting Children from Cold Weather

There is no set time that is safe for children to play safely when the weather is cold. Teachers
will have to use their best judgment. Use the chart in Figure 4.8 to ensure it is safe to go
outside.

When playing outdoors in the cold it is important for children to bundle up. They are at greater
risk for frostbite than adults. They should dress in layers. Wet clothing should be removed.
Scarves must be tucked into coats to avoid becoming a strangulation hazard. Gloves/mittens
and socks must stay dry to protect fingers and toes from frostbite. Children should come in
periodically to warm up. And even though it's cold, sunscreen and hydration are still
important.33

Protecting Children from Insects

Children and adults can be protected from insect bites by
     Checking for and removing insect nests and spiders under slides, in bushes and in the
         ground.
     Making sure there is no standing water near play areas for mosquitoes to lay their eggs.
     Checking for ticks after outdoor play. The Center for Disease Control provides
         instructions about Tick Removal (see Figure 4.10).
     Consulting with the local health department, Health Services Advisory Committee, or a
         child care health consultant about whether to use insect repellent when local insects are
         likely to carry diseases.

Figure 4.10 - Remove a tick by gripping it with tweezers as close to the skin as possible, pulling upward with steady
pressure. After removal, clean the bite area and your hands with sanitizer or soap and water and dispose of the tick

   by putting it in alcohol, placing it in a sealed bag/container, wrapping it tightly in tape, or flushing it down the
                                                                  toilet.34

Water Safety

Drowning is a major cause of death among children under 5 years of age in California. Water
safety presents a particular challenge to child care providers. Most drownings in this age group
occur in home swimming pools. Water-filled bathtubs, wading pools, toilets, buckets or other
containers are also places where top-heavy young children can drown. Water safety presents
its own set of challenges to the child care environment.

107 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
Children between the ages of 1 and 4 years are at greatest risk from drowning. These children
are just learning to walk and explore. They excel at getting out from under the watchful eye of
the provider.
Wading in bodies of freshwater may carry the additional risk of injury from cuts, puncture
wounds and infections. Standing bodies of water such as swimming pools, wading pools and
hot tubs also have the potential for spreading disease, so they are not recommended for use
with young children. Instead, the use of sprinklers is recommended.

                                         Figure 4.11 Children love playing in the water.35

Reducing the Risk of Drowning

Reduce water hazards and prevent access to water
     Safety precautions must be taken to keep any water in the child care environment as
         risk-free as possible.
     Any body of water poses a threat and young children can drown in as little as one inch
         of water,
     The indoor and outdoor environments should be thoroughly screened to detect hazards
         that may lead to the risk of drowning

Promote safe behaviors
     Because children move quickly, are curious and do not understand their physical
         abilities, they must be watched carefully around even small bodies of water.
     The majority of drownings occur within a surprisingly short period of time.

     Never, ever, leave a child alone, even for a moment, when there is a body of water in
         the environment.

     When near water, always reinforce safety for the children.
     Plan water play when children are the least tired and most alert.
     Teach children safe practices for swimming and playing in the water.
     Have a telephone within easy reach at all times.

Learn proper response if there is a water emergency and act immediately
     Pull the child from the water and place the child on his/her back.
     Check for breathing, and clear mouth and nose of any obstructions.
     Get another adult to call for emergency help.
     Begin rescue breathing or CPR as needed until the child is revived or help arrives.

Preventing Drownings

     Never leave a child alone in or near any body of water (tub, wading pools, shower, pool,
         water table or even a bucket).

     Always provide careful, direct and constant supervision of young children if there is a
         body of water present in the environment.

     Never expect swimming instruction to eliminate the risk of drowning in children.
     Supervise children in the water even if they are wearing flotation devices. These devices

         are not substitutes for constant supervision.
     Any hazard should be enclosed with a fence that is at least five feet tall and not easy to

         climb. A door or sliding glass door is not a safe substitute for a fence.
     Gates should have locks that are at least 55 inches high and self-closing. Keep gate keys

         in a safe place away from children.
     Never leave pool covers partially in place because children can become trapped beneath

         them. Pool covers are not a substitute for fencing.
     Keep chairs, tables and climbing equipment away from pool fences to prevent children

         from climbing over the fence into the pool.
     Learn CPR and keep rescue equipment at poolside, including a life preserver, shepherd's

         crook and cordless telephone to call 9-1-1.
     If a portable wading pool is used in child care (although it is not recommended), it

         should be filled with water, used immediately, drained and put away as soon as children
         leave the pool.
     Never leave infants or children unattended around five-gallon buckets containing even a
         small amount of liquid. Empty buckets when not in use.
     Children with seizure disorders are particularly vulnerable to drowning. Know your
         children's medical history.
     Teach children water safety behaviors:

             o Do not run, push or play around swimming areas.
             o Do not swim with anything in your mouth.
             o Do not swim in very cold water because it increases the risk of drowning.

109 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
             o Look out for other children who might be in danger.
             o Do not go near a pool unless supervised.
             o Do not scream for help unless you mean it.
             o Do not roughhouse in the water.36

Preventing Poisoning Outdoors

This topic was covered in Chapter 3, but it is important to note that poisonous materials are
also found outdoors, including some of the plants in Table 3.8.

Storing Toys, Materials, and Equipment Safely

In order to protect toys, materials, and equipment from the elements, they should be safely
stored when not in use. Keep storage areas clean and dry to prevent mold and infestations of
insects, spider, rodents, or other pests.

Pedestrian Safety

Each year for more than a decade, more than 700 children have died from injuries sustained
while walking, over 500 of these in traffic. Although the fatality rate has declined somewhat
during this period, it could be attributable to improvements in pre-hospital and emergency
medical care or to a decline in walking as a mode of transportation. As we want children (and
their educators and families) to get out and walk to for both health reasons and for
opportunities to explore and learn about their communities, we must make sure that they have
a safe environment in which to do so. Children under 10 should always have adult
supervision.37

Teaching Children about Pedestrian Safety

Before going on a walk, teachers should talk to children about the safety practices that they will
be using (see Table 4.7). Children need close adult supervision and proximity while walking
because they may do the unexpected (like suddenly dart off the sidewalk).39

                       Table 4.7 - Safety Practices While Walking40,41

                                      Safety Practices While Walking42,43
 Always walk on the sidewalk (if there is one).
 If there is no sidewalk, walk facing traffic.
 Be safe and be seen (bright clothing during the day, lights and reflectors at night).
 Walk safely. Don't run, don't push or roughhouse. Be aware and don't let toys distract you.
 Watch for cars pulling in and out of driveways. Make sure drivers make eye contact with you.

When it is time to cross the street, show children a good place to safely cross the street.
Explain how to safely cross the street (see Figure 4.13). If there is a button at the crosswalk,
have them push it.44

Motor Vehicle Safety

Motor vehicle injuries are a leading cause of death among children in the United States. But
many of these deaths can be prevented.

     In the United States, 723 children ages 12 years and younger died as occupants in motor
         vehicle crashes during 2016, and more than 128,000 were injured in 2016.

     One CDC study found that, in one year, more than 618,000 children ages 0-12 rode in
         vehicles without the use of a child safety seat or booster seat or a seat belt at least
         some of the time.

     Of the children ages 12 years and younger who died in a crash in 2016 (for which
         restraint use was known), 35% were not buckled up.46

Safely Transporting Children

Any licensed driver transporting children should be trained in safety practices and if alone, have
CPR and first aid training. They should have a safe driving record and their license should
authorize them to drive the type of vehicle being driven.47

                     Figure 4.14 - Drivers must be licensed, trained, and have a clean driving record.48

The interior of vehicles used to transport children for field trips and out-of-program activities
should be maintained at a temperature comfortable for children. All vehicles should be locked
when not in use, headcounts of children should be taken before and after transporting to
prevent a child from being left in a vehicle, and children should never be left in a vehicle
unattended.49

                Hot Car Warning!

                   "Never leave children in a car or in another closed motor vehicle. The
                   temperature inside the car can quickly become much higher than the outside
                   temperature--a car can heat up about 19 degrees in as little as 10 minutes
                   and continue rising to temperatures that cause death." 50

Passenger Safety in Motor Vehicles

When children are driven in a motor vehicle other than a bus, all children should be transported
only if they are restrained in a developmentally appropriate car safety seat, booster seat, seat
belt, or harness that is suited to the child's weight and age in accordance with state and federal
laws and regulations. The child should be securely fastened, according to the manufacturer's
instructions. The child passenger restraint system should meet the federal motor vehicle safety
standards and carry notice of compliance. Child passenger restraint systems should be installed
and used in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions and should be secured in back
seats only.

Car safety seats should be replaced if they have been recalled, are past the manufacturer's
"date of use" expiration date, or have been involved in a crash that meets the U.S. Department
of Transportation crash severity criteria or the manufacturer's criteria for replacement of seats
after a crash.51

Buckling children in age- and size-appropriate car seats, booster seats, and seat belts reduces
the risk of serious and fatal injuries:

     Car seat use reduces the risk of injury in a crash by 71-82% for children when compared
         to seat belt use alone.

     Booster seat use reduces the risk for serious injury by 45% for children aged 4-8 years
         when compared with seat belt use alone.

     For older children and adults, seat belt use reduces the risk of death and serious injury
         by approximately half.52

Tips for Safe Field Trips

Early care and education programs can be enriched through carefully planned field trips. It is
important that the destination be appropriate for the age and developmental level of each child
that will be attending. Any special arrangements needed to make sure that all children can
safely be included should be made ahead of time.

All staff and background-checked volunteers that will be attending should be made familiar
with the travel plans, the field trip location, rules, and their responsibilities. The children should
also be prepared for the trip. Teachers can review and practice safety precautions and
emergency procedures.

Families should be made aware of the field trip and provide consent for their child to attend.
Emergency information for every child should be kept with staff off-site at all times. An
accurate list of all children in attendance must be kept as well (at the field trip destination and
at the school/center).

chosen regrouping location and checkpoints. Information is also provided in Chapter 6 about
preventing lost children on field trips.54

Summary

Safe, outdoor play is vital to children's health and well-being. Environments that are well
designed, with age appropriate, hazard-free equipment, impact absorbing surfaces, and use
zones around equipment will protect children from many injuries. Supervising children and
actively monitoring the outdoor space are also key to preventing injuries. Having knowledge
about the weather, implementing sun safety practices, protecting children from insects,
following safe practices around water play, and storing toys safely are also important for
children's safety. When going off site (and during drop off and pick up times), it's important to

Introduction

An emergency is a situation that poses an immediate risk to health, life, property, or
environment. Most emergencies require urgent intervention to prevent a worsening of the
situation. Some emergencies will be obvious (such as natural disasters), but others will require
early childhood educators to decide if it truly is an emergency.1

Once an emergency has been identified, it's important to know what to do. This chapter
introduces different first aid and emergency medical responses, the phases of a disaster, and
more information about a few different types of emergencies.

Basic First Aid

"Minor accidents and unintentional childhood injuries are not unusual in the child care setting.
Even with careful supervision, children frequently sustain scrapes, bruises, cuts, bites, and falls
in the normal course of their day. Less frequently, medical emergencies...may require
immediate intervention and treatment."2

                   First Aid Kits

                       Here is a recommended list of supplies for the first aid kit (modified from
                       the Emergency First Aid Guidelines for California Schools):

Minor Cuts and Scrapes

Before performing first aid for minor cuts and scrapes, early childhood educators should wash
their hands and apply gloves. The cut or scrape should then be washed with cool water. The
surrounding area can be washed with soap, but soap should not get into the wound. The cool
water will wash away any debris that may be in the wound and will help blood vessels
to constrict (become narrower), which helps to stop bleeding. Once the area is clean and the
blood has decreased, place gentle pressure on the wound with a clean and sterile gauze pad. If
the first gauze saturates with blood, add additional gauze pads. Gauze pads should not be
removed, as this could cause any clots that have begun to form to be removed and bleeding to
continue. When the wound has stopped bleeding, the cut or scrape can be covered by a clean
bandage. Be sure to document the injury and communicate what happened with families.4,5

Burns

The treatment of burns depends on the type of burn (refer back to Figure 3.20). The first step
for any burn is to remove the source of heat. For minor burns that are limited to a small area, a
clean cool towel or cloth can be applied to the skin or the skin can be flushed with cool water.
Do not use ice. A clean, dry sterile piece of gauze can then be taped over the area when the
burn is cooled and is only first degree. Ointments, grease, and oils should never be put on a
burn. And blisters should not be broken. Children with second degree burns should be referred

for medical care. Emergency care must be sought (call 911) any time a child receives a third
degree burn. 7,8

Broken Bones

If a child breaks a bone, it will require medical treatment. The child should be comforted and
not be moved any more than necessary. Any bleeding should be stopped (apply pressure with a
sterile bandage or clean cloth), the area should be immobilized, and the family should be
contacted to seek medical care. If the child is not conscious, there is heavy bleeding, the bone
has pierced the skin, or the break is suspected in the back, neck, or head, emergency medical
care should be sought.9

Head Injuries

Most trauma to the head is minor and will not require first aid. But trauma that is associated
with symptoms of a concussion (such as nausea, unsteadiness, headaches) needs to be
evaluated by a medical professional. More serious injury indicated by the following warrant
calling for emergency medical care (911). Keep the child skill, stop any bleeding, and monitor
vital signs (and start CPR if needed).

Symptoms of severe head injury:
     Severe bleeding or bleeding from nose or ears
     Change in consciousness
     Not breathing
     Confusion or slow response to questions
     Dizziness, balance problems, or trouble walking
     Unequal pupil size
     Slurred speech
     Seizures
     Persistent crying
     Refusing to eat

Injuries to the Mouth

Injuries to the head, face, and mouth are common in young children. Even when families do
their best to keep children safe, oral injuries can happen. Most oral injuries happen when young
children are learning to walk. The top front teeth are injured most often.

If the child's tongue or lip is injured, the area should be cleaned. Ice wrapped in a clean cloth
can be placed on the area to reduce swelling. If the bleeding doesn't stop after 30 minutes,
medical attention should be sought.

If a child has an injury to a tooth, families should contact a dentist for advice. Teeth that are
knocked out should not be put back in the mouth.12

Injuries to the Nose and Nosebleeds

Nosebleeds are not unusual and not usually a health concern. If a child gets a nosebleed they
should be reassured. They should sit upright and gently pinch the soft part of the nose for
about 10 minutes (or the bleeding may start back up). Discourage nose-blowing, picking, or
rubbing.13

If a nosebleed is heavy and won't stop after 30 minutes, the child feels lightheaded, or the
nosebleed is the result of an injury that may indicate a broken nose emergency medical care
should be sought.14

                Pause to Reflect

                   What experiences do you have with first aid (giving or receiving)? How might
                   this affect how you respond to a child getting injured?

                   In addition to providing treatment for the injury, what else might an injured
                   child need from a caring adult to feel emotionally safe?

Poisoning

If a child ingests a potentially poisonous substance, Poison Control should be contacted at 1-
800-222-1222. They will advise about the effects of the substance that has been ingested and
what the proper response should be.

Bites

How you will respond to bites depends on what bit (or stung) the child and how severe the
injury is. Table 5.1 provides more information.

Lifesaving First Aid

Sometimes children will experience incidents or injuries that are a threat to their life. It's
important that early childhood educators know how to respond in these situations. It is
recommended that every person working with children become certified in emergency
response through an agency such as the Red Cross (licensing requires one staff member that is
certified to be on-site at all times).

Situations such as the following are considered medical emergencies and early childhood
educators should contact emergency medical services (911) if a child exhibits these symptoms:

     Bleeding that will not stop
     Breathing problems (difficulty breathing, shortness of breath)
     Change in mental status (such as unusual behavior, confusion, difficulty arousing)
     Choking
     Coughing up or vomiting blood
     Loss of consciousness
     Sudden dizziness, weakness, or change in vision
     Swallowing a poisonous substance25

While waiting for paramedics, early childhood educators will need to follow appropriate
lifesaving procedures. Three of those responses are introduced below (but are not a substitute
for becoming CPR and First Aid certified)

               These instructions are not intended to be a substitute for
                           becoming certified in first aid and CPR.

Responding to Severe Bleeding

Bleeding from most injuries can be stopped by applying direct pressure to the injury. This keeps
from cutting off the blood supply to the affected limb. This procedure was introduced earlier in
the section on responding to minor cuts and scrapes.26

                           cloth or your gloved hand, maintaining pressure until bleeding stops.27

Responding to Choking

If a child is not able to breathe, not able to cry, talk, or make noise, turning blue, or grabbing at
their throat, or coughing and gagging the early childhood educator should call 911. If they are
able to cough or gag (which indicates they are breathing), no further response is needed. If they
are not breathing, an immediate response is important.28 The response to choking is called the
Heimlich maneuver and varies based on the age of the person that is choking. If the child loses
consciousness at any point start CPR (which is covered in the next section).

Responding to a Choking Infant (under 1 year of age)

    1. Lay the infant face down, along your forearm. Use your thigh or lap for support. Hold
         the infant's chest in your hand and jaw with your fingers. Point the infant's head
         downward, lower than the body.

    2. Give up to 5 quick, forceful blows between the infant's shoulder blades. Use the heel of
         your free hand.29

    3. If the object is not dislodged, turn the infant face up. Use your thigh or lap for support.
         Support the head.

    4. Place 2 fingers on the middle of his breastbone just below the nipples.
    5. Give up to 5 quick thrusts down, compressing the chest 1/3 to 1/2 the depth of the

         chest.
    6. Continue this series of 5 back blows and 5 chest thrusts until the object is dislodged or

         the infant loses consciousness.30

Responding to Children Who are Not Breathing or Without a
Pulse

CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when a
child's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after drowning, suffocation,
choking, or an injury. CPR involves:

     Rescue breathing, which provides oxygen to a child's lungs
     Chest compressions, which keep the child's blood circulating

Permanent brain damage or death can occur within minutes if a child's blood flow stops.
Therefore, you must continue CPR until the child's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained
medical help arrives.

CPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The newest techniques
emphasize compression over rescue breathing and airway management, reversing a long-
standing practice. The procedures described here are NOT a substitute for CPR training.

Machines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places
and can be purchased for homes and early care and education programs. These machines have
pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They use computers
to automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is
needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm. When using an AED, follow the instructions
exactly.

CPR for Infants (under 1 year of age)

    1. Check for responsiveness. Shake or tap the infant gently. See if the infant moves or
         makes a noise. Shout, "Are you OK?"

    2. If there is no response, shout for help. Send someone to call 911. Do not leave the infant
         yourself to call 911 until you have performed CPR for about 2 minutes.

    3. Carefully place the infant on their back. If there is a chance the infant has a spinal injury,
         two people should move the infant to prevent the head and neck from twisting.36

    4. Perform chest compressions:
              Place 2 fingers on the breastbone -- just below the nipples. Make sure not to
                  press at the very end of the breastbone.
              Keep your other hand on the infant's forehead, keeping the head tilted back.
              Press down on the infant's chest so that it compresses about 1/3 to 1/2 the
                  depth of the chest.
              Give 30 chest compressions. Each time, let the chest rise completely. These
                  compressions should be FAST and hard with no pausing. Count the 30
                  compressions quickly: "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,
                  19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, off."37

    5. Open the airway. Lift up the chin with one hand. At the same time, push down on the
         forehead with the other hand.

    6. Look, listen, and feel for breathing. Place your ear close to the infant's mouth and nose.
         Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.

    7. If the infant is not breathing:
              Cover the infant's mouth and nose tightly with your mouth.
              Alternatively, cover just the nose. Hold the mouth shut.
              Keep the chin lifted and head tilted.
              Give 2 breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.

    8. Continue CPR (30 chest compressions followed by 2 breaths, then repeat) for about 2
         minutes.

    9. After about 2 minutes of CPR, if the infant still does not have normal breathing,
         coughing, or any movement, leave the infant to call 911.

    10. Repeat rescue breathing and chest compressions until the infant recovers or help
         arrives.

If the infant starts breathing again, place them in the recovery position (see Figure 5.12).
Periodically re-check for breathing until help arrives.38

Lost or Missing Child

The best way to prevent children from going missing is to establish and follow procedures to
monitor attendance. The following suggestions have been modified from New York City Health
Code.

     Identify who is responsible for taking attendance
     Identify when attendance will be taken
     Identify how attendance is going to be confirmed, documented, and reported
     Make sure that staffing schedules ensure that adult-to-child ratios are maintained at all

         times
     Have clear procedures for any times children are transitioning between classrooms and

         outdoor spaces
     Follow procedures for transitioning children that arrive late or leave early
     Train all staff in procedures
     For special events and field trips

             o A coordinator should be identified
             o Ensure staff are familiar with the destination prior to event/trip
             o Follow procedures for documenting parental approval
             o Increase ratios with extra staff or volunteers (who have background clearance)
             o Determine communication procedures with dependable methods (develop

                  communication tree)
             o Monitor attendance and take headcounts often
             o Maintain trip attendance log
             o Assign small groups of children to specific staff
             o Establish areas for regrouping
             o Take attendance before departure

And here are the procedures to follow if a child does go missing:
     Establish instructions for reporting (when, how, and by whom)
     Establish procedures for searching for the child while maintaining supervision of all
         other children
     Document the incident
     Develop actions to be taken in response to the event49

Unauthorized Adult Attempting or Gaining Access

There should also be policies and procedures in place to keep children safe from unauthorized
persons on grounds of the early care and education program. Programs may choose to have
entrances that are locked and only accessed through codes (each authorized person should
have their own code) or by being buzzed in by a member of program staff.

              Figure 5.13 - Secure entrances can be accessed by authorized persons with their own code.50

Programs can also use cameras to monitor and record the entrances of the building, common
spaces, hallways, classrooms, and outdoor spaces. Alarms and panic buttons are also something
programs can consider using for added protection (and alarms protect the grounds even after
hours of operation).

The front desk/entrance should be staffed with someone who can check each person entering
to ensure they have been authorized to have access by matching their ID to the child's record of
authorized persons. Sign-in sheets should be used to document who is dropping each child off
and who has picked them up. It is important to note that, unless the program has received a
court order limiting the parent's rights to custody, children cannot be kept from a parent.

The one exception to this is that according to California law, a program can deny access to an
adult whose behavior presents a risk to children in the program. According to the California
Department of Social Services and the Child Care Advocate Program, if a parent comes to pick
up their child while inebriated or under the influence of drugs, child care providers must:

     Make every effort to prevent the parent from taking the child by taking the
         recommended steps

     Attempt to delay departure until you can contact another authorized person to pick the
         child up.

     Consider calling the police if the person refuses to cooperate or acts in a threatening
         manner

     If the child is taken, write down a description of the vehicle and the license plate and
         report the situation to the parent/legal guardian and/or police.51

Response to Unauthorized Person's Attempt to Pick Up Child

According to the Public Counsel Law Center: Early Care and Education Law Project's Guidelines
for Releasing Children, if an unauthorized person attempts to pick up a child, a program should:

      Calmly request their ID and explain that the law requires that the enrolling parent/legal

         guardian authorize any person that will be permitted to pick up a child
      Call the custodial parent right away and let them know what is happening
      If the person refuses to comply, the police may need to be called
      If the child is taken by force, get a detailed description of the person and vehicle to

         report authorities immediately52

Disasters and Emergencies

Early care and education programs should consider how to prepare for and respond to
emergency situations or natural disasters that may require evacuation, lock-down, or shelter-
in-place and have written plans, accordingly. Written plans should be posted in each classroom
and areas used by children. The following topics should be addressed, including but not limited
to regularly scheduled practice drills, procedures for notifying and updating families, and the
use of the daily class roster(s) to check attendance of children and staff during an emergency or
drill when gathered in a safe space after exit and upon return to the program. All
drills/exercises should be recorded.53

Emergencies often happen suddenly and can be devastating to programs and communities.
Emergency preparedness is the process of taking steps to ensure your early care and education
program is safe before, during, and after an emergency. Whether a natural disaster such as a
tornado hits or a man-made emergency such as the appearance of a violent intruder occurs,
early childhood educators need to know how to respond quickly and appropriately to situations
that could happen in their program, center, or home. It's important for every program to create
an emergency preparedness plan specific to their location, building, and grounds.

Early care and education programs play an important role in supporting children and families in
their local communities before, during, and after an emergency through three phases of
emergency management:

     Preparedness--Takes place before an emergency. It includes being informed about any
         likely emergencies in your area; mitigating any existing concerns at your facility that
         could make an emergency worse; making plans to respond to emergencies before they
         happen; and building, maintaining, and updating supply kits you will take or keep with
         you during an emergency.

     Response--Begins the moment you are alerted to an impending emergency and
         continues as the emergency occurs.

     Recovery--Happens as soon as the emergency is over, when efforts are focused on
         food, water, shelter, safety, and the emotional needs of those affected. Recovery is also

         the process of rebuilding your program and returning to normalcy after an emergency,
         which is why it can last hours, weeks, months, or even years in the most extreme cases.

                                             Figure 5.14 - Programs need to make a plan.54

Preparedness

Ensuring you are prepared and ready for everyday activities is essential, and it is something you
do every day in your program. Preparing and planning for emergencies is no different. Use the
self-assessment in Appendix F to determine the steps you may need to take to develop a
comprehensive and effective emergency-preparedness plan.

You will also need to consider the types of emergencies your program could experience. What
types of emergencies have previously occurred in your area? Is your program in a flood zone or
an area commonly threatened by wildfire? Do you experience severe weather events? Is there
a history of violence in your community? Here are some possible emergencies to consider:

     Tornado
     Earthquake
     Hurricane
     Flooding
     Tsunami
     Thunderstorm
     House Fire/Wildfire
     Active Shooter/Violent Intruder (Prepared for?)
     Blackout/Power Outage
     Extreme Heat
     Winter Storm/Extreme Cold
     Landslide/Mudslide
     Volcanic Eruption

                                        Figure 5.15 - One threat to consider is wildfires55

Your emergency plan should address all aspects of your early childcare education program,
including the number and ages of enrolled children and any special health care needs or
concerns of children and staff. While developing your emergency plan, use community
resources for different perspectives and recommendations on preparedness, response, and
recovery efforts. These resources can include but are not limited to:

     Child care health consultants
     Mental health consultants
     Child care resource and referral agencies (CCR&Rs)
     First responders, such as fire, law enforcement, and emergency medical personnel
     State/territory child care licensing agency
     Public health departments
     School district personnel, if your program is located within a school
     Community physicians who are disaster experts

Making Your Emergency Response Plan

Working together and communicating what to do during an event is essential. Understanding
everyone's role during an emergency before the emergency occurs helps make the response
procedure quicker and more efficient. Establishing responsibilities can be addressed during
training sessions and planning meetings before an emergency or drill, to ensure staff are
comfortable with the procedures.

Types of Emergency Responses

There are many types of emergencies. The key to remember is that each is a method to put
effective barriers between you and a threat. The difference is in the types of threats and what
kind of barrier is called for.

     Evacuating is a means to leave a dangerous situation or area (e.g., because of a fire).
     Sheltering in place is the use of a structure and its indoor atmosphere to temporarily

         separate you from a hazardous outdoor atmosphere (e.g., tornadoes, earthquakes,
         severe weather, landslides, or debris flow). It entails closing all doors, windows, and
         vents and taking immediate shelter in a readily accessible location.

     A lockdown is a shelter-in-place procedure that is used in situations with intruders or
         emergencies that involve potential violence. Lockdown requires children and adults to
         shelter in a safe room, lock doors, and remain quiet until the event is over.

    
See a sample evacuation plan and example blank plans for evacuation, shelter-in-place, and
lockdown in Appendix G.

                     Figure 5.16 - These school-aged children are taking part in an earthquake drill.56

Building an Emergency Kit

Building an emergency supply kit is an important part of preparedness. This kit ensures that
your program has sufficient supplies and food if you and the children need to shelter in place or
evacuate in an emergency for at least 72 hours. Make sure that all items are up to date and not
expired. Consider appointing someone to be responsible for routinely checking expiration dates
of the food in your kit. Here are some items you might consider including in your kit:

     Emergency contact information for children and staff
     Attendance sheet
     Facility floor plan with evacuation routes outlined
     Printed directions to evacuation sites
     Medication list with dosing instructions for each child who takes medication
     Battery- or hand-powered weather radio
     Battery-powered walkie-talkies to communicate with staff
     Fully charged cell phone and charger
     Flashlight and batteries
     First aid kit
     Diapers, toilet paper, diaper wipes
     Sanitary wipes and hand sanitizer
     Non-latex medical gloves
     Dry or canned infant formula
     Bottled water

Practice Your Plan

Practicing your emergency plan in advance helps everyone respond quickly and appropriately
when an emergency situation arises. You won't know if the plan works unless you try it out, so
practice with all children and adults. If you have enrolled children or staff with special health
care needs or disabilities, address these specific needs with community partners during
practice.

                                           Figure 5.17 - Practicing an evacuation drill.57

Regular emergency drills, both announced and unannounced, help everyone become familiar
with emergency procedures and activities. This can reduce panic and fear during an actual
emergency, freeing participants to focus on how to evacuate, shelter in place, or lockdown.

Reunification Procedures

An effective method of reuniting children with their parents and guardians after an emergency
is an often-overlooked component of an emergency plan, but it is very important. Including up-
to-date emergency contact information for each child in your emergency kit can help provide
structure around this process. Reunification procedures that should be communicated to
families:

     Evacuation or shelter-in-place locations

     What the program will do during a lockdown response
     What families should do during a lockdown response
     Who will contact families before, during, and after an emergency
     How families will be contacted (e.g., text, email, phone call)
     Procedures if a child needs to be transported for medical care (e.g., who will accompany

         the child, where they will go)

It is important for programs to have procedures in place if children cannot be reunited with
their families immediately. Roads close, care gets delayed, and work shifts go into overtime
during emergencies for parents/guardians working in hospitals or as first responders. Having a
plan in case you need to take care of a child overnight is a critical part of your reunification
procedures.

                 What is Mitigation?

                       Mitigation is similar to preparedness and involves reducing the seriousness
                       or severity of disasters or emergencies. It is also a way of preventing future
                       emergencies or disasters. Use the following checklist in Appendix H to
                       ensure you are mitigating your program's risks.58

Response

The goals of the response phase are to:
     Determine that an emergency is occurring
     Determine appropriate response (evacuation, shelter in place, or lockdown)
     Activate the emergency response plan
     Maintain communication with all staff and first responders
     Establish what information needs to be communicated to staff, teachers, assistants,
         children, families, and the community
     Provide emergency first aid as needed

Refer to Figure 5.18 to see the process responses should follow.

Response is directly related to preparedness--the more you prepare and practice your
emergency response, the more efficient your response will be. After performing an emergency
all involved parties should reflect upon how the drill went and provide feedback on what
worked and what did not work. Updates and revisions to the plan and procedures should be
made based on that feedback. Teachers should also discuss the drill with the children
afterward, so the children can ask questions and understand what happened.60

                 Responding to Fires and Earthquakes

                       Earthquake Response - Drop, Cover, and Hold On
                       In order to be prepared to respond when there is an earthquake, teachers
                       should identify safe places. A safe place could be under a sturdy table or
                       desk or against an interior wall away from windows, bookcases or tall
                       furniture that could fall on teachers and children. The shorter the distance
                       to move to safety, the less likely that someone will be injured.

                       Everyone should practice drop, cover, and hold on. Have children go under
                       a table (or desk if school-age) and hold on to one leg of the table or desk.
                       Have them protect their eyes by keeping their head down.

                                                       Figure 5.19 - Drop, Cover, and Hold graphic.61

                       If an earthquake occurs inside, everyone should drop, cover, and hold on
                       until the shaking stops. Teachers should then check everyone for injuries
                       and look for things that may have fallen or broken that may now be a
                       hazard (including fire). If evacuation is necessary, everyone should use
                       stairs.

                       If an earthquake occurs when people are outdoors, they should stay
                       outside, moving away from buildings, trees, streetlights and overhead lines,
                       crouching down and covering their heads. Many injuries occur within ten
                       feet of the entrance to buildings. Bricks, roofing and other materials can fall
                       from buildings, injuring persons nearby. Trees, streetlights and overhead
                       lines may also fall, causing damage or injury.62

                       Fire Response
                       Programs should have clear escape routes drawn on floor plans that note
                       all doors, windows, and potential barriers. Every room should have two
                       escape routes, which should be kept open/accessible at all times. And the
                       evacuation site (and a backup evacuation site/temporary shelter) should be
                       identified. These plans should be posted in every room and all program

                       staff and families should be familiar with these (and regularly practice
                       them).

                       If a fire occurs, 911 should be called immediately. A designated staff person
                       should get the current record of the attendance and the emergency contact
                       information for all of the children. As the children and staff evacuate, each
                       should be noted so that no one is left behind. No one should go back into
                       the building once it has been evacuated

                       Everyone should proceed to the evacuation site or temporary shelter. For
                       children that cannot yet walk (infants, toddlers, or children with mobility
                       impairments) a large wagon, or emergency crib on wheels, or similar
                       equipment can be used for evacuation.

Recovery

The recovery phase refers to the actions taken from the time the emergency ends until the
needs of staff, children, and families are met. It includes helping affected families resume their
daily activities and helping all those affected cope with the aftermath of the emergency.
Recovery can last for a few days, weeks, months, or even years. The goals of the recovery phase
are to:

     Rebuild your facility or home if necessary, and restore services as quickly as possible.
     Meet the needs (physical, health, emotional) of children, families, and staff.
     Provide a supportive and caring environment that brings normalcy back into children's

         lives.

Incorporating recovery resources into your emergency-preparedness plan can help you reach
these goals more quickly while providing mental health and emotional support to children,
families, and staff.

Reunification

Safely returning children to their families after an emergency begins to bring children and
families back to normalcy. Preparing for this by keeping up-to-date emergency contact
information for each child in your emergency kit can help provide structure around this process.
As discussed in previous chapters, make sure you are communicating with families throughout
the emergency, if possible. This communication may help the reunification process begin more
quickly, as families may be able to safely pick up their children sooner.

Damage and Needs Assessment

A damage assessment of your facility or home after an emergency is crucial for your early
childcare education program to open again. Assessments will differ based on the type of
emergency your program, center, or home experienced. Resources to help you complete a
damage assessment: b Flooding: usa.childcareaware.org/flooding/ b Hurricane:

usa.childcareaware.org/hurricanes b Tornado: www.ready.gov/tornadoes Ensure that your
early childcare education program has been given the all-clear from licensing and emergency
officials before reopening.

Continuation of Services

After conducting your damage and needs assessment, an action plan is needed for how your
early childcare education program will resume services to families. Use community resources,
they can connect you to resources that can help you re-open your early care and education
program or provide children with temporary child care. Resources related to the continuation
of services: b childcareta.acf.hhs.gov/resource/continuation-child-careservices-louisianas-
experience

Mental Health and Emotional Needs

Mental health support is a high priority after an emergency. Children and adults who have
experienced stress and/or loss, either at the child care program or at home, may have difficulty
coping. By offering a safe place and resources like mental health consultants, early care and
education programs support children, families, and staff coping with fear, anger, and grief and
help them resume their lives in a healthy way.

Coping with Disaster, Emergencies, and Tragedies

Keep in mind the following:
     Everyone who sees or experiences an emergency is affected by it in some way.
     It is normal to feel anxious about your own safety and that of your family and close
         friends.
     Profound sadness, grief, and anger are normal reactions during or after an emergency.
     Everyone has different needs and different ways of coping.
     Acknowledging feelings and focusing on your strengths and abilities can help recovery.
     Difficult memories of the disaster can be triggered by certain loud noises, weather
         events, or news clips from the emergency. This may be true even years later.

Summary

When early care and education programs have staff that are knowledgeable about how to
identify and respond to injuries and emergencies, they are prepared to keep children safe. This
chapter provided basic information on responding to injuries. This content is not a replacement
for the certification that teachers and other staff members should pursue.

It's important to remember that emergencies can take many forms. Early care and education
programs should be ready to act in the event of any type of emergency by being prepared and
by knowing how to respond and recover.63

Introduction

One more responsibility early childhood educators have to protect children's safety is to
understand what child maltreatment is, risk factors for child maltreatment, signs of different
forms of child maltreatment, and what they should do to support children and families and
what they must legally do if they suspect child maltreatment.

Looking at the Data

In 2017, there were 674,000 substantiated victims of child abuse and neglect across the U.S.
The youngest children are the most vulnerable to maltreatment. Nationally, states report that
more than one-quarter (28.5%) of victims are younger than 3 years old. The victimization rate is
highest for children younger than 1-year-old at 25.3 per 1,000 children.

The percentages of child victims are similar for both boys (48.6%) and girls (51.0%). Sixty-nine
percent of victims are maltreated by a mother, either acting alone (40.8%) or with a father
and/or nonparent (28.2%). More than 13.0 percent (13.5%) of victims are maltreated by a
perpetrator who was not the child's parent. The largest categories in the nonparent group are
relative (4.7%), partner of parent (2.9%), and "other" (2.7%).

The effects of child abuse and neglect are serious, and a child fatality is the most tragic
consequence. In 2017, a national estimate of 1,720 children died from abuse and neglect at a
rate of 2.32 per 100,000 children in the population.3

Definitions

Child maltreatment includes all types of abuse and neglect of a child under the age of 18 by a
parent, caregiver, or another person in a custodial role (such as clergy, a coach, a teacher) that
results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. There are four common types
of abuse and neglect: physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, and neglect.4

Physical Abuse

Physical abuse is a nonaccidental physical injury to a child caused by a parent, caregiver, or
other person responsible for a child and can include punching, beating, kicking, biting, shaking,
throwing, stabbing, choking, hitting (with a hand, stick, strap, or other object), burning, or
otherwise causing physical harm. Physical discipline, such as spanking or paddling, is not
considered abuse as long as it is reasonable and causes no bodily injury to the child. Injuries
from physical abuse could range from minor bruises to severe fractures or death.

                 Abusive Head Trauma

                       Abusive head trauma (AHT), which includes shaken baby syndrome, is a
                       preventable and severe form of physical child abuse that results in an injury
                       to the brain of a child. AHT is most common in children under age five, with
                       children under one year of age at most risk. It is caused by violent shaking
                       and/or with blunt impact. The resulting injury can cause bleeding around
                       the brain or on the inside back layer of the eyes.

                       Nearly all victims of AHT suffer serious, long-term health consequences
                       such as vision problems, developmental delays, physical disabilities, and
                       hearing loss. At least one of every four babies who experience AHT dies
                       from this form of child abuse.

                                                      Figure 6.2 - Long-term damage or death are the
                                                          consequence of almost all victims of AHT.5

                       AHT often happens when a parent or caregiver becomes angry or frustrated
                       because of a child's crying. The caregiver then shakes the child and/or hits
                       or slams the child's head into something in an effort to stop the crying.

                       Crying, including long bouts of inconsolable crying, is normal behavior in
                       infants. Shaking, throwing, hitting, or hurting a baby is never the right
                       response to crying.

                   How Can Abusive Head Trauma Be Prevented?

                       Anyone can play a role in preventing AHT by understanding the dangers of
                       violently shaking or hitting a baby's head into something, knowing the risk
                       factors and the triggers for abuse, and finding ways to support families and
                       caregivers in their community.6

                       The Bottom Line
                       Shaking a baby can cause death or permanent brain damage. It can result in
                       life-long disability.
                       Healthy strategies for dealing with a crying baby include:

                            finding the reason for the crying
                            checking for signs of illness or discomfort, such as diaper rash,

                                teething, tight clothing;
                            feeding or burping;
                            soothing the baby by rubbing its back; gently rocking; offering a

                                pacifier; singing or talking;
                            taking a walk using a stroller or a drive in a properly-secured car

                                seat;
                            or calling the doctor if sickness is suspected

                       All babies cry. Caregivers often feel overwhelmed by a crying baby. Calling a
                       friend, relative, or neighbor for support or assistance lets the caregiver take
                       a break from the situation. If immediate support is not available, the
                       caregiver could place the baby in a crib (making sure the baby is safe), close
                       the door, and check on the baby every five minutes.7

                       If an early childhood educator is growing frustrated with a child's crying or
                       other behaviors, it's important that they follow the same advice they would
                       give a parent/caregiver or find a co-worker to relieve them while they calm
                       down.

Sexual Abuse

Child sexual abuse is a significant but preventable adverse childhood experience and public
health problem. Sexual abuse includes activities by a parent or other caregiver such as fondling
a child's genitals, penetration, incest, rape, sodomy, indecent exposure, and exploitation
through prostitution or the production of pornographic materials. Sexual abuse is defined by
the Federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act as "the employment, use, persuasion,
inducement, enticement, or coercion of any child to engage in, or assist any other person to
engage in, any sexually explicit conduct or simulation of such conduct for the purpose of
producing a visual depiction of such conduct; or the rape, and in cases of caretaker or
interfamilial relationships, statutory rape, molestation, prostitution, or other form of sexual
exploitation of children, or incest with children"8

About 1 in 4 girls and 1 in 13 boys experience child sexual abuse at some point in childhood.
And 90% of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by someone the child or child's family knows.9

Emotional Abuse

Emotional abuse (or psychological abuse) is a pattern of behavior that impairs a child's
emotional development or sense of self-worth. This may include constant criticism, threats, or
rejection as well as withholding love, support, or guidance. Emotional abuse is often difficult to
prove, and, therefore, child protective services may not be able to intervene without evidence
of harm or mental injury to the child (Prevent Child Abuse America, 2016). 10

Neglect

Neglect is the failure of a parent or other caregiver to provide for a child's basic needs. Neglect
generally includes the following categories:

     Physical (e.g., failure to provide necessary food or shelter, lack of appropriate
         supervision)

     Medical (e.g., failure to provide necessary medical or mental health treatment,
         withholding medically indicated treatment from children with life-threatening
         conditions)

     Educational (e.g., failure to educate a child or attend to special education needs)
     Emotional (e.g., inattention to a child's emotional needs, failure to provide psychological

         care, permitting a child to use alcohol or other drugs)

Sometimes cultural values, the standards of care in the community, and poverty may contribute
to what is perceived as maltreatment, indicating the family may need information or assistance.
It is important to note that living in poverty is not considered child abuse or neglect. However, a
family's failure to use available information and resources to care for their child may put the
child's health or safety at risk, and child welfare intervention could be required. In addition,
many states provide an exception to the definition of neglect for parents/caregivers who
choose not to seek medical care for their children due to religious beliefs.

Abandonment is considered in many states as a form of neglect. In general, a child is
considered to be abandoned when the parent's identity or whereabouts are unknown, the child
has been left alone in circumstances where the child suffers serious harm, the child has been
deserted with no regard for his or her health or safety, or the parent has failed to maintain
contact with the child or provide reasonable support for a specified period of time. Some states
have enacted laws--often called safe haven laws--that provide safe places for parents to
relinquish newborn infants.

                Pause to Reflect

                   Come up with a situation that would be an example of each type of abuse and
                   each type of neglect. Keep these in mind to revisit in another Pause to Reflect
                   feature later in the chapter.

Risk Factors

Risk factors are those characteristics linked with child abuse and neglect--they may or may not
be direct causes. A combination of individual, relational, community, and societal factors
contribute to the risk of child abuse and neglect. Although children are not responsible for the
harm inflicted upon them, certain characteristics have been found to increase their risk of being
abused and or neglected.

Individual Risk Factors for Victimization

     Children younger than 4 years of age
     Special needs that may increase caregiver burden (e.g., disabilities, mental health issues,

         and chronic physical illnesses)

Risk Factors for Perpetration

There are different levels of risk factors for the perpetrators of child maltreatment

Individual Risk Factors

     Families' lack of understanding of children's needs, child development and parenting
         skills

     Parental history of child abuse and or neglect
     Substance abuse and/or mental health issues including depression in the family
     Parental characteristics such as young age, low education, single parenthood, a large

         number of dependent children, and low income
     Nonbiological, transient caregivers in the home (e.g., mother's male partner)
     Parental thoughts and emotions that tend to support or justify maltreatment behaviors

Family Risk Factors

     Social isolation
     Family disorganization, dissolution, and violence, including intimate partner violence
     Parenting stress, poor parent-child relationships, and negative interactions

                   Figure 6.4 - Intimate partner violence is a family risk factor for child maltreatment.12

Community Risk Factors

     Community violence
     Concentrated neighborhood disadvantage (e.g., high poverty and residential instability,

         high unemployment rates, and high density of alcohol outlets), and poor social
         connections.13

Protective Factors

Protective factors may lessen the likelihood of children being abused or neglected. Protective
factors have not been studied as extensively or rigorously as risk factors. Identifying and
understanding protective factors are equally as important as researching risk factors.

Family Protective Factors

     Supportive family environment and social networks
     Concrete support for basic needs
     Nurturing parenting skills
     Stable family relationships
     Household rules and child monitoring
     Parental employment
     Parental education
     Adequate housing
     Access to health care and social services
     Caring adults outside the family who can serve as role models or mentors

Community Protective Factors

     Communities that support families and take responsibility for preventing abuse14

Preventative Strategies

Child abuse and neglect are serious problems that can have lasting harmful effects on its
victims. The goal in preventing child abuse and neglect is to stop this violence from happening
in the first place.
Child abuse and neglect are complex problems rooted in unhealthy relationships and
environments. Preventing child abuse and neglect requires addressing factors at all levels of
the social ecology-the individual, relational, community, and societal levels.15 As you can see in
Figure 6.5, early care and education has a direct role to play in one of the National Center for
Injury Prevention and Control, Division of Violence Prevention's strategies and can support
families in some of the others. Families who have access to quality childcare, which increases
the likelihood that children will experience safe, stable, nurturing relationships and
environments. Access to affordable childcare also reduces parental stress and maternal
depression, which are risk factors for child abuse and neglect.16

                   Domestic Violence

                       Given the magnitude of the problem of children's exposure to violence,
                       including the co-occurrence of domestic violence and child maltreatment,
                       early care and education programs are serving children and families
                       impacted by violence. Here are some key facts about domestic violence and
                       intimate partner violence:

                           1. Intimate partner violence describes physical, sexual, or
                                psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse. This
                                type of violence can occur among heterosexual or same-sex couples
                                and does not require sexual intimacy. Intimate partner violence can
                                vary in frequency and severity. It occurs on a continuum ranging
                                from one hit that may or may not impact the victim to chronic,
                                severe beating.

                           2. Domestic violence is the second leading cause of death for pregnant
                                women, and some 25 to 50 percent of adolescent mothers
                                experience partner violence before, during, or just after their
                                pregnancy.

                           3. Witnessing family assault is among the most common victimizations
                                experienced by toddlers (ages 2 to 5). Other common forms of
                                victimization are assault by a sibling and physical bullying.

                           4. In 30 to 60 percent of families where either child abuse or domestic
                                violence is present, child abuse and domestic violence co-occur.

                       Children may very well experience the violence themselves; however, even
                       when they are not directly injured, exposure to traumatic events can cause
                       social, emotional, and behavioral difficulties. Children exposed to domestic
                       violence have often been found to develop a wide range of problems,
                       including externalizing behavior problems, interpersonal skill deficits, and
                       psychological and emotional problems such as depression and post-
                       traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In addition, a Michigan study of preschool-
                       aged children found that those exposed to domestic violence at home are
                       more likely to have health problems, including allergies, asthma, frequent
                       headaches and stomach-aches, and generalized lethargy.

                 What Early Care and Education Programs Should Do to
                 Help

                       It is critical that early childhood educators be prepared to work with and
                       guide these children and families to needed services. Teachers and
                       administrators can support the child and family during times of stress by
                       making hotline and other domestic violence information available to
                       families.

                  The early childhood workforce is currently comprised of about 1 million
                  center-based teachers and caregivers, 1 million home-based teachers and
                  caregivers, and an additional 2.7 million unpaid home-based teachers and
                  caregivers. This workforce consists largely of women, and women are
                  disproportionately affected by domestic violence. Therefore, information
                  about appropriate services and programs should be made available for both
                  staff and families.18

Signs of Child Maltreatment

It is important to recognize high-risk situations and the signs and symptoms of maltreatment. If
you suspect a child is being harmed or the child directly discloses that they have experienced
abuse or neglect, reporting suspicions may protect him or her and help the family receive
assistance. Any concerned person can report suspicions of child abuse or neglect. Reporting
your concerns is not making an accusation; rather, it is a request for an investigation and
assessment to determine if help is needed.

maltreated; there may be other causes. They are, however, indicators that others should be
concerned about the child's welfare, particularly when multiple signs are present or they occur
repeatedly.

                Pause to Reflect

                   Think back to your example situations. What signs might a teacher or caregiver
                   notice for each of these?

Mandated Reporting of Child Maltreatment in California

A list of persons whose profession qualifies them as "mandated reporters" of child abuse or
neglect is found in California Penal Code Section 11165.7. The list is extensive and continues to
grow. It includes all school/district employees, administrators, and athletic coaches. All persons
hired into positions included on the list of mandated reporters are required, upon employment,
to be provided with a statement, informing them that they are a mandated reporter and their
obligations to report suspected cases of abuse and neglect pursuant to California Penal Code
Section 11166.5.

All persons who are mandated reporters are required, by law, to report all known or suspected
cases of child abuse or neglect. It is not the job of the mandated reporter to determine whether
the allegations are valid. If child abuse or neglect is reasonably suspected or if the child shares
information with a mandated reporter leading him/her to believe abuse or neglect has taken
place, the report must be made. No supervisor or administrator can impede or inhibit a report
or subject the reporting person to any sanction.

To make a report, an employee must contact appropriate local law enforcement or county child
welfare agency, listed below. This legal obligation is not satisfied by making a report of the
incident to a supervisor or to the school. An appropriate law enforcement agency may be one
of the following:

     A Police or Sheriff's Department (not including a school district police department or
         school security department).

     A County Probation Department, if designated by the county to receive child abuse
         reports.

     A County Welfare Department/County Child Protective Services.

The report should be made immediately over the telephone and should be followed up in
writing. The law enforcement agency has special forms for this purpose that they will ask you to
complete. If a report cannot be made immediately over the telephone, then an initial report
may be made via e-mail or fax.

                                            abuse, it should be reported immediately.25

Rights to Confidentiality and Immunity

Mandated reporters are required to give their names when making a report. However, the
reporter's identity is kept confidential. Reports of suspected child abuse are also confidential.
Mandated reporters have immunity from state criminal or civil liability for reporting as
required. This is true even if the mandated reporter acquired the knowledge, or suspicion of
abuse or neglect, outside his/her professional capacity or scope of employment.

Consequences of Failing to Report

A person who fails to make a required report is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by up to six
months in jail and/or up to a $1,000 fine (California Penal Code Section 11166[c]).

After the Report is Made

The local law enforcement agency is required to investigate all reports. Cases may also be
investigated by Child Welfare Services when allegations involve abuse or neglect within
families.

Child Protective Services

Child Protective Services (CPS) is the major organization to intervene in child abuse and neglect
cases in California. Existing law provides services to abused and neglected children and their
families. More information can be found at Child Protective Services.26

                   The Impact of Childhood Trauma on Well-Being

                       Child abuse and neglect can have lifelong implications for victims, including
                       on their wellbeing. While the physical wounds may heal, there are many
                       long-term consequences of experiencing the trauma of abuse or neglect. A
                       child or youth's ability to cope and thrive after trauma is called "resilience."
                       With help, many of these children can work through and overcome their
                       past experiences.

                       Children who are maltreated may be at risk of experiencing cognitive delays
                       and emotional difficulties, among other issues, which can affect many
                       aspects of their lives, including their academic outcomes and social skills
                       development (Bick & Nelson, 2016). Experiencing childhood maltreatment
                       also is a risk factor for depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric disorders
                       (FullerThomson, Baird, Dhrodia, & Brennenstuhl, 2016).27

                       We will look more closely at this when we examine mental health, social
                       and emotional well-being, adverse childhood events, and trauma informed
                       care in Chapter 11.

Working with Children that Have Been Abused

Children who have experienced abuse or neglect need support from caring adults who
understand the impact of trauma and how to help. Adverse childhood experiences and trauma-
informed care will be addressed more in Chapter 11). Early childhood educators should
consider the following suggestions:

     Help children feel safe. Support them in expressing and managing intense emotions.
         Help children understand their trauma history and current experiences (for example, by
         helping them understand that what happened was not their fault, or helping them see
         how their current emotions might be related to past trauma).

     Assess the impact of trauma on the child, and address any trauma-related challenges in
         the child's behavior, development, and relationships.

     Support and promote safe and stable relationships in the child's life, including
         supporting the child's family and caregivers if appropriate. Often parents and caregivers
         have also experienced trauma.

     Manage your own stress. Providers who have histories of trauma themselves may be at
         particular risk of experiencing secondary trauma symptoms.

     Refer the child to trauma-informed services, which may be more effective than generic
         services that do not address trauma.28

Summary

Child maltreatment results from the interaction of a number of individual, family, societal, and
environmental factors. Child abuse and neglect are not inevitable--safe, stable, and nurturing
relationships and environments are key for prevention. Preventing child abuse and neglect can
also prevent other forms of violence, as various types of violence are interrelated and share
many risk and protective factors, consequences, and effective prevention tactics.29 When there
is suspicion that maltreatment has occurred, it's critical that early childhood educators report
that. And being educated on trauma-informed care can help you support children who have
been the victims of child maltreatment.

Introduction

Healthy development continues to support learning throughout childhood and later life.
"Health in the earliest years...lays the groundwork for a lifetime of well-being..."1 To promote
the health of children in early care and education programs, it's important to keep records of
both children's and staff's health. Programs can support children's oral health and healthy sleep
habits. And they can help identify developmental and health concerns with screening.

                                                Figure 7.1 - Healthy children thrive!2

Children's Health Records

"The health and safety of individual children requires that information regarding each child in
care be kept and available when needed. Children's records consist of various documentation
such as a child's medical and immunization history, emergency medical care information, and
parental permission to participate in specific activities...Each child care facility must keep
accurate records on each child receiving care in child care."3

Health records can help early care and education programs identify preventative health
measures, develop care plans for children with special needs, and determine whether or not a
child should be excluded from care due to illness.

California Title 22 Child Care licensing requirements list the following health-related items to
include in the child's records:

     Medical assessment and the following health information:
             o Dietary restrictions and allergies.
             o Instructions for action to be taken in case the child's authorized representative,
                  or the physician designated by the authorized representative, cannot be reached
                  in an emergency.
             o A signed consent form for emergency medical treatment

         which the center provided assistance to the child in meeting his/her necessary medical
         or dental needs.

     Record of current medications, including the name of the prescribing physician, and
         instructions, if any, regarding control and custody of medications.

     Current and updated immunization records4

The National Health and Safety Standards recommends that the following also be included in
the child's records:

     A health history completed by the family at admission
     The child's health insurance information5

                           Figure 7.2 - Keeping health records for children and staff is important.6

Staff Health Records

It is also important for records to be kept to document the health of all staff in an early care
and education program. Licensing requires the following health-related items to be in staff
records:

     Health Screening Report
     TB Clearance7

In September of 2016, Senate Bill 792 was passed that requires staff or volunteers in an early
care and education program to provide records of immunizations (or immunity) for

     Pertussis
     Measles
     Influenza (annually between August 1 and December 1 of each year; can decline in

         writing)8

                   The Importance of Keeping Staff Healthy

                       A culture of wellness is a working environment where an employee's health
                       and safety is valued, supported, and promoted through worksite, health
                       and wellness programs, policies, benefits, and environmental supports. A
                       culture of wellness for staff is really going to be the foundation for creating
                       a culture of health and safety for children.
                       Staff have health problems such as obesity and depression at rates above
                       the national average. Early care and education salaries are often low,
                       creating personal financial stress. Staff turnover rates are high. In general,
                       early childhood educators are undervalued for the important and high-
                       demand work they do.
                       Staff wellness and stability will affect the quality of services a program is
                       able to deliver to families and children. Children need consistent, sensitive,
                       caring, and stable relationships with adults. Adults who are well, physically
                       and mentally, are more likely to engage in positive relationships. When we
                       support staff well-being, we strengthen early care and education.
                       Programs can use the CDC's Workplace Health Model to support the health
                       of their staff.9 It is outlined in this image (and a link is provided in the
                       Further Resources to Explore feature at the end of the chapter).

                Pause to Reflect

                  What does staying healthy mean to you? What do you do (or could you do) to
                  manage your stress, reinforce your resilience, and keep yourself physically
                  healthy (nutrition, activity, etc.)? How could your employer help you stay
                  healthy?

Daily Health Checks

Every day an informal, observation-based quick health check should be performed on every
child (before the parent/caregiver leaves). Early childhood educators should use their
knowledge about what is normal for a child to identify any concerns about the child's well-
being (but not as an attempt to formally diagnose illness). It is not a process that formally
excludes children from illness, but following up concerns noticed at a health check may find
reasons to exclude children.

"In a child care setting where lots of people are coming at the same time, it is hard to take a
moment with each child. However, this welcoming routine can establish many things and is a
good child development policy. This contact will help [teachers] better understand each child,
help the children feel comfortable and good about themselves, reduce the spread of illness by
excluding children with obvious signs of illness, and foster better communications with
[families]."11

                     Figure 7.4 - Teachers should do a health check when each child is dropped off.12

Conducting the Daily Health Check

Teachers should use all of their senses to check for signs of illness. This includes:
     Listening to what families tell you about how their child is feeling and what the child
         sounds like (hoarse voice, coughing, wheezing, etc.)
     Looking at the child from head to toe (with a quick scan) to see if the child looks flushed,
         pale, has a rash, has a runny nose or mucus in the eyes

     Feeling the child's cheek or neck (as part of a greeting) for warmth or clamminess
     Smelling the child for unusual smelling breath or a bowel movement.

Here are the signs to observe for:
     General mood and atypical behavior
     Fever (elevated temperature)
     Rashes or unusual spots, itching, swelling, and bruising
     Complaints of not feeling well
     Symptoms of illness (coughing, sneezing, runny nose, eye or ear discharge, diarrhea,
         vomiting, etc.)
     Reported illness in child or family members13,14

Dental Hygiene

Dental hygiene is important to prevent Early Childhood Caries (ECC), which is a term used to
describe tooth decay, including filled or extracted teeth due to decay, in the primary teeth
(baby teeth). It is important to rethink the way we "treat" dental caries. Traditionally, we would
wait until a child had a cavity and "treat" the cavity with a filling. In order to prevent ECC, we
must intervene before the first cavity develops.15 Early care and education programs can teach
children and families about dental hygiene and oral care as well as implement good dental
hygiene practices. Here are some ideas:

     Use teaching practices that engage children and promoting thinking critically. Consider
         asking questions such as:
             o How do you brush your teeth?
             o Why do you brush your teeth?
             o What else can you do to keep your mouth and teeth healthy?
             o What happens if you don't brush your teeth?
             o Tell me about your last visit to the dentist.

     Integrate oral health into activities (in addition to tooth brushing). Some possibilities
         include:
             o Having children separate pictures of foods that are good for oral health from
                  pictures of foods that are high in sugar.
             o Reading books with positive oral health messages to children.
             o Having children pretend they are visiting a dental office.
             o Singing songs about oral health

     Engage families in promoting oral health at home. Some ways to do this include:
             o Working with families to find the best ways to position their child for tooth
                  brushing. Remind families that young children cannot brush their teeth well until

                  age 7 to 8. It is also important for a parent to brush their child's teeth or help
                  them with brushing.
             o Asking families to take photographs of their child brushing his teeth and helping
                  the child write stories about his experience.
             o Helping families choose and prepare foods that promote good oral health.
             o Encouraging families to ask their child what she learned about oral health in
                  school that day.
             o Offering families suggestions for at-home activities that support what children
                  are learning about oral health at school.16

Classroom Tooth Brushing Steps

    1. Sitting at a table in a circle, children brush teeth as a group activity every day.
    2. Give each child a small paper cup, a paper towel, and a soft-bristled, child-sized

         toothbrush.
    3. Put a small (pea-sized) dab of fluoride toothpaste on the inside rim of each cup, and

         have children use their toothbrushes to pick up the dabs of toothpaste.
    4. Brush together for two minutes, using an egg timer or a song that lasts for about two

         minutes.
    5. Brush your teeth with the children to set an example, and remind them to brush all of

         their teeth, on all sides.
    6. When the two minutes are up, have the children spit any extra toothpaste into their

         cups, wipe their mouths and throw the cups and paper towels away.
    7. Children can go to the sink in groups to rinse their toothbrushes and put the

         toothbrushes in holders to dry.17

Sleep Hygiene

It's important to get enough sleep. Sleep supports mind and body health. Getting enough sleep
isn't only about total hours of sleep. It's also important to get good quality sleep on a regular
schedule to feel rested upon waking.

Sleep is an important part of life! Young children spend around half of their time asleep.19
     Babies need to sleep between 12 and 16 hours a day (including naps).
     Toddlers need to sleep between 11 and 14 hours a day (including naps).
     Preschoolers need to sleep between 10 and 13 hours a day (including naps).
     School-aged children need 9 to 12 hours of sleep each night.20

We know how busy they are when they are awake, but what are they doing during all of those
restful hours? Actually, sleep has many purposes.

     Growth: Growth hormone is released when children sleep (Berk 2002, 302). Young
         children are growing in their sleep, and since they have a lot of growing to do, they need
         all the sleep they can get.

     Restoration: Some sleep researchers have found that sleep is important for letting the
         brain relax and restore some of the hormones and nutrients it needs (Jenni & O'Conner
         1995, 205).

     Memory: Sleep is also a time when the brain is figuring out what experiences from the
         day are important to remember (Jenni & O'Conner 1995, 205).

     Health: One study found that infants and toddlers need at least 12 hours of sleep in a 24
         hour day. When infants and toddlers had less than 12 hours they were more likely to be
         obese by the age of 3 (Taveras et. al. 2008, 305).21

The Culture of Sleep and Child Care

Across the world people sleep in different ways. Some people sleep inside, some sleep outside.
Some people sleep in beds, others in hammocks or on mats on the floor. Some people sleep
alone, some sleep with a spouse or children or both. Some people sleep only at night, while
others value a nap during the day. How, when, and where people choose to sleep has a lot to
do with their culture, traditions, and customs. This can include where they live, how their family
sleeps, even how many bedrooms are in their home. Teachers have a role in providing a sleep
environment that is comfortable and safe for the children in their care, while honoring families'
cultural beliefs.

What can teachers do to help young children feel more "at home" when it is time for them to
rest?

     Think of sleep and sleep routines as part of the child's individualized curriculum.
     Classroom teachers should meet with a family before a child enters your care. This is an

         opportunity to find out about a child's sleep habits before they join the classroom.
         When you know how a baby sleeps at home, you can use that information to plan for
         how they might sleep best in your care.
     Brainstorm ways to adapt your classroom to help a child feel "at home" during rest
         times. For example, a baby who is used to sleeping in a busy environment might nap
         better if you roll a crib into the classroom. Some mobile infants and toddlers might have
         a hard time sleeping in child care because they think they will miss something fun!
         These children benefit from having a very quiet place to fall asleep. When you have a
         positive relationship with a baby it will be easier to know what will help them relax into
         sleep.
     Encourage families to bring in "a little bit of home" to the program - like a stuffed
         animal or special blanket. A comfort item from home can help children feel connected
         to their families. They might want that comfort all day. The comfort item from home can
         also help children make the transition to sleep while in your care. Make sure that infants
         under one year of age do not have any extra toys or blankets in the crib with them.
     Share with families what you learn about their child. Use pick up and drop off times to
         ask questions about sleep at home. Families can share information that could make
         their child more comfortable in your care. You can be a resource for families about sleep
         and their child. Remember that families are the experts about their child.

Napping and Individual Differences

Have you noticed that some children will fall asleep every day at the same time no matter what
else is going on? These kids could fall asleep into their lunch if it is served too late! Have you
known children who seem to fall asleep easily some days and other times just can't settle into
sleep? These children might need a very stable routine. Some toddlers nap less and sleep more
at night while others need to have a long sleep during the day.

Temperament and Sleep

Some of the different patterns in children's sleep has to do with their temperament (Jenni &
O'Connor 2005, 204). Temperament is like the personality we are born with. Some children are
naturally easy-going and adapt to new situations while others really need a routine that is the
same every day. One child might fall asleep easily just by putting her in her crib or cot when she
is drifting off to sleep. Another child might fall asleep in your arms but startle awake the
moment he realizes he has been laid down alone.

Circadian Rhythms and Sleep

Something else that can make nap time easy or difficult for young children has to do with their
natural sleep cycles. Everyone has a kind of "clock" inside of their bodies that tells them when
they are hungry or sleepy. The cycle of this clock is called circadian rhythms. Circadian rhythms

172 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
are the patterns of sleeping, waking, eating, body temperature and even hormone releases in
your body over a twenty-four hour period. How much children need to sleep, when they feel
tired, and how easily they can fall asleep are all related to their circadian rhythms (Ferber 2006,
31).

Meeting Each Individual Child's Sleep Needs

Thinking about the circadian rhythms and temperament reminds us how each child is different.
That is why it is important to have nap times that meet the needs of all children in your care.
Helping young children to learn to recognize their bodies' needs and find ways to meet those
needs is the very important skill of self-regulation.22

                           Figure 7.6 - Children may get tired at times other than nap/rest time.23

                   Individualizing Nap Schedules

                       Creating a space for sleepy children can allow them to relax or nap when
                       their body tells them they are tired. It can take some creativity to figure out
                       how to let a young child nap or rest when they are tired.

                       What do you do if a child won't nap when others are? How does one child
                       rest quietly in a busy classroom?

                       Two-and-a-half-year-old Henry is new to your classroom. His mother has
                       shared with you that he does not nap during the day with her. When nap
                       time comes around you can tell that Henry does not seem very tired.

                       What can you do for Henry, or other children like him, while the rest of the
                       class sleeps?

                            Do you have a "cozy corner" that could also be a one child nap area?
                            Are there soft places to sit and relax with a book or stuffed animal?
                            Are books or other quiet activities provided if a child isn't able to

                                rest or settle when other children are?

                            Are children provided techniques and strategies for calming their
                                bodies e.g. deep breathing, tensing and relaxing their bodies, feeling
                                their heartbeat, etc?24

Developmental and Health Screenings

There are specific health conditions that impact learning and development, which can be
identified and treated early. These conditions can be identified through early health
screening.25

Screening is the first step in getting to know a child at the beginning of each enrollment year.
This "baseline data" helps staff plan and individualize services. It also helps them identify "red
flags" for further examination or evaluation. When concerns go unidentified, they can lead to
bigger problems.26

Screening helps staff and families:
     Celebrate milestones: Every family looks forward to seeing a child's first smile, first step,
         and first words. Regular screenings with early childhood professionals help raise
         awareness of a child's development, making it easier to celebrate developmental
         milestones.
     Promote universal screening: All children need support in the early years to stay healthy
         and happy. Just like regular hearing and vision screenings can assure that children are
         able to hear and see clearly, developmental and behavioral screenings can assure that
         children are making progress in areas such as language, social, or motor development.
     Identify possible delays and concerns early: With regular screenings, families, teachers,
         and other professionals can assure that young children get the services and supports
         they need as early as possible to help them thrive.
     Enhance developmental supports: Families are children's first and most important
         teachers. Tools, guidance, and tips recommended by experts, can help families support
         their children's development.27

Screening is part of a larger process professionals use to learn about children's health and
development. In partnership with families, developmental monitoring (or surveillance),
screening, and assessment keep children on track developmentally.

                   What is the Difference Between Screening, Assessment, and
                   Evaluation

                       Screening
                       The screening process is the preliminary step to determine if sensory,
                       behavioral, and development skills are progressing as expected. The
                       screening itself does not determine a diagnosis or need for early
                       intervention.

                       Assessment
                       Assessment is an on-going process to determine a child's and family's
                       strengths and needs. The assessment process should be continued
                       throughout a child's eligibility and be used to determine strategies to
                       support the development of the child in the classroom and at home. This
                       can be both a formal or informal process.

                       Evaluation
                       A formal evaluation is performed by a qualified professional to identify or
                       diagnose a developmental, sensory, or behavioral condition or disability
                       requiring intervention. Only children who were identified through screening
                       and ongoing assessment as possibly having a condition or disability might
                       require intervention. The Early Intervention Part C agency or Local
                       Education Agency in your community must be notified for a formal
                       evaluation to determine his or her eligibility for early intervention, special
                       education or other related services.28

A couple of important things to remember about screening:
     Children develop rapidly during the first three years of life, so keeping a watchful eye on
         health and development for infants and toddlers is critical.
     Most early childhood programs serve diverse families. Therefore, the best screening
         tools gather information in ways that respond to culture and language.29
     Developmental screening using research-based standardized developmental screening
         instruments that are valid and reliable for the population and purpose for which they
         will be used; age, developmentally, culturally, and linguistically appropriate, and
         appropriate for children with disabilities, as needed; and conducted by qualified and
         trained personnel. Currently, standardized screening instruments for children birth to

         children whose families speak other languages.30

                Engaging Families in Screening and Follow-Up

                   Families can be your most powerful ally and asset throughout the screening
                   process. They are the expert on their child and can provide meaningful and
                   reliable information. Screenings are also an opportunity to support families to
                   focus on their child and increase their understanding of their child's
                   development.

                   When families are active partners in the assessment (and intervention)

                   for the child, the families ' priorities, and goals for the child's learning and
                   development.

                   You can engage families by:
                        Discussing and explaining the screening process and results. Make sure
                            to include an explanation of the tools you used and any relevant
                            developmental, linguistic or cultural accommodations made for their
                            child.
                        Listening to parent feedback and concerns on the screening and

Developmental Monitoring and Screening

The first years of life are so important for a child's development. Early experiences make a
difference in how young children's brains develop and can influence lifelong learning and
health. Early childhood educators spend a great deal of time with young children and are
instrumental in determining many of the kinds of experiences they will have. Developmental
monitoring means observing and noting specific ways a child plays, learns, speaks, acts, and
moves every day, in an ongoing way. Developmental monitoring often involves tracking a
child's development using a checklist of developmental milestones.

Teachers are in a unique position to monitor the development of each child in their care. They
may be the first one to observe potential delays in a child's development. Working with groups
of same-aged children can help teachers recognize children who reach milestones early and
late. Working with children of different ages can help teachers notice if a child's skills are more
similar to those of a younger or older child than to those of his or her same-aged peers.
Because teachers spend their day teaching, playing with, and watching children, they may find
themselves concerned that a child in their care is not reaching milestones that other children
his or her age have, or they may have families ask them if they are concerned about their child's
development. 32

                      The first time I heard the term "developmental monitoring," I was really
                      intimidated and thought, "this sounds really complicated and time-
                      consuming. How am I going to do that on top of everything else I have to do
                      during the day?"

                      I was so relieved when I found out that "developmental monitoring" is just a
                      fancy way of saying "watch, observe and record what the kids are doing to
                      make sure they're on track." I just mark on a simple checklist when children
                      meet milestones.

                      We observe children every day anyway. We watch what they're doing when
                      they play in the classroom or outside, when they eat, and so on. Monitoring
                      is just that: watching and observing, and recording what you see. Making a
                      check on a list when a child meets a milestone takes about two seconds,
                      and it's easier than just about anything else we do all day. It's definitely
                      easier than getting a room full of toddlers to sleep at naptime, and it's a lot
                      more fun than changing diapers!

                      And if that's all it takes to really make sure each child is on track and to
                      make sure I'm not missing anything in all the hubbub each day, I'm all over
                      it!

                      -Ms. Carolyn (an early childhood educator)33

but here are some examples of children birth to age 5 that showcase typical milestones for
their age.

                   Do you feel like you are less knowledgeable about or have less experience with
                   a specific age of children (refer to Appendix I to see detailed milestones from 2
                   months through 12 years of age)? What can you do to improve your familiarity
                   with the milestones for children that age? Why would this be important?

Developmental screening is a more formal process that uses a validated screening tool at
specific ages to determine if a child's development is on track or whether he or she needs to be
referred for further evaluation.35

Screening alone is not enough to identify a developmental concern. Rather, it helps staff and
families decide whether to refer a child for more evaluation by a qualified professional. The
earlier a possible delay is identified, the earlier a program can refer a child for further
evaluation and additional supports and services.36

Most children with developmental delays are not identified early enough for them to benefit
from early intervention services; early care and education programs can help change that.
Although about 1 in 6 children has a developmental disability, less than half of these children
are identified as having a problem before starting school.

Too often, adults don't recognize the signs of a potential developmental disability, they are not
sure if their concern is warranted, or they don't have resources to help make their concern
easier to talk about. But pinpointing concerns and talking about them is very important to get a
child the help he or she might need.37

Developmental screening involves:
     Research-based, standardized developmental screening tools
     Information from family members, teachers, and other staff who know the child
     Written parental consent before starting the screening
     Communication with families in their home language

Appropriate Screening Tools

When searching for screening tools, keep the following in mind.
     Screening tools must be research-based and designed to be a brief measure of
         development that identifies if the child needs a more in-depth evaluation.
     Screening tools should be
             o Age-appropriate

             o Culturally appropriate
             o Sensitive to the family's home language
             o Used by trained and qualified personnel
             o Valid for the intended results
             o Reliable across users
             o Clearly identified for use in screening

Programs need to make careful and informed decisions about whether to screen a child who is
a dual language learner (DLL) in their home language, English, or both. Some skills may look
different depending on the child's culture and background. Use a screening tool that considers
the child's cultural context. When a culturally appropriate screening tool is not available, asking
families about their child's typical behavior becomes even more critical. This information helps
staff interpret screening results.

Timing

Programs should complete the first developmental screening in the first month or two of care.
Programs may keep track of a child's development with an annual screening after that. Also, a
child and family's primary health care provider may do developmental screening, autism
spectrum disorder screening, and developmental surveillance.

After Screening

These are examples of the next steps a program might take based on the results of the
screening.

         Results: There are no concerns.
         Action: The child participates in ongoing, individualized care. Staff do ongoing child
         assessments.
         Results: The results are unclear or there may be additional concerns.
         Action: The child participates in ongoing, individualized care. Staff do ongoing child
         assessments. The family and staff closely observe the child's development over time to
         decide if they should re-screen or evaluate the child.
         Results: The screening or information collected from family members, teachers, and
         other program staff found some concerns.
         Action: The child participates in ongoing, individualized care. Program staff work with
         the family to refer the child for a free evaluation. Infants and toddlers go to the
         appropriate Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C agency and
         preschool children go to the appropriate Part B agency, usually a school district. Families
         may need support to navigate the referral and evaluation process.38

If a delay or disability is diagnosed, early treatment is important. Speech therapy, physical
therapy, and other services are available in every state for free or at low cost to families.

However, if a developmental concern is not identified early, families can't take advantage of
these services.39

Vision Screening

Families and early care and education staff cannot always tell when a child has trouble seeing.
Observation alone isn't enough. This is why implementing evidence-based vision screening
throughout early childhood is important.

Timely vision screening (coupled with an eye examination2 when indicated) is an important
step toward early detection of any possible vision problems. Early detection can lead to an
effective intervention and help to restore proper vision. Young children rarely complain when
they can't see well because to them, it's normal.

Engaging Families

It is easier for families to partner with early care and education staff and health care providers
when they understand how vision influences their child's development and learning. Preparing
families about what to expect from a vision screening helps them know how to prepare their
child. It is also important to talk about who will have access to their child's screening results.
One of the best ways to promote children's vision health is by developing and implementing
policies and procedures that both define and support ways for staff to collaborate with families.

Include questions on the program's family health history form to identify children who may
have a higher risk of vision problems. For example is there a family history of amblyopia,
strabismus, or early and serious eye disease?

Provide resources to help families learn more about healthy eyes and the importance of early
detection of vision problems. Do families know that it isn't always possible to tell if children
have a vision problem just by looking at their eyes? Or that young children seldom complain
when they can't see well?

In addition to assuring timely vision screening, programs can support children and families who
have been given treatment recommendations from an eye specialist (such as wearing glasses or
patching one eye for amblyopia), as well as reminding families of follow-up visits to the eye
doctor whenever recommended.

                  Figure 7.8 - Programs can support children who wear glasses to correct their vision.40

Rescreening

Programs that perform vision screenings will need to determine when to rescreen children who
do not pass. Some children may be unable to pay attention, cooperate or understand what they
need to do during the first attempt at screening. This is especially true for visual acuity testing.
These children may not have "failed" their vision screening. They may be considered
"untestable."

Research shows that preschool children who are "untestable" are almost twice as likely to have
a vision problem as those who successfully pass a screening. They should be rescreened as soon
as possible, but not longer than 6 months later. If a child fails or is untestable at the second
attempt, consider referring the child for a full eye examination.

Ongoing Care

It is important to remember that screening only provides a vision assessment at one moment in
time. Occasionally a family member or teacher will identify a new or different vision concern
after a child has been previously screened. In addition, as children grow their eyes change and
new signs of an eye problem or blurred vision can arise as they mature. Programs should
address this new concern with the parent and the health care provider promptly.41

Hearing Screening

Families and early care and education staff cannot always tell when a child is deaf or hard of
hearing. Observation alone isn't enough. This is why implementing evidence-based hearing
screening throughout early childhood is important.

Hearing helps us communicate with others and understand the world around us. However,
about 2 to 3 of every 1,000 children in the United States are born deaf or hard of hearing. A

child may also experience a decline in hearing ability at any time caused by illness, physical
trauma, or environmental or genetic factors. It is estimated that the incidence of permanent
hearing loss doubles by the time children enter school. A child may have difficulty hearing in
one ear or both ears. The difficulty may be temporary or permanent. It may be mild or it may
be a complete inability to hear spoken language and other important sounds.
Any inability to hear clearly can get in the way of a child's speech, language, social and
emotional development, and school readiness. Intervention may improve social and emotional
and academic achievement when children who are deaf or hard of hearing are identified early.

                                  Figure 7.9 - This child is undergoing a hearing screening. 42

An evidence-based hearing screening is a way to identify children who need an evaluation to
determine if they are deaf or hard of hearing. Prior to discharge from the hospital, almost all
newborns are screened and an evaluation is necessary for those who do not pass the screening.

Engaging Families

It is easier for families to partner with early care and education staff and health care providers
when they understand how hearing influences their child's speech and language development,
socialization, and learning. Preparing families about what to expect from a hearing screening
helps them know how to prepare their child. It is also important to talk about who will have
access to their child's screening results. When a child does not pass a hearing screening,
programs can provide support to help families follow up with referrals and any recommended
treatment. If a child is identified as deaf or hard of hearing, collaboration between the family,
the early care and education program, and the child's audiologist and other early intervention
providers will be helpful. Share information with the family about the importance of hearing for

children's language development and communication. This supports a family's health literacy,
and it may help them complete the follow-up steps.

Rescreening

If your program performs a hearing screening and a child does not pass, it is important for you
to collaborate with and support the family to complete all recommended follow-up steps.

     The child is typically screened a second time within about 2 weeks.
     If the child does not pass, the child should be referred to a health care provider for a

         middle ear evaluation. A health care provider can diagnose and treat common problems
         such as earwax buildup or middle ear infections. A third screening is necessary after the
         medical examination.
     If a child still does not pass, programs should recommend for a referral to a pediatric
         audiologist for a complete diagnostic evaluation.

It is also important for programs to support families to follow up if the program obtains results
from the child's health care provider indicating that the child did not pass a hearing screening.43

                Pause to Reflect

                   Do you remember getting your vision or hearing screened during your
                   childhood? If you were diagnosed with vision or hearing impairments, how
                   was it discovered? At what age did that happen?

Lead Screening

Lead screening measures the level of lead in the blood. Lead is a poison that is very dangerous
for young children because of their small size and rapid growth and development. It can cause
anemia, learning difficulties, and other medical problems.

Children can inhale or swallow lead through exposure to:
     Home or child care environments, including those:
     Built before 1960 with peeling paint or renovation
     Located near a highway or lead industry
     Family members who work with lead or have been treated for lead poisoning
     Imported ceramic pottery for cooking, storing, or serving food
     Home remedies with lead
     Certain candies, which may contain high levels of lead in the wrapper or stick. Be
         cautious when providing imported candies to children.
     Eating paint chips or dirt
     Water pumped through lead-based pipes

Lead screening involves a blood lead test, from a finger stick or a venous blood draw. It is
recommended at 12 months and 24 months of age. Children from 3 to 6 years of age should
have their blood tested if they have not been tested

Symptoms of Lead Poisoning

Most children with lead poisoning show no symptoms. However, you might notice:
     Developmental delay
     Learning Difficulties
     Irritability
     Headaches
     Poor appetite or stomachache
     Weight loss
     Fatigue and sluggishness
     Slow growth and development
     Vomiting
     Constipation
     Hearing loss

Follow-Up to Lead Screening

New recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) state that if
screening indicates a lead level of five micrograms per deciliter or more, the child should be
referred to a health professional. 44

Lead has negative outcomes on a variety of things, including:
     Attention (easily distracted, challenges with sustained attention, hyperactivity)
     executive functions (problems with planning, impulse control, flexible thinking, etc.)
     visual-spatial skills (problems related to visual perception, memory, organization, and
         reasoning with visually presented information)
     social behavior (aggression, disruptive behavior, poor self-regulation)
     speech and language (problems with phonological and sentence processing and spoken
         word recognition)
     fine and gross motor skills (unsteadiness, clumsiness, and problems with coordination,
         visual-motor control, and dexterity)45

Depending on the effects of lead poisoning, early care and education programs can implement
intervention services to support the child. Other treatments include:

     Nutrition counseling
     Iron supplements

Social and Emotional and Behavioral Screening

Young children are learning to get along with others and manage their own emotions. When a
child enters a program, staff get to know what social and emotional skills children are working
on. They can use social and emotional or behavioral screening tools to gather that
information.47

                                      Figure 7.10 - Screening will help you provide optimal
                                       support for children's social and emotional health.48

Social and emotional health--the ability to form strong relationships, solve problems, and
express and manage emotions--is critical for school readiness and lifelong success. Without it,
young children are more likely to:

     Have difficulty experiencing or showing emotions, which may lead to withdrawal from
         social activities and maintaining distance from others

     Have trouble making friends and getting along with others
     Have behaviors, such as biting, hitting, using unkind words, or bullying--behaviors that

         often lead to difficulty with learning, suspension or expulsion, and later school dropout49

More information about this topic can be found in other parts of this book. Behavior has been
addressed in Chapter 3 in the section on Interpersonal Safety and children's mental health is
the focus of Chapter 11.

Summary

By keeping accurate records, conducting daily health checks, supporting children's
development of good dental hygiene, and by providing for individual children's sleep needs
early care and education programs can help promote good health on a daily basis. When
programs monitor and screen children, they can ensure that conditions or situations that might
interfere with a child's health or well-being can be identified and supports put in place to
mitigate potential negative effects.

                Healthy Schools Act

                   A California law called the Healthy Schools Act requires certain rules to be
                   followed when anyone applies pesticides at the child care facility.1

Introduction

Science and experience tell us that infectious disease, especially gastrointestinal disease, which
means vomiting and diarrhea, and respiratory disease, including coughs, colds, sore throats,
and runny noses, are increased among children who are cared for in out-of-home group

settings. In addition, such children may be at increased risk for certain other infections that may
be transmitted by insects or by body fluids. It's also true that children who are cared for in
group out-of-home settings are more likely to experience infectious illnesses that are more
severe and more prolonged (although 90% of those infections are mild and self-limited,
requiring no special treatment).
But there's good news, too. Infectious illnesses such as pneumonia and influenza, which
together were the leading causes of death among U.S. children in the early 20th century, have
declined 99.7 percent. Common childhood illnesses such as diphtheria, whooping cough,
measles, mumps, and rubella are rare except in communities where immunization rates are
low, and polio is unheard of in our country today.
Although younger children are more susceptible to infectious illness because their immune
systems are immature, as they grow older, the incidents of infectious disease decreases as their
immune systems mature. Furthermore, children who experience more infectious disease at an
early age in group out-of-home care have a decreasing incidence of infectious disease as they
grow older. In fact, they have less infectious illnesses in kindergarten than children who were
taken care of exclusively at home. Illness also decreases with years of attendance in out-of-
home early care and education settings.

                                   Figure 8.1 - As children get older, they get sick less often.2

There are negative consequences of childhood illness, including:
     It's unpleasant to be sick (for children or the adults that may also become infected).
     Illnesses that are minor in children can be much more serious for adults and pregnant
         women.

     Some illnesses have severe effects (and can even be life-threatening).
     There are short-term medical costs.
     There may also be additional child care costs or lost wages for parents/caregivers of

         children that must be excluded from group care.
     Overuse of antibiotics in an effort to get children well contributes to antibiotic

         resistance among common bacteria.

To prevent illness we need to understand the different ways illness is spread, how
immunizations protect children, and what universal precautions early care and education
program staff can take to prevent the spread of illness.

How Illnesses are Transmitted

Bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites that cause illness can be transmitted in five ways,
including through:

    1. the respiratory route
    2. the fecal-oral route
    3. the direct contact route
    4. the bodily fluid route (including blood, urine, vomit, and saliva)
    5. the vector-borne route

Respiratory Transmission

Most respiratory germs stay in the nose, sinuses, mouth and throat, or possibly the middle ear.
Upper respiratory illnesses (colds) are the most common and the most likely to be transmitted
in early care and education settings.

The more common respiratory illnesses include:
     Sinusitis
     Sore throat
     Common cold
     Recurrent middle ear infection
     Strep throat
     RSV
     Pneumonia
     Bronchitis

Pneumonia and bronchitis are rarely the result of an infection picked up in an early education
setting. We also have immunizations for many respiratory diseases that are rarely transmitted
in early care and education settings today, including:

     Mumps
     Measles
     Bacterial meningitis
     Chicken pox

     Diphtheria
     Pertussis
     Pneumonia
     Seasonal flu

If we could actually see what comes out of a child's mouth along with a cough or a sneeze, we
might appreciate the respiratory route of infectious disease transmission more.

                   Figure 8.4 - What it might look like if we could see what a child coughs or sneezes.3

The germs that are in this contaminated cloud of exhalation can wind up on surfaces and hands
and be transmitted to others. Staff and children who are able to are encouraged to cough into
their sleeves. Covering your mouth with your hand only transfers these germs to your hand.
This will be addressed more in depth later in the chapter.

Fecal-Oral Transmission

When organisms that live in our intestines get into our mouths they can cause illness. Usually,
this happens via someone's hands, usually our own. Fecal-oral routes diseases include:

     Hepatitis A
     diarrhea
     hand, foot, and mouth disease
     pinworms
     rotavirus
     norovirus
     giardia
     shigella
     cryptosporidiosis

That is why it is so important that everyone wash hands after using the bathroom, changing
diapers, when preparing food, and before eating.

Food Poisoning

E. coli and salmonella are two of the germs that you may also have heard mentioned in the
news when grocery stores send back fresh vegetables, meat, or poultry. These organisms
originate with farm animals themselves and they can cause diarrhea and vomiting if children or
staff eat contaminated food. Properly preparing and serving fresh produce, meat, and poultry is
essential to prevent food poisoning.

Direct Contact Transmission

Direct contact with another person's skin (or hair) puts infants and children at risk of illnesses
such as:

     cold sores
     conjunctivitis
     pink eye
     impetigo
     lice
     scabies
     ringworm (a fungus, not a worm).

Bodily Fluid Transmission

Bodily fluids, including saliva, urine, vomit, and blood, can cause illness, such as:
     Dental caries (by saliva)
     Cytomegalovirus or CMV (by urine)
     Hepatitis B (preventable by vaccine)
     Hepatitis C (rare in children)
     HIV (no cases of transmission in an early education setting)

Vector-Borne Transmission

A vector is a living thing that can transmit disease. We know, for example, that ticks can
transmit Lyme disease and Rocky Mountain spotted fever. Fleas are known to transmit Bubonic
plague and typhus. Mosquitoes can infect people with St. Louis encephalitis (SLE), dengue
fever, Zika virus, and West Nile disease. Rats and mice can transmit leptospirosis, trichinosis,
hantavirus, and bacterial food poisoning. Raccoons can spread raccoon roundworm.

               Figure 8.5 - Cases of disease caused by mosquitos and ticks in California from 2004-2016.4

While these illnesses are relatively uncommon, the risk reminds us of the importance of
     utilizing integrated pest management techniques to keep insects and rodents out of
         buildings (covered later in this chapter)
     using insect repellant specifically recommended for children during outdoor activities
     removing standing water in which mosquitoes can lay their eggs
     checking for and removing ticks (addressed in Figure 4.10) in centers when children
         come back in after playing in or near heavily wooded areas5

                Pause to Reflect

                   Why is it important to understand how illnesses and diseases are spread?

Immunizations

Prevention of infectious disease starts with immunizations (or vaccines). Immunizations are
considered the number one public health intervention of the 20th century and one of the top
10 interventions of the first decade of the 21st century.6

On-time vaccination throughout childhood is essential because it helps provide immunity
before children are exposed to potentially life-threatening diseases. Vaccines are tested to

ensure that they are safe and effective for children to receive at the recommended ages.7 See
Figure 8.X for the current schedule of immunizations.
Fully vaccinated children in the U.S. are protected against sixteen potentially harmful diseases
(see Figure 8.X). Vaccine-preventable diseases can be very serious, may require hospitalization,
or even be deadly -- especially in infants and young children.8
Here is the schedule from the CDC to ensure a child is fully vaccinated:

How Vaccines Work

The immune system helps the human body fight germs by producing substances to combat
them. Once it does, the immune system "remembers" the germ and can fight it again. Vaccines
contain germs that have been killed or weakened. When given to a healthy person, the vaccine
triggers the immune system to respond and thus build immunity.

Before vaccines, people became immune only by actually getting a disease and surviving it.
Immunizations are an easier and less risky way to become immune.

Vaccines are the best defense we have against serious, preventable, and sometimes deadly
contagious diseases. Vaccines are some of the safest medical products available, but like any
other medical product, there may be risks. Accurate information about the value of vaccines as
well as their possible side effects helps people to make informed decisions about vaccination.

Potential Side Effects

Vaccines, like all medical products, may cause side effects in some people. Most of these side
effects are minor, such as redness or swelling at the injection site. Read further to learn about
possible side effects of vaccines.

201 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
Any vaccine can cause side effects. For the most part, these are minor (for example, a sore arm
or low-grade fever) and go away within a few days.11 Serious side effects after vaccination, such
as severe allergic reaction, are very rare.12

Remember, vaccines are continually monitored for safety, and like any medication, vaccines can
cause side effects. However, a decision not to immunize a child also involves risk and could put
the child and others who come into contact with him or her at risk of contracting a potentially
deadly disease.

How Well Do Vaccines Work?

Vaccines work really well. No medicine is perfect, of course, but most childhood vaccines
produce immunity about 90-100% of the time.
What about the argument made by some people that vaccines don't work that well and that
diseases would be going away on their own because of better hygiene or sanitation, even if
there were no vaccines?

That simply isn't true. Certainly better hygiene and sanitation can help prevent the spread of
disease, but the germs that cause disease will still be around, and as long as they are they will
continue to make people sick.

All vaccines must be licensed (approved) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before
being used in the United States, and a vaccine must go through extensive testing to show that it
works and that it is safe before the FDA will approve it. Among these tests are clinical trials,
which compare groups of people who get a vaccine with groups of people who get a control. A
vaccine is approved only if FDA makes the determination that it is safe and effective for its
intended use.

If you look at the history of any vaccine-preventable disease, you will virtually always see that
the number of cases of disease starts to drop when a vaccine is licensed. Vaccines are the most
effective tool we have to prevent infectious diseases.

Opposition to Vaccines

In 2010, a pertussis (whooping cough) outbreak in California sickened 9,143 people and
resulted in 10 infant deaths: the worst outbreak in 63 years (Centers for Disease Control
2011b). Researchers, suspecting that the primary cause of the outbreak was the waning
strength of pertussis vaccines in older children, recommended a booster vaccination for 11-12-
year-olds and also for pregnant women (Zacharyczuk 2011). Pertussis is most serious for babies;
one in five needs to be hospitalized, and since they are too young for the vaccine themselves, it
is crucial that people around them be immunized (Centers for Disease Control 2011b). Several

states, including California, have been requiring the pertussis booster for older children in
recent years with the hope of staving off another outbreak.

But what about people who do not want their children to have this vaccine, or any other? That
question is at the heart of a debate that has been simmering for years. Vaccines are biological
preparations that improve immunity against a certain disease. Vaccines have contributed to the
eradication and weakening of numerous infectious diseases, including smallpox, polio, mumps,
chickenpox, and meningitis.

                                   Figure 8.7 - These two young children contracted polio.13

However, many people express concern about the potential negative side effects of vaccines.
These concerns range from fears about overloading the child's immune system to controversial
reports about devastating side effects of the vaccines.14

Although children continue to get several vaccines up to their second birthday, these vaccines
do not overload the immune system. Every day, an infant's healthy immune system successfully
fights off thousands of antigens - the parts of germs that cause their immune system to
respond. Even if your child receives several vaccines in one day, vaccines contain only a tiny
amount of antigens compared to the antigens your baby encounters every day.

This is the case even if your child receives combination vaccines. Combination vaccines take two
or more vaccines that could be given individually and put them into one shot. Children get the
same protection as they do from individual vaccines given separately--but with fewer shots.15
One misapprehension is that the vaccine itself might cause the disease it is supposed to be
immunizing against.16 Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection, but this

"imitation" infection does not cause illness. Instead, it causes the immune system to develop
the same response as it does to a real infection so the body can recognize and fight the vaccine-
preventable disease in the future. Sometimes, after getting a vaccine, the imitation infection
can cause minor symptoms, such as fever. Such minor symptoms are normal and should be
expected as the body builds immunity.17

Another commonly circulated concern is that vaccinations, specifically the MMR vaccine (MMR
stands for measles, mumps, and rubella), are linked to autism. The autism connection has been
particularly controversial. In 1998, a British physician named Andrew Wakefield published a
study in Great Britain's Lancet magazine that linked the MMR vaccine to autism. The report
received a lot of media attention, resulting in British immunization rates decreasing from 91
percent in 1997 to almost 80 percent by 2003, accompanied by a subsequent rise in measles
cases (Devlin 2008). A prolonged investigation by the British Medical Journal proved that not
only was the link in the study nonexistent, but that Dr. Wakefield had falsified data in order to
support his claims (CNN 2011). Dr. Wakefield was discredited and stripped of his license, but
the doubt still lingers in many parents' minds.

In the United States, many parents still believe in the now-discredited MMR-autism link and
refuse to vaccinate their children. Other parents choose not to vaccinate for various reasons
like religious or health beliefs. In one instance, a boy whose parents opted not to vaccinate
returned home to the U.S. after a trip abroad; no one yet knew he was infected with measles.
The boy exposed 839 people to the disease and caused 11 additional cases of measles, all in
other unvaccinated children, including one infant who had to be hospitalized.

                                                Figure 8.8 - An infant with measles18

According to a study published in Pediatrics (2010), the outbreak cost the public sector $10,376
per diagnosed case. The study further showed that the intentional non-vaccination of those
infected occurred in students from private schools, public charter schools, and public schools in
upper-socioeconomic areas (Sugerman et al. 2010).19

                   What about the Flu Vaccine?

                       There are many reasons to get an influenza (flu) vaccine each year. Below is a
                       summary of the benefits of flu vaccination, and selected scientific studies that
                       support these benefits.

                            Flu vaccination can keep you from getting sick with flu.
                            Flu vaccination can reduce the risk of flu-associated hospitalization.
                            Flu vaccination is an important preventive tool for people with chronic

                                health conditions.
                            Flu vaccination helps protect women during and after pregnancy and

                                helps protect the baby from flu for several months after birth.
                            Flu vaccination can be life-saving in children.
                            Flu vaccination has been shown in several studies to reduce the

                                severity of illness in people who get vaccinated but still get sick.
                            Getting vaccinated yourself may also protect people around you,

                                including those who are more vulnerable to serious flu illness, like
                                babies and young children, older people, and people with certain
                                chronic health conditions.20

                                                   Figure 8.9 - What does into the flu vaccine each year.21

                Pause to Reflect

                   Using the information that has been provided about immunizations, think of
                   ways you could respond to the following:

                        1. "I don't believe in giving all of the vaccines, like chicken pox. It's better
                            for children to just get the disease like we all did when we were kids."

                        2. "Why do they have to give vaccines so early? It seems like it's too much,
                            too quickly."

                        3. "I have heard that vaccines give some kids autism. And even if they
                            don't, the side effects are just too scary."

Universal Precautions to Prevent the Spread of Illness

There are some standard practices that prevent, or reduce the risk of, the spread of illness in
early care and education programs. These are modeled after practices in health care, where
everyone is treated as being potentially infected with something that is contagious. Many
illnesses are actually contagious before the infected person is symptomatic, so waiting until you
see signs of illness is an ineffective way of preventing its spread. Child care providers can
practice these four things to help control the spread of illness.

    1. Hand washing
    2. Use of disposable nonporous gloves when working with bodily fluids
    3. Disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces
    4. Proper disposal of potentially contaminated waste22

Handwashing

Regular handwashing is an important step to minimizing the spread of germs. Hands pick up
germs from all of the things they touch and then spread them from one place to another.
Germs that are on hands can also enter the body when a person eats or when they touch their
eyes, nose, mouth, or any area on the body where the skin is broken (because of a cut, rash,
etc.).

All that is needed for handwashing is soap and clean, running water. Handwashing with soap
and water removes visible dirt and hidden germs. Studies have demonstrated that
handwashing reduced the number of diarrheal illnesses by 31 percent and respiratory illnesses
by 21 percent.

Hands should be washed:
     before eating, feeding, or preparing food. This prevents germs from getting into the
         mouth from hands. (Hygiene practices related specifically to food safety will be
         addressed in Chapter 15.)

     after touching saliva (after feeding or eating), mucus (wiping a nose, using a tissue),
         bodily fluids (toileting, diapering), food, or animals

     when visibly dirty, after touching garbage, or after cleaning

The Center for Disease Control recommends the following handwashing steps:
    1. "Wet your hands with clean, running water (warm or cold) and apply soap."
    2. "Rub your hands together to make a lather and scrub your hands well; be sure to scrub
         the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your nails."
    3. "Continue rubbing your hands for at least 20 seconds. Need a timer? Hum the "Happy
         Birthday" song from beginning to end twice."
    4. "Rinse your hands well under running water."
    5. "Dry your hands using a clean towel or air dry them."

                                   Figure 8.10 - Illustrations of the 5 steps of handwashing.23

Infants and young children will need help with handwashing. Caring for Our Children
recommends that caregivers:

     Safely cradle an infant in one arm to wash their hands at a sink.
     Provide assistance with handwashing for young children that cannot yet wash their

         hands independently.
     Offer a stepping stool to young children so they may safely reach the sink.24

Wearing Disposable Gloves

Teachers and caregivers should wear gloves when they anticipate coming into contact with any
of the following (on a child's body or a contaminated surface)

     Blood or bodily substances (i.e., fluids or solids)
     Mucous membranes (e.g., nasal, oral, genital area)
     Non-intact skin (e.g., rashes or cuts and scrapes)25

Once the gloves are soiled, it's important to remove them carefully.
    1. Using a gloved hand, grasp the palm area of the other gloved hand and peel off the first
         glove.
    2. Hold the removed glove in the gloved hand.

    3. Slide fingers of the ungloved hand under the remaining glove at the wrist and peel off
         the second glove over the first glove.

    4. Discard the gloves in a waste container.26

                                                 Figure 8.11 - Safe glove removal.27

After you remove your gloves you should wash your hands. "Do not reuse the gloves: this can
spread germs from one child to another...Gloves provide added protection from communicable
disease only if used correctly. If you use gloves incorrectly, you actually risk spreading more
germs than if you don't use gloves at all. Pay attention to your gloving technique so that you do
not develop a false sense of security (and carelessness) when wearing gloves."28

Cleaning and Disinfecting

Washing Surfaces Germs spread onto surfaces from hands and objects (tissues or mouthed
toys) or from a sneeze or cough. It is important to clean all surfaces well, including toys and any
surface that a young child puts in his mouth, because germs cannot be seen and it is easy to
overlook surfaces that do not look soiled or dirty.

Toileting and diapering involve germs from bodily fluids and fecal material. These germs spread
easily in a bathroom onto hands, flushers, and faucets. Routinely washing bathroom surfaces
removes most germs and prevents them from spreading. The kitchen is another area of the
home where it is important to clean surfaces well.

The terms "cleaning," "sanitizing," and "disinfecting" deserve close attention.
         Cleaning removes visible soil, dirt, and germs. Soap and water will clean most surfaces.
         Sanitizing reduces, but does not totally get rid of, germs to a level that is unlikely to
         cause disease. Sanitizers may be appropriate to use on surfaces where you eat (such as

a table or high chair tray) and with toys that children place in their mouths. It is
important to follow the instructions on the label, which may also include rinsing
surfaces after using the sanitizing product.
Disinfecting destroys or inactivates infectious germs on surfaces. Disinfectants may be
used on diaper-changing tables, toilets, and counter tops.29

Early care and education programs can create a bleach and water solution of one tablespoon
household bleach to one quart water for surfaces that need to be sanitized or disinfected. To
use effectively, the surface must be wetted with the solution and allowed to air dry. A fresh
bleach solution should be made each day to maintain effectiveness, and stored in a clearly
labeled spray bottle out of children's reach. Research shows that other chemicals (e.g.,
ammonia, vinegar, baking soda, Borax) are not effective against some bacteria.30 "Items that
can be washed in a dishwasher or hot cycle of a washing machine do not have to be disinfected
because these machines use water that is hot enough for a long enough period of time to kill
most germs."31

Cleaning and disinfecting are essential. Studies have shown that some germs, including
influenza virus, can survive on surfaces for two to eight hours; rotavirus can survive up to 10
days.32

Disposal of Waste

Proper disposal and storage of garbage waste prevent the spread of disease, odors, and
problems with pests. Disposable items (diapers, gloves, paper towels, and facial tissues) should
be thrown away immediately in an appropriate container. Make sure the container is water and
rodent-proof, operated with a foot pedal, is lined with a plastic bag, within reach of diaper
changing area, handwashing sink, and food preparation areas, out-of-reach of and unable to be
knocked over by infants and toddlers. The containers should be emptied, cleaned, and sanitized
daily. 34

Diaper Changing

Diaper changing areas should be smooth and nonporous (such as a plastic-covered pad), have a
raised edge to prevent children from falling, be near a sink, be out of reach from children, and
away from food preparation areas.35

The following diaper changing procedure should be posted in the changing area and followed to
protect the health and safety of children and staff:

         Step 1: Before bringing the child to the diaper changing area, perform hand hygiene
         (including putting on gloves, if using) and bring supplies to the diaper changing area, and
         place a disposable liner on the changing area.
         Step 2: Carry/bring the child to the changing table/surface, keeping soiled clothing away
         from you and any surfaces you cannot easily clean and sanitize after the change. Always
         keep a hand on the child.
         Step 3: Remove the soiled diaper and clothing without contaminating any surface not
         already in contact with stool or urine. Put soiled diaper in covered waste container. Put
         any soiled clothing in a plastic bag that is securely closed to give to family.
         Step 4: Clean the child's diaper area with disposable wipes and place soiled wipes into a
         covered waste container.
         Step 5: Removed the disposable liner and gloves and place in waste container
         Step 6: Use facial tissue to apply any creams or ointments. Slide clean diaper under the
         child and fasten it and dress the child.
         Step 6: Wash the child's hands and return the child to a supervised area.
         Step 7: Clean and disinfect the diaper-changing surface and any equipment or supplies
         that were touched (and any other area child soiled before changed).
         Step 8: Perform hand hygiene and record the diaper change, diaper contents, and/or
         any problems.

Caregivers/teachers should never leave a child unattended on a table or countertop. A safety
strap or harness should not be used on the diaper changing table/surface.36

                   If Using Potty Chairs

                       Due to being hard to clean and disinfect, potty chairs are not ideal in a
                       child care environment. If they are used, they should be used in the
                       bathroom only. After each use:

                            Empty contents immediately into the toilet
                            Rinse with water and dump water into the toilet
                            Wash with soap and water (with a paper towel) and empty

                                soapy water into the toilet
                            Rinse again and empty into the toilet

Environmental Health

Sometimes the threat to health comes from the environment itself. Air quality, chemical
hazards, drinking water, mold, and pest management are all topics early care and education
providers should be aware of.

Outdoor Air Quality

Children are more susceptible to the effects of contaminated air because they breathe in more
oxygen relative to their body weight than adults.38 Therefore, they "can be exposed to a lot of
pollution. Children should be kept inside when air quality is poor, or should at least be
discouraged from intense outdoor activity. Educators and parents should be aware that nearby
construction and traffic can increase pollution. Mowing school lawns should never occur during
school hours since this can cause an allergy or asthma attack. Insecticides should never be
sprayed while children are in care. Outdoor air can include odors, pollutants from vehicles, and
fumes from stored trash, chemicals, and plumbing vents."39

Indoor Air Quality

There are so many sources of indoor air pollution in childcare facilities that the air is considered
to be two to five times more polluted than outdoor air. Common sources of indoor air pollution
include combustion sources such as oil, gas, kerosene, coal, wood, and tobacco products;
building materials and furnishings as diverse as deteriorated, asbestos-containing insulation,
wet or damp carpet, and cabinetry or furniture made of certain pressed wood products;
products for household cleaning and maintenance, personal care, or hobbies; central heating

                   Environmental Tobacco Smoke & Dangers of E-Cigarettes

                                  Figure 8.12 - Secondhand smoke is dangerous to young children.41

                       Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), otherwise known as secondhand
                       smoke, is a mixture of the smoke given off by the burning end of a
                       cigarette, or cigar, and the smoke exhaled by smokers. Secondhand
                       smoke contains more than 4,000 substances, several of which are known
                       to cause cancer.

                       Children are particularly vulnerable to the effects of secondhand smoke
                       because they are still developing physically, have higher breathing rates
                       than adults, and have little control over their environment, including
                       where and when the adults in their world choose to smoke. Exposure to
                       secondhand smoke can cause asthma, and places infants and children at
                       increased risk for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), pneumonia,
                       bronchitis, and middle ear infections.42

                       What About E-Cigarettes?
                       The aerosol from e-cigarettes is not harmless. It can contain harmful and
                       potentially harmful chemicals, including nicotine; ultrafine particles that
                       can be inhaled deep into the lungs; flavoring such diacetyl, a chemical
                       linked to a serious lung disease; volatile organic compounds such as
                       benzene, which is found in car exhaust; and heavy metals, such as nickel,
                       tin, and lead.

                                       Figure 8.13 - Secondhand smoke from e-cigarettes isn't safe either. 43

                       Scientists are still working to understand more fully the health effects
                       and harmful doses of e-cigarette contents when they are heated and
                       turned into an aerosol, both for active users who inhale from a device
                       and for those who are exposed to the aerosol secondhand. Another risk
                       to consider involves defective e-cigarette batteries that have been
                       known to cause fires and explosions, some of which have resulted in
                       serious injuries. Most of the explosions happened when the e-cigarette
                       batteries were being charged.44

Mold

Mold is a fungus that thrives indoors when excessive moisture or water accumulates indoors or
when moisture problems remain undiscovered or un-addressed. There are molds that can grow
on wood, paper, carpet, and foods. There is no practical way to eliminate all mold and mold
spores in the indoor environment. The way to control indoor mold growth is to control
moisture.

Mold needs to be controlled in childcare settings to avoid possible health impacts for infants
and children, including allergic reactions, asthma, and other respiratory issues.45

Integrated Pest Management

Exposure to pests such as cockroaches, rodents, ants, and stinging insects in childcare centers
may place children at risk for disease, asthma attacks, bites, and stings. Improper use of
pesticides can also place children at risk. A recent study of pesticide use in child care centers
revealed that 75% of centers reported at least one pesticide application in the last year. Several
factors increase both children's exposures and their vulnerability to these exposures compared
to adults. Children spend more time on the floor, where residues can transfer to skin and be
absorbed.

Young children also frequently place their hands and objects in their mouths, resulting in the
non-dietary ingestion of pesticides. Children are less developed immunologically,
physiologically, and neurologically, and therefore may be more susceptible to the adverse
effects of chemicals and toxins. There is increasing evidence of adverse effects of pesticides on
young children, particularly on neurodevelopment.46

Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an effective and environmentally sensitive approach to
pest management that relies on a combination of common-sense practices. IPM programs use
current, comprehensive information on the life cycles of pests and their interaction with the
environment.

Integrated Pest Management "(IPM) is a safer, more effective, longer-lasting method of pest
control that emphasizes pest prevention by eliminating pests' access to food, water, and
shelter. When using IPM, properly identify the pest and know why it's there so an appropriate
combination of different pest control methods can be used for better effectiveness in
controlling the pest."47 This information, in combination with the last toxic available pest
control methods, is used to manage pest damage by the most economical means, and with the
least possible hazard to people, property, and the environment.48

                  Figure 8.14 - Using traps can help a program determine what insects they are dealing
                  with in order to take the most effective and least hazardous steps to get rid of them.49

Chemical Hazards

A child born today will grow up exposed to more chemicals than a child from any other
generation in our nation's history. Of the 85,000 synthetic chemicals in commerce today, only a

A 2005 study found 287 different chemicals in cord blood of 10 newborn babies - chemicals
from pesticides, fast food packaging, coals, gasoline emissions, and trash incineration. Children
are more vulnerable to toxic chemicals because their bodies are still growing and developing.50

Plastics in Child Care Settings

Certain types of plastics contain chemicals such as phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), and polystyrene that may be toxic to children. These plastics can be found in
baby bottles, sippy cups, teething rings, pacifiers, and toys. When these items are in a child's
mouth or when they are heated (such as in a microwave), children can be exposed to harmful
chemicals that have the potential to mimic or suppress hormones and disrupt normal growth
and development.51

Drinking Water

The United States has one of the safest public drinking water supplies in the world. Over 286
million Americans get their tap water from a community water system. The US Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulates drinking water quality in public water systems and sets
maximum concentration levels for water chemicals and pollutants.

Sources of drinking water are subject to contamination and require appropriate treatment to
remove disease-causing contaminants. Contamination of drinking water supplies can occur in
the source water as well as in the distribution system after water treatment has already
occurred. There are many sources of water contamination, including naturally occurring
chemicals and minerals (for example, arsenic, radon, uranium), local land use practices
(fertilizers, pesticides, concentrated feeding operations), manufacturing processes, and sewer
overflows or wastewater releases.

The presence of contaminants in water can lead to adverse health effects, including
gastrointestinal illness, reproductive problems, and neurological disorders.52 Young children are
at particular risk for exposure to contaminants in drinking water because, pound for pound,
they drink more water than adults (including water used to prepare formula), and because their
immature body systems are less efficient at detoxification. Exposure to lead in drinking water is
a serious health concern, especially for young children and infants since elevated lead levels in
children may result in delays in physical or mental development, lower IQ, and even brain
damage.53

Under the federal regulations of the Safe Drinking Water Act, all water suppliers must notify
consumers quickly when there is a serious problem with water quality. Water systems serving
the same people year-round must provide annual consumer confidence reports on the source
and quality of their tap water. National drinking water standards are legally enforceable, which
means that both U.S. EPA and states can take enforcement actions against water systems not
meeting safety standards. 55

                Pause to Reflect

                   What are five important things that early care and education programs should
                   remember about environmental health to keep children healthy?

Summary

Understanding how illness is spread, helps early care and education programs prevent the
spread of illness. Immunizations also play an important role in preventing illness. And when
program staff use universal precautions, including handwashing, cleaning and disinfecting, and
proper disposal of waste, they also prevent the spread of illness.

Programs must also be aware of environmental hazards that present a threat to children's
health. These include both indoor and outdoor air quality, mold, and chemicals. Programs
should use integrated pest management and make sure that their drinking water is safe as well.

                Engaging Families

                   Teachers can use the following strategies to help families to develop their
                   children's health habits:

                         Provide families with concise, accurate information about ways to
                            promote and develop good health habits in children; information
                            should be presented in English and the families' home languages.
                            Capture their interest by addressing topics related to their children's
                            age and development, as well as topics related to common health risks
                            for children, such as childhood obesity, asthma, and dental caries.
                            Injury prevention and first-aid topics, such as treating burns, bleeding,
                            and choking, are also relevant. Provide written informational materials
                            that are brief and easy to read.

                         Provide individualized information, as well as general health
                            information, to all families through daily contact, workshops, and
                            parent meetings. All information should be presented in English and in
                            the families' home languages. Accommodate family schedules by
                            providing workshops and meetings at various times (e.g., morning,
                            afternoon, evening), and arrange for child care during meetings.

                         Show family members what the children are learning by sending home
                            examples of work, encouraging families to visit the preschool and
                            observe children in action, and sharing children's portfolios during
                            home visits. Reinforce children's learning about health habits through
                            take-home activities, lending libraries of read-aloud books in the
                            languages of the families in the group, and displays of children's work.

                         As you introduce health routines (e.g., handwashing, tooth brushing),
                            invite family members to participate and model. Encourage families to
                            contribute ideas or materials to interest areas that reflect diverse
                            health habits at home.

                         Identify community resources related to health habits (e.g.,
                            handwashing, tooth brushing) and invite community personnel to
                            participate in and bring resources to family workshops or parent
                            meetings. Emphasize the role of home and family members in helping
                            children to develop health habits, and inform all parents of the
                            availability of free and low-cost community resources.

                         Be sensitive to and respectful of different values or beliefs, as well as
                            varying levels of access to health products and services. Gather
                            information on available and accessible resources in the community,
                            including those for children with special needs, and provide this
                            information to all families, translated into their home languages.

   Chapter 9: Supportive Health Care

Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
     Identify symptoms of infectious disease that is common during early childhood.
     Outline criteria for exclusion from care for ill children and staff.
     Describe considerations programs must make regarding caring for children that are
         mildly ill.
     Recall licensing requirements for handling medication in early care and education
         programs.
     Explain the communication about illness that should happen between families and early
         care and education programs.

Licensing Regulations

Title 22 Regulations that relate to this chapter include:

101212 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
   The licensee shall report specified illnesses to the local
      department of health

101226  HEALTH-RELATED SERVICES

 The licensee shall immediately notify the child's authorized

representative if the child becomes ill.

 The licensee shall make prompt arrangements for obtaining

medical treatment for any child as necessary.

 In centers where the licensee chooses to handle medication:

         Medications must be kept inaccessible to children.

         Prescription medications must be administered in

        accordance with the label directions as prescribed by

        the child's physician and there must be written approval

        and instructions from the child's authorized

        representative before giving medication to the child.

         Nonprescription medications must be administered in

        accordance with the product label and there must be

        written approval and instructions from the child's

        authorized representative before giving medication to

        the child.

101226.2 ISOLATION FOR ILLNESS
     A center shall be equipped to isolate and care for any child who
        becomes ill during the day.

220 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                               The child's authorized representative shall be notified
                                   immediately when the child becomes ill enough to require
                                   isolation, and shall be asked to pick up the child as soon as
                                   possible.

                               (from 101426.2) the isolation area for programs caring for infants
                                   must have a crib, cot, mat or playpen for each ill infant. This
                                   isolation area must be under constant visual supervision by staff.

Illness in Early Care and Education Programs

The most frequent infectious disease symptoms that are reported by early care and education
settings are sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath or cough, fever, vomiting and diarrhea
(gastroenteritis), earaches, and rashes.

                   Figure 9.1 - Respiratory symptoms are by far the most common for children in care.1

However, these are not the symptoms that necessarily lead to absences. In fact, although
respiratory symptoms are most common, it's rashes and gastrointestinal disease that more
often keep children from attending their early education programs. This is more a reflection of
exclusion policies than real risk of serious illness.2

It's important for early childhood programs to identify illness accurately and respond in ways
that protect all children and staff health (whether it be to allow them to stay in care or to
exclude them from care).

Identifying Infectious Disease

When you are familiar with different infectious diseases, it's easier to identify them in children
and know whether or not children (and staff) who are affected should be excluded from the
early care and education program.

Common Cold

A child is sneezing and has a stuffy, runny nose. It's quite likely that they have a common cold.
As presented in Chapter 8, children get sick many times a year, probably between 4 and 12
times, depending on age and amount of time in child care. Many of these are likely due to the
common cold. More than 200 viruses can cause a cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common
type.

                                 Figure 9.3 - When you have a cold, mucus fills your nose and
                                   could cause post-nasal drip, headache, and a sore throat.4

Symptoms of a cold usually peak within 2 to 3 days and can include:
     Sneezing
     Stuffy nose
     Runny nose
     Sore throat
     Coughing
     Mucus dripping down your throat (post-nasal drip)
     Watery eyes
     Fever (although most people with colds do not have fever)

When viruses that cause colds first infect the nose and air-filled pockets in the face (sinuses),
the nose makes clear mucus. This helps wash the viruses from the nose and sinuses. After 2 or 3
days, mucus may change to a white, yellow, or green color. This is normal and does not mean
an antibiotic is needed. Some symptoms, particularly runny nose, stuffy nose, and cough, can
last for up to 10 to 14 days, but those symptoms should be improving during that time.

There is no cure for a cold. It will get better on its own--without antibiotics. When a child with
a cold is feeling well enough to participate and staff are able to provide adequate care for them
and all of the other children, the child does not need to be excluded from care.

Because colds can have similar symptoms to flu, it can be difficult to tell the difference between
the two illnesses based on symptoms alone. Flu and the common cold are both respiratory
illnesses, but they are caused by different viruses.5

Influenza (Flu)

In general, flu is worse than a cold, and symptoms are more intense. People with colds are
more likely to have a runny or stuffy nose. Colds generally do not result in serious health
problems, such as pneumonia, bacterial infections, or hospitalizations. Flu can have very
serious associated complications.6

                                                     Figure 9.4 - Flu symptoms.7

Flu can cause mild to severe illness, and at times can lead to death. Flu usually comes on
suddenly. People who have flu often feel some or all of these symptoms:

     Fever (common, but not always) or feeling feverish/chills
     cough
     sore throat
     runny or stuffy nose
     muscle or body aches
     headaches
     fatigue (tiredness)
     some people may have vomiting and diarrhea, though this is more common in children

         than adults.
Most people who get flu will recover in a few days to less than two weeks, but some people will
develop complications (such as pneumonia) as a result of flu, some of which can be life-
threatening and result in death.
Sinus and ear infections are examples of moderate complications from flu, while pneumonia is
a serious flu complication that can result from either influenza virus infection alone or from co-
infection of flu virus and bacteria. Other possible serious complications triggered by flu can

include inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis) or muscle (myositis,
rhabdomyolysis) tissues, and multi-organ failure (for example, respiratory and kidney failure).
Flu virus infection of the respiratory tract can trigger an extreme inflammatory response in the
body and can lead to sepsis, the body's life-threatening response to infection. Flu also can make
chronic medical problems worse. For example, people with asthma may experience asthma
attacks while they have flu.8
A yearly flu vaccine is the first and most important step in protecting against influenza and its
potentially serious complications for everyone 6 months and older. While there are many
different flu viruses, flu vaccines protect against the 3 or 4 viruses that research suggests will be
most common. Flu vaccination can reduce flu illnesses, doctors' visits, missed school due to flu,
prevent flu-related hospitalizations, and reduce the risk of dying from influenza. Also, there are
data to suggest that even if someone gets sick after vaccination, their illness may be milder.9
Once a person has the flu, their health care provider may recommend antiviral drugs. When
used for treatment, antiviral drugs can lessen symptoms and shorten the length of sickness by 1
or 2 days. They also can prevent serious flu complications, like pneumonia. For people at high
risk of serious flu complications (including children), treatment with antiviral drugs can mean
the difference between milder or more serious illness possibly resulting in a hospital stay. CDC
recommends prompt treatment for people who have influenza infection or suspected influenza
infection and who are at high risk of serious flu complications.10
As with a cold, a child with the flu does not need to be excluded if staff can care for them and
all of the other children and they feel well enough to participate.

                   Avoiding Spreading Germs to Others

                       Early care and education programs should teach children and model good
                       cough and sneeze etiquette. Always sneeze or cough into a tissue that is
                       discarded after use. If a tissue is not available, use your upper sleeve,
                       completely covering the mouth and nose. Always wash hands after
                       coughing, sneezing, and blowing noses. 11

                                             Figure 9.5 -Cover coughs and sneezes, but not with your hand.12

Sinusitis (Sinus Infection)

Sinus infections happen when fluid builds up in the air-filled pockets in the face (sinuses), which
allows germs to grow. Viruses cause most sinus infections, but bacteria can cause some sinus
infections.

  Figure 9.6 - When you have a sinus infection, one or more of your sinuses becomes inflamed and fluid builds up,
                                               causing congestion and runny nose.13

Common symptoms of sinus infections include:
     Runny nose
     Stuffy nose
     Facial pain or pressure
     Headache
     Mucus dripping down the throat (post-nasal drip)
     Sore throat
     Cough
     Bad breath

Most sinus infections usually get better on their own without antibiotics.14 As with colds and
flu, a child does not need to be automatically excluded from care for a sinus infection.

                   What was your last experience with an upper respiratory infection (such as
                   cold, flu, or sinus infection? If a child had the same symptoms as you, would
                   they have needed to be excluded from care?

Sore Throat

A sore throat can make it painful to swallow. A sore throat can also feel dry and scratchy. Sore
throat can be a symptom of the common cold, allergies, strep throat, or other upper respiratory
tract illness. Strep throat is an infection in the throat and tonsils caused by bacteria called group
A Streptococcus (also called Streptococcus pyogenes).

Infections from viruses are the most common cause of sore throats. The following symptoms
suggest a virus is the cause of the illness instead of the bacteria called group A strep:

     Cough
     Runny nose
     Hoarseness (changes in your voice that makes it sound breathy, raspy, or strained)
     Conjunctivitis (also called pink eye)

The most common symptoms of strep throat include:
     Sore throat that can start very quickly
     Pain when swallowing
     Fever
     Red and swollen tonsils, sometimes with white patches or streaks of pus
     Tiny red spots on the roof of the mouth
     Swollen lymph nodes in the front of the neck

A doctor can determine the likely cause of a sore throat. If a sore throat is caused by a virus,
antibiotics will not help. Most sore throats will get better on their own within one week and are
not cause for exclusion from child care.
Since bacteria cause strep throat, antibiotics are needed to treat the infection and prevent
rheumatic fever and other complications. A doctor cannot tell if someone has strep throat just
by looking in the throat. If a doctor suspects strep throat, they may test to confirm diagnosis. A
child with strep throat should be excluded from care until they no longer have fever AND have
taken antibiotics for at least 24 hours.15

Ear Infection

There are different types of ear infections. Middle ear infection (acute otitis media) is an
infection in the middle ear.
Another condition that affects the middle ear is called otitis media with effusion. It occurs when
fluid builds up in the middle ear without being infected and without causing fever, ear pain, or
pus build-up in the middle ear.
When the outer ear canal is infected, the condition is called swimmer's ear, which is different
from a middle ear infection.

                             middle, and inner ear, showing inflammation and fluid in the ear.16

Middle Ear Infection

A middle ear infection may be caused by:
     Bacteria, like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenza (nontypeable) - the
         two most common bacterial causes
     Viruses, like those that cause colds or flu

Common symptoms of middle ear infection in children can include:
     Ear pain
     Fever
     Fussiness or irritability
     Rubbing or tugging at an ear
     Difficulty sleeping

A can make the diagnosis of a middle ear infection by looking inside the child's ear to examine
the eardrum and see if there is pus in the middle ear. Antibiotics are often not needed for
middle ear infections because the body's immune system can fight off the infection on its own.
However, sometimes antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, are needed to treat severe cases right
away or cases that last longer than 2-3 days.17

Swimmer's Ear

Ear infections can be caused by leaving contaminated water in the ear after swimming. This
infection, known as "swimmer's ear" or otitis externa, is not the same as the common
childhood middle ear infection. The infection occurs in the outer ear canal and can cause pain
and discomfort for swimmers of all ages.

Symptoms of swimmer's ear usually appear within a few days of swimming and include:
     Itchiness inside the ear.
     Redness and swelling of the ear.
     Pain when the infected ear is tugged or when pressure is placed on the ear.
     Pus draining from the infected ear.

Although all age groups are affected by swimmer's ear, it is more common in children and can
be extremely painful. If swimmer's ear is suspected, a healthcare provider should be consulted.
Swimmer's ear can be treated with antibiotic ear drops.18

Head Lice

Head lice are parasitic insects that live on the head. They survive by feeding on human blood.
Lice infestations are spread most commonly by close person-to-person contact. Lice move by
crawling; they cannot hop or fly.

Adult head lice are 2-3 mm in length. Head lice infest the head and neck and attach their eggs
to the base of the hair shaft. Lice move by crawling; they cannot hop or fly.19

                                                   Figure 9.9 - Adult head louse.20

Symptoms of a head lice infestation include:
     Tickling feeling of something moving in the hair.
     Itching, caused by an allergic reaction to the bites of the head louse.
     Irritability and difficulty sleeping; head lice are most active in the dark.
     Sores on the head caused by scratching. These sores can sometimes become infected
         with bacteria found on the person's skin.

Head-to-head contact with a person who already has an infestation is the most common way to
get head lice. Head-to-head contact is common during play at school, at home, and elsewhere
(sports activities, playground, slumber parties, camp).

Although uncommon, head lice can be spread by sharing clothing or belongings. This happens
when lice crawl, or the nits that are attached to shed hair hatch, and get on the shared clothing
or belongings. Examples include:

     Sharing clothing (hats, scarves, coats, sports uniforms) or articles (hair ribbons,
         barrettes, combs, brushes, towels, stuffed animals) recently worn or used by a person
         with an infestation;

     Or lying on a bed, couch, pillow, or carpet that has recently been in contact with a
         person with an infestation.

Dogs, cats, and other pets do not play a role in the spread of head lice.

The diagnosis of a head lice infestation is best made by finding a live nymph or adult louse on
the scalp or hair of a person. Because nymphs and adult lice are very small, move quickly, and
avoid light, they can be difficult to find. Use of a magnifying lens and a fine-toothed comb may
be helpful to find live lice.

If crawling lice are not seen, finding nits firmly attached within a  inch of base of the hair
shafts strongly suggests, but does not confirm, that a person is infested and should be treated.

Nits that are attached more than  inch from the base of the hair shaft are almost always dead
or already hatched. Nits are often confused with other things found in the hair such as
dandruff, hair spray droplets, and dirt particles. If no live nymphs or adult lice are seen, and the
only nits found are more than -inch from the scalp, the infestation is probably old and no
longer active and does not need to be treated.21

                  Figure 9.10 -Louse as a nit (egg), nymph (juvenile), and adult compared to a penny.22

Treatment for head lice is recommended for persons diagnosed with an active infestation. All
household members and other close contacts should be checked; those persons with evidence
of an active infestation should be treated with an over-the-counter or prescription medication
(following the provided instructions).
Hats, scarves, pillow cases, bedding, clothing, and towels worn or used by the person with the
infestation in the 2-day period just before treatment is started can be machine washed and
dried using the hot water and hot air cycles because lice and eggs are killed by exposure for 5
minutes to temperatures greater than 128.3캟. Items that cannot be laundered may be dry-
cleaned or sealed in a plastic bag for two weeks. Items such as hats, grooming aids, and towels
that come in contact with the hair of a person with an infestation should not be shared.
Vacuuming furniture and floors can remove hairs that might have viable nits attached. Head lice
do not survive long if they fall off a person and cannot feed.
After treatment, it's important to check the hair and comb with a nit comb to remove nits and
lice every 2-3 days which will decrease the chance of self-reinfestation. Checking for 2-3
weeks will ensure that all lice and nits are gone.23

                   No More "No Nits" Policies

                       Children diagnosed with live head lice do not need to be sent home early
                       from early care and education programs or school; they can go home at the
                       end of the day, be treated, and return to class after appropriate treatment
                       has begun. Nits may persist after treatment, but successful treatment should
                       kill crawling lice.

                       Head lice can be a nuisance but they have not been shown to spread
                       disease. Personal hygiene or cleanliness in the home or school has nothing
                       to do with getting head lice.

                       Both the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Association
                       of School Nurses (NASN) advocate that "no-nit" policies should be
                       discontinued. "No-nit" policies that require a child to be free of nits before
                       they can return to schools should be discontinued for the following reasons:

                            Many nits are more than  inch from the scalp. Such nits are usually
                                not viable and very unlikely to hatch to become crawling lice, or may
                                in fact be empty shells, also known as `casings'.

                            Nits are cemented to hair shafts and are very unlikely to be
                                transferred successfully to other people.

                            The burden of unnecessary absenteeism to the students, families and
                                communities far outweighs the risks associated with head lice.

                            Misdiagnosis of nits is very common during nit checks conducted by
                                nonmedical personnel.24

                Pause to Reflect

                   What experience with or knowledge do you have about policies that specific
                   early education and care program and schools have on head lice? Are (or
                   were) those policies "no nits" or in line with the recommendations above?

                   Danger of Infectious Disease for Adults

                       Because early care and education program employees are around
                       children who are at higher risk of infectious diseases and have limited
                       understanding of hygiene practices, those employees are also at
                       greater risk for getting sick.

                       While most illness that are spread in early care and education
                       programs are not serious, some can be very dangerous. Knowledge
                       about illness and how to prevent its spread helps. Being fully
                       immunized (from childhood illness and or vaccines) protects adult
                       health as well.

                       Employees that are or could become pregnant want to be especially
                       careful because first time exposure to chickenpox, cytomegalovirus
                       (CMV), Fifths disease, and Rubella can cause major damage to fetal
                       health, birth defects, and even fetal death.25

Reportable Diseases

Some diseases are enough of a threat to the community that it is required that diagnosed cases
are reported to the local health department. See Table 9.1 for which diseases must be

Exclusion Policies

Most children with mild illnesses can safely attend child care. "Many health policies concerning
the care of ill children [including exclusion policies] have been based upon common
misunderstandings about contagion, risks to ill children, and risks to other children and staff.
Current research clearly shows that certain ill children do not pose a health threat. Also, the
research shows that keeping certain other mildly ill children at home or isolated at the child
care setting will not prevent other children from becoming ill."27

But there are times when exclusion is the right answer. Licensing states that a child may be too
sick to attend if:

     The child does not feel well enough to participate comfortably in the program's
         activities.

     The staff cannot adequately care for the sick child without compromising the care of the
         other children.

         the child is well enough to attend and that the illness is not contagious:
                  o Fever (above 100 F. axillary or above 101 F. orally) accompanied by
                      behavior change and other signs or symptoms of illness (i.e., the child looks

If there is an outbreak of any reportable illness (See Table 9.X), a child or staff member who
meets the following criteria as determined by the local health department or a health care
provider to be:

     contributing to transmission of the illness
     not adequately immunized when the disease is vaccine-preventable
     at increased risk due to the pathogens being circulated.

They can be readmitted when the health department official or that health care provider
decides that the risk of transmission is no longer present.29

What to do When a Child Requires Exclusion

When a child becomes ill enough to be excluded, they should be immediately isolated from
other children. Early care and education programs are required to be equipped to isolate and
care for any child who becomes ill during the day. The isolation area shall be located to afford
easy supervision of children by center staff and equipped with a mat, cot, couch or bed for each
ill child (or a crib if caring for infants).

The child's authorized representative shall be notified immediately when the child becomes ill
enough to require isolation, and shall be asked to have the child picked up from the center as
soon as possible.30

See Table 9.2 for a list of illnesses that require exclusion and when children who are diagnosed
with those illnesses can return to care.

                      Table 9.2 - Conditions that Require Exclusion31

                Pause to Reflect

                   Consider the following situations. Should each child be excluded from care or
                   not? If so, why and when should the child return? If not, what should the
                   teacher/caregiver do?

                        1. Mario's dad drops him off and let's Ms. Michelle know that he is a little
                            under the weather. He is not running a fever, but has a mild cough and
                            a runny nose. But he ate a good breakfast and has a pretty typical level
                            of energy.

                        2. About an hour into the day, Li vomits. Mr. Abraham checks and she has
                            a fever of 101.3. She looks a little pale and just wants to lay down. As
                            he goes to call Li's family, she vomits again.

                        3. When Latanya goes to change Daniel's diaper she notices a rash on his
                            stomach. She checks his temperature and he is not running a fever. He
                            is not scratching at it or seemingly in any discomfort. She remembers
                            that he has a history of eczema and contact dermatitis.

                        4. Apurva wakes up from naptime with discharge coming from a slightly
                            swollen and bloodshot right eye. She tells Ms. Maria that her eye hurts
                            and is "kind of itchy."

239 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
                   Now, come up with your own examples of a child that should be excluded
                   from care and that should not automatically be excluded.

Caring for Mildly Ill Children

Because young in early care and education programs have high incidence of illness and may
have conditions (such as eczema and asthmas), providers should be prepared to care for mildly
ill children, at least temporarily. And since we know that excluding most mildly ill children
doesn't prevent the spread of illness and can have negative effects on families, programs
should consider whether they can care for children with mild symptoms (not meeting the
exclusion policy). The California Childcare Health Program poses the following questions to
consider:

     Are there sufficient staff (including volunteers) to provide minor modifications that a
         child might need (such as quiet activities or extra fluids)?

     Are staff willing and able to care for the child's symptoms (such as wiping a runny nose
         and checking a fever) without neglecting the care of other children in the group?

     Is there a space where the mildly ill child can rest if needed?
     Are families able or willing to pay extra for sick care if other resources are not available,

         so that you can hire extra staff as needed?
     Have families made alternative arrangements for someone to pick up and care for their

         ill children if they cannot?"

It's important that programs recognize the families have to weigh many things when trying to
decide whether or not to send a child to child care. They must consider how the child feels
(physically and emotionally), whether or not the program can provide care for the specific
needs of the child, what alternative care arrangements are available, as well as the income they
may lose if they have to stay home.32

                Responding to Illness that Requires Medical Care

                   "Some conditions, require immediate medical help. If the parents can be
                   reached, tell them to come right away and to notify their medical provider.
                   Call Emergency Medical services (9-1-1) immediately and also notify parents if
                   any of the following things happen:

                         You believe a child needs immediate medical assessment and
                            treatment that cannot wait for parents to take the child for care.

                         A child has a stiff neck (that limits his ability to put his chin to his chest)
                            or severe headache and fever.

                         A child has a seizure for the first time.
                         A child who has a fever as well as difficulty breathing.
                         A child looks or acts very ill, or seems to be getting worse quickly.

Administering Medications

Some children in your early care and education setting may need to take medications during
the hours you provide care for them. It's important that early care and education programs
have a written policy for the use of prescription and nonprescription medication.34

According to licensing, programs that choose to handle medications must abide by the
following:

     All prescription and nonprescription medications shall be centrally stored in a safe place
         inaccessible to children, with an unaltered label, and labeled with the child's name and
         date

     A refrigerator shall be used to store any medication that requires refrigeration.
     Prescription medications may be administered with written permission by the child's

         authorized representatives in accordance with the label instructions by the physician
     Nonprescription medications may be administered without approval or instructions

         from the child's physician with written approval and instructions from the child's
         authorized representative and when administered in accordance with the product label
         directions.

                               Figure 9.11 - Medication must be given according to the label.35

Valid reasons for an early care and education program to consider administering medication.
     Some medication dosing cannot be adjusted to be taken before and after care (and
         keeping them out of care when otherwise well enough to attend, would be a hardship
         for families.
     Some children may have chronic conditions that may require urgent administration of
         medication (such as asthma and diabetes).36

Communication with Families

When children are excluded from care, it's important to provide documentation for families of
how the child meets the guidelines in your exclusion policy and what needs to happen before
the child can return to care. See Appendix K for a possible form that programs could use.

Programs are also required to inform families when children are exposed to a communicable
disease. See Appendix L for an example of a notice of exposure form you can provide to families
so they know what signs of illness to watch for and to seek medical advice when necessary.37

                Pause to Reflect

                   Why is it important for early care and education programs to communicate
                   clearly with families regarding communicable illness?

Summary

Becoming familiar with infectious diseases that are common in early childhood enables early
care and education program staff to identify illness and respond appropriately. This included
knowing when children (and staff) should be excluded from care and what needs to happen
before they should come back.

Programs must create policies on how they will handle children that are mildly ill (those that
need care before they can be picked up from care and those that do not require exclusion) and
children who have illness that requires medical care. Programs who choose to administer
medication, must be familiar with the licensing regulations they must follow.

Open communication with families is important when a child becomes ill or is potentially
exposed to an illness. Helping families understand and follow policies regarding exclusion is
vital to keeping everyone in the program as healthy as possible.

Introduction

Children with special health care needs are defined as ". . . those who have or are at increased
risk for a chronic physical, developmental, behavioral, or emotional condition and who also
require health and related services of a type or amount beyond that required by children
generally" (McPherson, 1998).

Any child who meets these criteria in an early care and education setting should have an up-to-
date care plan, completed by their primary health care provider with input from

245 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
parents/guardians, included in their on-site health record and readily accessible to those caring
for the child.1

Individualized Planning for Health

What does it take to care for children with chronic conditions in an early care and education
program? There's no single recipe for all situations. What it takes--more than any policy, list of
services, or staffing plan--is a commitment to communication, collaboration, and creative
problem-solving, and a determination to make it work. The essential principles that should
guide the care of children with chronic conditions in early childhood education are: care should
be family-centered, individualized, safe, and legal.

Family-Centered Care

Over the last 15 years, children's health care and the relationship between families and health
professionals have changed significantly. The role of parents/caregivers has shifted from being
patients to partners with the health care provider; and the "good patient" has changed from
unquestioningly following advice to being a good partner who actively participates in decisions
and advocates for services for their child.

"Family-centered care" involves providing the family health care and other services based on
the family's needs, priorities, and convenience rather than those of the service providers or the
child alone. Family-centered services are evidence of a program's commitment to family
partnerships and supporting child and family development.

                               10.1 - Family centered care relies on respect and collaboration.2

Services are family-centered when:
     The family is recognized as the child's most constant and important caregiver.
     The family and professionals collaborate as partners.
     Communication is open and honest, in both directions, between the family and
         professionals.

     Individual strengths and differences are respected among families.
     Services are flexible and responsive to the family's needs.
     Family-to-family support is encouraged.
     Children with chronic conditions and their families are treated like other children and

         families, and not defined by their condition.

Individualizing Care

Individualizing means recognizing the characteristics that make each child unique and planning
a program that responds to these differences. Individualizing allows families and staff to
respond to each child's built-in time clock for development, as well as culture, family, home
language, life experiences, strengths, needs, skills, and abilities.

Early care and education programs can best meet the needs of children with chronic conditions
by following a systematic process of Individualized Health Planning. For children who are
eligible for an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or Individualized Family Service Plan
(IFSP), the IEP or IFSP may or may not include planning for the child's health care needs. In
addition, many children with special health needs who are not eligible for an IEP or IFSP would,
in fact, benefit from individualized health planning.

Individualized health planning for children with chronic conditions involves close
communication and collaboration among families, the early care and education program staff,
and health care and service providers. It is a process of collecting all the necessary information
from screening and evaluations, developing plans for the child's routine and emergency care,
conducting ongoing assessment, and revising the plans as needed. The plan should be
documented in writing to serve as a clear guide for staff, families, and health care providers on
meeting the child's health needs.

Who Should Have an Individualized Health Plan?

Children who would benefit from an Individualized Health Plan include any child who:
          Requires adaptations in daily activities because of a medical condition; daily
             activities to be considered include feeding, playing, sleeping, toileting
          Needs medication regularly
          Requires a specialized emergency plan

The decision to develop an Individualized Health Plan for a child should be made collaboratively
by the family, health specialists, and classroom teacher.

What are the Benefits of an Individualized Health Plan?

          Health Promotion and Prevention of Complications: Children with chronic conditions
             remain healthiest when all possible measures are taken to promote their general
             health and manage the chronic condition closely.

          Communication and Collaboration: Optimal health care for children with chronic
             conditions requires close communication and coordination among families, Head
             Start, and health care providers.

          Training and Skills: An Individualized Health Plan identifies the specific procedures
             needed to care for a child with chronic conditions.

          Confidence: With an Individualized Health Plan, families and program staff can feel
             confident that they are doing everything possible to keep the child healthy on a
             routine and daily basis. Also, if health problems or emergencies occur, they can feel
             confident that they are prepared to manage them in the best way possible. Children
             with special medical needs feel more secure and able to learn when their caregivers
             know what to do.

           Figure 10.2 - Families, health care and service providers, and early care and education programs
               can work together to make sure children with special health needs get the care they need.3

What should be Included in an Individualized Health Plan?

Caring for children with chronic conditions is a serious responsibility. Staff are commonly
concerned about meeting the child's daily care needs: "How can I be sure to give him his
medicine at the right time? Do we have enough staff to do his tracheostomy care while also
supervising the other children? Will I have all his asthma supplies on the field trip?" Staff are
also commonly concerned about emergencies: "What if I give her the wrong amount of
medicine? What if she stops breathing? What if I can't reach her father on the phone?" The
Individualized Health Plan should include the information necessary to respond to the most
likely "what-ifs."

Many people are afraid to care for children with chronic conditions. It can raise anxieties to
discuss and plan for the "what-if" situations. It is important to remember that anticipating and
planning for a situation doesn't make it happen; it just allows you to be prepared if it does.

At minimum, an Individualized Health Plan should be a guide to:
     What accommodations in daily programming are needed, including meals and snacks,
         playing, sleeping, and toileting
     When and how to give medication, and who may give it

     When and how to perform any required medical procedures, and who may perform
         them

     What procedures to follow in the event of a medical emergency

The Individualized Health Plan should be developed with the participation of families, medical
professionals, classroom staff, and any other program that may be involved in providing care.
All parties should sign the form as an indication of agreement with and commitment to plan.4
See the example of a health plan in Appendix M.

Introduction to Chronic Health Conditions

Although no summary in a textbook will replace the knowledge families and their health care
and service providers can provide about a child who has a chronic health condition, it can be
helpful to have some familiarity with different conditions. Here is some introductory
information on some of the chronic health conditions children in early care and education
programs may have.

Allergies

An allergy is a reaction by the immune system to something that does not bother most other
people. People who have allergies often are sensitive to more than one thing. Substances that
often cause reactions are

     Pollen
     Dust mites
     Mold spores
     Pet dander

     Food
     Insect stings
     Medicines
Normally, the immune system fights germs. It is the body's defense system. In most allergic
reactions, however, it is responding to a false alarm. Genes and the environment probably both
play a role.

                                          Figure 10.4 - This child suffers from allergies.7

Allergies can cause a variety of symptoms such as a runny nose, sneezing, itching, rashes,
swelling, or asthma. Allergies can range from minor to severe. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction
that can be life-threatening. Doctors use skin and blood tests to diagnose allergies. Treatments
include medicines, allergy shots, and avoiding the substances that cause the reactions.8

                  Anaphylaxis

                      Anaphylaxis is a serious allergic reaction. It can begin very quickly, and
                      symptoms may be life-threatening. The most common causes are reactions
                      to foods (especially peanuts), medications, and stinging insects. Other causes
                      include exercise and exposure to latex. Sometimes no cause can be found.

                      It can affect many organs:
                           Skin - itching, hives, redness, swelling
                           Nose - sneezing, stuffy nose, runny nose
                           Mouth - itching, swelling of the lips or tongue
                           Throat - itching, tightness, trouble swallowing, swelling of the back of
                               the throat
                           Chest - shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, chest pain or
                               tightness
                           Heart - weak pulse, passing out, shock
                           Gastrointestinal tract - vomiting, diarrhea, cramps
                           Nervous system - dizziness or fainting

                      If child is having a serious allergic reaction, 911 should be called. If an auto-
                      injector is available, give the injection right away.9

Arthritis

Arthritis in children is called childhood arthritis or juvenile arthritis. The most common type of
childhood arthritis is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), also known as juvenile rheumatoid
arthritis.

Childhood arthritis can cause permanent physical damage to joints. This damage can make it
hard for the child to do everyday things like walking or dressing and can result in disability.

Symptoms may come and go over time. There may be times when symptoms get worse, known
as flares, and times when symptoms get better, known as remission. Signs and symptoms
include:

     Joint pain.
     Swelling.
     Fever.
     Stiffness.
     Rash.
     Fatigue (tiredness).
     Loss of appetite.
     Inflammation of the eye.

     Difficulty with daily living activities such as walking, dressing, and playing.

The exact cause of childhood arthritis is unknown. In childhood arthritis, the immune system
may not work right which causes the inflammation in the joints and other body systems.
Although there is no cure, some children with arthritis achieve permanent remission, which
means the disease is no longer active. Any physical damage to the joint will remain.10

Asthma

Asthma is a disease that affects the lungs. In the United States, about 20 million people
have asthma. Nearly 9 million of them are children. Children have smaller airways than adults,
which makes asthma especially serious for them.11 It causes wheezing, breathlessness, chest
tightness, and coughing at night or early in the morning. If a person has asthma, they have it all
the time, but they will have asthma attacks only when something bothers their lungs.

An asthma attack may include coughing, chest tightness, wheezing, and trouble breathing. The
attack happens in the body's airways, which are the paths that carry air to the lungs. As the air
moves through the lungs, the airways become smaller, like the branches of a tree are smaller
than the tree trunk. During an asthma attack, the sides of the airways in the lungs swell and the
airways shrink. Less air gets in and out of the lungs, and mucous that the body makes clogs up
the airways.
An asthma attack can happen when the person is exposed to asthma triggers. Your asthma
triggers can be very different from someone else's asthma triggers. It's important for teacher to
know about the triggers for any child in their care that has asthma, so they can help the child
avoid them and watch for an attack when you can't. 12 Triggers include:

     Allergens - mold, pollen, animals
     Irritants - cigarette smoke, air pollution
     Weather - cold air, changes in weather
     Exercise
     Infections - flu, common cold13

Asthma is treated with medication. There are quick-relief and long-term medications. Some are
taken orally and some may be breathed it. It's important to have accurate information in the
health plan and in the child's records about a child with asthma's medication.14

Blood Disorders

There are several blood disorders that children in early care and education programs may have.
Here is an introduction to hemophilia, sickle cell disease, and thalassemia.

Hemophilia

Hemophilia is usually an inherited bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly.
This can lead to spontaneous bleeding as well as bleeding following injuries or surgery. Blood
contains many proteins called clotting factors that can help to stop bleeding. People with
hemophilia have low levels of either factor VIII (8) or factor IX (9). The severity of hemophilia
that a person has is determined by the amount of factor in the blood. The lower the amount of
the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding will occur which can lead to serious health
problems.

Hemophilia is caused by a mutation or change, in one of the genes, that provides instructions
for making the clotting factor proteins needed to form a blood clot. This change or mutation
can prevent the clotting protein from working properly or to be missing altogether. Hemophilia
occurs in about 1 of every 5,000 male births. Females can also have hemophilia, but this is
much rarer (and more often they are carriers). Hemophilia affects people from all racial and
ethnic groups.

The best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing blood clotting factor so that the
blood can clot properly. This is done by infusing (administering through a vein) commercially
prepared factor concentrates.16 Hemophilia is a complex disorder. Good quality medical care
from doctors and nurses who know a lot about the disorder can help people with hemophilia
prevent some serious problems.17

Sickle Cell Disease

SCD is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. Healthy red blood cells are round, and they
move through small blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of the body. In someone who has
SCD, the red blood cells become hard and sticky and look like a C-shaped farm tool called a
"sickle". The sickle cells die early, which causes a constant shortage of red blood cells. Also,
when they travel through small blood vessels, they get stuck and clog the blood flow. This can
cause pain and other serious problems such infection, acute chest syndrome and stroke.

                                    Figure 10.6 - Normal vs. sickle cell anemia blood cells.18

SCD is a genetic condition that is present at birth. It is inherited when a child receives two sickle
cell genes--one from each parent. People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the
first year of life, usually around 5 months of age. Symptoms and complications of SCD are
different for each person and can range from mild to severe.
There is no single best treatment for all people with SCD. Treatment options are different for
each person depending on the symptoms. The only cure for SCD is bone marrow or stem cell
transplant.19

Thalassemia

Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder caused when the body doesn't make enough of a
protein called hemoglobin, an important part of red blood cells. When there isn't enough
hemoglobin, the body's red blood cells don't function properly and they last shorter periods of
time, so there are fewer healthy red blood cells traveling in the bloodstream.

Red blood cells carry oxygen to all the cells of the body. Oxygen is a sort of food that cells use to
function. When there are not enough healthy red blood cells, there is also not enough oxygen
delivered to all the other cells of the body, which may cause a person to feel tired, weak or
short of breath. This is a condition called anemia.

People with thalassemia may have mild or severe anemia. Severe anemia can damage organs
and lead to death. People with moderate and severe forms of thalassemia usually find out
about their condition in childhood, since they have symptoms of severe anemia early in life.20
Symptoms of anemia include:

     Dizziness
     Shortness of breath
     A fast heart beat
     Headache
     Leg cramps
     Difficulty concentrating
     Pale skin

The type of treatment a person receives depends on how severe the thalassemia is. The more
severe the thalassemia, the less hemoglobin the body has, and the more severe the anemia
may be. One way to treat anemia is to provide the body with more red blood cells to carry
oxygen. This can be done through a blood transfusion, a safe, common procedure in which the
person receives blood through a small plastic tube inserted into one of their blood vessels.21

Cerebral Palsy

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person's ability to move and maintain
balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood. Cerebral means
having to do with the brain. Palsy means weakness or problems with using the muscles. CP is
caused by abnormal brain development or damage to the developing brain that affects a
person's ability to control his or her muscles.

The symptoms of CP vary from person to person. A child with severe CP might need to use
special equipment to be able to walk, or might not be able to walk at all and might need lifelong
care. A child with mild CP, on the other hand, might walk a little awkwardly, but might not need
any special help. CP does not get worse over time, though the exact symptoms can change over
a person's lifetime.

All people with CP have problems with movement and posture. Many also have related
conditions such as intellectual disability; seizures; problems with vision, hearing, or speech;
changes in the spine (such as scoliosis); or joint problems (such as contractures).

             Figure 10.7 - Children with cerebral palsy can be part of early care and education programs.22

Doctors classify CP according to the main type of movement disorder involved. Depending on
which areas of the brain are affected, one or more of the following movement disorders can
occur:

     Stiff muscles (spasticity)
     Uncontrollable movements (dyskinesia)
     Poor balance and coordination (ataxia)

There is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have the condition. It
is important to begin a treatment program as early as possible.

After a CP diagnosis is made, a team of health professionals works with the child and family to
develop a plan to help the child reach his or her full potential. Common treatments include
medicines; surgery; braces; and physical, occupational, and speech therapy. No single
treatment is the best one for all children with CP.23

Cystic Fibrosis

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease of the mucus and sweat glands. It affects mostly the
lungs, pancreas, liver, intestines, sinuses, and sex organs. CF causes mucus to be thick and
sticky. The mucus clogs the lungs, causing breathing problems and making it easy for bacteria to
grow. This can lead to repeated lung infections and lung damage.24 It is one of the most
common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults. It is a life-threatening disorder.

                                              Figure 10.8 - Cystic fibrosis treatment.25

The symptoms and severity of CF can vary. Some people have serious problems from birth.
Others have a milder version of the disease that doesn't show up until they are teens or young
adults.

CF is diagnosed through various tests, such as gene, blood, and sweat tests. There is no cure for
CF, but treatments have improved greatly in recent years. In the past, most deaths from CF
were in children and teenagers. Today, with improved treatments, some people who have CF
are living into their forties, fifties, or older. Treatments may include chest physical therapy,
nutritional and respiratory therapies, medicines, and exercise.26

Diabetes

Until recently, the common type of diabetes in children and teens was type 1. It was called
juvenile diabetes. With Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas does not make insulin. Insulin is a
hormone that helps glucose, or sugar, get into your cells to give them energy. Without insulin,
too much sugar stays in the blood.

Now younger people are also getting type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes used to be called adult-
onset diabetes. But now it is becoming more common in children and teens, due to
more obesity. With Type 2 diabetes, the body does not make or use insulin well.

Children have a higher risk of type 2 diabetes if they are overweight or have obesity, have a
family history of diabetes, or are not active. Children who are African American, Hispanic,
Native American/Alaska Native, Asian American, or Pacific Islander also have a higher risk. To
lower the risk of type 2 diabetes in children

     Have them maintain a healthy weight
     Be sure they are physically active

Children and teens with type 1 diabetes may need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes may be
controlled with diet and exercise. If not, patients will need to take oral diabetes medicines or
insulin.27

                                 Figure 10.9 - Insulin can be delivered via different methods.28

When a child in an early care and education program has type 1 diabetes, staff will be involved
in diabetes care on a day-to-day basis, from serving healthy foods to giving insulin injections to
watching for and treating hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). 29

                   Hypoglycemia

                       Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can happen quickly and needs to
                       be treated immediately. It's most often caused by too much insulin,
                       waiting too long for a meal or snack, not eating enough, or getting extra
                       physical activity. Hypoglycemia symptoms are different from person to
                       person; make sure you know your specific symptoms, which could
                       include:

                            Shakiness
                            Nervousness or anxiety
                            Sweating, chills, or clamminess
                            Irritability or impatience
                            Dizziness and difficulty concentrating
                            Hunger or nausea
                            Blurred vision
                            Weakness or fatigue

Down Syndrome

Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome. Chromosomes are
small "packages" of genes in the body. They determine how a baby's body forms during
pregnancy and how the baby's body functions as it grows in the womb and after birth. Typically,
a baby is born with 46 chromosomes. Babies with Down syndrome have an extra copy of one of
these chromosomes, chromosome 21. A medical term for having an extra copy of a
chromosome is `trisomy.' Down syndrome is also referred to as Trisomy 21. This extra copy
changes how the baby's body and brain develop, which can cause both mental and physical
challenges for the baby.

Even though people with Down syndrome might act and look similar, each person has different
abilities. People with Down syndrome usually have an IQ (a measure of intelligence) in the
mildly-to-moderately low range and are slower to speak than other children.

Some common physical features of Down syndrome include:
     A flattened face, especially the bridge of the nose
     Almond-shaped eyes that slant up
     A short neck
     Small ears
     A tongue that tends to stick out of the mouth
     Tiny white spots on the iris (colored part) of the eye
     Small hands and feet
     A single line across the palm of the hand (palmar crease)
     Small pinky fingers that sometimes curve toward the thumb
     Poor muscle tone or loose joints
     Shorter in height as children and adults

Many people with Down syndrome have the common facial features and no other major birth
defects. However, some people with Down syndrome might have one or more major birth
defects or other medical problems. Some of the more common health problems among
children with Down syndrome are listed below.

     Hearing loss
     Obstructive sleep apnea, which is a condition where the person's breathing temporarily

         stops while asleep
     Ear infections
     Eye diseases
     Heart defects present at birth

                      Figure 10.10 - Two children, one with Down syndrome, working on an art project.31

Down syndrome is a lifelong condition. Services early in life will often help babies and children
with Down syndrome to improve their physical and intellectual abilities. Most of these services
focus on helping children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. These services
include speech, occupational, and physical therapy, and they are typically offered through early
intervention programs in each state. Children with Down syndrome may also need extra help or
attention in early care and education programs and school, although many children are
included in classrooms with children that do not have special needs.32

Epilepsy

Epilepsy is a broad term used for a brain disorder that causes seizures. There are many different
types of epilepsy. There are also different kinds of seizures.33 A seizure is a short change in
normal brain activity. Seizures are the main sign of epilepsy. Some seizures can look like staring
spells. Other seizures cause a person to fall, shake, and lose awareness of what's going on
around them. 34

Most seizures end in a few minutes. If a child has a seizure the teacher should:
     Stay with the child until the seizure ends and he or she is fully awake. Once they are
         alert and able to communicate, tell them what happened in very simple terms.
     Comfort the person and speak calmly.
     Keep yourself and other people calm.
     Follow the directions in the Health Care Plan (which likely will include calling the family)

Teacher should never do any of the following things:
     Do not hold the child down or try to stop their movements.
     Do not put anything in the child's mouth. This can injure teeth or the jaw. A person
         having a seizure cannot swallow his or her tongue.
     Do not try to give mouth-to-mouth breaths (like CPR). People usually start breathing
         again on their own after a seizure.
     Do not offer the person water or food until he or she is fully alert.35

                              Figure 10.11 - This girl has Dravet syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy.36

Nationwide, about 470,000 children have epilepsy. For many children, epilepsy is easily
controlled with medicine. These children can do what other kids can do, and perform as well in
school. For others, it can be more challenging.37

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)

ADHD is one of the most common neurodevelopmental disorders of childhood. It is usually first
diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. Children with ADHD may have trouble
paying attention, controlling impulsive behaviors (may act without thinking about what the
result will be), or be overly active.

It is normal for children to have trouble focusing and behaving at one time or another.
However, children with ADHD do not just grow out of these behaviors. The symptoms continue,
can be severe, and can cause difficulty at school, at home, or with friends.
A child with ADHD might:

     daydream a lot
     forget or lose things a lot
     squirm or fidget
     talk too much
     make careless mistakes or take unnecessary risks

     have trouble taking turns
     have difficulty getting along with others

           Figure 10.12 - Brain scans of showing difference in brain activity in children with and without ADHD.38

There are three different types of ADHD, depending on which types of symptoms are strongest
in the individual. Because symptoms can change over time, the presentation may change over
time as well.

         Predominantly Inattentive Presentation: It is hard for the individual to organize or
         finish a task, to pay attention to details, or to follow instructions or conversations. The
         person is easily distracted or forgets details of daily routines.
         Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Presentation: The person fidgets and talks a lot.
         It is hard to sit still for long (e.g., for a meal or while doing homework). Smaller children
         may run, jump or climb constantly. The individual feels restless and has trouble with
         impulsivity. Someone who is impulsive may interrupt others a lot, grab things from
         people, or speak at inappropriate times. It is hard for the person to wait their turn or
         listen to directions. A person with impulsiveness may have more accidents and injuries
         than others.
         Combined Presentation: Symptoms of the above two types are equally present in the
         person.

The cause(s) and risk factors for ADHD are unknown, but current research shows that genetics
plays an important role. Recent studies of twins link genes with ADHD. In addition to genetics,
scientists are studying other possible causes and risk factors including:

     Brain injury
     Exposure to environmental (e.g., lead) during pregnancy or at a young age
     Alcohol and tobacco use during pregnancy
     Premature delivery
     Low birth weight

Research does not support the popularly held views that ADHD is caused by eating too much
sugar, watching too much television, parenting, or social and environmental factors such as
poverty or family chaos.
For preschool-aged children (4-5 years of age) with ADHD, behavior therapy, particularly
training for parents, is recommended as the first line of treatment before medication is tried.
What works best can depend on the child and family. Good treatment plans will include close
monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way.39

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disability that can cause significant social,
communication and behavioral challenges. There is often nothing about how people with ASD
look that sets them apart from other people, but people with ASD may communicate, interact,
behave, and learn in ways that are different from most other people. A diagnosis of ASD now
includes several conditions that used to be diagnosed separately: autistic disorder, pervasive
developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), and Asperger syndrome. These
conditions are now all called autism spectrum disorder.
The learning, thinking, and problem-solving abilities of people with ASD can range from gifted
to severely challenged. Some people with ASD need a lot of help in their daily lives; others need
less. People with ASD might repeat certain behaviors and might not want change in their daily
activities. Many people with ASD also have different ways of learning, paying attention, or
reacting to things. Signs of ASD begin during early childhood and typically last throughout a
person's life.

                              Figure 10.13 - This three-year-old boy was diagnosed with ASD.40

264 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
Children or adults with ASD might:
     not point at objects to show interest (for example, not point at an airplane flying over)
     not look at objects when another person points at them
     have trouble relating to others or not have an interest in other people at all
     avoid eye contact and want to be alone
     have trouble understanding other people's feelings or talking about their own feelings
     prefer not to be held or cuddled, or might cuddle only when they want to
     appear to be unaware when people talk to them, but respond to other sounds
     be very interested in people, but not know how to talk, play, or relate to them
     repeat or echo words or phrases said to them, or repeat words or phrases in place of
         normal language
     have trouble expressing their needs using typical words or motions
     not play "pretend" games (for example, not pretend to "feed" a doll)
     repeat actions over and over again
     have trouble adapting when a routine changes
     have unusual reactions to the way things smell, taste, look, feel, or sound
     lose skills they once had (for example, stop saying words they were using)

We do not know all of the causes of ASD. However, we have learned that there are likely many
causes for multiple types of ASD. There may be many different factors that make a child more
likely to have an ASD, including environmental, biologic and genetic factors. ASD occurs in all
racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, but is about 4 times more common among boys than
among girls.

Research shows that early intervention treatment services can improve a child's
development. Services can help the child meet developmental milestones and interact with
others. There is no cure for ASD.41 But not everyone believes that autism is a condition or
disorder or that it needs to be cured.

                 Neurodiversity

                    "Neurodiversity is a concept that's been around for a while. In a nutshell, it
                    means that brain differences are just that: differences. So conditions
                    like ADHD and [ASD] aren't "abnormal." They're simply variations of the
                    human brain.

                    For kids with learning and thinking differences, the idea of neurodiversity has
                    real benefits. It can help kids (and their parents) frame their challenges as
                    differences, rather than as deficits. It can also shed light on instructional
                    approaches that might help to highlight particular strengths kids have."42

Hearing Problems

Hearing loss can happen when any part of the ear is not working in the usual way. This includes
the outer ear, middle ear, inner ear, hearing (acoustic) nerve, and auditory system.

     The outer ear is made up of:
             o the part we see on the sides of our heads, known as pinna
             o the ear canal
             o the eardrum, sometimes called the tympanic membrane, which separates the
                  outer and middle ear

     The middle ear is made up of:
             o the eardrum
             o three small bones called ossicles that send the movement of the eardrum to the
                  inner ear

     The inner ear is made up of:
             o the snail shaped organ for hearing known as the cochlea
             o the semicircular canals that help with balance
             o the nerves that go to the brain

     The auditory (ear) nerve sends sound information from the ear to the brain.
     The auditory (hearing) system processes sound information as it travels from the ear to

         the brain so that our brain pathways are part of our hearing.

                                        Figure 10.14 - The outer, middle, and inner ear.43

There are four types of hearing loss:
     Conductive Hearing Loss: Hearing loss caused by something that stops sounds from
         getting through the outer or middle ear. This type of hearing loss can often be treated
         with medicine or surgery.
     Sensorineural Hearing Loss : Hearing loss that occurs when there is a problem in the way
         the inner ear or hearing nerve works.
     Mixed Hearing Loss: Hearing loss that includes both a conductive and a sensorineural
         hearing loss.

     Auditory Neuropathy Spectrum Disorder: Hearing loss that occurs when sound enters
         the ear normally, but because of damage to the inner ear or the hearing nerve, sound
         isn't organized in a way that the brain can understand.

The degree of hearing loss can range from mild to profound:
     Mild Hearing Loss: A person with a mild hearing loss may hear some speech sounds but
         soft sounds are hard to hear.
     Moderate Hearing Loss: A person with a moderate hearing loss may hear almost no
         speech when another person is talking at a normal level.
     Severe Hearing Loss: A person with severe hearing loss will hear no speech when a
         person is talking at a normal level and only some loud sounds.
     Profound Hearing Loss: A person with a profound hearing loss will not hear any speech
         and only very loud sounds. 44

Hearing loss can happen any time during life - from before birth to adulthood. Following are
some of the things that can increase the chance that a child will have hearing loss:

     A genetic cause: About 1 out of 2 cases of hearing loss in babies is due to genetic causes.
     1 out of 4 cases of hearing loss in babies is due to maternal infections during pregnancy,

         complications after birth, and head trauma.
     For about 1 out of 4 babies born with hearing loss, the cause is unknown.

Hearing loss can affect a child's ability to develop speech, language, and social skills. The earlier
children with hearing loss start getting services, the more likely they are to reach their full
potential.45 Screening for hearing loss was covered in Chapter 7.

Vision Problems

In the United States, the most prevalent disabling childhood conditions are vision disorders
including amblyopia, strabismus, and significant refractive errors. Early detection increases the
likelihood of effective treatment; however, less than 15% of all preschool children receive an
eye exam, and less than 22% of preschool children receive some type of vision screening. 46
Vision screening was also addressed in Chapter 7.

Amblyopia

Amblyopia, also referred to as "lazy eye," is the most common cause of vision impairment in
children. Amblyopia is the medical term used when the vision in one of the eyes is reduced
because the eye and the brain are not working together properly. The eye itself looks normal,
but it is not being used normally because the brain is favoring the other eye. Conditions leading
to amblyopia include strabismus, an imbalance in the positioning of the two eyes, being more

nearsighted, farsighted, or astigmatic in one eye than the other eye, and rarely, other eye
conditions, such as cataracts.
Unless it is successfully treated in early childhood amblyopia usually persists into adulthood,
and is the most common cause of permanent one-eye vision impairment among children and
young and middle-aged adults. An estimated 2%-3% of the population suffer from amblyopia.

                       Figure 10.15 - Patching the dominant eye is one way of treating amblyopia.47

Strabismus

Strabismus involves an imbalance in the positioning of the two eyes. Strabismus can cause the
eyes to cross in (esotropia) or turn out (exotropia). Strabismus is caused by a lack of
coordination between the eyes. As a result, the eyes look in different directions and do not
focus simultaneously on a single point. In most cases of strabismus in children, the cause is
unknown. In more than half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth
(congenital strabismus). When the two eyes fail to focus on the same image, there is reduced or
absent depth perception and the brain may learn to ignore the input from one eye, causing
permanent vision loss in that eye (one type of amblyopia).

Refractive Errors

Refractive errors in children include myopia (near-sightedness), hyperopia (farsightedness), and
astigmatism (distorted vision at all distances), can be corrected by eyeglasses, contact lenses, or
in some cases surgery.48

Other Eye Diseases

Other eye diseases affecting this age group include retinopathy of prematurity (ROP),
congenital defects, diabetic retinopathy (DR), and cancers such as retinoblastoma.50

                  Do you have experiences with any of the special needs discussed in this
                  section? How does this affect how you feel about that particular need?
                  Did you find yourself feeling more concerned about potentially caring for a
                  child with any of these? If so, why? What can you do to address those
                  concerns?
                  Are there any you feel more comfortable and/or qualified to handle? Why or

Children with Special Needs

Children in early care and education programs may have special needs that are not directly
related to their health. The number of children enrolled in Special Education according to the
California Department of Education, in the 2018-2019 academic year is provided by disability in

These children and their families need a partnership with early care and education staff and
other service providers as early as possible because it creates a solid foundation to support
optimal development and can reduce the prevalence of ongoing and future challenges.52

The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) is the federal law that makes available a
free appropriate public education to eligible children with disabilities throughout the nation
and ensures special education and related services to those children.

The IDEA governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education,
and related services to more than 6.5 million eligible infants, toddlers, children, and youth with
disabilities.53

For children birth to 3 years, Part C of IDEA Provides early intervention services to
children from birth to 3 with special needs. And Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP)
is a written document outlining:

     The early intervention services a child and family will receive
     The child's needs; the family's strengths and choices; and the Early Intervention

         team's recommendations

         Once children turn 3, Part B of IDEA (Section 619), provides special education services
         through the public school system. An Individualized Education Program (IEP) is a written
         plan that describes:

              The child's educational goals
              Services and supports in a school setting54

                            Figure 10.17 - This child with cerebral palsy has a special chair that allows
                               her to participate in her inclusive early care and education program 55

Inclusion

In IDEA, the word appropriate, refers to providing that educational experience in the least
restrictive environment (LRE). LRE requires a continuum of placement options be available to
best meet the diverse needs of children with disabilities, and presumes that the first placement
option considered for each child with a disability is the regular classroom the child would
attend if he or she did not have a disability.56 The full and active participation of children with
disabilities or other special needs in community activities, services, and programs designed for
children without disabilities, including child care, is referred to as inclusion. In an inclusive
program, if support, accommodations, or modifications are needed to ensure the child's full,
active participation, they are provided appropriately. The participation results in an authentic
sense of belonging for the child and family.

Teachers may be reassured to know that:
     Child care providers can successfully include children with disabilities or other special
         needs in the program while promoting belonging for all children.
     Major modifications to their program or facility probably will not be needed in order to
         include children with disabilities or other special needs.
     Assistance and support for more significant changes in their program or facility may be
         available.
     An inclusive child care program is rewarding for all the children, families, and staff in
         child care programs.57

Individualizing Care and Education

When serving an individual child, the provider should focus on the child's needs, not the
disability or its label. Working with the family and the service providers, teachers can provide
individualized care and education for the child's unique needs and strengths, just as they should
be doing for each and every child in their classroom.

As each child is unique, so is each child care program. There is no magic formula for making
inclusion work beyond the creativity, energy, and interest that most child care providers
already bring to their work. Their uniqueness notwithstanding, every program is able to
successfully include children with disabilities. And each makes it work child by child, day by day.

Some children need small changes to the curriculum or minor supports in order to get the most
out of certain activities. These sorts of things may consist of fairly simple accommodations, such
as providing a special place or quiet activity for a child who is unable to participate in large-
group activities or making available a special snack for a child who needs to eat more frequently
than the typical meal or snack schedule. Other children may require more specific adaptations
that might not be readily apparent. A variety of community resources can be helpful in
determining what those might be. The family, for example, is always the first and most
important guide for what a child might need; after that, an area specialist or a local workshop
might be. Beyond the immediate community, a world of literature in books, periodicals, and
Web sites devoted to disabilities and inclusion can inform a child care provider about
appropriate adaptations for a child with a particular condition or need.

                      Figure 10.18 - All programs can successfully include children with disabilities.58

Programs that begin with a high-quality, developmentally appropriate foundation; a positive
attitude on the part of the care provider; appropriate adult-child ratios; supportive
administrators; and adequate training for the provider will be in a good position to creatively
solve problems for a child with disabilities or other special needs, exactly as it does for children
who are typically developing. If a child already has an established diagnosis, trained
intervention personnel may be available to assist in this process.

One of the biggest roles for a care provider is to facilitate a sense of belonging and inclusion.
Several helpful strategies are as follows:

     Start with the assumption that all children are competent.
     Adapt the environment so that it is developmentally appropriate, challenging, and fits

         the needs and interests of each child.
     While there may be a need to support a child's mastery of a specific skill, keep the

         whole child in mind, particularly the child's social-emotional experience.59

Common Modifications, Adaptations, and Supports

Each child is an individual, and modifications, adaptations, accommodations, and supports
should be designed with a single child in mind. However, researchers from the Early Childhood
Research Institute on Inclusion (ECRII) have found that many changes can be grouped into
categories of modifications, summarized in Table 10.2.60

Summary

All children and their families deserve access to and full inclusion in high-quality early care and
education programs. This includes children with special health care and other special needs.
Working with families and the health care and service providers, programs can meet each
child's individualized needs. This takes knowledge, planning, and partnership. Inclusive
programs are beneficial to everyone, the children with the special needs and their families, the
children that do not have the special needs, and the program staff.

Introduction

Mental health in childhood means reaching developmental and emotional milestones, and
learning healthy social skills and how to cope when there are problems. Mentally healthy
children have a positive quality of life and can function well at home, in early care and
education programs and school, and in their communities.1

Mental health is an important part of overall health and well-being. Mental health includes
emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how people think, feel, and act. It also
helps determine how people handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental

health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.2
When early educators and families know more about early childhood mental health, they are
better able to support children's learning and development.3

Foundation for Mental Health

Beginning at birth, children need positive relationships with the adults who care for them.
When children learn to recognize and share their feelings with trusted adults, they feel good
about themselves. These relationships help them develop the confidence to learn new skills.
Children thrive when adults support their strengths and needs. Responsive adults help children
feel safe and valued and learn how to get along well with others.

Children who can manage their feelings can learn and play with peers. They are better able to
plan, monitor and control their behavior. They can also adjust to changes in schedules and
routines. Children who get along with adults learn to work together and follow rules. They can
also show concern for, and share, take turns and compromise with other children.4

              Figure 11.1 - It is important to care for children's emotional well-being from the beginning.5

Mental Health from the Beginning

Infant mental health practice applies knowledge of relationships to support and enhance
healthy social and emotional development and to prevent and treat mental health disorders.
The following definition of infant mental health was developed by a group of experts with the
common understanding that observing young children's interactions with parents and other
significant people is key for the assessment of emotional well-being.

         In addition, experts also suggest keeping in mind the infants' underlying biology that
         could include temperament and compromises to resilience from early trauma. Infant
         mental health is the developing capacity of the child from birth to three to: experience,
         regulate, and express emotions; form close and secure interpersonal relationships; and
         explore the environment and learn--all in the context of family, community, and
         cultural expectations for young children. Infant mental health is synonymous with
         healthy social and emotional development. (ZERO TO THREE Infant Mental Health Task
         Force, December, 2001) The mental and physical health of infants and toddlers is
         critically influenced by the daily behaviors of their caregivers.

The following sections describe key concepts related to the mental health of infants. These
concepts enhance what is included in the previous definition:

     "Developing capacity" highlights the extraordinarily rapid pace of growth and change in
         the first 3 years. Although newborns experience intense feelings and are active partners
         in their relationships with adults, the differentiation and complexity of a young child's
         emotional and social development increases markedly over time.

     Infants and toddlers initially depend heavily on adults to help them experience,
         regulate, and express emotions. Infants' cries and coos evoke strong reactions in their
         caregivers. An infant's ability to master feelings develops through give and take.

     Through relationships with parents and other caregivers, infants and toddlers learn
         what people expect of them and what they can expect of other people. Infants and
         toddlers learn through what they experience within relationships and what they observe
         in adult's interactions with one another.

     Infants and toddlers share and communicate feelings and experiences with significant
         caregivers and other children. Infants and toddlers interact with one another in
         emotionally meaningful ways. Parents and caregivers help young children name the
         feelings and understand their effect on others.

     The drive to explore and master one's environment is inborn in humans. An essential
         component of infants' and toddlers' well-being is the self-esteem that grows out of
         mastering their bodies and the environment as well as sharing that mastery with
         parents and significant caregivers.

     Every child is a unique blend of characteristics; infants' and toddlers' developmental
         pathways will reflect not only their individual constitutional differences but also the
         contributions of their caregiving environments. Temperament, or the way an individual
         approaches the world, influences how tentatively or vigorously an infant might engage
         with a new person, toy, or situation.

     The state of adults' emotional well-being and life circumstances profoundly affects the
         quality of infant-caregiver relationships as well as infant and toddler mental health.
         Parents and other significant caregivers bring their own temperament and past
         experiences to relationships.

     Culture influences every aspect of human development. This broad influence affects the
         way that infant mental health is understood; the goals and expectations adults have for

280 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
         young children's development; and the childrearing practices that parents and
         caregivers use to promote, protect, or restore infants' and toddlers' mental health.6

                Pause to Reflect

                   How does this toddler's exploration relate to his self-esteem?

                                                                          Figure 11.27

Mental Health in Early Childhood

Early childhood mental health (birth to 5 years) is a child's growing capacity to do these things,
all in the cultural context of family and community (adapted from ZERO TO THREE):

     Experience, regulate, and express emotions
     Develop close, secure, relationships
     Explore the surroundings and learn.
Early childhood mental health is the same as social emotional development.8 Social and
emotional development is important to early learning. Many social-emotional qualities--such
as curiosity; self-confidence as a learner; self-control of attention, thinking, and impulses; and
initiative in developing new ideas--are essential to learning at any age. Learning, problem
solving, and creativity rely on these social-emotional and motivational qualities as well as basic
cognitive skills.
When learning occurs in groups, such as in preschool classrooms or family child care programs,
the social environment significantly influences how learning occurs. When young children enjoy
interacting with adults and other children, they are more enthusiastic about activities and
participate more. Furthermore, the interest and enthusiasm of others fuels the child's own

excitement about learning, and children are also motivated by others' acknowledgment of the
child's accomplishments.9

It is important because it affects a child's ability to:
     Express their needs
     Pay attention
     Solve problems
     Get along with others
     Follow directions
     Persist when challenged
     Manage their emotions
     Take initiative
     Be curious and interested in learning10

Interviews with preschool and kindergarten teachers indicate that children who have the
greatest difficulties in learning are hindered by the lack of these social-emotional qualities more
than by the inability to identify letters or numbers. Children who are delayed or impaired in
developing these social-emotional and motivational qualities:

     may have difficulty controlling their emotions or behavior,
     may not readily work independently or in a group,
     often appear to lack curiosity or be uninterested in learning, and
     may have difficulties getting along with others, which may undermine the learning

         environment for all children11

Children's mental health is critical to their later school success as well. Children who
     are able to follow directions and pay attention are able to focus on learning.
     can express their feelings are able to get help when they need it.
     learn to persist when frustrated can overcome challenges.
     feel good about themselves are able to work on their own.
     can control their behavior are able to stay on task.12

Finally, the importance of social-emotional development to early learning is consistent with the
research on brain science. The developing brain is not neatly divided into separate areas
governing learning, thinking, and emotions. Instead, it is a highly interconnected organ with
different regions influencing, and being affected by, the others. This means, for example, that
young children who experience emotional challenges (perhaps because of stress) are less ready
for learning because brain regions related to memory are being affected by other regions

governing emotion. This conclusion from brain research is, of course, consistent with the
everyday experience of teachers of children whose stressful lives often lead to emotional,
behavioral, and learning difficulties.13

Childhoods Mental Health Issues

There are two types of mental health issues this chapter is going to address. The first is
diagnosable mental problems. The second is the result of Adverse Childhood Experiences and
childhood trauma.

Mental Health Problems

Mental health problems, which the CDC refers to as mental disorders, among children are
described as serious changes in the way children typically learn, behave, or handle their
emotions, which cause distress and problems getting through the day.

Among the more common mental health problems that can be diagnosed in childhood are
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, which has already been addressed in Chapter
10), anxiety, and behavior disorders.14

Anxiety and Depression

Many children have fears and worries, and may feel sad and hopeless from time to time. Strong
fears may appear at different times during development. For example, toddlers are often very
distressed about being away from their parents, even if they are safe and cared for. Although
fears and worries are typical in children, persistent or extreme forms of fear and sadness could
be due to anxiety or depression. Because the symptoms primarily involve thoughts and feelings,
they are called internalizing disorders.

Anxiety

When children do not outgrow the fears and worries that are typical in young children, or when
there are so many fears and worries that they interfere with school, home, or play activities,
the child may be diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Examples of different types of anxiety
disorders include

     Being very afraid when away from parents (separation anxiety)
     Having extreme fear about a specific thing or situation, such as dogs, insects, or going to

         the doctor (phobias)
     Being very afraid of school and other places where there are people (social anxiety)
     Being very worried about the future and about bad things happening (general anxiety)

     Having repeated episodes of sudden, unexpected, intense fear that come with
         symptoms like heart pounding, having trouble breathing, or feeling dizzy, shaky, or
         sweaty (panic disorder)

Anxiety may present as fear or worry, but can also make children irritable and angry. Anxiety
symptoms can also include trouble sleeping, as well as physical symptoms like fatigue,
headaches, or stomachaches. Some anxious children keep their worries to themselves and,
thus, the symptoms can be missed.

Depression

Occasionally being sad or feeling hopeless is a part of every child's life. However, some children
feel sad or uninterested in things that they used to enjoy, or feel helpless or hopeless in
situations they are able to change. When children feel persistent sadness and hopelessness,
they may be diagnosed with depression.

Examples of behaviors often seen in children with depression include
     Feeling sad, hopeless, or irritable a lot of the time
     Not wanting to do or enjoy doing fun things
     Showing changes in eating patterns - eating a lot more or a lot less than usual
     Showing changes in sleep patterns - sleeping a lot more or a lot less than normal
     Showing changes in energy - being tired and sluggish or tense and restless a lot of the
         time
     Having a hard time paying attention
     Feeling worthless, useless, or guilty
     Showing self-injury and self-destructive behavior

Extreme depression can lead a child to think about suicide or plan for suicide. While less
common in early childhood, for youth ages 10-24 years, suicide is among the leading causes of
death.

Some children may not talk about their helpless and hopeless thoughts, and may not appear
sad. Depression might also cause a child to make trouble or act unmotivated, causing
others not to notice that the child is depressed or to incorrectly label the child as a trouble-
maker or lazy. 15

                                    Figure 11.3 - Persistent sadness is a sign of depression.16

Behavior or Conduct Problems

Children sometimes argue, are aggressive, or act angry or defiant around adults. A behavior
disorder may be diagnosed when these disruptive behaviors are uncommon for the child's age
at the time, persist over time, or are severe. Because disruptive behavior disorders involve
acting out and showing unwanted behavior towards others they are often called externalizing
disorders.

Oppositional Defiant Disorder

When children act out persistently so that it causes serious problems at home, in school, or
with peers, they may be diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD). ODD usually
starts before 8 years of age, but no later than by about 12 years of age. Children with ODD are
more likely to act oppositional or defiant around people they know well, such as family
members, a regular care provider, or a teacher. Children with ODD show these behaviors more
often than other children their age.

Examples of ODD behaviors include:
     Often being angry or losing one's temper
     Often arguing with adults or refusing to comply with adults' rules or requests
     Often resentful or spiteful
     Deliberately annoying others or becoming annoyed with others
     Often blaming other people for one's own mistakes or misbehavior

Conduct Disorder

Conduct Disorder (CD) is diagnosed when children show an ongoing pattern of aggression
toward others, and serious violations of rules and social norms at home, in school, and with

16 Image on pxfuel

285 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
peers. In older children, these rule violations may involve breaking the law and result in arrest.
Children with CD are more likely to get injured and may have difficulties getting along with
peers.

Examples of CD behaviors include:
     Breaking serious rules, such as running away, or for older children staying out at night
         when told not to or skipping school
     Being aggressive in a way that causes harm, such as bullying, fighting, or being cruel to
         animals
     Lying, stealing, or damaging other people's property on purpose17

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)

Many children occasionally have thoughts that bother them, and they might feel like they have
to do something about those thoughts, even if their actions don't actually make sense. For
example, they might worry about having bad luck if they don't wear a favorite piece of clothing.
For some children, the thoughts and the urges to perform certain actions persist, even if they
try to ignore them or make them go away. Children may have an obsessive-compulsive disorder
(OCD) when unwanted thoughts, and the behaviors they feel they must do because of the
thoughts, happen frequently, take up a lot of time (more than an hour a day), interfere with
their activities, or make them very upset. The thoughts are called obsessions. The behaviors are
called compulsions.

Having OCD means having obsessions, compulsions, or both.
Examples of obsessive or compulsive behaviors include:

     Having unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that occur over and over and which
         cause anxiety or distress.

     Having to think about or say something over and over (for example, counting, or
         repeating words over and over silently or out loud)

     Having to do something over and over (for example, handwashing, placing things in a
         specific order, or checking the same things over and over, like whether a door is locked)

     Having to do something over and over according to certain rules that must be followed
         exactly in order to make an obsession go away.

Children do these behaviors because they have the feeling that the behaviors will prevent bad
things from happening or will make them feel better. However, the behavior is not typically
connected to actual danger of something bad happening, or the behavior is extreme, such as
washing hands multiple times per hour.

A common myth is that OCD means being really neat and orderly. Sometimes, OCD behaviors
may involve cleaning, but many times someone with OCD is too focused on one thing that must

be done over and over, rather than on being organized. Obsessions and compulsions can also
change over time.18

Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

All children may experience very stressful events that affect how they think and feel. Most of
the time, children recover quickly and well. However, sometimes children who experience
severe stress, such as from an injury, from the death or threatened death of a close family
member or friend, or from violence, will be affected long-term. The child could experience this
trauma directly or could witness it happening to someone else. When children develop long
term symptoms (longer than one month) from such stress, which are upsetting or interfere with
their relationships and activities, they may be diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder
(PTSD).

Examples of PTSD symptoms include:
     Reliving the event over and over in thought or in play
     Nightmares and sleep problems
     Becoming very upset when something causes memories of the event
     Lack of positive emotions
     Intense ongoing fear or sadness
     Irritability and angry outbursts
     Constantly looking for possible threats, being easily startled
     Acting helpless, hopeless or withdrawn
     Denying that the event happened or feeling numb
     Avoiding places or people associated with the event

                                   Figure 11.4 - Severe stress can cause long-term effects.19

287 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
Because children who have experienced traumatic stress may seem restless, fidgety, or have
trouble paying attention and staying organized, the symptoms of traumatic stress can be
confused with symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
Examples of events that could cause PTSD include:

     Physical, sexual, or emotional maltreatment
     Being a victim or witness to violence or crime
     Serious illness or death of a close family member or friend
     Natural or manmade disasters
     Severe car accidents20

Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Health Problems in Childhood

Symptoms of mental health problems change over time as a child grows, and may include
difficulties with how a child plays, learns, speaks, and acts or how the child handles their
emotions. Symptoms often start in early childhood, although some disorders may develop
during the teenage years. The diagnosis is often made in the school years and sometimes
earlier. However, some children with a mental disorder may not be recognized or diagnosed as
having one.

Childhood mental health problems can, and should, be treated and managed. There are many
treatment options based on the best and most current medical evidence, so families and
doctors should work closely with everyone involved in the child's treatment -- teachers,
coaches, therapists, and other service providers. Taking advantage of all the resources available
will help parents, health professionals, and educators guide the child towards success. Early
diagnosis and appropriate services for children and their families can make a difference in the
lives of children with mental disorders and their families.22

Adverse Childhood Experiences and Trauma

The childhood years, from the prenatal period to late adolescence, are the "building block"
years that help set the stage for adult relationships, behaviors, health, and social outcomes.23
The occurrence of Adverse Childhood Experiences and childhood trauma can damage those
building blocks. Early care and education programs can help children develop resilience to
combat the negative effects of those.

Adverse Childhood Experiences

Adverse Childhood Experiences, or ACEs, are potentially traumatic events that occur in
childhood (0-17 years) such as experiencing violence, abuse, or neglect; witnessing violence in
the home; and having a family member attempt or die by suicide. Also included are aspects of
the child's environment that can undermine their sense of safety, stability, and bonding such as
growing up in a household with substance misuse, mental health problems, or instability due to
parental separation or incarceration of a parent, sibling or other member of the household.
Traumatic events in childhood can be emotionally painful or distressing and can have effects
that persist for years. Factors such as the nature, frequency and seriousness of the traumatic
event, prior history of trauma, and available family and community supports can shape a child's
response to trauma.24

Adverse Childhood Experiences and associated conditions such as living in under-resourced or
racially segregated neighborhoods, frequently moving, experiencing food insecurity, and other
instability can cause toxic stress (i.e., prolonged activation of the stress-response system). Some
children may face further exposure to toxic stress from historical and ongoing traumas due to
systemic racism or the impacts of multigenerational poverty resulting from limited educational
and economic opportunities.

A large and growing body of research indicates that toxic stress during childhood can harm the
most basic levels of the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems, and that such exposures can
even alter the physical structure of DNA (epigenetic effects). Changes to the brain from toxic
stress can affect such things as attention, impulsive behavior, decision-making, learning,
emotion, and response to stress. Absent factors that can prevent or reduce toxic stress,
children growing up under these conditions often struggle to learn and complete schooling.
They are at increased risk of becoming involved in crime and violence, using alcohol or drugs,
and engaging in other health-risk behaviors (e.g., early initiation of sexual activity; unprotected
sex; and suicide attempts). They are susceptible to disease, illness, and mental health
challenges over their lifetime. Children growing up with toxic stress may have difficulty forming
healthy and stable relationships. They may also have unstable work histories as adults and
struggle with finances, family, jobs, and depression throughout life--the effects of which can be
passed on to their own children. 26

Childhood Trauma

Childhood trauma occurs when a child experiences an actual or threatened negative event,
series of events, or set of circumstances that cause emotional pain and overwhelm the child's
ability to cope. Childhood trauma is widespread and can take many forms. Common types of
childhood trauma include:

     Abuse and neglect
     Family violence
     Community violence
     School violence
     Life-threatening accidents and injuries
     Frightening or painful medical procedures
     Serious and untreated parental mental illness
     Loss of or separation from a parent or other loved one
     Natural or manmade disasters
     War or terrorist attack
     Forced displacement or refugee status
     Discrimination
     Extreme poverty

Trauma exposure often begins early in life. Young children are at the highest risk for exposure
to trauma and are most vulnerable to its adverse effects. An estimated half of all children in the
United States--approximately 35 million--are exposed to at least one type of trauma prior to

their eighth birthday. For example, child abuse and neglect are most common among children
younger than age 3. Children under age 5 are most likely to incur injuries from falls, choking,
and poisoning, and represent the majority of children who witness domestic violence. Children
from certain racial and ethnic groups also are more likely to experience adversities that can
cause trauma. For example, exposure to childhood adversity is more common among black and
Hispanic children than among white children, even when accounting for the role of income.

Childhood trauma is strongly linked to mental and physical health problems over the lifespan. It
negatively impacts brain development, cognitive development, learning, social-emotional
development, the ability to develop secure attachments to others, and physical health; it is also
associated with a shortened lifespan. A considerable body of research demonstrates that
children suffer the most severe, long-lasting, and harmful effects when trauma exposure begins
early in life, takes multiple forms, is severe and pervasive, and involves harm by a parent or
other primary caregiver--often referred to as complex trauma.

Childhood trauma is more likely to lead to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) than trauma
that occurs in adulthood. Children exposed to several different forms of trauma are more likely
to exhibit PTSD (e.g., anxiety, depression, anger, aggression, dissociation) than children with
chronic exposure to a single type of trauma. Children and youth with PTSD may re-experience
the traumatic event through intrusive memories, nightmares, and flashbacks; avoid situations
or people that remind them of the trauma; and feel intense anxiety that disrupts their everyday
lives. In addition, they may engage in aggressive, self-destructive, or reckless behavior; have
trouble sleeping; or remain in a state of hypervigilance, an exaggerated state of awareness and
reactivity to their environments. However, there is no typical reaction to trauma. The vast
majority of children show distress immediately following a traumatic event, but most return to
their prior level of functioning.

Generally, children's reactions to trauma differ based on the nature of the trauma; the child's
individual, family, and neighborhood characteristics; and the overall balance of risk and
protective factors in their lives. It also depends on their age and developmental stage.

Young children who experience trauma may:
     Have difficulties forming an attachment to caregivers
     Experience excessive fear of strangers or separation anxiety
     Have trouble eating and sleeping
     Be especially fussy
     Show regression after reaching a developmental milestone (e.g., sleeping through the
         night, toilet training)

School-age children who experience trauma may:
     Engage in aggressive behavior
     Become withdrawn
     Fixate on their own safety or the safety of others

Resilience to Childhood Trauma

When parents, service providers, and programs employ a resilience framework to childhood
trauma, they understand there are always opportunities to support positive developmental
trajectories among children, even if they have experienced trauma. Resilience has been defined
as "a dynamic process encompassing positive adaptation within the context of significant
adversity." Resilience is not a personal trait that individuals do or do not possess (thus, the term
"resiliency" is best avoided because it connotes an individual characteristic), but rather a
product of interacting factors--biological, psychological, social, and cultural--that determine
how a child responds to traumatic events.

Resilience to trauma can be defined in several ways: positive child outcomes despite exposure
to trauma, prevention of trauma recurrence despite high risk for further exposure, or avoidance
of traumatic experiences altogether in the face of significant risk. All three of these
conceptualizations of resilience are based on an ecological approach.

Using an ecological approach to promote resilience in development among children who
experience trauma is useful because it assumes that there are multiple levels of influence on a
child's development--the individual, parent, family, school, community, and culture--which
may increase or decrease a child's risk for and response to experiencing trauma. These various
influences are often referred to as risk and protective factors.

Risk factors are circumstances, characteristics, conditions, events, or traits at the
individual, family, community, or cultural level that may increase the likelihood a person
will experience adversity (e.g., childhood trauma, re-traumatization, or negative
outcomes due to trauma). Risk factors for specific types of trauma may vary, but
commonly include living in poverty, a lack of social supports, and prior history of
trauma. Additionally, children who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or
queer (LGBTQ) and children in military families are at an increased risk for experiencing
trauma. However, the presence of risk factors or membership in a high-risk group does
not necessarily mean that a child will experience trauma or its most adverse
effects. Protective factors can buffer children from risk and improve the odds of resilient
functioning.

294 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
         Protective factors are characteristics, conditions, or events that promote healthy
         development and minimize the risk or likelihood a person will experience a particular
         illness or event, or its related negative outcomes. Research shows that the strongest
         protective factor linked with resilience to childhood trauma is the reliable presence of a
         sensitive, nurturing, and responsive adult. The presence of such a figure can help
         children by restoring a sense of safety, predictability, and control; giving them the
         feeling of safety; providing them a way to process traumatic events; protecting them
         from re-traumatization; supporting their development of self-regulation; and helping
         them heal.

In addition, the National Child Traumatic Stress Network highlights the following protective
factors that promote resilience to childhood trauma:

     Support from family, friends, people at school, and members of the community
     A sense of safety at home, at school, and in the community
     High self-esteem and positive sense of self-worth
     Self-efficacy
     Spiritual or cultural beliefs, goals, or dreams for the future that provide a sense of

         meaning to a child's life
     A talent or skill in a particular area (e.g., excelling in school or in a sport)
     Coping skills that can be applied to varying situations

Finally, resilience to childhood trauma depends largely on the supports available to a child and
his or her family. Family members, teachers, mental health providers, child welfare workers,
and other community service providers can work together to ensure that children and families
receive the emotional and concrete supports (e.g., food, shelter, financial stability) they need.
This system of care approach is also a cornerstone of TIC. 29

                Pause to Reflect

                   What risk factors did you encounter in your own childhood? What protective
                   factors did you experience? How did/does this effect your resilience?

Early Care and Education's Role in Children's Mental
Health

Many practices of high-quality early care and education programs promote mental health and
well-being including:

     A well-designed space is comfortable for infants and toddlers with different

         temperaments as well as for their teachers and parents.
             o Poorly designed environments are stressful. Teachers are concerned about the
                  safety and well-being of children, and their saying "no" occupies a great deal of
                  teacher energy and attention. The time teachers spend monitoring keeps them
                  from interacting with an infant or toddler in ways that build self-esteem.

     Having partnerships with community resources that families can be referred to.
     Reciprocal communication with families. 30

Mental health services in early care and education programs can address:
     Promotion--helping all children to feel good about themselves, to get along with others
         and to manage their behavior.
     Prevention--reducing the likelihood that children will develop mental health problems
         and reducing the impact of mental health problems that do exist.
     Early Identification--paying attention to mental health problems early on.
     Treatment--helping connect families with appropriate help for children with mental

                       Infant and Early Childhood Mental Health Consultation (IECMHC) a
                       prevention-based service that pairs a mental health consultant with
                       families and adults who work with infants and young children in the
                       different settings where they learn and grow, such as child care,
                       preschool, and their home. The aim is to build adults' capacity to
                       strengthen and support the healthy social and emotional development of
                       childrenearly and before intervention is needed.

                       IECMHC has been shown to improve children's social skills and emotional
                       functioning, promote healthy relationships, reduce challenging behaviors,
                       reduce the number of suspensions and expulsions, improve classroom
                       quality, and reduce provider stress, burnout, and turnover. 33

Increasing Children's Opportunities to Practice Social Skills
and Emotional Competencies

Everyday activities in the classroom can be planned and implemented to help children's social
and emotional development (which, as mentioned, is the same as their mental health).

Teaching Children About Emotions

There are many things that teachers can do to help support children's understanding emotions.
Here are some ideas:

     Make faces expressing different emotions and have children guess what you might be
         feeling.

     Throughout the day, help children learn to label their own emotions (e.g., "It looks like
         you are feeling mad that we can't go outside; what can we do to help you feel better?").

     While reading stories to children, have children guess how the characters in the story
         are feeling. Ask questions like, "How can you tell that the character is feeling that way?
         Can you make a face that shows that feeling?"

     Use puppets to act out different situations; for example, one puppet takes a toy from
         another puppet. Ask the children what emotion(s) the puppets might be feeling.

     Frequently direct children to look at each other's faces and think about how they are
         feeling.

     Listen to some different types of music, such as rock or classical, and let the children
         dance to the music. Ask children how the song made the children feel.

Teaching Children about Friendship

Being in an environment with many same-aged peers that are all learning about how to express
themselves, work with others, and regulate their behaviors provides a great place to help
children learn about friendships. Here are some ideas:

     Model asking others for help. If you have a task to do in the classroom, involve another
         child.

     Whenever children have to take turns, have the child who just finished call someone to
         go next.

     Have children help during routines such as putting out cots or mats for naptime.
     Talk about your own social behaviors. You can say things like, "I said 'thank you' to Ms.

         Tanya because she passed me the milk," or "I think I'll hold the door open for Jamal
         because his hands are full."
     Identify certain items in centers that require children to help each other, like taking a
         dollhouse off a shelf, moving the car garage, or feeding the class pet. Explain to children
         that it takes two friends to do these things.
     Provide toys and play games that require two or more people, like a wagon or toss and
         catch game.
     Make a "Friendship Board" on a bulletin board in your classroom. Take pictures when
         children are working together on something or playing together and put them on the
         wall.

                       Figure 11.10 - When children work together, they practice their social skills.34

Teaching Children about Problem-Solving

Everyday life presents many opportunities for children to engage in identifying problems and
generating and trying out solutions. Here are some ideas for in the classroom:

34 Image by cottonbro on pexels

298 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Use naturally occurring opportunities to work problem-solving words into the classroom
         vocabulary. When there aren't enough glue sticks or too many people wanting to go in a
         certain center, say things like, "We have a problem. What can we do to fix it?"

     Use naturally occurring problems in small groups to brainstorm possible solutions. Talk
         about that problem and come up with some ideas that could work to solve the problem.

     Use puppets to act out problem situations during group time. Ask the children to come
         up with a solution for the problem.

     When a child asks for help, take the opportunity to involve another child in solving the
         problem. You can say, "Let's look and see if one of your friends can help you. Marne,
         Sheila needs a glue stick and there are no more. Can you help her solve her problem?"

     Encourage the children while they are working through a problem and provide them
         with recognition when they solve it. You can use a situation that ended well as an
         example to discuss in large group.

     Discuss the problems that characters are having in the books you are reading.
         Brainstorm some possible solutions and guess what they are going to do.

     Make up a song about what to do when children have a problem. For example, to
         the Row, Row, Row Your Boat tune: "Problem, problem, problem, oh what can we do?
         Stop and think of something new. I'll try it out with you."

     If similar solutions keep coming up during discussions of problem-solving, start a
         "Solution Board" that shows the different solutions with an image to represent it.
         Children can use it to help think of solutions as problems arise, and the teacher can
         prompt a child to go look at it.

                   Figure 11.11 - Use real life opportunities to help children practice problem-solving.35

Teaching Children about Handling Disappointment and Difficult
Emotions

Handling intense emotions and the disappointment when things don't go their way are
challenging for young children (and even adults!) to navigate. But teachers can help children
develop techniques to handle difficult emotions. Here are some ideas:

299 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Throughout the day, model labeling your own emotions. For example, "I feel frustrated
         because I cannot open this jar of paint."

     Help children learn to label their emotions when they have conflict with other children:
         "Bobby, it looks like you are feeling angry because Terrence took away your toy. Can you
         tell Terrence how it makes you feel when he takes your toy away?"

     When children cry, identify their feelings, and yours too. "I know that was really scary
         falling off the slide. I was worried about you. I am glad you are okay. Is there something I
         can do to help you until you feel better?"

     Help children learn how to take deep breaths by "smelling the flowers" and "blowing
         out the birthday candles." Knowing how to breathe deeply is an important part of
         learning how to calm down when angry or upset.

     Give children materials to use to get out their anger. They can use a toy hammer,
         squeeze playdough, or run laps at recess. Let them know that it is okay to be angry and
         that there are safe ways to express anger.

     Act out the difference between feeling tense (like a robot or statue) and relaxed (like a
         rag doll or stuffed animal). Have children act it out, too, so they begin to learn to
         identify when they are becoming wound up.

     Help children learn to label their own emotions. You can say, "It looks like you are really
         frustrated over here. What is the problem?"

     Give children different situations, such as "A child is very sad because he misses his
         mom," and let them act it out. Talk about the emotion and some things the child might
         do to feel better.

     Children's storybooks have lots of opportunities to talk about dealing with certain
         emotions. Point out characters' simple emotions like happy, sad, mad, and excited, and
         look for opportunities to label more complex ones like disappointed, frustrated,
         surprised, and embarrassed. See what the characters do to deal with those emotions
         and whether or not the children think it was a good way. Brainstorm other things that
         could have been done when the characters were feeling that way.

     If children are feeling sad at drop-off, have them "write" a letter or draw a picture to
         show their caregivers at pick-up time. Talk about how it is ok to feel sad, but that their
         caregiver will come back at the end of the day. 36

              Engaging Families in Supporting Children's Social-Emotional
              Development

                 There are many things you can do to give families ideas of how to support their
                 children's social and emotional development at home too. You can

                      Incorporate the emotion words the children have been practicing or have
                          identified during the day into notes or newsletters for parents. This may

                          help to encourage discussion of emotion words in the home setting as
                          well.
                      Include a note about a situation that arose at school and how it was
                          solved when reporting to parents. Encourage the parents to ask the
                          children about it.
                      Encourage families to use meals and end of day routes to discuss the day
                          with their children.
                      Share some of the things you do throughout the day. Many of those
                          things can be done at home too.

                 Some specific ideas you can give parents include the following:
                      During bathroom routines, have children look in the mirror and practice
                          making mad, sad, and happy faces.
                      In the morning, discuss things you are excited about for the upcoming
                          day.
                      When leaving the house, ask the child to help you carry things.
                          Afterward, thank them for helping.
                      Throughout daily routines outside of the house, talk about the different
                          ways the people you see help (police officers, bus drivers, cashiers).
                          Emphasize the helping nature of these jobs.
                      Use meal preparation as a chance to practice and talk about social skills.
                          Have children get out ingredients, set the table, or stir food. Discuss how
                          important it is to help and how much the help is appreciated.
                      Create a solution kit that can be used at home when your child has a
                          problem. Add solutions such as asking a sibling or parent for help,
                          choosing a different toy, or going outside to play. Post them on the fridge
                          for easy access!
                      Model techniques to use when dealing with anger and frustration. Show
                          breathing techniques, counting, or whatever works to calm you down.37

Supporting Children Under Stress

Supporting children's mental health also extends to helping children deal with the stress that
they may encounter. One of the most important things teachers can do is provide the child with
a predictable, safe haven where children can feel secure. Teachers can create a comfortable
and comforting everyday routine that is child-centered, individualized, responsive, and helpfully
structured to give young children a sense of control and predictability that may be lacking in
other aspects of the child's life. Central to these efforts is providing children with supportive
adult relationships that are reliable and helpful. This may be more difficult than one would
expect because young children under stress often test these relationships to see whether

teachers and other adults will remain responsive to them even when children act defiantly or
negatively.

In some circumstances, it can be helpful for teachers to obtain the advice of an early childhood
mental health consultant who can observe the child in the classroom, talk with the teacher
about the child's behavior, and suggest strategies for providing supportive assistance. Early
childhood mental health consultants can be valuable resources to an early childhood education
program. They can help teachers provide much-needed support to young children who may not
have other such sources of support elsewhere in their lives.38

Trauma-Informed Care

As mentioned, children who are exposed to traumatic life events are at significant risk for
developing serious and long-lasting problems across multiple areas of development. However,
children are far more likely to exhibit resilience to childhood trauma when child-serving
programs, institutions, and service systems understand the impact of childhood trauma, share
common ways to talk and think about trauma, and thoroughly integrate effective practices and
policies to address it--an approach often referred to as trauma-informed care (TIC).

The context in which children live, learn, and grow shapes both their immediate and long-term
well-being. Accordingly, children who experience trauma are more likely to exhibit resilience
when their environments are responsive to their specific needs. Families, schools, community-
based programs and services, and the individuals caring for children can increase the chances of
resilience following childhood trauma when they become aware of the impact of childhood
trauma, provide a sense of safety and predictability, protect children from further adversity,
and offer pathways for their recovery. In other words, children benefit when these entities
provide them with trauma-informed care (TIC).

Despite its focus on trauma, TIC is inherently a strengths-based perspective that emphasizes
resilience instead of pathology. TIC has been defined and implemented in a number of ways,
but the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has identified four key
elements--the Four Rs (see Figure 11.12)

                        Figure 11.12 - The Four Rs are the key elements of Trauma-Informed Care 39

Applying TIC to real-world settings begins with a child's first contact with a program, institution,
or service system. It requires a comprehensive and multi-pronged effort involving the many
adults in children's lives. For example, in a school or afterschool program, TIC means increasing
trauma-related knowledge and skills among program facilitators, school administrators, bus
drivers, food service workers, classroom assistants, administrative staff, volunteers, teachers,
leadership, special education professionals, school social workers and psychologists, families,
and anyone else who comes into contact with children. However, increasing trauma knowledge
is only one aspect of TIC, which also means that the individuals who care for children must be
able to:

    1. Realize the widespread nature of childhood trauma and how it impacts the child's
         emotional, social, behavioral, cognitive, brain, and physical development, as well as
         their mental health. In addition, adults must be aware of the influence of trauma on
         family members, first responders, service providers, and others who may experience
         secondary stress (trauma-related reactions to exposure to another person's traumatic
         experience). In some instances, adults endure the same traumatic events or
         circumstances as the child (e.g., a natural disaster, community violence, death of a
         community member) and may benefit from similar supports.

    2. Recognize the symptoms of trauma, including how trauma reactions (i.e., symptoms of
         posttraumatic stress) vary by gender, age, type of trauma, or setting. In addition, the
         adults in children's lives must understand that a child's challenging behaviors are
         normal, self-protective, and adaptive reactions to highly stressful situations, rather than

         viewing that child as intentionally misbehaving. Children's trauma reactions are
         understood to be adaptive efforts to protect themselves in response to traumatic
         events. For example, a child may be hypervigilant to an adult's anger or disapproval
         because, in the past, he or she experienced physical abuse by a parent. Or, a child may
         disassociate or daydream as a learned response that enables them to avoid feeling or
         thinking about a traumatic experience. In addition, TIC means recognizing that trauma
         may influence a child's engagement in activities and services, interactions with peers
         and adults, and responsiveness to rules and guidelines.
    3. Respond by making necessary adjustments, in their own language and behavior, to the
         child's environment; and to policies, procedures, and practices to support the child's
         recovery and resilience to trauma.
    4. Resist re-traumatization by actively shaping children's environments to avoid triggers
         (sounds, sights, smells, objects, places, or people that remind an individual of the
         original trauma) and protect children from further trauma, which can exacerbate the
         negative impacts of trauma and interfere with the healing process.

Training and Professional Development on Child Trauma

Providing adults (staff, leadership, families, and community partners) with training and
professional development on childhood trauma is an important component of implementing
TIC. It is essential that adults become aware of the prevalence and impact of trauma, and learn
to apply a "trauma lens" (i.e., gain the capacity to view children's difficulties in behavior,
learning, and relationships as natural reactions to trauma that warrant understanding and
sensitive care). In addition, adults can learn key strategies to manage trauma-related problems
in childhood. These include:

     creating environments that feel physically and emotionally safe.
     teaching children self-regulation, language and communication skills, and how to build

         healthy relationships.
     learning each child's trauma triggers and how both the child and adults can limit,

         anticipate, and cope with them.
     supporting the development of healthy attachments with parents and other caregivers,

         as well as positive relationships with peers.

Evaluations of TIC initiatives also indicate that when parents, service providers, and programs
share a common language and view of trauma, they are better able to work together to meet
children's needs.

Training and professional development opportunities are also important for increasing the
capacity of adults to attend to other aspects of TIC, including:

     family engagement.
     practices that are responsive to culture, gender, and sexual orientation.
     collaboration with community service providers (e.g., mental health providers who can

         screen for childhood trauma and provide evidence-based treatment).
     developing and integrating emergency and crisis response protocols.

304 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     and establishing trauma-informed policies that support positive youth development
         despite exposure to trauma.

Building capacity and maintaining an ongoing commitment to TIC efforts are critical to
sustainability. However, although it is a critical component of TIC, training staff and parents on
the impact of childhood trauma is not sufficient and does not in and of itself constitute TIC. TIC
must also include comprehensive, ongoing professional development and education for
parents, families, school staff, out-of-school program staff, and community service providers on
jointly addressing childhood trauma.

Secondary Traumatic Stress

TIC also means attending to the psychological and physical safety and well-being of the adults
who care for children who have experienced trauma. Professionals, parents, and other
caregiving adults may suffer secondary traumatic stress (trauma-related reactions to exposure
to another person's traumatic experience). The National Child Traumatic Stress Network
recommends the following strategies to combat secondary traumatic stress and reduce related
staff burnout and turnover:

     Provide high-quality, reflective supervision
     Maintain trauma workload balance
     Support workplace self-care groups
     Enhance the physical safety of staff
     Provide training to both staff and leadership to increase awareness about secondary

         traumatic stress and how to address it effectively
     Develop opportunities for staff and leadership to learn about and engage in self-care

         practices.
     Create external partnerships with secondary traumatic stress experts.
     Regularly assess the vulnerability and resilience of staff and leadership to second

         traumatic stress
     Create a buddy system for self-care accountability.40

Summary

Children's mental health (their social and emotional development) must be intentionally
supported from the beginning. Children with mental health problems (both diagnosed and that

stress may need additional mental health support. Early care and education programs should
practice trauma informed care and recognize their role in helping children, and their families, to
develop resilience.

Introduction

In order to plan, prepare, and serve nutritious foods to children in early care and education
programs it's important to have a basic understanding of nutrition and the programs and
resources available to support meeting children's nutrition needs.

What are Nutrients?

The foods we eat contain nutrients. Nutrients are substances required by the body to perform
its basic functions. Nutrients must be obtained from our diet, since the human body does not
synthesize or produce them. Nutrients have one or more of three basic functions: they provide
energy, contribute to body structure, and/or regulate chemical processes in the body. These
basic functions allow us to detect and respond to environmental surroundings, move, excrete
wastes, respire (breathe), grow, and reproduce. There are six classes of nutrients required for
the body to function and maintain overall health. These are carbohydrates, fats, proteins,

309 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
water, vitamins, and minerals. Foods also contain non-nutrients that may be harmful (such as
natural toxins common in plant foods and additives like some dyes and preservatives) or
beneficial (such as antioxidants).

Macronutrients

Nutrients that are needed in large amounts are called macronutrients. There are three classes
of macronutrients: carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. These can be metabolically processed into
cellular energy, allowing our bodies to conduct their basic functions. A unit of measurement of
food energy is the calorie. Water is also a macronutrient in the sense that you require a large
amount of it, but unlike the other macronutrients, it does not yield calories.

Carbohydrates

Carbohydrates are molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. The major food
sources of carbohydrates are grains, milk, fruits, and starchy vegetables, like potatoes. Non-
starchy vegetables also contain carbohydrates, but in lesser quantities. Carbohydrates are
broadly classified into two forms based on their chemical structure: simple carbohydrates,
often called simple sugars; and complex carbohydrates.

Simple carbohydrates consist of one or two basic units. Examples of simple sugars include
sucrose, the type of sugar you would have in a bowl on the breakfast table, and glucose, the
type of sugar that circulates in your blood.

Complex carbohydrates are long chains of simple. During digestion, the body breaks down
digestible complex carbohydrates to simple sugars, mostly glucose. Glucose is then transported
to all our cells where it is stored, used to make energy, or used to build macromolecules. Fiber
is also a complex carbohydrate, but it cannot be broken down by digestive enzymes in the
human intestine. As a result, it passes through the digestive tract undigested unless the
bacteria that inhabit the colon or large intestine break it down.

One gram of digestible carbohydrates yields four kilocalories of energy for the cells in the body
to perform work. In addition to providing energy and serving as building blocks for bigger
macromolecules, carbohydrates are essential for proper functioning of the nervous system,
heart, and kidneys. As mentioned, glucose can be stored in the body for future use.

Fats

Fat (officially called lipids) are also a family of molecules composed of carbon, hydrogen, and
oxygen, but unlike carbohydrates, they are insoluble in water. Fats are found predominantly in
butter, oils, meats, dairy products, nuts, and seeds, and in many processed foods. The main job
of fats is to provide or store energy. Fats provide more energy per gram than carbohydrates
(nine kilocalories per gram of fats versus four kilocalories per gram of carbohydrates). In
addition to energy storage, fats serve as a major component of cell membranes, surround and
protect organs (in fat-storing tissues), provide insulation to aid in temperature regulation, and
regulate many other functions in the body.

Proteins

Proteins are macromolecules composed of chains of subunits called amino acids. Amino acids
are simple subunits composed of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, and nitrogen. Food sources of
proteins include meats, dairy products, seafood, and a variety of different plant-based foods,
most notably soy. The word protein comes from a Greek word meaning "of primary
importance," which is an apt description of these macronutrients; they are also known
colloquially as the "workhorses" of life. Proteins provide four kilocalories of energy per gram;
however providing energy is not protein's most important function. Proteins provide structure
to bones, muscles and skin, and play a role in conducting most of the chemical reactions that
take place in the body. Scientists estimate that more than one-hundred thousand different
proteins exist within the human body. The genetic codes in DNA are basically protein recipes
that determine the order in which 20 different amino acids are bound together to make
thousands of specific proteins.

Water

There is one other nutrient that we must have in large quantities: water. Water does not
contain carbon, but is composed of two hydrogens and one oxygen per molecule of water.
More than 60 percent of your total body weight is water. Without it, nothing could be
transported in or out of the body, chemical reactions would not occur, organs would not be
cushioned, and body temperature would fluctuate widely.

Micronutrients

Micronutrients are nutrients required by the body in lesser amounts, but are still essential for
carrying out bodily functions. Micronutrients include all the essential minerals and vitamins.
There are sixteen essential minerals and thirteen vitamins (See Table 12.1 "Minerals and Their
Major Functions" and Table 12.2 "Vitamins and Their Major Functions" for a complete list and
their major functions). In contrast to carbohydrates, fats, and proteins, micronutrients are not
sources of energy (calories), but they assist in the process as components of enzymes. Enzymes
are proteins that cause chemical reactions in the body and are involved in all aspects of body

functions from producing energy, to digesting nutrients, to building macromolecules.
Micronutrients play many essential roles in the body.

Minerals

Minerals are solid inorganic substances that form crystals and are classified depending on how
much of them we need. Trace minerals, such as molybdenum, selenium, zinc, iron, and iodine,
are only required in a few milligrams or less. Macrominerals, such as calcium, magnesium,
potassium, sodium, and phosphorus, are required in hundreds of milligrams. Many minerals are
critical for enzyme function, others are used to maintain fluid balance, build bone tissue,
synthesize hormones, transmit nerve impulses, contract and relax muscles, and protect against
harmful free radicals in the body that can cause health problems such as cancer.

Vitamins

The thirteen vitamins are categorized as either water-soluble or fat-soluble. The water-soluble
vitamins are vitamin C and all the B vitamins, which include thiamine, riboflavin, niacin,
pantothenic acid, pyridoxine, biotin, folate and cobalamin. Unneeded water soluble vitamins
are excreted from the body. The fat-soluble vitamins are A, D, E, and K. Vitamins are required to
perform many functions in the body such as making red blood cells, synthesizing bone tissue,
and playing a role in normal vision, nervous system function, and immune system function. Fat
soluble vitamins are stored in the body in fat (and can become toxic when too much is
consumed, almost always from supplements).

Vitamin deficiencies can cause severe health problems and even death. Some vitamins have
been found to prevent certain disorders and diseases such as scurvy (vitamin C), night blindness
(vitamin A), and rickets (vitamin D).4

Quality of Food

One measurement of food quality is the amount of nutrients it contains relative to the amount
of energy it provides. High-quality foods are nutrient dense, meaning they contain significant
amounts of one or more essential nutrients relative to the amount of calories they provide.
Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite of "empty-calorie" foods such as carbonated sugary soft
drinks, which provide many calories and very little, if any, other nutrients. Food quality is
additionally associated with its taste, texture, appearance, microbial content, and how much
consumers like it. 6

                   Food: A Better Source of Nutrients

                       It is better to get all your micronutrients from the foods you eat as
                       opposed to from supplements. Supplements contain only what is listed
                       on the label, but foods contain many more macronutrients,
                       micronutrients, and other chemicals, like antioxidants, that benefit
                       health. While vitamins, multivitamins, and supplements are a $20 billion
                       industry in the United States, and more than 50 percent of Americans
                       purchase and use them daily, there is no consistent evidence that they
                       are better than food in promoting health and preventing disease.7

Food Additives

People have been using food additives for thousands of years. Today more than 3000
substances are used as food additives. Salt, sugar, and corn syrup are by far the most widely
used additives in food in this country. How this might affect the quality (including nutritional
value) of food will depend on the additive.

"Food additive" is defined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as any substance that--
directly or indirectly--becomes a component or otherwise affects the characteristics of any
food. This definition includes any substance used in the production, processing, treatment,
packaging, transportation or storage of food.

Additives are used to maintain or improve safety, freshness, nutritional value, taste, texture
and appearance. The use of food additives has become more prominent in recent years due to
the increased production of prepared, processed, and convenience foods.

According to the FDA, "Direct food additives are those that are added to a food for a specific
purpose in that food." For example, using phosphates in meat and poultry products to retain
moisture and protect the flavor.

"Indirect food additives are those that become part of the food in trace amounts due to its
packaging, storage or other handling," according to the FDA. For instance, minute amounts of
packaging substances may find their way into foods during storage. Food packaging
manufacturers must prove to the FDA that all materials coming in contact with food are safe
before they are permitted for use in such a manner.

FDA defines a color additive as any dye, pigment, or substance which--when added or applied
to a food, drug, or cosmetic, or to the human body--is capable (alone or through reactions with
other substances) of imparting color. FDA is responsible for regulating all color additives to
ensure that foods containing color additives are safe to eat, contain only approved ingredients,
and are accurately labeled.

Color additives are used in foods for many reasons: 1) to offset color loss due to exposure to
light, air, temperature extremes, moisture, and storage conditions; 2) to correct natural
variations in color; 3) to enhance colors that occur naturally; and 4) to provide color to colorless

and "fun" foods. Without color additives, colas wouldn't be brown, margarine wouldn't be
yellow, and mint ice cream wouldn't be green. Color additives are now recognized as an
important part of practically all processed foods we eat.

Today, food and color additives are more strictly studied, regulated, and monitored than at any
other time in history. FDA has the primary legal responsibility for determining their safe use. To
market a new food or color additive (or before using an additive already approved for one use
in another manner not yet approved), a manufacturer or other sponsor must first petition FDA
for its approval. These petitions must provide evidence that the substance is safe for the ways
in which it will be used.

Before any substance can be added to food, its safety must be assessed in a stringent approval
process. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the U.S. Department of Agriculture
(USDA) shares responsibility with FDA for the safety of food additives used in meat, poultry, and
egg products. All additives are initially evaluated for safety by FDA.

When an additive is proposed for use in a meat, poultry, or egg product, its safety, technical
function, and conditions of use must also be evaluated by the Risk, Innovations and
Management Staff of FSIS, as provided in the Federal Meat Inspection Act, the Poultry Products
Inspection Act, the Egg Products Inspection Act, and related regulations.

Although FDA has overriding authority regarding additive safety, FSIS may apply even stricter
standards that take into account the unique characteristics of meat, poultry, and egg products.
Several years ago, for instance, permission was sought to use sorbic acid in meat salads.
Although sorbic acid was an approved food additive, permission for use in meat salad was
denied because such usage could mask spoilage caused by organisms that cause foodborne
illness.

Additives are never given permanent approval. FDA and FSIS continually review the safety of
approved additives, based on the best scientific knowledge, to determine if approvals should be
modified or withdrawn.

The statutes and regulations to enforce the statutes require certain information on labels of
meat and poultry products so consumers will have complete information about a product. In all
cases, ingredients must be listed on the product label in the ingredients statement in order by
weight, from the greatest amount to the least.

Substances such as spices and spice extractives may be declared as "natural flavors," "flavors,"
or "natural flavoring" on meat and poultry labels without naming each one. This is because they
are used primarily for their flavor contribution and not their nutritional contribution.

Substances such as dried meat, poultry stock, meat extracts, or hydrolyzed protein must be
listed on the label by their common or usual name because their primary purpose is not flavor.
They may be used as flavor enhancers, binders, or emulsifiers. They must be labeled using the

317 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
species of origin of the additive, for example, dried beef, chicken stock, pork extract, or
hydrolyzed wheat protein.

Color additives must be declared by their common or usual names on labels (for example, FD&C
Yellow 5 or annatto extract), not collectively as colorings. These labeling requirements help
consumers make choices about the foods they eat. 11

Artificial Sweeteners

Artificial sweeteners, also called sugar substitutes, are substances that are used instead of
sucrose (table sugar) to sweeten foods and beverages. Because artificial sweeteners are many
times sweeter than table sugar, much smaller amounts (200 to 20,000 times less) are needed to
create the same level of sweetness.

                                          Figure 12.3 - Common artificial sweeteners.12

Artificial sweeteners are regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Approved
artificial sweeteners include:

     Aspartame, distributed under several trade names (e.g., NutraSweet and Equal),
     Sucralose, marketed under the trade name Splenda
     Acesulfame potassium (also known as ACK, Sweet One, and Sunett)
     Neotame, which is similar to aspartame
     Advantame, which is also similar to aspartame

Questions about artificial sweeteners and cancer arose when early studies showed that
cyclamate in combination with saccharin caused bladder cancer in laboratory animals.
However, results from subsequent carcinogenicity studies (studies that examine whether a
substance can cause cancer) of these sweeteners have not provided clear evidence of an
association with cancer in humans. Similarly, studies of other FDA-approved sweeteners have
not demonstrated clear evidence of an association with cancer in humans.13

The Challenge of Choosing Foods

There are other factors besides environment and lifestyle that influence the foods you choose
to eat. Different foods affect energy level, mood, how much is eaten, how long before you eat
again, and if cravings are satisfied. We have talked about some of the physical effects of food
on your body, but there are other effects too.

Food regulates your appetite and how you feel. Multiple studies have demonstrated that some
high fiber foods and high-protein foods decrease appetite by slowing the digestive process and
prolonging the feeling of being full or satiety. The effects of individual foods and nutrients on
mood are not backed by consistent scientific evidence, but in general, most studies support
that healthier diets are associated with a decrease in depression and improved well-being. To
date, science has not been able to track the exact path in the brain that occurs in response to
eating a particular food, but it is quite clear that foods, in general, stimulate emotional
responses in people.

Food also has psychological, cultural, and religious significance, so your personal choices of
food affect your mind, as well as your body. The social implications of food have a great deal to
do with what people eat, as well as how and when. Special events in individual lives--from
birthdays to funerals--are commemorated with equally special foods. Being aware of these
forces can help people make healthier food choices--and still honor the traditions and ties they
hold dear.

Typically, eating kosher food means a person is Jewish; eating fish on Fridays during Lent means
a person is Catholic; fasting during the ninth month of the Islamic calendar means a person is
Muslim. On New Year's Day, Japanese take part in an annual tradition of Mochitsuki also known
as Mochi pounding in hopes of gaining good fortune over the coming year. Several hundred
miles away in Hawai`i, people eat poi made from pounded taro root with great significance in
the Hawaiian culture, as it represents Hloa, the ancestor of chiefs and kanaka maoli (Native
Hawaiians). National food traditions are carried to other countries when people immigrate.

Factors that Drive Food Choices

Along with these influences, a number of other factors affect the dietary choices individuals
make, including:

     Taste, texture, and appearance. Individuals have a wide range of tastes which influence
         their food choices, leading some to dislike milk and others to hate raw vegetables. Some
         foods that are very healthy, such as tofu, may be unappealing at first to many people.
         However, creative cooks can adapt healthy foods to meet most people's taste.

     Economics. Access to fresh fruits and vegetables may be scant, particularly for those
         who live in economically disadvantaged or remote areas, where cheaper food options
         are limited to convenience stores and fast food.

319 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Early food experiences. People who were not exposed to different foods as children, or
         who were forced to swallow every last bite of overcooked vegetables, may make limited
         food choices as adults.

     Habits. It's common to establish eating routines, which can work both for and against
         optimal health. Habitually grabbing a fast food sandwich for breakfast can seem
         convenient, but might not offer substantial nutrition. Yet getting in the habit of drinking
         an ample amount of water each day can yield multiple benefits.

     Culture. The culture in which one grows up affects how one sees food in daily life and on
         special occasions.

     Geography. Where a person lives influences food choices. For instance, people who live
         in Midwestern US states have less access to seafood than those living along the coasts.

     Advertising. The media greatly influences food choice by persuading consumers to eat
         certain foods.

     Social factors. Any school lunchroom observer can testify to the impact of peer pressure
         on eating habits, and this influence lasts through adulthood. People make food choices
         based on how they see others and want others to see them. For example, individuals
         who are surrounded by others who consume fast food are more likely to do the same.

     Health concerns. Some people have significant food allergies, to peanuts for example,
         and need to avoid those foods. Others may have developed health issues which require
         them to follow a low salt diet. In addition, people who have never worried about their
         weight have a very different approach to eating than those who have long struggled
         with excess weight.

     Emotions. There is a wide range in how emotional issues affect eating habits. When
         faced with a great deal of stress, some people tend to overeat, while others find it hard
         to eat at all.

     Green food/Sustainability choices. Based on a growing understanding of diet as a public
         and personal issue, more and more people are starting to make food choices based on
         their environmental impact. Realizing that their food choices help shape the world,
         many individuals are opting for a vegetarian diet, or, if they do eat animal products,
         striving to find the most "cruelty-free" options possible. Purchasing local and organic
         food products and items grown through sustainable products also help shrink the size of
         one's dietary footprint.14

                Pause to Reflect

                   Think of your last meal or snack. What are some of the factors listed above
                   that led you to choose to eat what you did?

                   Vegetarian Diet

                       People choose a vegetarian diet for various reasons, including religious
                       doctrines, health concerns, ecological and animal welfare concerns, or
                       simply because they dislike the taste of meat. There are different types
                       of vegetarians, but a common theme is that vegetarians do not eat
                       meat. Four common forms of vegetarianism are:

                           1. Lacto-ovo vegetarian. This is the most common form. This type
                                of vegetarian diet includes the animal foods eggs and dairy
                                products.

                           2. Lacto-vegetarian. This type of vegetarian diet includes dairy
                                products but not eggs.

                           3. Ovo-vegetarian. This type of vegetarian diet includes eggs but
                                not dairy products.

                           4. Vegan. This type of vegetarian diet does not include dairy, eggs,
                                or any type of animal product or animal by-product. 15

                       Preparing vegetarian meals will be addressed further in Chapter 15.

Achieving a Healthy Diet

Achieving a healthy diet is a matter of balancing the quality and quantity of food that is eaten.
There are five key factors that make up a healthful diet:

    1. A diet must be adequate, by providing sufficient amounts of each essential nutrient, as
         well as fiber and adequate calories.

    2. A balanced diet results when you do not consume one nutrient at the expense of
         another, but rather get appropriate amounts of all nutrients.

    3. Calorie control is necessary so that the amount of energy you get from the nutrients you
         consume equals the amount of energy you expend during your day's activities.

    4. Moderation means not eating to the extremes, neither too much nor too little.
    5. Variety refers to consuming different foods from within each of the food groups on a

         regular basis.

A healthy diet is one that favors whole foods. As an alternative to modern processed foods, a
healthy diet focuses on "real" fresh whole foods that have been sustaining people for
generations. Whole foods supply the needed vitamins, minerals, protein, carbohydrates, fats,
and fiber that are essential to good health. Commercially prepared and fast foods are often
lacking nutrients and often contain inordinate amounts of sugar, salt, saturated and trans fats,
all of which are associated with the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, heart
disease, stroke, cancer, obesity, diabetes, and other illnesses. A balanced diet is a mix of food
from the different food groups (vegetables, legumes, fruits, grains, protein foods, and dairy).

                           Figure 12.4 - Whole foods from all food groups make a balanced diet.16

Adequacy

An adequate diet is one that favors nutrient-dense foods. Nutrient-dense foods are defined as
foods that contain many essential nutrients per calorie. Nutrient-dense foods are the opposite
of "empty-calorie" foods, such as sugary carbonated beverages, which are also called "nutrient-
poor." Nutrient-dense foods include fruits and vegetables, lean meats, poultry, fish, low-fat
dairy products, and whole grains. Choosing more nutrient-dense foods will facilitate weight
loss, while simultaneously providing all necessary nutrients.

Balance

Balance the foods in your diet. Achieving balance in your diet entails not consuming one
nutrient at the expense of another. For example, calcium is essential for healthy teeth and
bones, but too much calcium will interfere with iron absorption. Most foods that are good
sources of iron are poor sources of calcium, so in order to get the necessary amounts of calcium
and iron from your diet, a proper balance between food choices is critical. Another example is
that while sodium is an essential nutrient, excessive intake may contribute to congestive heart
failure and chronic kidney disease in some people. Remember, everything must be consumed in
the proper amounts.

Moderation

Eat in moderation. Moderation is crucial for optimal health and survival. Eating nutrient-poor
foods each night for dinner will lead to health complications. But as part of an otherwise
healthful diet and consumed only on a weekly basis, this should not significantly impact overall
health. It's important to remember that eating is, in part, about enjoyment and indulging with a
spirit of moderation. This fits within a healthy diet.

Monitor food portions. For optimum weight maintenance, it is important to ensure that energy
consumed from foods meets the energy expenditures required for body functions and activity.
If not, the excess energy contributes to gradual, steady accumulation of stored body fat and
weight gain. In order to lose body fat, you need to ensure that more calories are burned than
consumed. Likewise, in order to gain weight, calories must be eaten in excess of what is
expended daily.

Variety

Variety involves eating different foods from all the food groups. Eating a varied diet helps to
ensure that you consume and absorb adequate amounts of all essential nutrients required for
health. One of the major drawbacks of a monotonous diet is the risk of consuming too much of
some nutrients and not enough of others. Trying new foods can also be a source of pleasure--
you never know what foods you might like until you try them.

Developing a healthful diet can be rewarding, but be mindful that all of the principles presented
must be followed to derive maximal health benefits. For instance, introducing variety in your
diet can still result in the consumption of too many high-calorie, nutrient poor foods and
inadequate nutrient intake if you do not also employ moderation and calorie control. Using all
of these principles together will promote lasting health benefits.17

                Pause to Reflect

                  Think back to your childhood, how do you think your diet did with regards to
                  adequacy, balance, moderation, and variety? What about your diet now?

Nutrition in Early Care and Education Programs

There are many different programs that can support early care and education programs in
providing nutritious meals and snacks for children. Let's explore a few of these.

Child and Adult Care Food Program

The Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP) is a federal program that provides
reimbursements for nutritious meals and snacks to eligible children and adults who are enrolled
for care at participating child care centers, day care homes, and adult day care centers. Eligible
public or private nonprofit child care centers, outside-school-hours care centers, Head Start
programs, and other institutions which are licensed or approved to provide day care services
may participate in CACFP, independently or as sponsored centers.18 Over 2 billion meals are
served in the CACFP.19

Even if a program chooses not to participate in (or is ineligible for) the CACFP, they are required
by licensing to its meal plan requirements. 20 (See Tables 12.4 and 12.5) The CACFP nutrition
standards for meals and snacks served in the CACFP are based on the Dietary Guidelines for
Americans, science-based recommendations made by the National Academy of Medicine, cost
and practical considerations, and stakeholder's input. Under these standards, meals and snacks
served include a greater variety of vegetables and fruit, more whole grains, and less added
sugar and saturated fat.21 (See Table 12.6)

Dietary Guidelines for Americans

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans provides evidence-based nutrition information and advice
for people ages two and older to help Americans make healthy choices about food and
beverages in their daily lives. The Guidelines also serve as the basis for federal food and
nutrition education programs, like the MyPlate campaign.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans, produced by HHS and the U.S. Department of Agriculture
every five years, analyze the latest research to help Americans make smart choices about food
and physical activity so they can live healthier lives.

The 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans focuses on making small shifts in your daily
eating habits to improve your health over the long run. They also emphasize the importance of
"eating patterns," which refer to the combination of ALL foods and beverages a person
consumes regularly over time, rather than focusing on individual nutrients or foods in isolation.
Healthy eating patterns, along with regular physical activity, have been shown in a large body of
current science to help people reach and maintain good health while reducing risks of chronic
disease throughout their lives. Additionally, healthy eating patterns can be adapted to an
individual's budget, taste preferences, traditions, and culture.

The core recommendations for these healthy eating patterns are unchanged from previous
editions of the Guidelines, and continue to encourage Americans to consume more healthy
foods like vegetables, fruits, whole grains, fat-free and low-fat dairy products, lean meats,
seafood, other protein foods, and oils. They also recommend limiting sodium, saturated and
trans fats, and added sugars.

There are five overarching guidelines in this eighth edition:
     Follow a healthy eating pattern across the lifespan. Eating patterns are the combination
         of foods and drinks that a person eats over time.
     A variety of vegetables: dark green, red and orange, legumes (beans and peas), starchy
         and other vegetables.
             o Fruits, especially whole fruit.
             o Grains, at least half of which are whole grain.

                  beverages.

             o A variety of protein foods, including seafood, lean meats and poultry, eggs,

             o Oils, including those from plants: canola, corn, olive, peanut, safflower, soybean,
                  and sunflower. Oils also are naturally present in nuts, seeds, seafood, olives, and
                  avocados.

     Focus on variety, nutrient-dense foods, and amount.
     Limit calories from added sugars and saturated fats, and reduce sodium intake.
     Children younger than 14 should consume less than 2.300 mg of sodium per day.
     Less than 10% of daily calories should come from saturated fats.
     Less than 10% of daily calories should come from added sugars
     Shift to healthier food and beverage choices.
     Support healthy eating patterns for all.27

Physical Guidelines for Americans

The second edition of the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans issued by the Department
of Health and Human Services provides science-based guidance to help people ages 3 years and
older improve their health through participation in regular physical activity. Key guidelines
include:

Preschool-Aged Children

Preschool-aged children (ages 3 through 5 years) should be physically active throughout the day
to enhance growth and development. Adult caregivers of preschool-aged children should
encourage active play that includes a variety of activity types.

Children and Adolescents

It is important to provide young people opportunities and encouragement to participate in
physical activities that are appropriate for their age, that are enjoyable, and that offer variety.
Children and adolescents ages 6 through 17 years should do 60 minutes (1 hour) or more of
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity daily that includes activity that is aerobic, muscle-
strengthening, and bone-strengthening.28

Physical activity will be addressed further in Chapter 13.

MyPlate

MyPlate is the United States Department of Agriculture's food guidance program to help
Americans eat healthy and is based on the Dietary Guidelines for America. It replaces
MyPyramid (which had replaced the classic Food Guide Pyramid).

The visual for MyPlate is a familiar mealtime symbol, the plate. It gives easy visual reference to
remind people to create balanced meals. The main messages of MyPlate include:

     Make half the plate fruits and vegetables
             o Focus on whole fruits.
             o Vary your veggies.

     Make half the grains whole grains.

Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)

Issued by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, National Academy of
Sciences, the DRI is the general term for a set of reference values used to plan and assess
nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:

     Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): average daily level of intake sufficient to meet
         the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97%-98%) healthy people.

     Adequate Intake (AI): established when evidence is insufficient to develop an RDA and is
         set at a level assumed to ensure nutritional adequacy.

     Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): maximum daily intake unlikely to cause adverse
         health effects.31

That information is used to create nutrition fact labels.

Nutrition Facts Labels

The information in the main or top section (see #1-4) of the sample nutrition label (below) can
vary with each food and beverage product; it contains product-specific information (serving
size, calories, and nutrient information). The bottom section contains a footnote that explains
the % Daily Value and gives the number of calories used for general nutrition advice.

In the following Nutrition Facts label certain sections have been colored to help focus on those
areas that will be explained in detail. Note that these colored sections are not on the actual
food labels of products you purchase.

                                   12.6 - A color-coded example nutrition label for lasagna.32

1. Serving Information

When looking at the Nutrition Facts label, first take a look at the number of servings in the
package (servings per container) and the serving size. Serving sizes are standardized to make it
easier to compare similar foods; they are provided in familiar units, such as cups or pieces,
followed by the metric amount, e.g., the number of grams (g). The serving size reflects the
amount that people typically eat or drink. It is not a recommendation of how much you should
eat or drink.

                    12.7 - The serving information portion of the example nutrition label for lasagna.33

330 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
It's important to realize that all the nutrient amounts shown on the label, including the number
of calories, refer to the size of the serving. Pay attention to the serving size, especially how
many servings there are in the food package. For example, you might ask yourself if you are
consuming  serving, 1 serving, or more.

2. Calories

Calories provide a measure of how much energy you get from a serving of this food.

                    12.8 - The calories per serving portion of the example nutrition label for lasagna.34

In the example, there are 280 calories in one serving of lasagna. What if you ate the entire
package? Then, you would consume 4 servings, or 1,120 calories.

3. Nutrients

                   12.9 - The portion of the example nutrition label for lasagna that details nutrients.35

Look at section 3 in the sample label (shown in Table 12.9). It shows you some key nutrients
that impact your health. Two key facts about the nutrients:

     Nutrients to get less of: Saturated Fat, Sodium, and Added Sugars.
     Nutrients to get more of: Dietary Fiber, Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, and Potassium.

4. The Percent Daily Value (%DV)

The % Daily Value (%DV) is the percentage of the Daily Value for each nutrient in a serving of
the food. The Daily Values are reference amounts (expressed in grams, milligrams, or
micrograms) of nutrients to consume or not to exceed each day.

       12.10 - The portion of the example nutrition label that details the percent daily value of the nutrients.36

The %DV shows how much a nutrient in a serving of a food contributes to a total daily diet for
adults. The %DV helps you determine if a serving of food is high or low in a nutrient.37

                Pause to Reflect

                  Find a food that is marketed to young children (that has a food label). Looking
                  at the label, how do you think it rates a healthy choice? Why?

Child Nutrition Programs for Schools

The federal government provides federal assistance to schools to provide nutritious meals to
children. With the exception of the Special Milk Program, early care and education programs
will not qualify for these programs. But they are included in this chapter as they are important
sources of nutrition for many children in the U.S., for reference for those that may work within
the school system, and they may provide resources that early care and education programs
may find useful when planning healthy meals and snacks and purchasing foods.

National School Lunch Program

The National School Lunch Program (NSLP) is a federally assisted meal program operating in
public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions. It provides

nutritionally balanced, low-cost or no-cost lunches to children each school day. The program
was established under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, signed into law by
President Harry Truman in 1946. 30.4 million children participated in the program in 2016.38

                                   Figure 12.11 - Children eating lunch together at school.39

School Breakfast Program

The School Breakfast Program (SBP) is a federally assisted meal program operating in public and
non-profit private schools and residential child care institutions. The SBP started in 1966 as a
pilot project, and was made a permanent entitlement program by Congress in 1975.
Participation in the SBP has slowly but steadily grown over the years and in 2016, 14.57 million
children participated in the program.40

Special Milk Program

The Special Milk Program provides milk to children in schools, child care program and eligible
camps that do not participate in other federal child nutrition meal service programs. The
program reimburses schools and institutions for the milk they serve. In 2011, 3,848 schools and
residential child care institutions participated, along with 782 summer camps and 527 non-
residential child care institutions. Schools in the National School Lunch or School Breakfast
Programs may also participate in the Special Milk Program to provide milk to children in half-
day pre-kindergarten and kindergarten programs where children do not have access to the
school meal programs.41

Summer Food Service Program

The Summer Food Service Program (SFSP) provides free meals and snacks when school is not in
session. The seasonal nature of SFSP, and the diversity of sponsors and site operators, make it
unique. State agencies, sponsors, and community organizations need flexibility to operate the

SFSP in a manner that is responsive to local conditions and allows operators to focus on
ensuring children in need can access food when school is not in session. In the summer of 2018
over 145 million meals were served to over 2.6 million children.42

Assessing Quality of Meal and Snack Times

Just like with safety and health (and many other things), early care and education programs
should assess how well they are meeting children's nutritional needs with the meals and snacks
they are providing for children. An assessment, such as one in Appendix N can be used to help
programs do this. You will notice that providing a positive eating environment takes more than
just giving children healthy food. Chapter 14 will look more at this by age.

               Figure 12.12 - This teacher is eating with the children and creating a positive meal time.43

Summary

Providing nutritious meals and snacks to children in early care and education programs requires
a basic understanding of nutrition. Program staff should also have an understanding of what a
complete and healthy diet includes and how to address factors that influence food choices, to
ensure that they provide healthy food and beverages that children will enjoy eating. Being
aware of the programs available to support doing so is also valuable. Children that have high-
quality meal and snack times will have the fuel their bodies need to sustain optimal growth and
development.

Introduction

Healthy active living includes eating healthy foods, staying physically active, and getting enough
rest. Developing healthy habits starts in early childhood. Eating well and being physically active
helps a child continue to grow and learn.1

Healthy Active Living

Research tells us that the way young children eat, move, and sleep can impact their weight now
and in the future. Early childhood is an ideal time to start healthy habits before unhealthy
patterns are set.2

Many children in the United States do not follow the recommendations of the Dietary
Guidelines for Americans. According to the CDC, on average, children consume too much fat,
saturated fat, and sodium and not enough fruits, vegetables, or calcium. Children obtain 33%-
35% of their calories from fat and 12%-13% from saturated fat (above the recommended levels
of 30% and 10%, respectively). Only 16% of children ages 6-11 years meet the recommendation
for total fat intake; only 9% of children meet the recommendation for saturated fat intake.3

Young children depend on parents, caregivers, and others to provide environments that foster
and shape healthy habits. Early care and education programs have a responsibility to promote
growth and development, make healthy foods available, and provide safe spaces for active
play. Staff can help children and families by encouraging and modeling healthy eating and
physical activity at the center and by providing suggestions for small, healthy steps at home.4

5-2-1-0 Message

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that pediatricians counsel parents and
patients at every well-child check on diet and lifestyle goals as a part of obesity prevention
initiatives (Hassink, 2010). These recommendations, initially put forth by the Maine Youth
Overweight Collaborative obesity prevention program "Let's Go! 5-2-1-0", have been promoted
locally and nationally for broad consumption (Rogers and Motyka, 2009).5

                 5 Fruits and Vegetables a Day
                      Go for the rainbow. Each month, pick a color from the rainbow and try to
                          eat a new fruit or veggie of that color (green, purple, orange, yellow,
                          red). It's a great way for little ones to learn colors while you're all eating
                          healthy.
                      Whenever possible, let your child help get fruits and veggies ready to
                          serve. Maybe he can wash an apple or mix the salad. Your little chef may
                          be more likely to try foods that he helps to prepare.
                      Ever feel like fresh fruits and veggies are just too expensive? Try using
                          frozen ones for a few meals every week.

                 2 Hours or Less of Screen Time a Day
                      A great way to cut down on screen time is to make a "no television (or
                          computer) while eating" rule.
                      If your children are watching TV, watch with them. Use commercial
                          breaks for an activity break--hula hoop, dance, or come up with a crazy
                          new way to do jumping jacks.
                      If you need a break and want to let your child watch TV, set a timer for
                          30 minutes. You can get a lot done and you'll know how long they
                          watched.
                      Television in your child's bedroom might seem like a convenience but
                          watching TV close to bedtime can affect your child's ability to sleep.

                 1 Hour of Active Play or Physical Activity a Day
                      An hour of active play might seem like a lot but you don't have to do it all
                          at one time. Try being active for 10-15 minutes several times each day.
                      What were your favorite active games when you were a child? They
                          might seem old school to you but they'll be new to your child. Try one
                          today.
                      Rain or bad weather has you stuck in the house? Don't let it keep you and
                          your child from being active together. Try one of these fun activities:
                              o Have an indoor parade.
                              o Set up a scavenger hunt inside.
                              o Start your own indoor Olympics--who can jump on one foot the
                                   longest or do the most sit ups?

                 0 Sugary Drinks a Day
                      Serve milk with meals and offer water at snack time.
                      Let your child pick their favorite "big kid" cup to use for water.
                      Think plain water is too boring? Try adding a fruit slice (like orange) for
                          natural flavor.
                      Avoid buying juice--if it's not in the house, no one can drink it.
                      If you're still trying to cut sugary drinks down to zero, keep up the great
                          work! Young children should never have soda pop or sports drinks but if
                          you choose to give juice, please remember:
                              o make sure the label says 100 percent fruit juice.
                              o limit the amount to one small cup a day (4-6 ounces if you
                                   measure it out).7

Physical Activity

Good activity habits begin early in children's lives. As early as infancy, adults can help children
grow lifelong healthy play habits. Children learn from adults, they should model being active
and participate with children when possible.

Infants should spend a lot of time on the floor (and out of equipment that limits mobility). This
time allows them to reach, and kick so they can reach important milestones like crawling and
sitting up.

Even very active toddlers need environments that support movement and activity and
intentional opportunities to be physically active. Things like dancing, jumping, and taking walks
are great ways to keep them moving.8
Childhood and adolescence are critical periods for developing movement skills, learning healthy
habits, and establishing a firm foundation for lifelong health and well-being. Regular physical
activity in children and adolescents promotes health and fitness. Compared to those who are
inactive, physically active youth have higher levels of cardiorespiratory fitness and stronger
muscles. They also typically have lower body fat and stronger bones. Physical activity also has
brain health benefits for school-aged children, including improved cognition and reduced
symptoms of depression. Evidence indicates that both acute bouts and regular moderate-to-
vigorous physical activity improve the cognitive functions of memory, executive function,
processing speed, attention, and academic performance for these children.

Youth who are regularly active also have a better chance of a healthy adulthood. Children and
adolescents do not usually develop chronic diseases, such as heart disease, hypertension, type
2 diabetes, or osteoporosis. However, current evidence shows that obesity and other risk
factors for these diseases, such as elevated insulin, blood lipids, and blood pressure, are
increasingly appearing in children and adolescents. Exercise training in youth with overweight
or obesity can improve body composition by reducing overall levels of body fat as well as
abdominal fat. Regular physical activity also makes it less likely that these risk factors will
develop and more likely that children remain healthy when they become adults.

                              Figure 13.2 - Regular physical activity protects children's health. 9

Preschool-aged children (ages 3 through 5 years) should be encouraged to move and engage in
active play as well as in structured activities, such as throwing games and bicycle or tricycle
riding. To strengthen bones, young children should do activities that involve hopping, skipping,
jumping, and tumbling. Although the specific amount of activity needed to improve bone health
and avoid excess fat in young children is not well defined, a reasonable target may be 3 hours

per day of activity of all intensities: light, moderate, or vigorous intensity. This is the average
amount of activity observed among children of this age and is consistent with guidelines from
Canada, the United Kingdom, and the Commonwealth of Australia.

School-aged youth (ages 6 through 17 years) can achieve substantial health benefits by doing
moderate and vigorous-intensity physical activity for periods of time that add up to 60 minutes
or more each day. This activity should include aerobic activity as well as age-appropriate
muscle- and bone-strengthening activities. It appears that, as in adults, the total amount of
physical activity is more important for achieving health benefits than is any one component
(frequency, intensity, or duration) or specific mix of activities (aerobic, muscle strengthening,
bone strengthening).

Children and adolescents should meet the key guidelines by doing activities that are
appropriate for their age. Their natural patterns of movement differ from those of adults. For
example, children are naturally active in an intermittent way, particularly when they do
unstructured active play. During recess and in their free play and games, children use basic
aerobic and bone-strengthening activities, such as running, hopping, skipping, and jumping, to
develop movement patterns and skills. They alternate brief periods of moderate- and vigorous
intensity activity with periods of light-intensity physical activity or rest. Any episode of
moderate- or vigorous intensity physical activity, however brief, counts toward the key
guidelines for children and adolescents ages 6 through 17 years. For preschool-aged children,
activity of any intensity counts, including light intensity.10

                        Figure 13.3 - There are many ways to support children's physical activity. 12

One practical strategy to promote activity in children is to replace sedentary behavior with
activity whenever possible. For example, where appropriate and safe, families should walk or
bicycle to school or the bus stop instead of riding in a car. Rather than only watching sporting
events on television, children should participate in age-appropriate sports or games.

     Children who do not meet the key guidelines should slowly increase their moderate-to-
         vigorous physical activity in small steps and in ways that they enjoy. A gradual increase
         in the number of days and the time spent being active will help reduce the risk of injury.

     Children who meet the key guidelines should continue doing moderate-to-vigorous
         physical activity every day and, if appropriate, become even more active. Evidence
         suggests that even more than 60 minutes of activity daily may provide additional health
         benefits for school-aged youth.

     Children who exceed the key guidelines should maintain their activity level and vary the
         kinds of activities they do to reduce the risk of overtraining or injury.

Children with disabilities are more likely to be inactive than those without disabilities. Families
of children with disabilities should work with a health care professional or physical activity
specialist to understand the types and amounts of physical activity appropriate for them. When
possible, children with disabilities should meet the key guidelines. When they are not able to
participate in the appropriate types or amounts of physical activities needed to meet the key
guidelines, they should be as active as possible and avoid being inactive.

              Engaging Families in Their Children's Physical Activity

                 Share the recommendations with families with these tips.

                 Children under 6 need to be active naturally!
                      Aim to keep them moving 3 hours a day -- and more is better
                      Limit time when they're just sitting around (like screen time)

                 Kids and teens ages 6 to 17 need at least 60 minutes every day. Most of it can be
                 moderate-intensity aerobic activity. Anything that gets their heart beating faster
                 counts. At least three days a week, encourage your kids to step it up to vigorous-
                 intensity aerobic activity.
                 Use the "talk test" to find out if activity is moderate or vigorous. When you're
                 being active, try talking:

                      If you're breathing hard but can still have a conversation easily, it's
                          moderate-intensity activity.

                      If you can only say a few words before you have to take a breath, it's
                          vigorous-intensity activity

                 As part of their daily 60 minutes, kids and teens also need:
                      Muscle-strengthening activity At least 3 days a week; anything that
                          makes their muscles work harder counts -- like climbing or swinging on
                          the monkey bars.
                      Bone-strengthening activity At least 3 days a week; bones need pressure
                          to get stronger. Running, jumping, and other weight-bearing activities all
                          count.

                 Some ideas:
                      Encourage active play with friends
                      Get them involved in active chores
                      Sign them up for free or low-cost sports or classes
                      Take walks
                      Dance while dinner's cooking
                      Show them your favorite ways to move.

                 Most of all, help them find activities they really like to do! Help them get active
                 now, and they'll build healthy habits for life.

Nutrition Education

Lifelong eating habits are shaped during a child's early years. Teachers of young children have a
special opportunity to help children establish a healthy relationship with food and lay the
foundation for sound eating habits. Nutrition education and activities help set children on the
path to a healthful lifestyle. Providing nutritionally balanced meals and snacks and integrating
nutrition education and healthy eating habits in the home and early childhood.

Nutrition education for preschoolers fosters children's awareness of different types of foods
and promotes exploration and inquiry of food choices. Lifelong habits with foods are developed
during early childhood. Through nutrition education in preschool, teachers encourage children
to include a wide variety of foods that provide adequate nutrients in their daily diet.

Through knowledge, children become aware of different foods and tastes, some of which are
familiar and others that are new. As they explore various foods and food preparations, they
develop likes and dislikes and begin to make choices based on preference. Both nutrition
choices and self-regulation of eating--that is, eating when hungry, chewing food thoroughly,
eating slowly, and stopping when full-- involve decision-making skills.

As children begin to understand the concepts of food identification and categorizing, teachers
may describe how specific foods help our bodies. Children may better understand the overall
benefit of food in terms of it helping them grow, giving them energy to run and play, and
helping them to become strong. As children begin to understand internal body parts, teachers
can initiate discussion of more specific food benefits.

Children need to understand that various foods help the body in different ways and that some
children have specific food allergies.

For those with allergies, certain foods are potentially harmful to them. Teachers should
encourage tasting and eating a variety of foods to obtain adequate nutrients for growth and
development. "Variety" may mean foods of different color, shape, texture, and taste.
As children gain an understanding of different foods, they can begin to categorize foods in
other ways, such as by food groups (e.g., bread, fruits, meat) or the U.S. Department of
Agriculture (USDA) MyPlate food guide for young children. MyPlate reflects the 2010 Dietary
Guidelines and replaces the MyPyramid for Preschoolers. Every food is all right, but some foods
help the body more than others; therefore, people may eat some foods more often than
others. Food models, combined with visual aids such as the Food Pyramid49 and integration of
the topic with daily nutrition activities (e.g., mealtime, snack time, cooking activities), can help
children begin to understand that some foods are eaten more frequently than others.

Here are some things that teachers can do to help educate children about nutrition:
     Introduce many different foods.
     Recognize and accommodate differences in eating habits and food choices.
     Provide opportunities and encouragement in food exploration.

345 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Integrate nutrition with other areas of learning through cooking activities.
     Show children where food is produced.
     Set up special areas to represent nutrition-related environments, such as grocery stores,

         restaurants, open-air markets, food co-ops, and picnics.
     Integrate nutrition education with basic hygiene education.
     Model and coach children's behavior by eating from the same menu and encouraging

         conversations during mealtimes.
     Encourage children to share information about family meals.
     Serve meals and snacks family-style.
     Encourage tasting and decision making.
     Provide choices for children.
     Offer a variety of nutritious, appetizing foods in small portions.
     Encourage children to chew their food well and eat slowly.
     Teach children to recognize signs of hunger.
     Discuss how the body uses food.
Children learn about food and develop food preferences through their direct experiences with
food (i.e., handling, preparing, eating) and by observing the eating behaviors of adults and
peers. The goal in preschool is that children will learn to eat a variety of nutritious foods and
begin to recognize the body's physical need for food (i.e., hunger and fullness).

                        Figure 13.4 - Serving meals family-style supports children's self-regulation.14

Through modeling, repeated and various exposures to food, and social experiences, children
begin to develop eating behaviors that can prevail throughout life.15

                  Reflect on how you will support children's nutrition education. What will be
                  most natural/easiest for you to do from this section? What might you have to
                  be more intentional about (what might be more challenging or less natural)?

Understanding Malnutrition

When children do not receive proper nutrition it affects their physical health and wellness. For
many, the word "malnutrition" produces an image of a child in a third-world country with a
bloated belly, and skinny arms and legs. However, this image alone is not an accurate
representation of the state of malnutrition. For example, someone who is 150 pounds
overweight can also be malnourished.

Malnutrition refers to one not receiving proper nutrition and does not distinguish between the
consequences of too many nutrients or the lack of nutrients, both of which impair overall
health. Undernutrition is characterized by a lack of nutrients and insufficient energy supply,
whereas overnutrition is characterized by excessive nutrient and energy intake. Overnutrition
can result in obesity, a growing global health threat.16

And if the cause of overnutrition is a diet that features food that is not nutrient-dense, a child
could experience both overnutrition (too many calories) and undernutrition (inadequate
micronutrients).

Undernutrition

Although not as prevalent in America as it is in developing countries, undernutrition is not
uncommon and affects many subpopulations, including the elderly, those with certain diseases,
and those in poverty.17 Undernutrition is most often due to not enough high-quality food being
available to eat. This is often related to high food prices and poverty. There are two main types
of undernutrition: protein-energy malnutrition and dietary deficiencies. Protein-energy
malnutrition has two severe forms: marasmus (a lack of protein and calories)
and kwashiorkor (a lack of just protein). Common micronutrient deficiencies include a lack
of iron, iodine, and vitamin A.

Undernutrition encompasses stunted growth (stunting), wasting, and deficiencies of essential
vitamins and minerals (collectively referred to as micronutrients).18 Even moderate
undernutrition can have lasting effects on children's cognitive development. When children are
hungry or undernourished, they have difficulty resisting infection and therefore are more likely

than other children to become sick and to miss school. They are irritable and have difficulty
concentrating, which can interfere with learning; and they have low energy, which can limit
their physical activity. Some reports have estimated that millions of children in the United
States experience hunger over the course of a year but no scientific consensus currently exists
on how to define or measure hunger.19 The term hunger, which describes a feeling of
discomfort from not eating, has been used to describe undernutrition, especially in reference to
food insecurity. 20

Food Insecurity

Food insecurity is defined as the disruption of food intake or eating patterns because of a lack
of money and other resources. In 2014, 17.4 million U.S. households were food insecure at
some time during the year. Food insecurity does not necessarily cause hunger, but hunger is a
possible outcome of food insecurity.

              Figure 13.5 -Resources such as food banks, can help families experiencing food insecurity.21

The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) divides food insecurity into the following 2
categories:

     Low food security: "Reports of reduced quality, variety, or desirability of diet. Little or
         no indication of reduced food intake."

     Very low food security: "Reports of multiple indications of disrupted eating patterns
         and reduced food intake."

Food insecurity may be long term or temporary. It may be influenced by a number of factors
including income, employment, race/ethnicity, and disability. The risk for food insecurity
increases when money to buy food is limited or not available. In 2016, 31.6% of low-income
households were food insecure, compared to the national average of 12.3%. children with
unemployed parents have higher rates of food insecurity than children with employed
parents. Racial and ethnic disparities exist related to food insecurity. In 2016, black non-

Hispanic households were nearly 2 times more likely to be food insecure than the national
average (22.5% versus 12.3%, respectively). Among Hispanic households, the prevalence of
food insecurity was 18.5% compared to the national average (12.3%).

Neighborhood conditions may affect physical access to food. For example, people living in some
urban areas, rural areas, and low-income neighborhoods may have limited access to full-service
supermarkets or grocery stores. Predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods have fewer
full-service supermarkets than predominantly white and non-Hispanic
neighborhoods. Communities that lack affordable and nutritious food are commonly known as
"food deserts." Convenience stores and small independent stores are more common in food
deserts than full-service supermarkets or grocery stores. These stores may have higher food
prices, lower quality foods, and less variety of foods than supermarkets or grocery
stores. Access to healthy foods is also affected by a lack of transportation and long distances
between residences and supermarkets or grocery stores.22

Overnutrition

Overnutrition is a form of malnutrition (imbalanced nutrition) arising from excessive intake of
nutrients, leading to an accumulation of body fat that impairs health (i.e.,
overweight/obesity).23 Overnutrition is an epidemic in the United States and is known to be a
risk factor for many diseases, including Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, inflammatory
disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis), and cancer.24

Overweight and Obesity in Childhood

Obesity means having too much body fat. It is different from being overweight, which means
weighing too much. Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered
healthy for his or her height. Children grow at different rates, so it isn't always easy to know
when a child has obesity or is overweight.25 Obesity is defined as a body mass index (BMI) at or
above the 95th percentile of the CDC sex-specific BMI-for-age growth charts (See Appendix
O).26

In the United States, the percentage of children and adolescents affected by obesity has more
than tripled since the 1970s.27 Obesity prevalence was 13.9% among 2- to 5-year-olds, 18.4%
among 6- to 11-year-olds. Childhood obesity is also more common among certain populations.

     Hispanics (25.8%) and non-Hispanic blacks (22.0%) had higher obesity prevalence than
         non-Hispanic whites (14.1%).

     Non-Hispanic Asians (11.0%) had lower obesity prevalence than non-Hispanic blacks and
         Hispanics.28

Many factors contribute to childhood obesity, including:
     Genetics.
     Metabolism--how your body changes food and oxygen into energy it can use.
     Eating and physical activity behaviors.
     Community and neighborhood design and safety.
     Short sleep duration.
     Negative childhood events.

Genetic factors cannot be changed. However, people and places can play a role in helping
children achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Changes in the environments where children
spend their time--like homes, early care and education programs, schools, and community
settings--can make it easier for children to access nutritious foods and be physically active.
Early care and education programs and schools can adopt policies and practices that help young
people eat more fruits and vegetables, eat fewer foods and beverages that are high in added
sugars or solid fats, and increase daily minutes of physical activity.29

Nutrition Concerns During Childhood

To keep children well, it's also important to be aware of common nutritional concerns during
childhood. Two of those concerns are food allergies and intolerances and iron deficiency
anemia.

Food Allergies and Food Intolerance

Food allergies impact four to six percent of young children in America. Common food allergens
include peanuts, eggs, shellfish, wheat, and cow's milk.30 Recent studies show that three million
children under age eighteen are allergic to at least one type of food.

An allergy occurs when a protein in food triggers an immune response, which results in the
release of antibodies, histamine, and other defenders that attack foreign bodies. Possible
symptoms include itchy skin, hives, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Symptoms
usually develop within minutes to hours after consuming a food allergen. Children can outgrow
a food allergy, especially allergies to wheat, milk, eggs, or soy.

                                    Figure 13.6 - Hives can be a sign of an allergic reaction31

Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening reaction that results in difficulty breathing, swelling in the
mouth and throat, decreased blood pressure, shock, or even death. Milk, eggs, wheat,
soybeans, fish, shellfish, peanuts, and tree nuts are the most likely to trigger this type of
response. A dose of the drug epinephrine is often administered via a "pen" to treat a person
who goes into anaphylactic shock.

Some children experience a food intolerance, which does not involve an immune response.
Food intolerance is marked by unpleasant symptoms that occur after consuming certain foods.
Lactose intolerance, though rare in very young children, is one example. Children who suffer
from this condition experience an adverse reaction to the lactose in milk products. It is a result
of the small intestine's inability to produce enough of the enzyme lactase, which is produced by
the small intestine. Symptoms of lactose intolerance usually affect the GI tract and can include
bloating, abdominal pain, gas, nausea, and diarrhea. An intolerance is best managed by making
dietary changes and avoiding any foods that trigger the reaction.32

Caring for Children with Food Allergies

Staff who work in schools and early care and education (ECE) programs should develop plans
for how they will respond effectively to children with food allergies. Although the number of
children with food allergies in any one school or ECE program may seem small, allergic reactions
can be life-threatening and have far-reaching effects on children and their families, as well as
on the schools or ECE programs they attend. Any child with a food allergy deserves attention
and the school or ECE program should create a plan for preventing an allergic reaction and
responding to a food allergy emergency.

Studies show that 16%-18% of children with food allergies have reacted to accidentally eating
food allergens while at school. In addition, 25% of the severe and potentially life-threatening

reactions (anaphylaxis) reported at schools happened in children with no previous diagnosis of
food allergy. School and ECE program staff should be ready to address the needs of children
with known food allergies. They also should be prepared to respond effectively to the
emergency needs of children who are not known to have food allergies but who exhibit allergic
signs and symptoms.

The symptoms of allergic reactions to food vary both in type and severity among individuals and
even in one individual over time. Symptoms associated with an allergic reaction to food include
the following:

     Mucous Membrane Symptoms: red watery eyes or swollen lips, tongue, or eyes.
     Skin Symptoms: itchiness, flushing, rash, or hives.
     Gastrointestinal Symptoms: nausea, pain, cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, or acid reflux.
     Upper Respiratory Symptoms: nasal congestion, sneezing, hoarse voice, trouble

         swallowing, dry staccato cough, or numbness around mouth.
     Lower Respiratory Symptoms: deep cough, wheezing, shortness of breath or difficulty

         breathing, or chest tightness.
     Cardiovascular Symptoms: pale or blue skin color, weak pulse, dizziness or fainting,

         confusion or shock, hypotension (decrease in blood pressure), or loss of consciousness.
     Mental or Emotional Symptoms: a sense of "impending doom," irritability, change in

         alertness, mood change, or confusion.

Children sometimes do not exhibit overt and visible symptoms after ingesting an allergen,
making early diagnosis difficult. Signs and symptoms can become evident within a few minutes
or up to 1-2 hours after ingestion of the allergen, and rarely, several hours after ingestion.
Children might communicate their symptoms in the following ways:

     It feels like something is poking my tongue.
     My tongue (or mouth) is tingling (or burning).
     My tongue (or mouth) itches.
     My tongue feels like there is hair on it.
     My mouth feels funny.
     There's a frog in my throat; there's something stuck in my throat.
     My tongue feels full (or heavy).
     My lips feel tight.
     It feels like there are bugs in there (to describe itchy ears).
     It (my throat) feels thick.
     It feels like a bump is on the back of my tongue (throat).

Some children may not be able to communicate their symptoms clearly because of their age or
developmental challenges.

Emotional Impact on Children with Food Allergies and Their Families

The health of a child with a food allergy can be compromised at any time by an allergic reaction
to food that is severe or life-threatening. Many studies have shown that food allergies have a

352 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
significant effect on the psychosocial well-being of children with food allergies and their
families.

Families of a child with a food allergy may have constant fear about the possibility of a life-
threatening reaction and stress from constant vigilance needed to prevent a reaction. They also
have to trust their child to the care of others, make sure their child is safe outside the home,
and help their child have a normal sense of identity.

Children with food allergies may also have constant fear and stress about the possibility of a
life-threatening reaction. The fear of ingesting a food allergen without knowing it can lead to
coping strategies that limit social and other daily activities. Children can carry emotional
burdens because they are not accepted by other people, they are socially isolated, or they
believe they are a burden to others. They also may have anxiety and distress that is caused by
teasing, taunting, harassment, or bullying by peers, teachers, or other adults. School and ECE
program staff must consider these factors as they develop plans for managing the risk of food
allergy for children with food allergies.

Food Allergy Management in Early Care and Education Programs

School and ECE program staff should develop a comprehensive strategy to manage the risk of
food allergy reactions in children. This strategy should include (1) a coordinated approach, (2)
strong leadership, and (3) a specific and comprehensive plan for managing food allergies.

1. Use a coordinated approach that is based on effective partnerships. The management of
    any chronic health condition should be based on a partnership among school or ECE
    program staff, children and their families, and the family's allergist or other doctor.

                             Figure 13.6 - Effective management of food allergies requires partnerships.33

2. The collective knowledge and experience of a licensed doctor, children with food allergies,
    and their families can guide the most effective management of food allergies in schools or
    ECE programs for each child. Close working relationships can help ease anxiety among

    parents, build trust, and improve the knowledge and skill of school or ECE program staff
    members.
3. Provide clear leadership to guide planning and ensure implementation of food allergy
    management plans and practices. This may be the administrator or the person that
    coordinates health services for children (health consultant, school nurse, etc.)
4. Develop and implement a comprehensive plan for managing food allergies. To effectively
    manage food allergies and the risks associated with these conditions, many people inside
    and outside the school or ECE program must come together to develop a comprehensive
    plan, called the Food Allergy Management and Prevention Plan (FAMPP). See Appendix P
    for a checklist that programs can use to evaluate their response to food allergy
    emergencies.

The FAMPP should address the following five priorities:
    1) Ensure the daily management of food allergies for individual children.
         a) Identify children with food allergies.
         b) Develop a plan to manage and reduce the risk of food allergy reactions in individual
             children, usually called a food allergy Emergency Care Plan (ECP). The ECP should be
             written by the child's physician and confirmed with the parents. It should include:
             i) A recent photo of the child.
             ii) Information about the food allergen, including a confirmed written diagnosis
                  from the child's doctor or allergist.
             iii) Information about signs and symptoms of the child's possible reactions to known
                  allergens.
             iv) Information about the possible severity of reactions, including any history of
                  prior anaphylaxis (even though anaphylaxis can occur even in children without a
                  history of prior anaphylaxis).
             v) A treatment plan for responding to a food allergy reaction or emergency,
                  including whether an epinephrine auto-injector should be used.
             vi) Information about other conditions, such as asthma or exercise-induced
                  anaphylaxis that might affect food allergy management.
             vii) Contact information for parents and doctors, including alternate phone numbers
                  for notification in case of emergency

    2) Prepare for food allergy emergencies.
         a) Set up communication systems that are easy to use (intercoms, walkie-talkies, cell
             phones, etc.)
         b) Make sure staff can get to epinephrine auto-injectors quickly and easily
         c) Make sure that epinephrine is used when needed and someone immediately
             contacts emergency medical services
         d) Identify the role of each staff member in an emergency
         e) Prepare for food allergy reactions in children without a prior history of food
             allergies.
         f) Document the response to a food allergy emergency

354 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
    3) Provide professional development on food allergies for staff members.
         a) Provide general training on food allergies for all staff.
         b) Provide in-depth training for staff who have frequent contact with children with
             food allergies.
         c) Provide specialized training for staff who are responsible for managing the health of
             children with food allergies on a daily basis.

    4) Educate children and family members about food allergies.
         a) Teach all children about food allergies
         b) Teach all parents and families about food allergies.

    5) Create and maintain a healthy and safe educational environment.
         a) Create an environment that is as safe as possible from exposure to food allergens.
         b) Develop food-handling policies and procedures to prevent food allergens from
             unintentionally contacting another food.
         c) Make outside groups aware of food allergy policies and rules when they use school
             or ECE program facilities before or after hours.
         d) Create a positive psychosocial climate (one that prevents bullying, teasing, and
             harassing).

Early care and education programs are responsible for the health and safety of children with
food allergies. Through the collective efforts of school and ECE program staff members,
parents, and health care providers, children with food allergies can be assured a safe place to
thrive, learn, and succeed.34

                   Gluten Intolerance and Celiac Disease

                       One particular intolerance to be aware of that may affect children in early
                       care and education programs is gluten intolerance. Gluten is a protein
                       found in wheat, rye, and barley. It is found mainly in foods but may also be
                       in other products like medicines, vitamins, and supplements. People with
                       gluten sensitivity have problems with gluten. It is different from celiac
                       disease (see below), an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten
                       because it will damage their small intestine.

                       Some of the symptoms of gluten sensitivity are similar to celiac disease.
                       They include tiredness and stomachaches. It can cause other symptoms
                       too, including muscle cramps and leg numbness. But it does not damage
                       the small intestine like celiac disease.

                       Researchers are still learning more about gluten sensitivity.35 A more
                       serious concern surrounding gluten that has more acknowledgment in the
                       medical field is celiac disease.

                       Celiac Disease
                       Celiac disease is an immune disease in which people can't eat gluten
                       because it will damage their small intestine. If they have celiac disease and
                       eat foods with gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the small
                       intestine. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley. It may also be
                       in other products like vitamins and supplements, hair and skin products,
                       toothpaste, and lip balm.

                       Celiac disease affects each person differently. Symptoms may occur in the
                       digestive system, or other parts of the body. One person might have
                       diarrhea and abdominal pain, while another person may be irritable or
                       depressed. Irritability is one of the most common symptoms in children.
                       Some people have no symptoms.

                       Celiac disease is genetic. Blood tests and tissue biopsies may be used to
                       diagnose celiac disease. 36 "Many kids are diagnosed with it when they're
                       between 6 months and 2 years old, which is when most kids get their first
                       taste of gluten in foods."37 Treatment is a diet free of gluten, which is
                       essential to prevent damage to the small intestine.38 So it is critical that
                       their food does not contain and is not contaminated with gluten. Because
                       gluten is found in many foods, reading nutrition labels will be vital.
                       Preparing food away from gluten containing food is also required to
                       prevent cross-contamination. Gluten free versions of foods and gluten-free
                       recipes will help early care and education staff (and families) to protect the
                       nutritional well-being and health of children with celiac disease.

Iron-Deficiency Anemia

Iron deficiency anemia is the most common cause of anemia in the United States.39 This
condition occurs when an iron-deprived body cannot produce enough hemoglobin, a protein in
red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body. The inadequate supply of
hemoglobin for new blood cells results in anemia. Iron-deficiency anemia causes a number of
problems including weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and irritability. It can also result in
intellectual, behavioral, or motor problems.

In infants and toddlers, iron-deficiency anemia can occur as young children are weaned from
iron-rich foods, such as breast milk and iron-fortified formula. They begin to eat solid foods that
may not provide enough of this nutrient. As a result, their iron stores become diminished at a
time when this nutrient is critical for brain growth and development.

There are steps that parents and caregivers can take to prevent iron-deficiency anemia, such as
adding more iron-rich foods to a child's diet, including lean meats, fish, poultry, eggs, legumes,
and iron-enriched whole-grain breads and cereals40 and foods high in vitamin C, which helps the
body absorb iron efficiently.41 Although milk is critical for the bone-building calcium that it
provides, intake should not exceed the recommended daily allowance (RDA) to avoid displacing
foods rich with iron.42

Summary

Early care and education programs can create environments that protect children's nutrition
and physical wellness by following dietary guidelines and providing nutritious foods that appeal
to children and keeping them active. It is important to understand forms of malnutrition that
can affect families and children and to understand and plan for nutritional concerns that may
affect children, such as food allergies and intolerances and iron deficiency anemia.

Introduction

To provide all children the appropriate nutrition, it is important to understand how nutritional
needs and feeding practices change as children mature. Children with special needs may have
different nutritional and feedings needs. Working with families and medical providers,
programs can ensure that they meet each and every child's needs. Early care and education
programs can also support and empower families to provide the best nutrition to their children.

Feeding Infants

Requirements for macronutrients and micronutrients on a per-kilogram basis are higher during
infancy than at any other stage in the human life cycle. See the average calorie needs for
infants in Table 14.1. An infants' resting metabolic rate is two times that of an adult. These
needs are affected by the rapid cell division that occurs during growth, which requires energy
and protein, along with the nutrients that are involved in DNA synthesis.1

Table 14.1 - Average Calorie Needs for Infants2

         Sex/Age              Calories
Boys (0-6 months)    472-645 calories

Girls (0-6 months)   438-593 calories

Boys (6-12 months)   645-844 calories

Girls (6-12 months)  593-768 calories

Boys (1-2 years)     844-1,050 calories

Girls (1-2 years)    768-997 calories

During this period, children are entirely dependent on their parents and other caregivers to
meet these needs. For almost all infants six months or younger, breast milk is the best source to
fulfill nutritional requirements. An infant may require feedings eight to twelve times a day or
more in the beginning. After six months, infants can gradually begin to consume solid foods to
help meet nutrient needs.

How often an infant wants to eat will also change over time due to growth spurts, which
typically occur at about two weeks and six weeks of age, and again at about three months and
six months of age.3

Breastfeeding

The dietary recommendations for infants are based on the nutritional content of human breast
milk. Carbohydrates make up about 45 to 65 percent of the caloric content in breast milk.
Protein makes up about 5 to 20 percent of the caloric content of breast milk. About 30 to 40

percent of the caloric content in breast milk is made up of fat. A diet in high unsaturated fat is
necessary to encourage the development of neural pathways in the brain and other parts of the
body.

Almost all of the nutrients that infants require can be met if they consume an adequate amount
of breast milk. There are a few exceptions, though. Human milk is low in vitamin D, which is
needed for calcium absorption and building bone, among other things. Breast milk is also low in
vitamin K, which is required for blood clotting, and deficits could lead to bleeding or
hemorrhagic disease. Infants are born with limited vitamin K, so supplementation may be
needed initially and some states require a vitamin K injection after birth. Also, breast milk is not
high in iron, but the iron in breast milk is well absorbed by infants. After four to six months,
however, an infant needs an additional source of iron other than breast milk. Therefore,
breastfed children often need to take a vitamin D supplement in the form of drops. 4

                   Supporting Breastfeeding in Early Care and Education

                       Early care and education programs play an important role in supporting
                       breastfeeding All staff members--despite their comfort or experience with
                       breastfeeding--play an important role in breastfeeding promotion. They
                       have an opportunity to share the facts about breastfeeding with families,
                       and to help them decide what's best for them and their babies.5

                       You can support breastfeeding mothers when you:
                            Talk about why breastfeeding is so good for their infant.
                            Tell them you want to care for breastfed infants and support
                                breastfeeding mothers.
                            Share other places in the community they can go to for help with
                                breastfeeding.
                            Share and discuss resources about breastfeeding.
                            Try to time feedings to the mother's schedule (being sure to
                                respond to the infant's needs and cues).
                            Offer a place to nurse that is comfortable, quiet, and private.
                            Communicate about their infant's day.6

Feeding with Breastmilk in Early Care and Education Programs

Mothers may choose to have their breastfed infants fed in one of several ways when the infant
is in child care including:

    1. mother uses her breaks to come to the child care site at feeding times to nurse her
         infant;

    2. child care provider gives the infant the breastmilk that the mother has expressed on a
         previous day.

Follow the feeding method that the mother chooses. Feeding advice such as the use of infant
formula should come from the infant's doctor or clinic.

Expressed breastmilk needs to be stored and handled safely to keep it from spoiling. Remind
mothers to label, date, and chill or refrigerate their breastmilk right after they express it. Ask
mothers to bring the milk in hard plastic bottles.

Ask mothers to bring in enough breastmilk to feed the infant each day. Be sure that each bottle
or other container of breastmilk is labeled with the infant's name and the date the milk was
expressed. Bottles should have just the amount both you and the mother think the infant will
take at each feeding. This amount will be about 2 to 4 ounces of breastmilk for the younger
infant. As the infant gets older, the mother can put more breastmilk in each bottle. Keep
breastmilk in the refrigerator or freezer until ready to use. Breastmilk that is not frozen, should
be disposed of if not eaten within 72 hours.

Thaw frozen breastmilk by running the container under cool water. Do not set breastmilk out to
thaw at room temperature. Do not thaw breastmilk by heating on the stove or in a microwave.8
See below for instructions on how to bottle feed an infant.

Although breast milk is ideal for almost all infants, not all mothers will be able to breastfeed
and some mothers should not breastfeed (including women with HIV, who are being treated for
cancer, or who are taking drugs that are not safe while breastfeeding).

Formula Feeding

Infant formula provides a balance of nutrients. However, not all formulas are the same and
there are important considerations that parents and caregivers must weigh. Standard formulas
use cow's milk as a base. They have 20 calories per fluid ounce, similar to breast milk, with
vitamins and minerals added. Soy-based formulas are usually given to infants who develop
diarrhea, constipation, vomiting, colic, or abdominal pain, or to infants with a cow's milk
protein allergy. Hypoallergenic protein hydrolysate formulas are usually given to infants who
are allergic to cow's milk and soy protein. This type of formula uses hydrolyzed protein,
meaning that the protein is broken down into amino acids and small peptides, which makes it
easier to digest.

Infant formula comes in three basic types:
    1. Powder that requires mixing with water. This is the least expensive type of formula.
    2. Concentrates, which are liquids that must be diluted with water. This type is slightly
         more expensive.
    3. Ready-to-use liquids that can be poured directly into bottles. This is the most expensive
         type of formula. However, it requires the least amount of preparation. Ready-to-use
         formulas are also convenient for traveling.

Most infants need about 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight each day. Therefore,
the average infant should consume about 24 fluid ounces of breastmilk or formula per day.
When preparing formula, caregivers should carefully follow the safety guidelines, since an
infant has an immature immune system. All equipment used in formula preparation should be
sterilized. Prepared, unused formula should be refrigerated to prevent bacterial growth.
Caregivers should make sure not to use contaminated water to mix formula in order to prevent
foodborne illnesses. Follow the instructions for powdered and concentrated formula carefully--
formula that is overly diluted would not provide adequate calories and protein, while overly
concentrated formula provides too much protein and too little water which can impair kidney
function.9

Feeding with Formula in Early Child Care and Education Programs

Early care and education programs provide commercially prepared formulas to infants, under
the direction of the family. Bottles of formula should come prepared in bottles labeled with the
infant's name and the date. Unused mixed formula should not be stored for more than 24
hours.

Bottle Feeding (Both Expressed Breastmilk and Formula)

Always wash your hands before handling bottles or feeding the infant. Use only clean bottles,
nipples, and cups. For infants that do not crawl, bottles and nipples should be sterilized. If you
need to reuse them, sterilize by boiling in water for 5 minutes or by washing in a dishwasher.
Warm breastmilk and formula by placing the bottle in a pan of warm water or by holding it
under warm running water for a few minutes. Do not warm breastmilk or formula on the stove
or in a microwave. Microwave heating causes hot spots in the milk that can burn the infant's
mouth and throat. These hot spots may stay even if you shake the bottle. And heating also
destroys most of the natural substances in breastmilk.
Double-check the labels on bottles before feeding to ensure the infant is getting the correct
breastmilk or formula. Always hold the infant when bottle feeding. Try different positions for
infants who do not want to take their bottles. Some infants are happier if you feed them in the
usual cradle position. Others prefer a different position. Do not prop up a bottle to feed an
infant or put an infant in a crib with a bottle. Bottle propping could cause the infant to choke,
tooth decay, and ear infections.

Figure 14.2 - Not only is holding an infant during bottle feeding safest, but it is also an important time for caregiver
                                       and infant to connect and build their relationship.10

Burp by placing the infant high over your shoulder or over your knee. You can also lean the
infant forward in a sitting position supported by your hands. Pat or rub the infant's back. This
puts gentle pressure on the abdomen to push extra air from the stomach.11
Uneaten breastmilk or formula should be discarded after a feeding as bacteria from the infant's
mouth may have made it into the bottle.

When to Feed

In the early months, infants will need to be fed "on demand"--this means that they are able to
feed whenever they are hungry or show hunger cues. Hunger cues are unique to each infant.
An infant might:

     Have a specific hunger cry
     Root or look around for food
     Suck on their hand or fingers
     Become irritable or restless
     Repeat a unique behavior to demonstrate hunger

When adults respond to an infant's hunger cues, the infant can also tell how much food they
want and when they are full. This feeding practice supports healthy eating habits, growth, and
development later in life.12

                Pause to Reflect

                  Some families put infants on a schedule that dictates when they eat (and even
                  sleep)? Is this compatible with feeding on demand as described above? How
                  might you discuss this with a family?

Introducing Solid Foods

Infants should be breastfed or formula-fed exclusively for the first six months of life according
to the WHO. (The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast milk or bottle formula
exclusively for at least the first four months, but ideally for six months.) Infants should not
consume solid foods before six months because solids do not contain the right nutrient mix that
infants need. Also, eating solids may mean drinking less breast milk or bottle formula. If that
occurs, an infant may not consume the right quantities of various nutrients. If parents try to
feed an infant who is too young or is not ready, their tongue will push the food out, which is
called an extrusion reflex. After six months, the suck-swallow reflexes are not as strong, and
infants can hold up their heads and move them around, both of which make eating solid foods
more feasible.13

                   Knowing When an Infant is Ready for Solid Foods

                       Here are several ways you can tell that an infant is ready to eat solid foods:
                            The infant's birth weight has doubled.
                            The infant can control their head and neck movements.
                            The infant can sit up with some support.

                            The infant can show you they are full by turning their head away or
                                by not opening their mouth.

                            The infant begins showing interest in food when others are eating.

Solid baby foods can be bought commercially or prepared from regular food using a food
processor, blender, food mill, or grinder.14 Baby food can be served at room temperature. If it is
warmed, it must be stirred to distribute evenly.15

Portion the amount of food you intend to serve the baby (any uneaten food will need to be
thrown away after a feeding and use small amounts on an infant-sized spoon. When beginning
solid foods, timing is important. To keep mealtimes positive, choose a time when the infant is
happy and when you have the patience and time to focus. Offer 1 to 2 teaspoons after a
breastmilk or formula feeding. This can increase over time to 2 to 3 tablespoons.

It is normal for infants to refuse new foods. Sometimes it can take 10 to 12 times of offering a
food before an infant will accept it. Infants know when they have had enough and may turn
their head away. Don't force them to keep eating.16

As families and caregivers introduce solids, they should feed the child only one new food at a
time, to help identify allergic responses or food intolerances. An iron supplement is also
recommended at this time.17

                   Foods to Avoid for Infants

                            Never give honey to infants. It may contain bacteria that can cause
                                botulism, a rare, but serious illness.

                            Do not give infants cow's milk until they are 1 year old. Before age 1,
                                they have a difficult time digesting cow's milk.

                            Avoid foods with added salt or sugar.
                            Do not give infants egg white until after they are 1 (egg yolks 3-4 per

                                week are okay)18

Learning to Self-Feed

With the introduction of solid foods, young children begin to learn how to handle food and how
to feed themselves. At six to seven months, infants can use their whole hand to pick up items

(this is known as the palmer grasp). They can lift larger items, but picking up smaller pieces of
food is difficult. At eight months, a child might be able to use a pincer grasp, which uses fingers
to pick up objects.19

Serve food that is soft and mashed. Cut food into small pieces (cubes no larger than 1/4 inch) or
thin slices that your baby can easily chew and swallow. Avoid high-risk choking foods such as
small, slippery foods; dry foods that are hard to chew or sticky; and tough foods. 20

                   Finger Foods

                       Here are some good food choices for self-feeding children:
                            Soft cooked vegetables
                            Washed and peeled fruits
                            Graham crackers
                            Melba toast
                            Noodles
                            Soft cooked vegetables
                            Washed and peeled fruits
                            Graham crackers
                            Melba toast
                            Noodles

                       Here are foods to avoid as they are a choking hazard:
                            Apple chunks or slices
                            Grapes
                            Berries
                            Raisins
                            Dry flake cereals
                            Hot dogs
                            Sausages
                            Peanut butter
                            Popcorn
                            Nuts
                            Seeds

To minimize choking, ensure that infants are seated while eating. If using a high chair, make
sure to use the safety straps.22

          Figure 14.3 -This older infant has been served food on an unbreakable plate with a small utensil.23

After the age of one, children slowly begin to use utensils to handle their food. Unbreakable
dishes and cups are essential, since very young children may play with them or throw them
when they become bored with their food. 24

Supporting Infant Nutrition

Nutrition during the first year of life is really important. While babies who are breastfed for at
least 6 months are more likely to have a healthy weight as they grow up, mothers often report
that breastfeeding is harder than they thought. And mothers may be more likely to stop
breastfeeding if they feel unsupported and have nowhere to turn for help. And families that
choose not to or cannot breastfeed have questions and need support to feed their infants in a
healthy and safe way, too. Babies should be ready to start eating simple solids around 6
months. Babies who start eating solid foods too early are more likely to have weight problems
as children and adults.25

Early care and education programs can support infant nutrition with the following practices:
     All food brought from home should be labeled with the child's name and date.
     Part of the care plan that families share with their program and that is updated
         regularly, should be instructions for feeding. Families should determine how and what
         their infant is fed (as long as it's in compliance with licensing).
     Support parents with materials on providing optimal nutrition for their infant (such as
         the tips just listed).

     Be supportive of mothers who are breastfeeding. For mothers who can come to nurse,
         provide a space conducive to that. Ensure the breastmilk that is brought to the program
         is properly labeled, stored, and prepared.

     For infants that are formula fed, ensure that formula is prepared according to the label
         (or doctor's instructions).

     Hold all infants during bottle feedings. Not only does this keep them safe, but it is also
         valuable one-on-one time (caregiving routines are the heart of infant/toddler
         curriculum).

     Follow the cues of the infant you are feeding (when they are hungry and full).
     When feeding pureed baby food, use a small spoon and make sure you transfer food

         from a jar into a dish and throw away any uneaten food.
     Have appropriate seating available for infants that are beginning to self-feed (high

         chairs, booster seats, or enclosed small chairs at a low table)
     Provide unbreakable dishes to serve food to self-feeding infants.

              Engaging Families in Supporting Their Infant's Nutrition

                 Here are tips you can share with families
                      If breastfeeding is harder than you thought it would be you are not
                          alone!
                      Lots of people say that breastfeeding just comes "naturally" but for many
                          moms, it doesn't.
                      Going back to work and wanting to get back into a normal family routine
                          can make it hard to stick with breastfeeding. Using a breast pump can
                          help ensure your baby still gets the best nutrition.
                      If you need support or help at any time while you are breastfeeding call
                          1-800-994-9662 (the National Breastfeeding Hotline) for free
                          breastfeeding support.
                      Don't use pillows or other objects to hold a bottle for your baby. This
                          makes it hard for her to spit out the bottle when she's done - it can cause
                          her to keep eating after she's full.
                      Make sure you take the bottle away if your baby falls asleep. If you let
                          the baby keep the bottle in her mouth when he's sleeping, formula can
                          stay in her mouth and can damage his teeth or cause her to choke.
                      Stick with ONLY breast milk or formula for feeding your baby until she is
                          6 months old. Unless your doctor tells you something different, adding
                          cereal to a baby's bottle adds extra calories to her diet that she doesn't
                          need. 26
                      Infants are usually ready to eat solid foods at about 6 months of age.
                      If you introduce one new food at a time, you will be able to identify any
                          foods that cause allergies in your baby.27

                      Start solid feedings with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk
                          or formula. Mix it with enough milk so that the texture is very thin. Start
                          by offering the cereal 2 times a day, in just a few spoonfuls.

                      You can make the mixture thicker as your baby learns to control it in
                          their mouth.

                      You can also introduce iron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables. Try
                          green peas, carrots, sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, pears, bananas,
                          and peaches.

                      Some dietitians recommend introducing a few vegetables before fruits.
                          The sweetness of fruit may make some vegetables less appealing.

                      The amount your child eats will vary between 2 tablespoons (30 grams)
                          and 2 cups (480 grams) of fruits and vegetables per day. How much your
                          child eats depends on their size and how well they eat fruits and
                          vegetables.28

Feeding Toddlers

Major physiological changes continue into the toddler years. Unlike in infancy, the limbs grow
much faster than the trunk, which gives the body a more proportionate appearance. Their
physical growth and motor development slow compared to the progress they made as infants.
The toddler years pose interesting challenges for parents or other caregivers, as children learn
how to eat on their own and begin to develop personal preferences. However, with the proper
diet and guidance, toddlers can continue to grow and develop at a healthy rate.

                            Figure 14.4 - Caloric intake will depend on a toddler's activity level. 29

The energy requirements for ages two to three are about 1,000 to 1,400 calories a day. In
general, a toddler needs to consume about 40 calories for every inch of height. For example, a
young child who measures 32 inches should take in an average of 1,300 calories a day.
However, the recommended caloric intake varies with each child's level of activity. Toddlers

require small, frequent, nutritious snacks and meals to satisfy energy requirements. The
amount of food a toddler needs from each food group depends on daily calorie needs.

Forty-five to 65% of their daily caloric intake should come from carbohydrates. Protein should
make up 5 to 20% of their daily calories. And fat should make up 30 to 40% of their daily intake.
Essential fatty acids are vital for the development of the eyes, along with nerve and other types
of tissue. However, toddlers should not consume foods with high amounts of trans fats and
saturated fats.

As a child grows bigger, the demands for micronutrients increase. These needs for vitamins and
minerals can be met with a balanced diet, with a few exceptions. According to the American
Academy of Pediatrics, toddlers and children of all ages need 600 international units of vitamin
D per day. Vitamin D-fortified milk and cereals can help to meet this need. However, toddlers
who do not get enough of this micronutrient should receive a supplement. Pediatricians may
also prescribe a fluoride supplement for toddlers who live in areas with fluoride-poor water.
Iron deficiency is also a major concern for children between the ages of two and three.30

Self-Feeding

As children grow older, they enjoy taking care of themselves, which includes self-feeding.
During this phase, it is important to offer children foods that they can handle on their own and
that helps them avoid choking and other hazards. Examples include fresh fruits that have been
sliced into pieces, orange or grapefruit sections, peas or potatoes that have been mashed for
safety, a cup of yogurt, and whole-grain bread or bagels cut into pieces. Even with careful
preparation and training, the learning process can be messy. As a result, parents and other
caregivers can help children learn how to feed themselves by providing the following:

     small utensils that fit a young child's hand
     small cups that will not tip over easily
     plates with edges to prevent food from falling off
     small servings on a plate
     highchairs, booster seats, or small enclosed chairs to reach a low table31

Feeding Challenges in the Toddler Years

During the toddler years, parents may face a number of problems related to food and nutrition.
Possible obstacles include difficulty helping a young child overcome a fear of new foods, or
fights over messy habits at the dinner table. Even in the face of problems and confrontations,
parents and other caregivers must make sure their preschooler has nutritious choices at every
meal. For example, even if a child stubbornly resists eating vegetables, parents should continue
to provide them. Before long, the child may change their mind, and develop a taste for foods
once abhorred. It is important to remember this is the time to establish or reinforce healthy
habits.

Nutritionist Ellyn Satter states that feeding is a responsibility that is split between parent and
child. According to Satter, parents are responsible for what their infants eat, while infants are
responsible for how much they eat. In the toddler years and beyond, parents are responsible
for what children eat, when they eat, and where they eat, while children are responsible for
how much food they eat and whether they eat. Satter states that the role of a parent or a
caregiver in feeding includes the following:

     selecting and preparing food
     providing regular meals and snacks
     making mealtimes pleasant
     showing children what they must learn about mealtime behavior
     avoiding letting children eat in between meal- or snack-times

You are likely to notice a sharp drop in their child's appetite. Children at this stage are often
picky about what they want to eat. They may turn their heads away after eating just a few
bites. Or, they may resist coming to the table at mealtimes. They also can be unpredictable
about what they want to consume for specific meals or at particular times of the day. Although
it may seem as if toddlers should increase their food intake to match their level of activity,

32 Image by the National Center on Early Childhood Health and Wellness is in the public domain

374 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
there is a good reason for picky eating. A child's growth rate slows after infancy, and toddlers
ages two and three do not require as much food.33

Establishing healthy meal routines is an important step in healthy toddler development. Ideally,
mealtimes should take place at regular times, at a table with limited distraction, and children
should be encouraged to feed themselves with adult support as needed. 34 Best practices in
early care and education include creating positive meal and snack times that are served family-
style with adult modeling eating balanced nutrition.

              Engaging Families in Supporting Their Toddler's Nutrition

                 Here are tips you can share with families:
                      Serving sizes for toddlers are much smaller than serving sizes for
                          adults.
                      A typical serving size for a toddler drink is 4-6 ounces. Water and milk
                          are the best choices for toddlers
                      Your toddler (and you too!) needs food from all five of the food
                          groups--grains, protein, vegetables, fruit, and dairy. Try offering a
                          variety of foods from these groups at meals and snacks.
                      Your toddler may eat more some days and less on others. Don't worry,
                          this is normal! Keep offering regularly scheduled meals and snacks.
                      Allow your toddler to tell you when she is full. This teaches them to
                          listen to their body for signs of hunger or fullness.
                      Try using child-size plates, bowls, and utensils for "right-size" portions
                          for your toddler. Using child-size utensils also makes it easier for your
                          toddler to eat.
                      Encourage toddlers to drink from cups and avoid the use of bottles or
                          sippy cups.
                      Limit distractions during meal and snack times to allow your toddler to
                          enjoy the food. Turn off the TV and sit at a table.
                      Toddlers get hungry between meals. Snack time is a great chance to
                          feed your toddler healthy foods (like fruits and veggies).
                      Remember to have a start and end time for snack time. Toddlers
                          should not be snacking (or grazing) all day.35

Feeding Preschoolers

Children's attitudes and opinions about food deepen. They not only begin taking their cues
about food preferences from family members, but also from peers and the larger culture. This
time in a child's life provides an opportunity for families and other caregivers to reinforce good

preferences. Adults should also serve as role models for their children, who will often mimic
their behavior and eating habits.36

In early childhood, children should still get 45-65% of their daily calories from carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates high in fiber should make up the bulk of intake. Their intake of protein increases
to 10-30% of their daily calories to support muscle growth and development. High levels of
essential fatty acids are needed to support growth (although not as high as in infancy and the
toddler years). As a result, the daily recommendation for fat is 25-35% of their daily calories.
And they should get 17-25 grams of fiber per day.

Their micronutrient needs should be met with foods first. Families and caregivers should select
a variety of foods from each food group to ensure that nutritional requirements are met.
Because children grow rapidly, they require foods that are high in iron, such as lean meats,
legumes, fish, poultry, and iron-enriched cereals. Adequate fluoride is crucial to support strong
teeth. One of the most important micronutrient requirements during childhood is adequate
calcium and vitamin D intake. Both are needed to build dense bones and a strong skeleton.
Children who do not consume adequate vitamin D should be given a supplement of 10
micrograms (400 international units) per day.39

Feeding Challenges in the Preschool Years

Picky eating is typical for many preschoolers. It's simply another step in the process of growing
up and becoming independent. As long as a preschooler is healthy, growing normally, and has
plenty of energy, they are most likely getting the nutrients they need.

Typical Picky Eating Behaviors

Many children will show one or more of the following behaviors during the preschool years. In
most cases, these will go away with time.

     Refusal of a food based on a certain color or texture. For example, they could refuse
         foods that are red or green, contain seeds, or are squishy.

     Only eating a certain type of food. A preschooler may choose 1 or 2 foods they like and
         refuse to eat anything else.

     "Wasting" of time at the table and seeming interested in doing anything but eating.
     Unwillingness to try new foods. It is normal for a preschooler to prefer familiar foods

         and be afraid to try new things.40

              Helping Families Cope with Picky Eating

                 Picky eating is temporary. If adults don't make it a big deal, it will usually end
                 before school age. The following tips are tips to help deal with picky eating
                 behavior positively.

                      Let your kids be "produce pickers." Let them pick out fruits and veggies
                          at the store.

                      Have your child help you prepare meals. Children learn about food and
                          get excited about tasting food when they help make meals. Let them
                          add ingredients, scrub veggies, or help stir.

                      Offer choices. Rather than ask, "Do you want broccoli for dinner?" ask
                          "Which would you like for dinner, broccoli or cauliflower?"

                      Enjoy each other while eating family meals together. Talk about fun
                          and happy things. If meals are times for family arguments, your child
                          may learn unhealthy attitudes toward food.

                      Offer the same foods for the whole family. Serve the same meal to
                          adults and kids. Let them see you enjoy healthy foods. Talk about the
                          colors, shapes, and textures on the plate.41

                      Make food fun
                      Cut food into fun and easy shapes with cookie cutters.
                      Encourage your child to invent and help prepare new snacks.
                      Name a food your child helps create.42

                      Focus on the meal and each other. Your child learns by watching you.
                          Children are likely to copy your table manners, your likes and dislikes,
                          and your willingness to try new foods.

                      Offer a variety of healthy foods. Let your child choose how much to
                          eat. Children are more likely to enjoy a food when eating it is their own
                          choice.

                      Let your children serve themselves. Teach your children to take small
                          amounts at first. Let them know they can get more if they are still
                          hungry.43

Trying New Foods

It is normal for children to reject foods they have never tried before. Here are some tips to get
preschoolers to try new foods:

     Small portions, big benefits. Let children try small portions of new foods that you enjoy.
         Give them a small taste at first and be patient with them.

     Offer only one new food at a time and ideally with a favored food. Offering many new
         foods all at once could be too much for children.

     Be a good role model. Try new foods yourself. Describe their taste, texture, and smell to
         the children.

     Offer new foods first when children are most hungry.
     Offer new foods many times. It may take up to a dozen tries for a child to accept a new

         food.44

                Pause to Reflect

                   Think back to your childhood. Were you a picky eater or more adventurous?
                   Why do you think that it was? How did your caregivers respond to your eating
                   preferences? Do you have similar preferences now or have you expanded your
                   tastes/preferences?

Feeding School-Aged Children

While calorie needs go up as children get older, until around age 9 (or the beginning of
puberty), nutritional needs for school-aged children are very similar to preschoolers. Once
puberty begins, there is a period of rapid growth as girls grow 2-8 inches and boys grow 4-12
inches.

School-aged children should still get 45-65% of their daily calories from carbohydrates.
Carbohydrates high in fiber should make up the bulk of that. Their intake of protein remains at
10-30% of their daily calories to support muscle growth and development. And the daily
recommendation for fat also remains at 25-35% of their daily calories.

A few micronutrients take on added importance, especially at the beginning of puberty. These
include vitamins, D, K, and B12, calcium, and iron. Whenever possible these additional
micronutrient needs should be met with dietary choices and not supplements (with the
exception of iron).46

School Meals

School-aged children can often eat both breakfast and lunch at school, which can save families
time and provide children with nutritious food.

Breakfast

Research has shown that children that eat breakfast do better in school and have higher intakes
of fiber, B vitamins, calcium, and other nutrients.47 Refer to Figure 14.7 to see what a school
breakfast includes.

Lunch

Lunch is important because it meets 1/3 of the nutritional needs of most children for the day.
And kids with healthier eating patterns have better academic performance. And farm to school
programs (in 42% of schools) increase children's access to locally produced foods.48 Refer to
Figure 14.8 to see a breakdown of school lunches provide.

Meals and Snacks in School-Aged Care Programs

On school days, children that are in care before school may need to be fed breakfast (if they did
not eat at home or will not be eating at school). After school, they will need substantial, healthy
snacks. On full days of care, they will need breakfast, lunch, and a snack.

Follow the menu planning advice in Chapter 15. And involve the children in menu planning and
food preparation whenever possible and see which of the suggestions in the following feature
for families might also be incorporated into the classroom.

              Activities Families Can Do with Children

                 Choosemyplate.gov offers some fun ideas for families to teach their children
                 about healthy eating and engage the whole family in making healthy choices.
                 Some of these include:

                      Food critic game where children select a new food to try and rate it on
                          visual appeal, smell, taste, and texture52

                      Grocery store bingo where children identify foods they see in the
                          grocery store to try to get a 5 in a row bingo53

                      Make food visually appealing by turning it into art
                      Kid's Restaurant: Kids get to plan out the meal, design the menu, and

                          prepare the dish
                      Growing a garden (or starting small with an herb box in a window)
                      Going to a local farmer's market or farm stand to find local food

                          options to buy, take home, and turn into a delicious meal.

                 Making Mealtimes Fun
                 Here are some tips for families for making mealtimes more relaxed and
                 enjoyable:

                      Remove distractions, such as phones, tablets, and turn off the
                          television.

                      Have conversations. Use starters like:
                          o Give each family member the spotlight to share their highlight,
                              lowlight, and "funnylight"
                          o If our family lived in a zoo, what animals would we be and why?
                          o If you could have one superpower, what would it be and why?
                          o If you were stranded on a desert island and could only have one
                              food to eat, what would it be and why?
                          o Pass on traditions, both the foods and the stories behind them

                      Let the children make the choices (from a healthy selection of foods)
                      Let everyone help prepare and clean up after meals
                      Consider a change of scenery, like a picnic
                      Reserve a special plate to rotate between family members, for

                          example on birthdays, when someone gets a good grade, or any other
                          occasion you'd like to recognize.54

Feeding Children with Special Needs

Some disabilities and other exceptional needs may affect children's nutrition. For example,
     children with cerebral palsy or cystic fibrosis may have different caloric needs
     children with celiac disease or irritable bowel syndrome may have dietary restrictions
     children with cleft lip or palate may have physical difficulties with eating
     children on the autism spectrum may have strong food preferences or aversions

                   Figure 14.10 - This child with a cleft lip may find sucking from a bottle challenging.55

Because each child's specific needs will vary, early care and education programs should work
closely with families, and medical providers as needed, to ensure that they understand and can
meet the nutritional and feeding needs of the individual child (not a generalization or
assumption about the child might need based on a diagnosis or label).

Nutrition policies and practices should be created to be inclusive of children with special needs.
Some general considerations early care and education programs and schools should make to
ensure that all children's nutritional needs are met and that all children experience positive
meal and snack times include:

     Ensure that the spaces in which children eat and access to drinking water are fully
         accessible to all children, including those with mobility impairments (and if needed,
         assistive devices should be provided).

     Staff should be trained to provide for children who may have additional or differing
         nutritional or feeding needs so they can work effectively and comfortably with all
         children.

     Follow any dietary restrictions.56

Summary

Early care and education programs can provide for all children's nutrition when they
understand

     the general changes children have in nutritional needs as they mature,
     common challenges across the different stages of development, and
     strategies that foster positive meal and snack times at each age stage, and
     the fact that children may have diverse and unique nutritional needs

Programs also play an important role in children's nutrition by empowering families by
providing support, information, and resources as they make decisions about how to feed their
children.

Introduction

Knowledge of menu planning is essential to providing appropriate nutrition to young children.
Early care and education programs must have staff who plan and prepare food that are aware
of individual preferences, including vegetarianism, and cultural and religious differences in food
choice, preparation, and service. To protect children's health, proper hygiene and sanitation
processes must be followed closely. Only safe food should be purchased. And how that food is
stored, prepared, and served must follow proper protocol to prevent foodborne illness.

Menu Planning

Let's examine several factors that are important for menu planning, including the meal
patterns, licensed programs must follow, the importance of variety and balance, and aesthetics.

Meal Patterns

In the state of California, licensing requires programs to follow the meal plan requirements of
the Child and Adult Care Food Program and the Healthy Beverages in Child Care Act. Both of
these were introduced in Chapter 12. To review, here are the breakfast meal patterns for
infants and children.

Factors to consider

Menu planning principles include aesthetics, and variety, including color, texture, flavors,
shapes, and sizes of food, cost, balance, and nutritional quality, The availability of equipment
and staff knowledge and skill to prepare the foods on menus are also important considerations
in planning the menu. Along with all of these, an effective menu also considers cost.17

Aesthetics and Variety

How our food is presented, along with texture, consistency, color, shape, and the preparation
method, influences how we feel and what we think about a menu. It can even influence our
appetite and our interest in eating.18

Select nutritious foods that are contrasting colors and textures. This adds to the visual and
chewing appeal. Try to vary the colors of the foods being served. Avoid serving foods that are
all one color. For example, select a green, soft vegetable (spinach), a red, crunchy fruit (an
apple), and colorful, chewy wild rice to go along with a piece of chicken and a glass of milk. This
lends visual and chewing appeal as the children can see different colors and feel different
textures as they chew.19

                Pause to Reflect

                   Go back and look at the samples. How well do you think they did with creating
                   meals and snacks that offered variety and were visually appealing? What
                   about the versions you created?

Cost

While well-balanced nutrition should never be sacrificed to save money, early care and
education programs must also consider the costs of the menus they plan. One way to save costs
is to use cycle menus. A cycle menu follows a particular pattern and repeats on a regular
basis. The length of the cycle can vary, but may be 4-6 weeks long and can be different lengths
for different meals/snacks (for instance, with breakfast repeating more often than lunches).
And they can be updated as needed to include new foods or make other accommodations.20

Cycle menus allow a program to forecast costs, order in bulk, and reduce waste (with tried and
tested menus). Cycle menus are often planned seasonally so an operation might have a spring,
summer, and fall/winter cycle.21 And buying produce seasonally is often more affordable.

Nutrition and Balance

The most important consideration for menu planning is that it meets children's nutritional
needs. The meals and snacks provided by full-day early care and education program should
provide a substantial portion of a child's daily nutrition. All programs should be supporting
children's well-balanced diet, in which all the nutrients the body needs for proper functioning
and energy are taken in. A well-balanced diet contains a variety of foods from all the food
groups, as well as all the necessary vitamins and minerals we need. It also means taking in an
adequate supply of water for adequate health. A well-balanced diet can be planned by selecting
healthy foods from each of the food groups.22

Food Groups

Let's look at each of the food groups a bit more closely and identify sources for each.

Dairy Group

All fluid milk products and many foods made from milk are considered part of this food group.
Foods made from milk that retain their calcium content are part of the group. Foods made from
milk that have little to no calcium, such as cream cheese, cream, and butter, are not. Calcium-
fortified soymilk (soy beverage) is also part of the Dairy Group. When choosing dairy, fat-free
and low-fat dairy are good options for children.23

                              Figure 15.10 - Milk and milk products make up the dairy group24

Sources of dairy include:
     Milk (low fat, fat-free, whole)
     Lactose-free and lactose-reduced milk
     Yogurt
     Pudding
     Ice cream
     Frozen yogurt
     Calcium-fortified soy milk
     Hard cheeses (cheddar, mozzarella, swiss, parmesan)
     Soft cheeses (ricotta, cottage cheese)
     Calcium-fortified juices and cereals25

                   Tips for Serving the Dairy Group for Children

                            Serve unflavored, fat-free, and low-fat milks most often. They have
                                less added sugar and fewer calories than flavored, whole, or
                                reduced-fat milk.

                            Low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese provide much needed calcium. Try
                                making a dip for fruits or vegetables from yogurt.

                            Blend dairy into smoothies. Combine low-fat or fat-free yogurt with
                                bananas and cocoa powder for a smoothie, or try milk, ice cubes,
                                and frozen berries.26

Protein Group

All foods made from meat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, processed soy products,
nuts, and seeds are considered part of the Protein Foods Group. Select a variety of protein
foods to improve nutrient intake and health benefits, including cooked seafood. Meat and
poultry choices should be lean or low-fat.27

                               Figure 15.11 - Poultry, eggs, nuts and legumes provide protein28

Sources of protein include:
     Beef
     Pork (ham, pork chops)
     Lamb
     Veal
     Poultry (chicken, turkey)
     Beans (black, kidney, chickpeas, lentils, navy, pinto, white, soy beans, split peas)
     Eggs
     Canned fish (sardines, salmon, tuna, anchovies, clams)
     Fish (cod, tuna, sea bass, catfish, flounder, halibut, swordfish, trout, mackerel)
     Shellfish (shrimp, lobster, crab, mussels, oysters, scallops)
     Nuts (almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, pistachios, peanuts, pecans)
     Seeds (sesame, pumpkin, squash, sunflower)29

                   Tips for Serving the Protein Group for Children

                            Choose a variety of protein foods such as seafood, beans, lean
                                meats, poultry, and eggs.

                            Limit highly processed poultry, fish, or meat (like hotdogs, chicken
                                nuggets, and fish sticks). Even some "reduced-fat" meats and cold
                                cuts, like sausage, bologna, and salami, may be high in saturated fat
                                and sodium.

                            Add beans to children's favorite foods. Add beans and peas to tacos,
                                casseroles, stews, pastas, and side dishes.30

                   Tips for Serving the Fruit Group for Children

                            Focus on whole fruits
                            Serve a rainbow of choices. Fruit can be a quick and easy way to

                                make meals and snacks healthier and more colorful.
                            Choose from fresh, frozen, canned, and dried fruits. Purchase

                                canned fruit in water or 100% fruit juice instead of syrup.
                            Limit fruit juice. While 100% fruit juice can be part of a healthy diet,

                                it does not contain the dietary fiber found in other forms of fruit.
                            Offer raisins or other unsweetened dried fruit instead of chewy fruit

                                snacks or strips, which usually contain very little fruit. 34

Vegetable Group

Any vegetable or 100% vegetable juice counts as a member of the Vegetable Group. Vegetables
may be raw or cooked; fresh, frozen, canned, or dried/dehydrated; and may be whole, cut-up,
or mashed. Based on their nutrient content, vegetables are organized into 5 subgroups: dark-
green vegetables, starchy vegetables, red and orange vegetables, beans and peas, and other
vegetables. While it is not necessary to eat vegetables from each subgroup daily, over the
course of a week, vegetables from each subgroup should be eaten to reach ensure the daily
intake recommendation of the different vitamins is met.35

Figure 15.13 - Broccoli, peppers, carrots, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, radishes, and spinach are in the vegetable
                                                                 group.36

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      2

                   Tips for Serving the Vegetable Group for Children

                            Serve a variety of colorful choices. Brighten children's plates with
                                red, orange, and dark-green vegetables.

                            Choose from fresh, frozen, or canned vegetables. Prepare and serve
                                vegetables without added salt or solid fat.

                            Try a dip. Kids love to dip their foods. Whip up a quick dip for
                                veggies with yogurt and seasonings such as herbs or garlic. Serve
                                with raw vegetables like broccoli, carrots, or cauliflower.38

                            Provide at least one serving each of dark green vegetables, red and
                                orange vegetables, beans and peas (legumes), starchy vegetables,
                                and other vegetables once per week.39

Grain Group

Any food made from wheat, rice, oats, cornmeal, barley, or another cereal grain is a grain
product. Bread, pasta, breakfast cereals, grits, and tortillas are examples of grain products.
Foods such as popcorn, rice, and oatmeal are also included in the Grains Group.

Grains are divided into 2 subgroups: Whole Grains and Refined Grains. Whole grains contain
the entire grain kernel  the bran, germ, and endosperm. Examples of whole grains include
whole-wheat flour, bulgur (cracked wheat), oatmeal, whole cornmeal, and brown rice. Refined
grains have been milled, a process that removes the bran and germ. This is done to give grains a
finer texture and improve their shelf life, but it also removes dietary fiber, iron, and many B
vitamins. Some examples of refined grain products are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white
bread, and white rice.

Most refined grains are enriched. This means certain B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin, folic
acid) and iron are added back after processing. Fiber is not added back to enriched grains.
Check the ingredient list on refined grain products to make sure that the word "enriched" is
included in the grain name. Some food products are made from mixtures of whole grains and
refined grains.40

                            Figure 15.14 - Bread, rice, and pasta are all in the grain food group.41

                   Tips for Providing the Grain Group for Children

                            Make at least half their grains whole grains by offering 100% whole-
                                grain cereals, breads, and pasta.

                            Vary the choices for whole grains. Rolled oats, oatmeal, brown rice,
                                wild rice, buckwheat, quinoa, wheat berries, and millet are whole-
                                grain foods.

                            Choose toppings wisely for toast, hot cereals, pasta, and
                                rice. Instead of adding butter, stick margarine, and regular full-fat
                                cheese, use vegetable oils, low-fat cheeses, or marinara sauce as
                                toppings.43

                            Provide at least two servings of whole grain-rich grains per day.44

Oils

Oils are NOT a food group, although they provide essential nutrients. Oils include items such as
butter, oils, margarine, mayonnaise, salad dressings. These food items should be used sparingly.
Foods such as fish, nuts, and avocados are good choices of fats. Many foods we eat, especially
those that are processed, often are high in fat. This should be considered when planning
meals.45

                   Tips for Providing Oils for Children

                            Limit serving purchased pre-fried foods to no more than one serving
                                per week.46

Individual and Cultural Preferences

What families eat, how those foods are prepared and served, and the routines surrounding
meals and snacks are going to vary in every family. For some children, those will be similar to
what they encounter in early care and education programs. And some children will easily adapt
to new foods and routines. But gathering information from families on these is one way to have
an understanding of the food experiences and preferences children have. Menus can be
planned that include familiar foods.

Cultural and Religious Considerations

Some people do not eat various specific foods and beverages in conformity with various
religious, cultural, legal, or other societal prohibitions. Many of these prohibitions
constitute taboos. Many food taboos and other prohibitions forbid the meat of a particular
animal. Some food prohibitions can be defined as rules, codified by religion or otherwise, about
which foods, or combinations of foods, may not be eaten and how animals are to
be slaughtered or prepared. Some foods may be prohibited during certain religious periods
(e.g., Lent), at certain stages of life (e.g., pregnancy), or to certain classes of people
(e.g., priests), even though the food is otherwise permitted.47

Families and children may choose to exclude, include, or prepare foods in a particular way
according to their religious faith and beliefs. The guidance given in Table 15.7 on food choices
for specific religious groups is very general (and does not include prohibited items, such as
alcohol that do not apply to children in early care and education programs). There will be
individual differences and varying levels of adherence to guidelines which should be discussed
for each child with their family. Some people within some of the faith groups identified may not
observe the dietary guidelines listed. Prohibitions and restrictions even within a particular faith
may change between denominations or branches.48

                  As discussed in Chapter 13, some allergic reactions can be life-threatening
                  and some foods can cause major health issues for children, it is vitally
                  important that everyone in the early care and education program that
                  prepares or serves food is aware of these and protects children from
                  consuming food that can hurt them.

Vegetarian Menu Planning

A vegetarian diet does not include any meat, poultry, or seafood. It is a meal plan made up of
foods that come mostly from plants. These include:

     Vegetables
     Fruits
     Whole grains
     Legumes
     Seeds
     Nuts
     May include eggs and/or milk if ovo-lacto vegetarian

A vegetarian diet contains no animal proteins. A semi-vegetarian diet is a meal plan that
contains little animal protein, but mostly plant-based foods. Vegetarians DO NOT eat:

     Fowl
     Seafood
     Beef
     Pork
     Lamb
     Other animal meats, such as bison, or exotic meats like ostrich or alligator

Vegetarians also do not eat products containing gelatin or rennin (an enzyme found in calf's
stomachs that is used to produce many cheeses).

                               Figure 15.15 - A tofu taco could be made vegan or vegetarian.52

Here are the different types of vegetarian diets:
     Vegan: Includes only plant-based foods. No animal proteins or animal by-products such
         as eggs, milk, or honey.
     Lacto-vegetarian: Includes plant foods plus some or all dairy products.
     Lacto-ovo vegetarian: Includes plant foods, dairy products, and eggs.

     Semi- or partial vegetarian: Includes plant foods and may include chicken or fish, dairy
         products, and eggs. It does not include red meat.

     Pescatarian: Includes plant foods and seafood.

Vegetarian diets that include some dairy products and eggs have all the nutrition needed. But
the more restrictive the diet, the harder it can be to get certain nutrients.

When a vegetarian's diet avoids most or all animal foods, close attention is required to make
sure there is adequate intake of all of the following nutrients.

Vitamin B12: This vitamin is needed to help prevent anemia. Eggs and dairy foods have the
most B12, so vegans may have a hard time getting enough. Sources of B12 include:

     Eggs
     Milk, yogurt, low-fat cheese, cottage cheese, and other dairy products
     Foods that have B12 added to them (fortified), such as cereal and soy products
     Nutritional yeast
     Seafood such as clams, salmon, and tuna (this only applies to pescetarians and semi-

         vegetarians)

Vitamin D: This vitamin is needed for bone health. Vitamin D can be produced from sun
exposure, but sun exposure should be limited due to skin cancer concerns. So vegetarians most
likely will not be able to get enough from sun exposure. Sources of vitamin D include:

     Fatty fish, such as sardines, salmon, and mackerel (this only applies to pescatarians and
         semi-vegetarians)

     Egg yolks
     Foods that are fortified with vitamin D, such as orange juice, cow's milk, soy milk, rice

         milk, and cereals

Zinc: Zinc is important for the immune system and cell growth, especially in teens. The body
does not absorb zinc from plant foods as well as from meat and other animal foods. Sources of
zinc include:

     Beans and legumes, such as chickpeas, kidney beans, and baked beans
     Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, peanuts, and cashews
     Seafood, such as oysters, crab, and lobster (this only applies to pescatarians and semi-

         vegetarians)
     Yogurt and cheese
     Foods fortified with zinc, such as milk and cereals

Iron: Iron is needed for red blood cells. The body does not absorb the type of iron found from
plant foods as well as from the type found in meat and other animal foods. Sources of iron
include:

     Beans and legumes, such as white beans, lentils, and kidney beans
     Green vegetables, such as broccoli, spinach, kale, and collard greens

     Dried fruit, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots
     Whole grains
     Foods fortified with iron, such as cereals and breads

Eating foods that are high in vitamin C at the same meal as iron-rich foods increase iron
absorption. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Foods high in vitamin C include tomatoes,
potatoes, citrus fruits, bell peppers, and strawberries.

Calcium: Foods high in calcium help keep bones strong. Dairy products have the highest
amount of calcium. If a vegetarian does not eat dairy, it can be hard to get enough. Oxalates, a
substance found in plant foods inhibits calcium absorption. Foods that are high in both oxalates
and calcium are not good sources of calcium. Examples include spinach, Swiss chard, and beet
greens.
Good sources of calcium include:

     Sardines and canned salmon with bones (this only applies to pescetarians and semi-
         vegetarians)

     Dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and cheese
     Green vegetables, such as collard greens, kale, bok choy, and broccoli
     Oranges and figs
     Tofu
     Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and white beans
     Foods fortified with calcium, such as cereal, orange juice, and soy, almond and rice milk

Omega-3 fatty acids: Omega-3s are important for heart and brain health. Sources of omega-3s
include:

     Fatty fish, such as halibut, mackerel, salmon, herring, and sardines (this only applies to
         pescatarians and semi-vegetarians)

     Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, ground flaxseed, canola oil, chia seeds
     Soybeans and soy oil
     Foods fortified with omega-3s, such as bread, eggs, juice, and milk

Protein: If you eat fish and/or eggs and dairy getting enough protein will not be a concern for
most people. Protein sources also include:

     Soy foods, such as soy nuts, soy milk, tempeh and tofu.
     Seitan (made of gluten).
     Vegetarian meat substitutes. Just watch for products that are high in sodium.
     Legumes, beans, and lentils.
     Nuts, nut butters, seeds, and whole grains.
     Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese.

These foods do not need to be combined in the same meal to get enough protein.53

The Dietary Guidelines 2015-2020 includes a Healthy Vegetarian Pattern that was adapted from
the Healthy U.S.-Style Pattern, modifying amounts recommended from some food groups. The
current Healthy Vegetarian Pattern includes changes in food group composition and amounts,
based on assessing the food choices of vegetarians.54

                   Tips for Menu Planning for Children with Vegetarian Diets

                       When following a vegetarian diet, keep in mind the following:
                            Provide different kinds of foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans,
                                nuts, seeds, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy and eggs if
                                their diet includes these.
                            Choose fortified foods, such as cereals, breads, soy or almond milk,
                                and fruits juices to get a full range of nutrients.
                            Limit foods that are high in sugar, salt (sodium), and fat.
                            Include a protein source with all meals.
                            Learn to read the Nutrition Facts Label on food packages. The label
                                tells you the ingredients and nutrition contents of the food product.
                            If you follow a more restrictive diet, you may want to work with a
                                dietitian to make sure you are getting enough nutrients.

                       Note: Vegetarian children may need to take supplements at home if their
                       diet lacks certain vitamins and minerals.55

                Pause to Reflect

                  What familiarity do you have with any of the varieties of food preferences

Family Style Meal Service

Currently, traditional family style meal service is the recommended approach to serving meals
in preschool settings. Using this approach, all foods on the menu are served at the same time in
serving bowls that are passed around the table, and children self-serve the amounts they
desire. There are a number of potential advantages to traditional family-style meal service
including allowing children the opportunity to self-regulate consumption (match food selection
with hunger level).56

                             Figure 15.16 - Family style meals have many benefits for children.57

This approach to mealtime creates a number of healthy habits that are important to the growth
and development of children at any age. Children tend to eat more healthy foods if they see
their friends try it. They learn skills such as taking turns, sharing, and teamwork.

Family style dining opens up opportunities for conversation, which increases vocabulary,
promotes proper use of language and interaction with friends.

There are even more benefits that support healthy growth. Children learn:
     portion sizes for each food group
     to recognize when they are hungry or satisfied
     how to identify healthy foods and where they come from
     to improve fine motor skills

Children are not the only ones who benefit. Providers get a better grasp of food costs, get help
with mealtime service and, with less food being wasted, they save money.58

                   Tips for Family Style Dining

                            Start with the right equipment. When purchasing serving dishes,
                                utensils and other place settings, keep in mind that they need to be
                                kid-friendly and sized for little hands to maneuver

                            Remember each child's skill level when choosing your menu. Finger
                                foods and foods that are easy to navigate with a child-size fork or
                                spoon are easiest to self-serve for younger children.

                            Have multiple sets of utensils and serving spoons in case someone
                                drops one on the floor.

                            Give each child a task to help set the table. One child can set the
                                plates, one can place the cups and so on. Children have a sense of
                                pride and belonging when they have a contributing role.

                            Offer a variety of familiar foods and don't forget to introduce new
                                foods. Children are more willing to try something new when they
                                serve themselves.

                            Reserve extra servings for second helpings or in case the bowl of
                                food gets contaminated.

                            Provide a trash can for children in which to dispose napkins and
                                uneaten food. Provide a tub for them to place dirty dishes after they
                                scrape them off.

                            Keep cleaning supplies nearby. Spills will happen. Be patient and
                                use this opportunity as a teaching moment on how to clean-up.

                            Most importantly, eat with the children. Children learn from good
                                role models. Sitting with them while everyone eats also allows you
                                to start positive mealtime conversations.59

Food from Home

Some early care and education programs depend on families to provide some or all of children's
meals and snacks. According to Sweitzer et al (2011), "[o]bservations of lunches of three to five
year old children attending fulltime childcare support the need for parent education about
packing healthy lunches." They site several studies that show inadequate servings of fruit and
vegetables and foods that fail to meet the Daily Reference Intakes for essential nutrients in
foods brought from home. They also site several studies that demonstrated that knowledge and
attitudes about nutrition were positively linked to serving fruits and vegetables to children. As
they stated, parents report barriers to supporting their young children's healthy eating.
"Common barriers for consumption of fruits and vegetables are the child's preferences,
preparation time involved, and higher cost of those items."60

Food brought from home, should be labeled with the child's name and date and stored in the
refrigerator when needed. When prepared and served to children it is important to follow food
safety practices (discussed in the next section of the book). Foods for one child should never be
given to another child.62

                   Tips for Supporting Families in Providing Nutritious Food From
                   Home

                       In the Sweitzer et al (2011) study, parents were interviewed about how
                       early care and education programs could help families provide better
                       nutrition for their children. Here are some tips based on their findings:

                            Provide regular written information to families about nutrients and
                                their importance for health

                            Provide convenient and affordable recipes and tips for families
                            Foster connection and interaction between families through events,

                                support groups, and recipe exchanges
                            Consider including nutrition as a topic of workshops for families
                            Connect with community resources and local markets to expand

                                opportunities and information for families
                            Remember to be budget-friendly with resources and recipes

Food Safety

Even the most nutritious, visually appealing, affordable, delicious food won't keep children
healthy if it isn't stored, prepared, and served safely. Let's look at recommendations for food
safety in early care and education programs based on the California Department of Social
Services and Child Care Advocate Program's Child Care Center Self-Assessment Guide - Safe
Food Handling and Preparation: Licensing Requirements and Best Practices.

       Figure 15.18 - Having a kitchen with appropriate equipment that is easy to keep sanitary is important.64

Safe Shopping

When purchasing food for an early care and education program:
     Do not buy or use meat, poultry, and meat products unless they have been inspected.
     Do not use or buy home-canned food from outside sources, food from dented, rusted,
         bulging, or leaking cans, or food from cans without labels.
     Do not buy or use raw or non-pasteurized milk or milk products, or non-pasteurized
         juices.
     Place frozen food and perishables such as meat, poultry, or fish in plastic bags and put
         them in the shopping cart last.
     Do not buy torn or leaking packages.
     Do not buy foods past "sell-by" or expiration dates.65

Storage Before Preparation

To keep foods safe from spoilage and contamination before you prepare them:
     Keep your refrigerator and freezer clean and in safe condition.
     Store soaps, detergents, cleaning compounds, or similar substances away from food
         supplies to prevent accidental poisoning, potential leakage problems, and
         contamination. Always keep these substances away from children.

 Do not store pesticides and other similar toxic substances where you store, cook, or
    prepare food, or where you store kitchen equipment or utensils. Always keep these
    substances away from children.

 Unpack perishable foods from the car first and put them in the refrigerator right away.
 Keep the refrigerator temperature at 40 F or less, and the freezer at 0 F, to slow the

    growth of most bacteria and keep them from multiplying.
 Check the temperature of your refrigerator and freezer daily with an appliance

    thermometer.
 Keep all food stored in the refrigerator and freezer covered, wrapped, stored in airtight

    containers, or otherwise protected from contamination.
 Wrap raw meat, poultry, and seafood securely to prevent raw juices from contaminating

    other foods. Store them in the meat drawer or coldest section of the refrigerator or
    freezer.
 Do not store perishable foods, such as eggs, in the refrigerator door. The temperature of
    storage bins in the door fluctuates more than the temperature in the cabinet.
 Cook or freeze fresh poultry, fish, ground meat, and mixed meats within 2 days after you
    buy them. Cook or freeze other beef, veal, lamb, or pork within 3 to 5 days.
 Use the cold storage chart in Table 15.9 for guidelines of how long different food
    products can be safely stored in the refrigerator and freezer.
 Store food that does not need refrigeration in a way to keep insects and rodents from
    entering the food. For example, keep storage containers off the floor.
 Store dry, bulk foods that are not in their original, unopened containers off the floor in
    clean metal, glass, or food-grade plastic containers with tight-fitting covers. Label and
    date the containers.
 Keep storerooms clean, dry, well ventilated, and cool (about 60 F).
 These storage guidelines for home-refrigerated foods will keep them from spoiling or
    becoming dangerous to eat. The guidelines for freezer storage are for quality only.
    Frozen foods remain safe indefinitely.66

Preparing

Safe food preparation practices include:
     Keep all kitchen equipment, dishes, and utensils clean and in safe condition.

417 | H e a l t h , S a f e t y , a n d N u t r i t i o n i n E a r l y C h i l d h o o d E d u c a t i o n
     Wash dishes and eating and serving utensils in a dishwasher (reach a temperature of
         165 F during the washing or drying cycle) or by hand with a sanitizing agent.

     Keep the food preparation area separate from the eating, napping, play, toilet and
         bathroom areas, and from areas where animals are kept. Never use the food
         preparation area as a passageway while food is being prepared.

     Make sure that all staff wash their hands before preparing food, serving and eating
         meals and snacks, and after toileting, diapering, and outdoor activities. The best way to
         combat the spread of communicable disease or germs is by careful handwashing with
         liquid soap, rinsing under running water, and drying with paper towels.

     Do not wash hands in food preparation sinks to prevent contamination of food.
     Keep all surfaces that come in contact with food (including tables and countertops),

         floors, and shelving in good repair. Use smooth and nonporous materials that are easily
         cleaned and sanitized.
     Use cutting boards that can be disinfected (such as glass, Formica, or plastic). Always
         clean them with soap and hot water after each use.
     Do not use cutting boards with crevices and cuts because they can hide food material
         that can grow bacteria and contaminate the next food cut on the surface.

        Figure 15.19 - A glass cutting board doesn't develop cuts and crevices and can easily be disinfected.68

     Always clean and sanitize cutting boards, knives, and other utensils after they come in
         contact with raw meat, poultry, and seafood. Use one cutting board for raw meat
         products and another for salads and ready-to-eat foods to prevent cross-contamination
         of bacteria from one food to another.

     Air-dry hand-washed dishes to eliminate recontamination from hands or towels.
     Use dishes with smooth, hard-glazed surfaces that do not have cracks or chips.
     Clean and sanitize table surfaces before and after use.
     Sanitize kitchen dishcloths and sponges often because these materials can hide bacteria

         and promote their growth.
     Wash kitchen towels and cloths often in hot water in the washing machine.
     Clean the can opener blade after each use.

     Keep garbage in a covered container, away from children. Empty the garbage every day
         to reduce odors, control insects and rodents, and protect children and the child care
         center from contamination.

     Occasionally sanitize the kitchen sink, drain, disposal, and connecting pipe by pouring a
         solution of one teaspoon of chlorine bleach in one quart of water or a commercial
         cleaning solution down the drain.

     Wash fresh fruits and vegetables with water, and soap and scrub brush when needed, to
         reduce or eliminate any pesticides or residues.

     Do not allow infants and toddlers in the food preparation area to protect them from
         kitchen hazards.69

Thawing

To protect against foodborne illness, follow the following practices when thawing frozen foods
     Do not thaw meat, poultry, and fish products on the counter or sink because harmful
         bacteria can grow at room temperature.
     Thaw food in the refrigerator or microwave oven.
     Immediately cook food thawed in the microwave.
     Use defrosted food (cooked or frozen) within 1 to 2 days.70

Cooking

Foods must be cooked at high enough temperatures and for long enough to kill any possible
microorganisms they may be contaminated with. Here are some general guidelines

     Never serve raw or slightly cooked eggs. Cook eggs until the white is firm and the yolk
         begins to harden. Substitute pasteurized eggs for raw eggs if sampling homemade
         dough, cake batter, or eating other foods made with raw eggs such as ice cream,
         mayonnaise, and eggnog.

     Use a meat thermometer to determine the temperature in the thickest part of the
         meat.71 Cook all food to these minimum internal temperatures provided in Table 15.8 as
         measured with a food thermometer before removing food from the heat source. For
         reasons of personal preference, consumers may choose to cook food to higher
         temperatures.72

Food Service

To continue to protect against foodborne illness and prevent injury, food must be served
following food safety guidelines, including:

     Keep hot foods hot (over 140 F) and cold food cold (under 40 F) until they are eaten or
         cooked.

     Carry perishable picnic food in a cooler with a cold pack or ice. Store the cooler in the
         shade and open it as little as possible.

     Do not leave cooked, perishable foods, including hot foods such as soups or sauces, out
         for more than two hours after cooking (one hour in temperatures over 90 F). The
         bacteria that cause foodborne illness grow rapidly at room temperature.

     Never offer foods that are round, hard, small, thick and sticky, smooth, or slippery to
         children under four years of age because they can cause choking. Hot dogs (sliced into
         rounds), whole grapes, hard candy, nuts, seeds, raw peas, dried fruit, pretzels, chips,
         peanuts, popcorn, marshmallows, spoonfuls of peanut butter, and chunks of meat,
         which are larger than can be swallowed whole are examples of foods that can cause
         choking.

     Cut food into small pieces for infants ( inch) and toddlers ( inch).
     Do not use microwave ovens for warming infant bottles and infant food because the

         microwave can heat liquids or food unevenly and to scalding temperatures. The milk or
         formula in a microwaved bottle may reach a higher temperature than the outside of the
         bottle.74

Handling Leftovers

All food that has been served to children must be discarded after the meal or snack. If a
program chooses to save food that has not been served to children, follow these guidelines:

     Divide large amounts of leftovers (for example, large cuts of meat or poultry) into
         smaller portions and place them in shallow containers before refrigerating for faster
         cooling.

     Use refrigerated leftovers within three to four days or discard them.
     Bring sauces, soups, and gravy to a boil when reheating. Heat other leftovers to 165 F.75

                Pause to Reflect

                   What are some new things you learned about food safety? Do you have
                   any questions about food safety that weren't addressed in this section? If
                   so, where could you find answers to them?

Summary

When staff in early care and education programs have an understanding of the CACFP meal
patterns and health sources for all of the food groups, they have the foundation to plan menus
that consider cost, variety, aesthetics, and balance. They can also support families in providing
healthy food to their children. And with a solid grounding in food safety policies and practices
they can buy, store, prepare, cook, and serve food to children safely.

                 Information

Bronchitis (Chest Cold)

A chest cold occurs when the airways of the lungs swell and produce mucus in the lungs. That's
what produces the cough. A chest cold, often called acute bronchitis, lasts less than 3 weeks
and is the most common type of bronchitis.

            Figure M.1 - Swelling of airways in the lungs produce mucus in the lungs and makes you cough.4

Acute bronchitis is usually caused by a virus and often occurs after an upper respiratory
infection. Bacteria can sometimes cause acute bronchitis, but even in these cases, antibiotics
are NOT recommended and will not help an infected person get better.
Symptoms of acute bronchitis last less than 3 weeks and can include:

     Coughing with or without mucus
     Soreness in the chest
     Feeling tired (fatigue)
     Mild headache
     Mild body aches
     Sore throat5

from child care.

Chickenpox

Chickenpox is a highly contagious disease caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It can cause
an itchy, blister-like rash. The rash first appears on the chest, back, and face, and then spreads
over the entire body, causing between 250 and 500 itchy blisters. Chickenpox can be serious,
especially in babies, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and people with a weakened
immune system. The best way to prevent chickenpox is to get the chickenpox vaccine.6

The classic symptom of chickenpox is a rash that turns into itchy, fluid-filled blisters that

eventually turn into scabs. The rash may first show up on the chest, back, and face, and then
spread over the entire body, including inside the mouth, eyelids, or genital area. It usually takes
about one week for all of the blisters to become scabs.

                                      Figure M.2 - an unvaccinated child with chickenpox7

Other typical symptoms that may begin to appear 1-2 days before rash include:
     fever
     tiredness
     loss of appetite
     headache8

The virus spreads mainly through close contact with someone who has chickenpox (or shingles).
It takes about 2 weeks (from 10 to 21 days) after exposure to a person with chickenpox or

1 to 2 days before rash onset until all the chickenpox lesions have crusted (scabbed).9
"Children/staff with chickenpox should be excluded for six days after the rash first appears or
until all blisters are crusted over and dry."10

Conjuctivitis (Pink Eye)

Pink eye, or conjunctivitis, is one of the most common and treatable eye conditions in the
world. It can affect both children and adults. It is an inflammation of the thin, clear tissue that
lines the inside of the eyelid (conjunctiva) and the white part of the eyeball. This inflammation
makes blood vessels more visible and gives the eye a pink or reddish color.

                         Figure M.3. - A healthy eye compared to one infected with conjunctivitis.11

The symptoms may vary, but usually include:
     Redness or swelling of the white of the eye or inside the eyelids
     Increased amount of tears
     Eye discharge which may be clear, yellow, white, or green
     Itchy, irritated, and/or burning eyes
     Gritty feeling in the eye
     Crusting of the eyelids or lashes
     Contact lenses that feel uncomfortable and/or do not stay in place on the eye

There are four main causes of pink eye:
     Viruses
     Bacteria
     Allergens (like pet dander or dust mites)

     Irritants (like smog or swimming pool chlorine) that infect or irritate the eye and eyelid
         lining

It can be difficult to determine the exact cause of pink eye because some signs and symptoms
may be the same no matter the cause. When pink eye is caused by a virus or bacteria, it is very
contagious. It can spread easily and quickly from person to person (through contact with the
discharge from the infected eye). Pink eye caused by allergens or irritants is not contagious.12

If a child has discharge from the eye, they should be excluded from care until they have been
examine and cleared for re-admission by a health care provider "with or without treatment as
determined by the health provider...They do not need to be sent home in the middle of the day.
Children with conjunctivitis caused by allergies need not be excluded."13

Fifth Disease (Slapped Cheek)

Fifth disease is a mild rash illness caused by parvovirus B19. It is more common in children than
adults. A person usually gets sick with fifth disease within 14 days after getting infected with
parvovirus B19.

The symptoms of fifth disease are usually mild and may include
     fever
     runny nose
     headache
     rash (on face and body)

Parvovirus B19--which causes fifth disease--spreads through respiratory secretions, such as
saliva, sputum, or nasal mucus, when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You are most
contagious when it seems like you have "just a fever and/or cold" and before you get the rash
or joint pain and swelling. After you get the rash you are not likely to be contagious. Fifth
disease is usually mild and will go away on its own. Children and adults who are otherwise
healthy usually recover completely.15 "A child who has been diagnosed with fifth disease need
not be excluded from child care."16

Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease

Hand-foot-mouth disease is a common viral infection that most often begins in the throat.
Hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD) is most commonly caused by a virus called coxsackievirus
A16. Children under age 10 are most often affected.

Symptoms of HFMD include:
     Fever
     Headache
     Loss of appetite
     Rash with very small blisters on the hands, feet, and diaper area that may be tender or
         painful when pressed
     Sore throat
     Ulcers in the throat (including tonsils), mouth, and tongue

                                                 Figure M.6 - Ulcers in the mouth18

The virus can spread from person-to-person through tiny, air droplets that are released when
the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose. You can catch hand-foot-mouth disease if:

     A person with the infection sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you.
     You touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated

         by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.
     You touch stools or fluid from the blisters of an infected person.

The virus is most easily spread the first week a person has the disease. The time between
contact with the virus and the start of symptoms is about 3 to 7 days.19

"Children with hand-foot-and-mouth disease do not need to stay home as long as they are
feeling well enough to participate...Children with hand-foot-and-mouth disease usually do not
need treatment and will get better on their own within a week."20

Hepatitis A

Hepatitis A is a highly contagious liver infection caused by the hepatitis A virus. It can range
from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months. Although rare,
hepatitis A can cause death in some people.

                   Pin It!

                       What is the difference between hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C?
                       Hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are liver infections caused by three
                       different viruses. Although each can cause similar symptoms, they have
                       different modes of transmission and can affect the liver differently. Hepatitis
                       A is usually a short-term infection and does not become chronic. Hepatitis B
                       and hepatitis C can also begin as short-term, acute infections, but in some

                       term liver problems. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and hepatitis
                       B; however, there is no vaccine for hepatitis C.

Most children younger than age 6 do not have symptoms when they have hepatitis A. Older
children and adults typically have symptoms. If symptoms develop, they usually start appearing
4 weeks after exposure, but can occur as early as 2 and as late as 7 weeks after exposure.
Symptoms usually develop over a period of several days and can include:

     Fever
     Fatigue
     Loss of appetite
     Nausea
     Vomiting
     Abdominal pain
     Dark urine
     Diarrhea
     Clay-colored stools
     Joint pain
     Jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes)

Hepatitis A usually spreads when a person unknowingly ingests the virus from objects, food, or
drinks contaminated by small, undetected amounts of stool from an infected person. A person
can transmit the virus to others up to 2 weeks before symptoms appear.21

A child diagnosed with hepatitis A should be excluded from care until one week after the onset
of symptoms.22

Impetigo

Impetigo is a common contagious skin infection that may be caused by two germs--
Streptococcus pyogenes and Staphylococcus aureus. Recommended treatment depends on
which germs are causing impetigo. With the right treatment, impetigo usually goes away within
two to three weeks.

The signs of impetigo include red sores that pop easily and leave a yellow crust, fluid-filled
blisters, itchy rash, skin lesions, and swollen lymph nodes. The sores can be uncomfortable and
painful.

Impetigo is typically spread through skin-to-skin contact with an individual who has impetigo,
but it can also be spread by contact with objects someone with impetigo has touched (for
example, towels, blankets, and toys).

It is recommended that children with impetigo be excluded from care until 24 hours after
treatment is started.24

Measles

Measles is a serious illness caused by a virus. The virus can last for one to two weeks. It is rare
today because most children are immunized against it. However, the number of diagnosed
cases has grown across the country. This increase is related to children not being vaccinated.

Measles starts with a fever that can get very high. Some of the other symptoms that may occur
are:

     Fatigue
     Cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes
     Rash of tiny, red spots that usually lasts five to six days, (the rash begins at the hairline,

         moves to the face and upper neck, and proceeds down the body)

is very contagious from five days before until four days after the start of the rash. After
exposure, it can take one to two weeks for the person to get sick.

Measles can spread by being in a room with a person with measles and up to two hours after
that person is gone. It can also spread from an infected person even before they have a measles
rash. Almost everyone who has not had the measles vaccine will get measles if they are
exposed to the measles virus. People who have had measles or were immunized usually can't
catch it again.

Children diagnosed with measles should remain out of the center until a doctor determines the
child is no longer infectious. Any unimmunized children or staff should be excluded from the
program for two weeks after the rash appears in the last case of measles at the facility.26

Meningitis

Meningitis is inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord, called the
meninges. There are several types of meningitis. The most common is viral meningitis. You get
it when a virus enters the body through the nose or mouth and travels to the brain. Bacterial
meningitis is rare, but can be deadly. It usually starts with bacteria that cause a cold-like
infection. It can cause stroke, hearing loss, and brain damage. It can also harm other
organs. Pneumococcal infections and meningococcal infections are the most common causes of
bacterial meningitis.

Other rare forms of meningitis include, fungal meningitis, parasitic meningitis, amebic
meningitis, and non-infectious meningitis.27

feel better with no fever, or when the health care provider determines the disease is no longer
contagious."28

Molluscum Contagiosum

Molluscum contagiosum is an infection caused by a poxvirus (molluscum contagiosum virus).
The result of the infection is usually a benign, mild skin disease characterized by lesions
(growths) that may appear anywhere on the body. Within 6-12 months, Molluscum
contagiosum typically resolves without scarring but may take as long as 4 years.

The lesions, known as Mollusca, are small, raised, and usually white, pink, or flesh-colored with
a dimple or pit in the center. They often have a pearly appearance. They're usually smooth and
firm. In most people, the lesions range from about the size of a pinhead to as large as a pencil
eraser (2 to 5 millimeters in diameter). They may become itchy, sore, red, and/or swollen.

Figure M.9 - These are classical appearing Molluscum. The large lesion in the center is one that has been picked and
                                  scratched and shows evidence of low-grade inflammation.29

Mollusca may occur anywhere on the body including the face, neck, arms, legs, abdomen, and
genital area, alone or in groups. The lesions are rarely found on the palms of the hands or the
soles of the feet.30

"Children with this rash should not be excluded from ECE settings. Molluscum is a nuisance, not
a serious health problem."31

Mumps

Mumps is best known for the puffy cheeks and tender, swollen jaw that it causes. It is one of
the diseases that is vaccine preventable. This is a result of swollen salivary glands under the
ears on one or both sides, often referred to as parotitis.

             Figure M.10 - This photo of a young child with mumps shows the characteristic jaw swelling.32

Other symptoms that might begin a few days before parotitis include:
     Fever
     Headache
     Muscle aches
     Tiredness
     Loss of appetite

Symptoms typically appear 16-18 days after infection, but this period can range from 12-25
days after infection.
Some people who get mumps have very mild symptoms (like a cold), or no symptoms at all and
may not know they have the disease.
In rare cases, mumps can cause more severe complications.
Most people with mumps recover completely within two weeks.33
Mumps is a contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads through direct contact with saliva
or respiratory droplets from the mouth, nose, or throat. An infected person can likely spread

mumps from a few days before their salivary glands begin to swell to up to five days after the
swelling begins. A person with mumps should limit their contact with others during this time.
For example, stay home from school and do not attend social events.34

Norovirus

Norovirus is the most common cause of vomiting and diarrhea, and foodborne illness.

The most common symptoms of norovirus are:
     diarrhea
     vomiting
     nausea
     stomach pain

Other symptoms includes fever, headache, and body aches.

Norovirus causes inflammation of the stomach or intestines. This is called acute gastroenteritis.
A person usually develops symptoms 12 to 48 hours after being exposed to norovirus. Most
people with norovirus illness get better within 1 to 3 days.

If you have norovirus illness, you can feel extremely ill, and vomit or have diarrhea many times
a day. This can lead to dehydration, especially in young children, older adults, and people with
other illnesses.35

You can get norovirus by accidentally getting tiny particles of feces or vomit from an infected
person in your mouth. This can happen through contaminated food and water, touching
contaminated surfaces and then putting your fingers in the mouth, and having direct contact
with someone that is infected with norovirus.

If you get norovirus illness, you can shed billions of norovirus particles that you can't see
without a microscope. Only a few norovirus particles can make other people sick. You are most
contagious

     when you have symptoms of norovirus illness, especially vomiting, and
     during the first few days after you recover from norovirus illness.

However, studies have shown that you can still spread norovirus for two weeks or more after
you feel better.36 Children that are infected with norovirus should be excluded for 48 hours
after becoming symptom free.37

Pertussis

Pertussis is a vaccine preventable respiratory illness commonly known as whooping cough. It is
a very contagious disease caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. These
bacteria attach to the cilia (tiny, hair-like extensions) that line part of the upper respiratory
system. The bacteria release toxins (poisons), which damage the cilia and cause airways to
swell.38

It can cause serious illness in babies, children, teens, and adults. Symptoms of pertussis usually
develop within 5 to 10 days after you are exposed. Sometimes pertussis symptoms do not
develop for as long as 3 weeks.

The disease usually starts with cold-like symptoms and maybe a mild cough or fever. In babies,
the cough can be minimal or not even there. Babies may have a symptom known as "apnea."
Apnea is a pause in the child's breathing pattern. Pertussis is most dangerous for babies. About
half of babies younger than 1 year who get the disease need care in the hospital.

Early symptoms can last for 1 to 2 weeks and usually include:
     Runny nose
     Low-grade fever (generally minimal throughout the course of the disease)
     Mild, occasional cough
     Apnea - a pause in breathing (in babies)

Pertussis in its early stages appears to be nothing more than the common cold. Therefore,
healthcare professionals often do not suspect or diagnose it until the more severe symptoms
appear.

After 1 to 2 weeks and as the disease progresses, the traditional symptoms of pertussis may
appear and include:

     Paroxysms (fits) of many, rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched "whoop" sound
         (babies with pertussis may not cough at all)

     Vomiting (throwing up) during or after coughing fits

Pertussis can cause violent and rapid coughing, over and over, until the air is gone from your
lungs. When there is no more air in the lungs, you are forced to inhale with a loud "whooping"
sound. This extreme coughing can cause you to throw up and be very tired. Although you are
often exhausted after a coughing fit, you usually appear fairly well in-between. Coughing fits

generally become more common and bad as the illness continues, and can occur more often at
night. The coughing fits can go on for up to 10 weeks or more.
Recovery from pertussis can happen slowly. The cough becomes milder and less common.
However, coughing fits can return with other respiratory infections for many months after the
pertussis infection started.41

Children who receive antibiotics should be excluded for 5 days of treatment. Children who do
not receive treatment, should stay home for 21 days from the onset of symptoms.42

Pinworms

A pinworm ("threadworm") is a small, thin, white roundworm (nematode) called Enterobius
vermicularis that sometimes lives in the colon and rectum of humans. Pinworms are about the
length of a staple. While an infected person sleeps, female pinworms leave the intestine
through the anus and deposit their eggs on the surrounding skin.

                                          Figure M.13 - A pinworm and pinworm eggs 43

Pinworm infection (called enterobiasis or oxyuriasis) causes itching around the anus which can
lead to difficulty sleeping and restlessness. Symptoms are caused by the female pinworm laying
her eggs. Symptoms of pinworm infection usually are mild and some infected people have no
symptoms.

Pinworm infection often occurs in more than one person in household and institutional
settings. Child care centers often are the site of cases of pinworm infection.

People become infected, usually unknowingly, by swallowing (ingesting) infective pinworm eggs
that are on fingers, under fingernails, or on clothing, bedding, and other contaminated objects
and surfaces. Because of their small size, pinworm eggs sometimes can become airborne and

only until their initial dose of treatment has begun.45

RSV

Respiratory syncytial (sin-SISH-uhl) virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus that usually
causes mild, cold-like symptoms. Most people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be serious,
especially for infants and older adults. In fact, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis
(inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in
children younger than 1 year of age in the United States. It is also a significant cause of
respiratory illness in older adults.46

Symptoms of RSV infection usually include
     Runny nose
     Decrease in appetite
     Coughing
     Sneezing
     Fever
     Wheezing

These symptoms usually appear in stages and not all at once. In very young infants with RSV,
the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and breathing difficulties.

                                         Image M.14 - This infant has an RSV infection.47

RSV can also cause more severe infections such as bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small
airways in the lung, and pneumonia, an infection of the lungs. It is the most common cause of
bronchiolitis and pneumonia in children younger than 1 year of age.

Almost all children will have had an RSV infection by their second birthday. People infected with
RSV usually show symptoms within 4 to 6 days after getting infected. Most RSV infections go
away on their own in a week or two.48

RSV can spread when an infected person coughs or sneezes. You can get infected if you get
droplets from the cough or sneeze in your eyes, nose, or mouth, or if you touch a surface that
has the virus on it, like a doorknob, and then touch your face before washing your hands.
Additionally, it can spread through direct contact with the virus, like kissing the face of a child
with RSV.

People infected with RSV are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days. However, some infants, and
people with weakened immune systems, can continue to spread the virus even after they stop
showing symptoms, for as long as 4 weeks. Children are often exposed to and infected with RSV
outside the home, such as in school or child-care centers. They can then transmit the virus to
other members of the family.

RSV can survive for many hours on hard surfaces such as tables and crib rails. It typically lives on
soft surfaces such as tissues and hands for shorter amounts of time.49

"Frequently, a child is infectious before symptoms appear. Therefore, an infected child does not
need to be excluded from child care unless he or she is not well enough to participate in usual
activities."50

Ringworm

Ringworm is a common skin infection that is caused by a fungus. It's called "ringworm" because
it can cause a circular rash (shaped like a ring) that is usually red and itchy. Anyone can get
ringworm. The fungi that cause this infection can live on skin, surfaces, and on household items
such as clothing, towels, and bedding.

Ringworm goes by many names. The medical terms are "tinea" or "dermatophytosis." Other
names for ringworm are based on its location on the body - for example, ringworm on the feet
is also called "athlete's foot."51

Ringworm can affect skin on almost any part of the body as well as fingernails and toenails. The
symptoms of ringworm often depend on which part of the body is infected, but they generally
include:

     Itchy skin
     Ring-shaped rash
     Red, scaly, cracked skin
     Hair loss

Symptoms typically appear between 4 and 14 days after the skin comes in contact with the
fungi that cause ringworm. 53

The fungi that cause ringworm can live on skin and in the environment. There are three main
ways that ringworm can spread:

    1. From a person who has ringworm
    2. From an animal that has ringworm.
    3. From the environment.54

"There is no need to exclude children/staff with these common, mild infections once treatment
has been started. Refer persons with a suspicious rash to their health care providers for
appropriate diagnosis and treatment and allow them to return as soon as treatment has
begun."55

Roseola

Roseola is a viral infection that commonly affects infants and young children. It involves a
pinkish-red skin rash and high fever.

Roseola is common in children ages 3 months to 4 years, and most common in those ages 6
months to 1 year.
It is caused by a virus called human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), although similar syndromes are
possible with other viruses.
The time between becoming infected and the beginning of symptoms (incubation period) is 5 to
15 days.
The first symptoms include:

     Eye redness
     Irritability
     Runny nose
     Sore throat
     High fever, that comes on quickly and may be as high as 105캟 (40.5캜) and can last 3 to

         7 days
About 2 to 4 days after becoming sick, the child's fever lowers and a rash appears. This rash
most often:

     Starts on the middle of the body and spreads to the arms, legs, neck, and face
     Is pink or rose-colored
     Has small sores that are slightly raised
The rash lasts from a few hours to 2 to 3 days. It usually does not itch.

                               Figure M.16 - an infant with the rash characteristic of roseola.56

without complications.57 "A child with fever and rash should be excluded from child care until

is still present, provided that the child feels well and is able to participate fully in all activities."58

Rotavirus

Rotavirus is most common in your infants and young children. Children, even those who are
vaccinated, may get infected and sick from rotavirus more than once. That is because neither
natural infection with rotavirus nor vaccination provides full protection from future infections.
Children who are not vaccinated usually have more severe symptoms the first time they get
rotavirus disease. Vaccinated children are less likely to get sick from rotavirus.59

Symptoms usually start about 2 days after a person is exposed to rotavirus. Vomiting and
watery diarrhea can last 3 to 8 days. Additional symptoms may include loss of appetite and
dehydration (loss of body fluids), which can be especially dangerous for infants and young
children.

Symptoms of dehydration include:
     decreased urination
     dry mouth and throat
     feeling dizzy when standing up
     crying with few or no tears and
     unusual sleepiness or fussiness.60

People who are infected with rotavirus shed the virus in their stool (poop). This is how the virus
gets into the environment and can infect other people (through contaminated food, surfaces,
or unwashed hands). People shed rotavirus the most, and are more likely to infect others, when
they have symptoms and during the first 3 days after they recover. People with rotavirus can
also infect others before they have symptoms.61

"Children with rotavirus should be excluded from child care if the stool cannot be contained by
diapers or toilet use."62

Rubella (German Measles)

Rubella is a vaccine preventable disease that is also called German measles, but it is caused by a
different virus than measles.63 It is usually mild with fever and a rash. About half of the people
who get rubella do not have symptoms. If you do get them, symptoms may include

     A rash that starts on the face and spreads to the body
     Mild fever
     Aching joints, especially in young women
     Swollen glands

                                   Figure 10.X - This is the rash of rubella on a child's back.64

Rubella spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes. People without symptoms can still
spread it. There is no treatment, but the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine can prevent
it.65

Shigella

Shigellosis is a very contagious diarrheal disease caused by bacteria called Shigella. Shigella
causes about 500,000 cases of diarrhea in the United States annually.
Symptoms of the Shigella infection typically start one to two days after exposure and include:

     Diarrhea (sometimes bloody)
     Fever
     Abdominal pain
     A painful sensation of needing to pass stools even when bowels are empty

Shigella spreads when people put something in their mouths or swallow something that has
come into contact with stool of a person infected with Shigella.
Exclusion is required for all diapered children whose stool is not contained in the diaper and
toilet-trained children if the diarrhea is causing soiled clothing. Re-admission after diarrhea can
occur when diapered children have their stool contained by the diaper (even if the stools
remain loose) and when toilet-trained children are continent.66

Tuberculosis

Tuberculosis (TB) is a contagious disease, caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis.
The bacteria usually attack the lungs, but can attack any organ in the body. Recommended
treatment depends on whether a person has:

     Latent TB infection-has no symptoms and can't spread the TB bacteria to others; has
         potential to develop active TB disease if not treated

     Active TB disease-has symptoms such as a fever, cough, or weight loss; these persons
         may be able to spread the germ to others. Needs treatment to cure the disease.

TB is spread in the air when a person with active TB disease of the lung or throat coughs,
sneezes, or speaks. The germs can be inhaled by someone else and they can become
infected. TB is often spread between people who spend time together every day. TB in children
usually comes from being around adults with active TB disease.
Children and staff with active TB disease should be excluded from the Head Start or child care
center until treatment is started, and the doctor determines the child or staff member is no
longer infectious. All children and staff should be tested for TB infection if there has been an
exposure to a person with active TB disease within the center or at home.67
